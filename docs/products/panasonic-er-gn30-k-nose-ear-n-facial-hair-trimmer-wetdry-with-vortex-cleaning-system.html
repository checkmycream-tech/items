            <li>Best one, clips close and clean no pulled hairs and cleans out easy.</li>
            <li>This is an inexpensive yet effective solution for trimming nose and ear hair.    </li>

            <li>Seemed like a good product but the top popped off, the blade fell out and that was the end of it.  </li>
            <li>Then I found all the good reviews for this baby and decided to try once more.</li>
            <li>oh my, it tickles!!&lt;br /&gt;Its reliable and effective.</li>

            <li>You: I would think it would be good for more than 4 monjths?</li>

            <li>Now, every thing is nice and trim.  </li>
            <li>Bought this so I could stop trying to pluck nose/ear hairs with tweezers because let&#x27;s be honest, that hurts.</li>
            <li>the rinse/clean feature is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Cleaning feature is nice, but as others have written, I hope it doesn&#x27;t lead to the trimmer breaking.</li>
            <li>Nice design.  </li>
            <li>I knew when I bought it, this would be nice with an eyebrow trimmer, etc.  </li>
            <li>I guess it&#x27;s nice if I wanted to.</li>
            <li>Fits hand nicely and does the job.  </li>
            <li>Dig for the noise, and when you can&#x27;t  find any more noise doing a good 360-degree sweep of the perimeter, you are getting the job done, but</li>
            <li>This is a nice compact device and it works well.</li>
            <li>Neither of us has managed to cut ourselves with it, and we now both have nice hairless</li>

            <li>Cuts nice</li>
            <li>Nice.  </li>
            <li>Bought it for my dad and he really liked it.</li>
            <li>Nothing like familiarity to make a product liked.  </li>

            <li>Considering the quality, the price is really nice.</li>
            <li>I will be using this handy tool a lot</li>
            <li>It was nice when it worked, but after 3 months it doesn&#x27;t do anything anymore.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice to buy something inexpensive that does what it says it will do and lasts.</li>
            <li>Thank you kindly.</li>
            <li>I really liked the design of this hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Yes, it cuts effectively</li>

            <li>I used it one (1) time and now it doesn&#x27;t work and because it has been more than 30 days</li>
            <li>This does a much better job without the irritation.  </li>
            <li>Save your money and buy something with a better design.</li>
            <li>Best of all it runs off of a standard battery</li>
            <li>and I love that I don&#x27;t have to plug this in and charge it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It is definitely more power than the attachment on the multi-function grooming tool.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and looks good too.</li>
            <li>works much better for me than the &amp;#34;toothbrush&amp;#34; style trimmers.</li>
            <li>the blades would not be able to cut and end up pulling.  </li>
            <li>Most definitely one of my best purchases here on Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li>you can find much better ...</li>
            <li>able to get those sprouts</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li>Only wish it had a rechargable battery, otherwise works just great!</li>
            <li>Pain free hair removal!</li>
            <li>I am very happy with my purchase especially at the price.  </li>
            <li>and Im used it for more than one year.</li>
            <li>This works well, better than the one</li>
            <li>I used couple of trimmer before but this one feels much better in use.</li>
            <li>Best one I have ever used actually.</li>
            <li>but I think I will invest in more rechargeable batteries from energizer or Duracell, etc...</li>
            <li>Perhaps of its shape and slender form it can get into those more recessed areas.      </li>
            <li>Outstanding value, too.</li>
            <li>Much better than the cheaper versions by Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Works good, easy to clean</li>
            <li>None of which produced more than a trickle of water out the exit port</li>
            <li>tried multipurpose machines, but this does a better job.</li>
            <li>The girlfriend is pleased.</li>
            <li>Gets every angle perfectly and is entirely pain free!</li>
            <li>Does a much more thorough job than scissors.</li>
            <li>Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li>And most of the time the trimmers you see, no matter where, are JUNK.</li>
            <li>I would chose it over others based on its better design qualities.</li>
            <li>This one is 100% better.</li>
            <li>Does a much better job.</li>
            <li>I always look at the reports from Consumer Report and they rate this trimmer in the top five for its price.</li>
            <li>We don&#x27;t know that for sure</li>
            <li>husband uses this the most</li>
            <li>The Panisonic Vortex is only slightly better than the no-brand one we were using so we&#x27;ll continue the great search!</li>
            <li>It also gets excellent life out of 1 AA battery (which is also simple to change).</li>
            <li>My husband was pleased and so am I, his wife.  </li>
            <li>More durable.</li>
            <li>,that would be great  thanks</li>
            <li>They have never been better treated.  </li>
            <li>I think people forget how many others look closely at your face/nose/ears...</li>
            <li>My favorite part?</li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>Tried several of these for the ole nose but this works the best.</li>
            <li>My favorite feature is its ease of cleaning, all you have to do is twist a knob and run water through it while its turned on and whammy</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>and he loves it.  :-)</li>
            <li>more hair sticking out where you don&#x27;t want</li>
            <li>they seldom reqier more then it works as its saposed to.</li>
            <li>I finally feel like I have found the best nose hair trimmer ever.</li>
            <li>You turn the top and put it under the faucet.</li>
            <li>What more could you want?</li>
            <li>but sure misses most for me</li>
            <li>Love this item.</li>
            <li>Although it is for light-duty, the trimmer is perfect for my personal grooming needs.</li>
            <li>To test it I ran it straight through the corner of my eyebrow (lol).</li>
            <li>How is that okay?</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give a satisfying cut feel and noise when you run it through your nose.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t cut that much more hair.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing more to it.</li>
            <li>Cant ask more from a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>(I suspect that many of the 1-star reviewers ranting about how their trimmer \\&quot;just stopped working\\&quot; might not be cleaning it after every use, as suggested by the manual, or not cleaning it thoroughly.</li>
            <li>I got the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear because the reviews said it was best for those gross ear and nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Makes a satisfying series of zaps as you move into a hairy area</li>
            <li>Do they need to be emptied after many uses or</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>This one seems much more sturdy.</li>
            <li>Tried more nose trimmers than I care to admit.</li>
            <li>I am greatly pleased.</li>
            <li>my boyfriends nostrils are Hair Free!</li>
            <li>With that being said, the Panasonic ER-GN30-k is the latest addition to my must have kit.</li>
            <li>Fully satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light weight...which in a way is good for travel but feels too light in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a perfect option when you are trying to help you out with the facial hair and even with the nose one</li>
            <li>This had the best review on the Japanese website kakaku.com.  </li>
            <li>Nothing more to say - it is a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>and I are pleased.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works fairly well, always have a fresh battery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, I feel the &#x27;reciprocating&#x27; trimmers do a better job with fewer missed hairs &amp;</li>
            <li>Who can ask for more .</li>
            <li>Just take apart the top and run it under the tap.</li>
            <li>it needs more power</li>
            <li>Would appreciate more power/motor speed, but it works as advertized.  </li>
            <li>Not yet sure about battery life...appears sufficient for 1x week use.</li>
            <li>Sure you can buy a cheaper one, but why not get one that is going to stick with you for a while.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying a Philips model now to see if it&#x27;s more</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband, who says it works way better than the one he had before.</li>
            <li>Light, not noisy, effective.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Fresh battery made it work even better</li>
            <li>I am blessed with hair and nothing is more unattractive than having rappel lines hanging from your nostril.</li>
            <li>Cut every piece of hair :)</li>
            <li>My husband who is a lot more mechanical savvy than I am couldn&#x27;t figure it out either.  </li>
            <li>I should be using it more often.</li>
            <li>Works more efficiently than cheaper models.</li>
            <li>The product is good and useful.</li>
            <li>It takes a AA battery, and although others mention that using a rechargeable battery will produce undesirable results, I had no problems at all using an Eneloop, although I&#x27;ll often rotate many of my rechargeable batteries, so maybe that&#x27;s the trick.</li>
            <li>It&#x60;s safe to use (I admit...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cut from the top, but rather the sides of the blade.</li>
            <li>and this works better than all of them put together.  </li>
            <li>It is safe.</li>
            <li>thanks for good and nice product</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>I had another trimmer that was ok, but had just didn&#x27;t seem to have the power this one has.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the way this works.</li>
            <li>What more could you want from a product</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Works well but to be honest seems kinda cheap</li>
            <li>Best personal trimmer I found.</li>
            <li>I was encouraged by the good reviews that this trimmer received and bought it, and I have been generally happy with it although it takes much more time to trim than a similar Remington model that I used to have.</li>
            <li>: I think there are some trimmers that trim more effectively and comfortably</li>
            <li>They love these trimmers.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I would buy it again for sure.  </li>
            <li>Top quality .</li>
            <li>That is for sure.</li>
            <li>Buy this thing and you will love it.</li>
            <li>this is made in china,it&#x27;s ok for me to using every day,thx</li>
            <li>Made like a disposable, the battery&#x27;s of better quality....</li>
            <li>I like it more than I would have</li>
            <li>Even more breath.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cute, I can not deny it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>but i wish the strength of the trimmer was better</li>
            <li>This works ok.</li>
            <li>works well and the initial battery life has been excellent.</li>
            <li>Moving on to something better...</li>
            <li>As smooth as my wifes legs when she remembers to shave!</li>
            <li>Ok on any superficial hair you can pick up with the tip of this item.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just barely ok.</li>
            <li>Love</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t work any more</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>Also for 10 dollars I would not expect anything more.</li>
            <li>One of the products where I pay for what I need and nothing more.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>What more can I say.  </li>
            <li>I love the curvy design.</li>
            <li>I love it-does the job removal of all the hair on your body</li>
            <li>take more than time than I anticipated to get all those pesky hairs (2 minutes), and I cannot speak to the battery longevity  - yet.  </li>
            <li>It also did an ok job on mustache, eyebrows (</li>
            <li>But you would think it would be a bit more rugged.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any more nose hairs.</li>
            <li>It was okay.  </li>
            <li>Works ok, its as advertised.</li>
            <li>changed the batteries, making sure the pieces were on correctly, and nothing.</li>
            <li>and this product makes my life so much better.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Then, I saw many review about it</li>
            <li>it was okay.  </li>
            <li>The blades cut better with no pulling</li>
            <li>It worked okay.  </li>
            <li>Unit feels to be of better quality than most competitors I have handled.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work any more.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the way the trimmer operates...</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, whether it would hurt or if I would be sneezing all day.</li>
            <li>This helps avoid any skin tucks, making it completely safe to use.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li>I thought the Norelco would be better, so I made the mistake of tossing the Panasonic unit.  </li>
            <li>So many things are powered by rechargeable lithium batteries now.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>construction , unlike many which are not&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer works better than others that I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s inexpensive too.  </li>
            <li>so I couldn&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li>He also says he can breathe better once I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>Be sure to read the manual before using it.</li>
            <li>And its cheap!</li>
            <li>Solid construction and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Much better than the one I bought from Marshalls.</li>
            <li>For years I have used a manual twist type nose hair clipper that worked well albeit pulled the hair from time which is not an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>The battery life seems to be good and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Guys, the world is better with one of these things.</li>
            <li>I believe that it is better to make it rechargeable with any battery of more quality.</li>
            <li>It takes 1AA battery and lasts through many uses.</li>
            <li>so I love it too.</li>
            <li>This thing works better than most.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.  </li>
            <li>Make sure you turn the knob to the appropriate setting when using in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Written up as sounding a lot more functional than it is.  </li>
            <li>improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the purchase and would not hesitate to recommend.</li>
            <li>Had I used it more, it would have died within the 30 day return period.</li>
            <li>works great and very inexpensive</li>
            <li>and i just imagined that it would do alot better.</li>
            <li>I wish there was a better alternative.</li>
            <li>Only used it one time but it works perfectly</li>
            <li>I love this thing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li>Is more like a fatter parker pen.</li>
            <li>Another top performer from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>but I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this thing-</li>
            <li>There has to be something better.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it does great job and is gentle.</li>
            <li>the top for drying.  </li>
            <li>I love the way this product trims my nose hair without any irritation.</li>
            <li>This one trims so much better.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>No nose hairs are safe from this trimmer</li>
            <li>did I know that this was going to be his favorite gift.</li>
            <li>Best trimmer for nose/ear that I have tried, and I have tried four different ones.</li>
            <li>I love the water setting.</li>
            <li>It really does work great</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying using this.</li>
            <li>I just love this Panasonic trimmer.</li>
            <li>Ok nose clipper.</li>
            <li>the trimmer barrel is so fat you wouldn&#x27;t be able to see anything anyway.</li>
            <li>This trimmed has worked well for me for many months.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE this hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Will buy something else more reliable.  </li>
            <li>All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I love this Panasonic item.</li>
            <li>It would be even better if the battery is included.</li>
            <li>I love the way it trims, but after a couple of uses, it started falling apart, showing all the symptoms customers mention in the 1-star rating section.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s worth the money and a good buy.  </li>
            <li>love it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li>Much better to use, with better results than the Wahl model I had before.</li>
            <li>just love it.</li>
            <li>The whole product is great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>okay,</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I use it - he uses it a lot more though.  :)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve torn-up the inside of my nostrils way more times than I care to recall.  </li>
            <li>Way better than anything I have had before.</li>
            <li>not &#x27;plastic&#x27; light helps a lot!</li>
            <li>sure what I&#x27;m expecting, but this doesn&#x27;t thrill.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If your looking for a excellent nose trimmer than definitely get this!</li>
            <li>I cannot say more, because I don&#x27;t have ear hairs.</li>
            <li>no matter how many batteries i try in it.</li>
            <li>I finally bit the bullet and this thing is great!</li>
            <li>Safe product.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it....</li>
            <li>I bought 2 more for my family.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well built, easy to clean, and is a good value.  </li>
            <li>I see I have to write 15 more words.  </li>
            <li>after reading reviews and seeing this as a top seller for an affordable price, I went for it.</li>
            <li>Those looking for what this does better get it while they can.i</li>
            <li>Works for more than nose hair</li>
            <li>For the price I feel I couldn&#x27;t have done any better.  </li>
            <li>Thank God, this was reasonably priced and works great.</li>
            <li>There are better products out there.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;round tip could be tapered to be more affective</li>
            <li>love the results.</li>
            <li>So glad I got this.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Wahl I had before.</li>
            <li>I figured it is better to trash the item rather than dealing with this and buy another trimmer (not panasonic ).</li>
            <li>just OK.  </li>
            <li>Was expecting more.</li>
            <li>Go for better quality.</li>

            <li>Well satisfied.</li>
            <li>Does an okay job on ear and nasal hair.</li>
            <li>Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li>Ok item.</li>
            <li>Its ok for nose hair but not for your face save your money and get something eles</li>
            <li>/&gt;Would purchase again, what better compliment is there than that?</li>
            <li>Cuts much better than most nose hair trimmers you find along discount stores and</li>
            <li>drug stores(which cost more).</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>I have used it several times and it works great!</li>
            <li>Have used several models of hair removal tools and this ranks up there with the best..</li>
            <li>Cheap and effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for some six months or more.  </li>
            <li>I also love the option to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li>I do rinse it under water to make sure nothing gets clogged.  </li>
            <li>This one works a lot better.</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to buy something else with better reliability.</li>
            <li>Does a great job...  Light weight, easy to clean, I would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>so I thought it was defective but after using it this is just a better build.</li>
            <li>cause it was once the top seller.</li>
            <li>When I read reviews of this product before purchasing, there was one written by a witty lady.  </li>
            <li>he love&#x27;s it...</li>
            <li>feel more confident and make everything look right!&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;i love</li>
            <li>it love it</li>
            <li>This trimmer is just ok.</li>
            <li>Would get more stars but it eats batteries.  </li>
            <li>Love the close shave that it brings to my nose and ear hairs because of the dual blade system https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tmT8qlWThQo</li>
            <li>He says that he likes it OK but still&lt;</li>
            <li>This one doesn&#x27;t do that at all, it cuts the hair nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>I honestly didn&#x27;t think this trimmer would work so well or be comfortable.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works :)</li>
            <li>Really does a great job and cuts the nose hairs without any pulling.</li>
            <li>Love that you can run it under the water.</li>
            <li>This one does an OK job and doesn&#x27;t pinch or grab.</li>
            <li>How about a 1/4 HP motor? :)</li>
            <li>You sneeze more often</li>
            <li>Like many guys who have been lots of years breathing in and out--I&#x27;m &amp;#34;older&amp;#34;--hair is going away where I want it to stay and growing in places that I don&#x27;t want it to be.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li>After finding my last nose hair trimmer destroyed when somebody knocked it out of the cabinet I came on Amazon and found one that is just perfect for getting them hairs that bug me.</li>
            <li>As I age my hair seems to grow in my nose more than my head.</li>
            <li>It did work okay, once.  </li>
            <li>I have experienced no hair pull; maybe those who have are moving tool too fast.  </li>
            <li>My favorite.</li>
            <li>I use it just for my nose and that what it seems most designed for.</li>
            <li>made my research and decided to give this one a try, since it had so many</li>
            <li>This product works ok.  </li>
            <li>I thought that it would work better though.  </li>
            <li>We love this.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s way better than anything else we&#x27;ve used on his nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Love this trimmer and all of its features.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;You deserve better and this will help you look better.</li>
            <li>Basically, glad I got it.  </li>
            <li>See, Panasonic says to replace the head on their nose-and-ear trimmers (i.e., the top part which houses the blade and can screw off) every 3 years.  </li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>this trimmer MISSES more than it trims.</li>
            <li>I have tried many many nose trimmers over the years but nothing comes close to this one.</li>
            <li>but ok to use nose hair remover..</li>
            <li>A scissors is still doing a better jobs.</li>
            <li>This unit is head and shoulders better than the cheep ones that come in kits.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic works much better and the cost was affordable.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is OK - and not anything more.  </li>
            <li>It trims more closely than the ones I purchased years ago and is painless.</li>
            <li>This is an elegant way to trim nasal and ear hair.  </li>
            <li>Most have pulled the hair, causing pain.  </li>
            <li>so I had to jiggle it many times to get it to work.</li>
            <li>Most nose trimmers are crap(walmart/costco)</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and everything was working great till a month ago, it decided not to switch on.</li>
            <li>When will someone make one that works like it should.&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly pay twice what I did for this for one that works better.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>slightly better that a manual powered one.</li>
            <li>The price for the quality makes this a worthwhile buy.</li>
            <li>The wirecutter rated this their top pick for a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Light and nice shape</li>
            <li>The clipper guards make it safe</li>
            <li>This one of the better nose/ear hair trimmers that I have used.  </li>
            <li>I ignored those reviews because it was a top selling item and had tons of 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li>I ordered one for my dad : )</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m glad I have them</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer on a whim, and I love it.</li>
            <li>Ranked as the top...</li>
            <li>it is okay...</li>
            <li>Mostly, I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cut my nose.  </li>
            <li>Of course, more discrete users wouldn&#x27;t have it on their bathroom counters at all.  </li>
            <li>An outstanding product.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it since more than two months now.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much more convenient to use it instead of scissors or having to wait for waxing.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great way for women on the go to stay well groomed without spending too much time.</li>
            <li>Also love that it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
            <li>It works ok, with no pain.  </li>
            <li>- I love it</li>
            <li>This one works about 35% more efficiently and am happier with this one.</li>
            <li>sure .</li>
            <li>I seem to have more hair in my ears and nose than on my head anymore.  </li>
            <li>I love this thing.  </li>
            <li>It does the job needed and more.  </li>
            <li>It has not broken, this works great.</li>
            <li>All I know is that he&#x27;s now hairless in places he should be. :-)  </li>
            <li>Everything was ok.</li>
            <li>They work better than anything I have found.</li>
            <li>Works as expected, does a great job and cleans out great.</li>
            <li>Love it A++++++++++</li>
            <li>thanks deliver time was great too.</li>
            <li>This is the best one of these I&#x27;ve ever used and only $13!  </li>
            <li>Really top quality, and runs on 2 AA batteries, which you can take out for traveling.</li>
            <li>I now am glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li>I use it for mostly for nose.</li>
            <li>and we are quite pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>It is better than some I have tried</li>
            <li>Great nose trimmer for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li>but it could use more power.  </li>
            <li>This unit is quiet, sleek, well designed and superbly performing.</li>
            <li>ALL THE HAIR ON MY NOSE IS GONE :))))))))))</li>
            <li>It is much better than the one I had before.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Ended up returning it for a better one.</li>
            <li>Worked OK for about a month.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and functional, what more can I say.</li>
            <li>Had another Braun nose mower that worked better.  </li>
            <li>This was in working order and more than satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Works ok.</li>
            <li>This works well, better than the mangroomer one I had before.</li>
            <li>How about you seller&#x27;s out there make sure the damn product works BEFORE you ship it?</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many of these damn things.</li>
            <li>love it.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>A satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>Perfect for daily use!  </li>
            <li>Quite pleased with item.</li>
            <li>Much better than the cheapo ones at the box stores.</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer at a cheap price.</li>
            <li>okay.  </li>
            <li>Although you have to go over some areas more than once, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Looks OK to me</li>
            <li>i bout the Panasonic one more time.</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Ok for the eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>, glad that I got it.</li>
            <li>This one feels better in the hand and works better.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say :)</li>
            <li>Much better them before Panasonic models,&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li>Glad we purchased the Panasonic ER-GN30-K hair remover.</li>
            <li>I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Much better then</li>
            <li>he biggest feature is the fact that it is waterproof, and able to be fully submerged in water.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than scissors.  </li>
            <li>I bought this after reading many glowing reviews online.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s WAY better than plucking nose hairs with your girlfriend&#x27;s tweezers.</li>
            <li>It is outstanding...</li>
            <li>and I was always satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>After reading all the reviews it seemed like this one was better then the one by wahl..</li>
            <li>Thanks to a great seller.</li>
            <li>Works better than most of these trimmers</li>
            <li>It worked, but this Panasonic rotary trimmer works better and is easier and quicker to use.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Battery life seems good and it is easy to clean since it has a waterproof mode</li>
            <li>Others I&#x27;ve tried leave you with a hanger or two that just stick out more because now they&#x27;re being showcased.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and great item.</li>
            <li>Thank you &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>and I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>I cannot be more satisfied with this.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>My dogs like it more than tweezers</li>
            <li>Just ordered a Wahl to see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad they improved on the product</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase one.</li>
            <li>Checked through many batteries and it wouldn&#x27;t work, so it wasn&#x27;t the power</li>
            <li>UI would say it&#x27;s OK but probably not recommend it.</li>
            <li>Husband and I both love it.</li>
            <li>Learn how to make the trimmer better in all areas.</li>
            <li>Now I have a better sense of smell?</li>
            <li>Like anything else that cuts things, make sure to not get too over-zealous with it.</li>
            <li>They both worked flawlessly and I wouldn&#x27;t even bother looking for anything different.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s just okay  </li>
            <li>This one is angled and allows a better grip to removing the ear hair.</li>
            <li>A wonderful product, and I am using on a daily basis and there is no any problem in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried this trimmer.</li>
            <li>That would have been a better business practice.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m thrilled with this trimmer, but it works, and it was cheap.  </li>
            <li>My husband love this nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Meh, its okay.</li>
            <li>So, yeah, its okay, it does the job.</li>
            <li>You know, there are just so many bthings</li>
            <li>we have tried many brands and this one tops them all</li>
            <li>This is ok and works</li>
            <li>I have used many nose-hair trimmers over the years, however find that their quality all rapidly deteriorate after weekly usage.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found the Panasonic brand to be the best trimmers so far...and this one has a much more solid design!</li>
            <li>It also tickles ALOT more than the others I&#x27;ve used - I end up with watery eyes and my nose feels tingly for about 10 minutes after.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend just love it.</li>
            <li>I also gave one to a friend who thinks it is fantastic!</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s performance</li>
            <li>Love this product.  </li>
            <li>So much better than those crappy trimmers you find at the grocery store.</li>
            <li>what more can i say...</li>
            <li>It works okay on eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>What more can I say.</li>
            <li>This really works great.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done, but could maybe have been more efficient.</li>
            <li>Why want to spend more money.  </li>
            <li>It does a through job of trimming  most of the hairs in the nostrils with a touch up here and there.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Excellent Facial Shaver</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Feels perfectly safe, won&#x27;t even pop a balloon if placed against it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t begin to say how much I love this</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have only used it for nose hair, but it does that job perfectly.  </li>
            <li>Works OK if you like some of the hair in your nose pulled out instead of cut.</li>
            <li>But the con is tip could be narrower for better nose access</li>
            <li>Does an ok job.</li>
            <li>Just wish that it had more flexibility  in trimming even hairs on the face.  </li>
            <li>I used it for ear nose mustache sideburn hair, no pull no pain as advertised, the waterproof cleaning makes it a better buy even.</li>
            <li>have had many others but none that works as well as this one.</li>
            <li>And the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof just makes it even better.</li>
            <li>After replacing 3 of them I realized the motor of the trimmer is not getting power any more.</li>
            <li>but it does an ok job.</li>
            <li>For this price what more can I ask for?</li>
            <li>Panasonic has always been one of my favorite brands and, as always, went beyond meeting my expectations with this product.</li>
            <li>When he sent out his list, I declared dibs on the nose hair trimmers and boy am I glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Make sure to read the instructoins before trying it out.</li>
            <li>Love the turbo cleaning function.  </li>
            <li>one of the better nose trimmers i&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li>, so good and satisfying, totally worth the $12.</li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>Bought one for my brother and one for my nephew both love it and thank me for finding it - had difficulty finding it in stores.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the way it took my hairs out.  </li>
            <li>Will be purchasing more for my family.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>thus came with the cruzer and my son and daughter-in-law are so glad it did he was using it as soon as he opened it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great deal, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do very well.</li>
            <li>It works, and if it lasts for years, even better.</li>
            <li>Given it&#x27;s low price, this handy trimmer is really a great valuable tool to keep around handy .</li>
            <li>One of the better ones I have used.  </li>
            <li>Soon as I age I am sure I will need it for my ears though.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>A feature that I enjoyed was that with water it removes all of the hairs inside machine.</li>
            <li>This is a good product and worth the money.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li>It was a much more efficient trimmer than my Sharper Image model that I used, but that lasted for 8 years.</li>
            <li>BEST ON THE MARKET AND LOW PRICE.</li>
            <li>but it sure goes through a lot of batteries.</li>
            <li>Much better than the sharper image nose trimmer I had that cost a bundle.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does an excellent job on any facial hair.</li>
            <li>Since receiving this product I have been able to eliminate hair from every aural cavity.</li>
            <li>As men age, they lose their hair on top and gain it in their ears and nose.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love how it cuts all my nose hair and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the item not being water resistant</li>
            <li>Fantastic!</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>but I mostly got it for the nose</li>
            <li>I wish more experience with these products</li>
            <li>so I could have bought a better trimmer.</li>
            <li>Which costs MORE than the trimmer itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be prepared to buy another in 6 months. :-)</li>
            <li>and I get more functionality out of the multi groomer.</li>
            <li>Glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li>I am a satisfied customer</li>
            <li>love this thing.</li>
            <li>about once a week or once every 2 weeks, i take it straight to my nostrils, and it does a great job clearing my nasal pathways</li>
            <li>Another gift I researched and compared it to the Wahl, but I think my husband is totally satisfied with it.</li>
            <li>but at 43, I seem to have more hair growing out of my nose and ears than my head.</li>
            <li>and it was ok.  </li>
            <li>I cant imagine there being a better one except maybe a rechargable version.</li>
            <li>What more can you say?</li>
            <li>Considering the price this is a winner for sure.</li>
            <li>This one being the most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It seems Panasonic gets better at these trimmers every year.  </li>
            <li>Had several in my lifetime and this one is the best ever.</li>
            <li>it is a lovely product.</li>
            <li>A great value and worked really well, for two months.</li>
            <li>this trimmer is okay for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li>The price was outstanding and it arrived promptly.  </li>
            <li>Many others have stated the grinding noise this will eventually make.  </li>
            <li>This is my second one, and this is the best.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Safe, never been cut, Works</li>
            <li>The pictures and video make it seem more than it is.</li>
            <li>This is magic and should get 10 stars at twice the price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I pulled the trigger on this one.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is a breeze, just remove the top cap and run it under some water while turned on.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li>OK.  </li>
            <li>what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li>What more can I ask for.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of these trimmers and wanted something better.  </li>
            <li>Would buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li>good result of nose hair shaving, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>But besides that, this is a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>I also find trimming the hairs helps me breath better.  </li>
            <li>Better handle and lighter.</li>
            <li>you can rinse it out with water (ok) or just pop the head off and tap it on a counter (better).</li>
            <li>I really love this product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Way better than many out there...</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>It is better to blow your nose before you use it.</li>
            <li>new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When looking for something better I saw this and thought, &amp;#34;could</li>
            <li>It does a great job and really doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the off-brands.</li>
            <li>It did magic to my nose.</li>
            <li>I thought it was ok, until I got this, never buy a man a tool that uses a AAA battery.</li>
            <li>It works better then</li>
            <li>but it still feels like it needs more power to do a better job.</li>
            <li>II brought it for my beard, and I love it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s tons better than the super-duper fancy one I had that sounded like a 747 taking</li>
            <li>This trimmer works longer than others I&#x27;ve tried, and does a much better job.</li>
            <li>I opened the top to see if there was some hair/buildup inside.  </li>
            <li>Love this grooming tool</li>
            <li>I would attribute my difficulty to getting all the hairs to the size of my nostrils compared to most.  </li>
            <li>I would attribute my difficulty to getting all the hairs to the size of my nostrils compared to most.  </li>
            <li>prefer my Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer to the Panasonic now given that I think it&#x27;s more durable and just works.  </li>
            <li>Plus the Groom Mate is tiny and perfect for travel!</li>
            <li>I just got this a couple of days ago, and have tried/used it twice, and I must say I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li>ok</li>
            <li>I have added twenty seconds to my morning routine a couple of times a week and am pleased I did.</li>
            <li>Makes me feel better to know</li>
            <li>Had this baby for almost 2 years, I love it.</li>
            <li>I would like to have a more efficient one.</li>
            <li>Not bad !!!</li>
            <li>This one has the power and better quality feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone in need of a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Glad I choose it.</li>
            <li>As you age, you use your brain more which causes the hair on your head to be pushed out of your ears and nose.  </li>
            <li>This one is way better than the Braun unit I threw out.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Remington model.  </li>
            <li>It works okay.</li>
            <li>I found a better one at Target, but my husband wanted this one..</li>
            <li>This trimmer is about a thousand times better than the one I was using.</li>
            <li>Yup, cuts my nose hair with not too many passes.</li>
            <li>sure you have a AA battery</li>
            <li>It works ok, but it does tend to rip out hair rather than cut it, which hurts.  </li>
            <li>Its just ok.</li>
            <li>It is OK.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, lightweight, good quality</li>
            <li>I have tried many nose hair trimmers before, and pushed this one off since it was so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Then I cleaned it, which means I took the top off.</li>
            <li>I have been through several of these types of tremors, and I have to say unequivocally that these are the best tremors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>You will be ok..</li>
            <li>HE IS SATISFIED IT.</li>
            <li>In some youtube videos, you can see people poking around trying to get a better trim, but you can cut yourself.</li>
            <li>It is ok as a nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>I replaced it&#x27;s predecessor which lasted for many years.  </li>
            <li>This one I haven&#x27;t had for more than a week,</li>
            <li>Much better results with this trimmer than any others I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li>its do the job love it</li>
            <li>I spend more time cleaning the device than I using it.</li>
            <li>It works ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll try to spend a bit more and buy something more substantial.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my family, love it,gets nose hair, ear hair and even eybrow hair.</li>
            <li>Compared to the zero turn mower this is the next best invention on earth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much better than any</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for its nose hair feature.</li>
            <li>I have tried numerous nose trimmers over the years and this was is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li>I cleaned it, and repeatedly checked to make sure it wasn&#x27;t on the rinse setting while</li>
            <li>well, Norelco is a much better choice.</li>
            <li>but it does job well, nice and light and cleaning</li>
            <li>It still takes a lot of work to get the errant hairs trimmed, but this design is better than many of the systems out there.</li>
            <li>Yeah sure, nose hair.  </li>
            <li>I brought this to replace one that I have been using for many many years.</li>
            <li>Totally pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li>This one is better because it can be cleaned.  </li>
            <li>100% satisfied.</li>
            <li>Works OK but the power is wimpy.</li>
            <li>I seem to be growing hair on my ears better than my head anymore</li>
            <li>Once it gets going, it seems to operate okay, but it involves a lot of jiggling and twisting to get it to turned on.  </li>
            <li>As this trimmer has a safe shielded rotary blade, I figured he wouldn&#x27;t be able to accidentally hurt himself.  </li>
            <li>He likes the circle style better than the straight comb style and this one works great.</li>
            <li>I have had product loyalty for many years.</li>
            <li>both use it its great works very well</li>
            <li>This product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li>LOVE the ability to wash/clean.</li>
            <li>All in all, somewhat satisfied.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li>recommended, perhaps there are better, I haven&#x27;t tried looking.</li>
            <li>and it did a great job; the price was quite reasonable too.</li>
            <li>Way Way better that the Remington nose hair clipper it replaced.  </li>
            <li>I suppose having the hairs be there is better than ingrown ones</li>
            <li>also used this on the mustache God granted me too, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with Nair on that one :)</li>
            <li>My husband really loves this trimmer and the size is great for travel.</li>
            <li>Did its job, Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine how a competitor could offer a better solution.  </li>
            <li>I bought many differnet type adn</li>
            <li>The best Nose and Ear Facial Hair Trimmer ever!</li>
            <li>Where have you been all my life : )</li>
            <li>This works and use this to trim hair in my ear and no where else.  :-)</li>
            <li>was bothering me :)</li>
            <li>The top of the device gets clogged up and stops working.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a lot better than going at it with a pair of scissors</li>
            <li>What more can you ask at $10?</li>
            <li>OK looks like it is burnt out and not working.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I intend to supplement this review when I have more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My husband&#x27;s ears never looked better and trims his nose like a champ.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li>Just got the trimmer last night, Works GREAT!!</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I like this a lot more than some others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s awesome at the low price point.</li>
            <li>Love this thing.</li>
            <li>Outstanding.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK but got to work at it to get all the hairs .</li>
            <li>also i am satisfied with this</li>
            <li>This trimmer works better than any I have owned to date.  </li>
            <li>No hair, no cuts, just smooth!  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>, it functions perfectly and only once have I managed to \\&quot;cut too close\\</li>
            <li>Glad I did</li>
            <li>Better than drug store brands.  </li>
            <li>Favorite nose hair trimmer yet.</li>
            <li>Oh my, it is so much better.  </li>
            <li>..now i will look eve more sexier if that was possible..lol</li>
            <li>But, unlike the others, this one seems so well made, I am hopeful it will give better service.  </li>
            <li>Doing too many of these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Removes the hair from inside your nose and growing out of your ears.  </li>
            <li>I had an earlier generation of Panasonic before, and it was excellent.</li>
            <li>Was pleased that this replacement was even better.</li>
            <li>It is also the most pain-free, and no burn, either.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t cost me more than I think maybe $10 or $15</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several trimmers and this is the best one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s miles better than the Conair one I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li>and I can remember looking at my grandfather, more specifically, looking at the hair growing out of his ear and in your youth</li>
            <li>He says he likes it MUCH better than the one he had before.</li>
            <li>and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Nothing chops &#x27;em up better.</li>
            <li>Me paying more than everyone elses&#x27; purchase price to repair a product that never worked?  </li>
            <li>Totally love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I recommend this Panasonic unit over most models.</li>
            <li>My dad love this</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how much better this Panasonic works.</li>
            <li>Love this gadget.</li>
            <li>I love using this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll buy a better one soon....</li>
            <li>GN30 the most.</li>
            <li>Love Amazon.</li>
            <li>The trimmer seems ok.  </li>
            <li>Not as noisy as most.</li>
            <li>(perhaps more is coming?)</li>
            <li>But, for what it is, I cannot imagine a better product.</li>
            <li>I like that its ok to rinse off and runs on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Wish it cut better.</li>
            <li>Very dependable and does a great &#x27;cleanup&#x27; job.</li>
            <li>This works OK.  </li>
            <li>It fits very well in your hand and it weighs almost nothing which is great if you want to bring it on vacation.</li>
            <li>While this is something that most men think is \\&quot;unmanly\\&quot; to do, just do it and you will feel better.  </li>
            <li>So glad that I did.</li>
            <li>I will really be enjoying the use of this product.</li>
            <li>It also feels like I breathe better through my nose.</li>
            <li>the price it is a great quality of product and performs very well</li>
            <li>Nevertheless, I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li>Probably the most \\&quot;useful\\&quot; product I&#x27;ve purchased in a&lt;br /&gt;long time.</li>
            <li>and it works more than 10x.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t been able to use it.</li>
            <li>Hands done one of the best facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfectly safe and harmless.</li>
            <li>This cutter really gets close and works great.</li>
            <li>It is better than the &amp;#34;Philips Norelco NT9130/40 NoseTrimmer 5100&amp;#34; if you plan to use it in your nose.  </li>
            <li>but I think it is one of the better trimmers sold.</li>
            <li>Many others were god for a month</li>
            <li>this model is much better.  </li>
            <li>Great price thanks.  </li>
            <li>Ok</li>
            <li>/&gt;Buy something better.  </li>
            <li>It works great and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>This is the best personal groomer I have had owned.</li>
            <li>It does the job, but it is not the most durable pice of machinery.</li>
            <li>Those all seemed to work better and get the hairs cut closer.</li>
            <li>It seems the panasonic misses more hairs, I have to go over the area longer and doesnt get them cut as close meaning</li>
            <li>I have to use it more often.</li>
            <li>Better than the garbage found at the pharmacy stores.</li>
            <li>Recommended :)</li>
            <li>Worked okay until it fell apart.</li>
            <li>and it did a much better in getting the job done.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Straight out of the box all I had to do was put in a battery and it began working - way better than my Remington model which I got from walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is better than getting my nose waxed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Glad I chose this one over others I was looking at.</li>
            <li>because I am not going to say &amp;#34;I Love it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>this is an okay trimmer.</li>
            <li>I like this model more then the ones with the exposed blades.</li>
            <li>Even my eye brows look better.</li>
            <li>It worked well but should be able to sustain a 12 inch drop.</li>
            <li>Just one more &#x27;benefit&#x27; of the aging process - hair in places</li>
            <li>Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Battery lasts a while, glad I purchased.</li>
            <li>but we have found a much better product since</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t go 5 stars, but 4+ for sure.  </li>
            <li>Buy a better powered version.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>not any better than any others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have tried several of these type trimmers and this has been the best one.  </li>
            <li>I have more than a years use on this one...</li>
            <li>I have to change the battery after a couple light uses (eyebrows, nose)  ... works great otherwise and easy to clean</li>
            <li>If you want better performance, make sure the batteries are replaced when needed and after cleaning the blades, pour a drop of mineral oil, it will run like a Porsche.</li>
            <li>The construction quality is excellent and I expect it to last many years.  </li>
            <li>My experience has been that most tend to pull hairs as they cut.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this since it&#x27;s really inexpensive, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>A nose trimmer won&#x27;t do that, but this one more than meets my expectations.</li>
            <li>And best part she said - it&#x27;s very quiet when running.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer and it&#x27;s made my nose feel so much better.</li>
            <li>but I feel like I can breathe better.</li>
            <li>This thing does the trick that is for sure.</li>
            <li>but I am sure it would do those just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job very well and at a great price.  </li>
            <li>what more can I say.  </li>
            <li>love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>Seems like an okay product for the price.</li>
            <li>but once you remove the top and try to replace the blade, it becomes noisy and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Best ever and very quiet.</li>
            <li>and I was pleased.</li>
            <li>so I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>Much much better than my manual one from ZWILLING.</li>
            <li>Better than many</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>more to be said except:&lt;br /&gt;if</li>
            <li>I love This Trimmer, It Does the Job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a nose hair trimmer before and wasn&#x27;t pleased with it, as it seemed like it did more pulling than trimming, so it mostly stayed in the drawer</li>
            <li>OK</li>
            <li>I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>My husband was pleased.</li>
            <li>Appears it is better</li>
            <li>Best personal hair trimmer I ever owned.  </li>
            <li>LOVE it.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>It works better than others in this price range.</li>
            <li>Love, ordered it for my son to use in nose and in between eyes.  </li>
            <li>seemed OK.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe how many people reviewed this thing favorably.</li>
            <li>I thought this one would be even better with the Panasonic name and all the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li>Love this device.</li>
            <li>Husband is satisfied and so am</li>
            <li>It works okay, but did pull some hairs</li>
            <li>It just takes more time to do the job.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much more to say about it.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t even realize the last one wasn&#x27;t very good until I got this one!!</li>
            <li>For the price I paid, I feel really satisfied.</li>
            <li>It helps me look better and feel better about myself.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li>Much better than a Wahl version that we had bought at a store.</li>
            <li>Received the item neatly pack, been using it for more than a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li>am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li>Thing thing is way better than the cheapo one that it replaced.</li>
            <li>All mens need this product and you won&#x27;t regret for sure.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>More rubbish for the trash heap.</li>
            <li>If it ever quits, I&#x27;ll be sure to let you know.</li>
            <li>Whats on the top is that its an amazon item.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, it heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li>This makes a great gift for any man really....</li>
            <li>Once I learned to use it I am pleased.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it will work well.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for nose hair trimming once a week.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>These are MUCH better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s inexpensive, but they seem to cut cleaner and have more speed.</li>
            <li>Works better than the staright brush style trimmers.</li>
            <li>/&gt;No &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; to the hair any more ...</li>
            <li>Glad I got it.</li>
            <li>Smooth operation!</li>
            <li>AS we age hair begins to grow more in the ears and nostrils.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer beacuse</li>
            <li>As the top reviewer here mentioned, quite delectably, aging men needs it to keep the unwanted hair in-check.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better nose hair trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>love the AA batteries instead of a charger.</li>
            <li>I have been using trimmers for many years.  </li>
            <li>There are many like it, but this one is mine.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t able to return it.</li>
            <li>We have gone through so many hair trimmers, but this one seems to be durable.  </li>
            <li>It just works. :)</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I never check luggage, but that may be changing :-)</li>
            <li>My Grand daughter tells me that I no longer have hair growing out of my nose, of course she says none on the top of my head either.</li>
            <li>I have owned several nose hair trimmers over the years and this one is the best nose hair trimmer ever!</li>
            <li>/&gt;^They sell them here as most of you know.</li>
            <li>It was hit and miss with it, mostly miss.  </li>
            <li>I bought it because I have had a Whal mustache trimmer for many years.</li>
            <li>I love that trimmer.</li>
            <li>This thing works much better and does what it says.  </li>
            <li>If you have a hairy nose then buy it, use it, love it.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this trimmer - Works as it was meant to work.</li>
            <li>does a great job getting my nose hears, i really just shove it up my nose and weed whack it around</li>
            <li>Worked great and is very quite</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an OK unit.</li>
            <li>I thought the slant might make it more efficient, with closer shaves to areas, but it does not.</li>
            <li>still going , better than many reviews</li>
            <li>The comfort with it is the best, a day later</li>
            <li>Very happy with item - works as described - glad I finally got around to purchasing it!</li>
            <li>Its ok.</li>
            <li>have tried many and this one beats them all in all categories!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the cleaning system</li>
            <li>Works OK</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had the trimmer for 3 weeks; I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll put it to many more</li>
            <li>I guess OK ; never had/used one before.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>This works well, better than the mangroomer one I had before</li>
            <li>I love that it runs on a AA battery and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged.</li>
            <li>Replace batteries, made sure the contacts were clean---still no go, so had to replace it.</li>
            <li>and I then put the top on after.</li>
            <li>Also packs better in my travel shaving kit.</li>
            <li>I have tried several trimmers, and this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li>Good quality build, but doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as I&#x27;d hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This one is safe and it never pulled the hair.</li>
            <li>It works ok.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li>Have had some of these prior to this one, but it is the best.</li>
            <li>its ok.  </li>
            <li>but if they could just take one week and work with engineers to design a better nose hair trimmer the world would be a better place.</li>
            <li>Awesome addition to my line of personal hygiene gadgets and bathroom showcase.</li>
            <li>it is ok..</li>
            <li>am satisfied..</li>
            <li>but it does get most of it out.</li>
            <li>Most hairs get pulled into the top part.</li>
            <li>Hope it doesn&#x27;t cost more than the unit itself.  </li>
            <li>Works, better than in store ones</li>
            <li>I LOVE that it&#x27;s washable</li>
            <li>But, I totally love this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better trimmers.</li>
            <li>He seems to love it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the same for many aging men, but I lived with it, using scissors as best</li>
            <li>Cheap!</li>
            <li>It is an outstanding performer.</li>
            <li>It might be the angled off top that causes it to fall, often.  </li>
            <li>What more can you ask?</li>
            <li>you just turn the dial at the top which opens a port where water can be discharged after flowing into the tip, or flow water into the port</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t grow hair on my head any more</li>
            <li>but I can sure grow it in my nose &amp; ears.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say much more than that.</li>
            <li>So just keep the plastic guard on top of the trimmer and don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li>He says it is like magic.</li>
            <li>Since purchasing it for him I don&#x27;t have to get trimmers out and help him trim nose and ear hairs - he grooms himself without me reminding him to do so :).</li>
            <li>Found as I turned 50 hair started gorwing faster out of my nose and ears than on the top of my head and</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>I finally found the one that  works great!!!</li>
            <li>Better than advertised.</li>
            <li>I no longer look like 40 going on 60. :-)</li>
            <li>Its Ok</li>
            <li>The reviews are correct for the most part.</li>
            <li>I wonder whether there are more efficient products out there.</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I use it and love it.</li>
            <li>The Vortex is definitely an exception and the best I&#x27;ve seen so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li>great product - trims very close to the skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;Be sure to read the instructions for cleaning.</li>
            <li>I do surely recommend it.</li>
            <li>but I gotta believe that there&#x27;s a more efficient motor out there.  </li>
            <li>this thing gets allot more hair than the Remington.</li>
            <li>Really pleased with this grooming device.</li>

            <li>Neither are perfect but please take my advice and get the vacuum one.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful or effective</li>

            <li>The head design is superior to others, in that it cuts much more consistently at the tip.  </li>

            <li>Just as good as the top-top ones, but for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>In my experience, these type of products tend to deteriorate quickly, but I must say, so far I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super happy I made, but I suppose it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>I recommend using it on a dry nose, since it works best with hairs that are up and not stuck on their side on the nose for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very happy with it, quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li>This works great as it is both fast and easy to maneuver.</li>

            <li>When I first looked at it I laughed.  </li>
            <li>My husband loved it so much, we bought another for my father in-law!</li>
            <li>pretty good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer for nose hair, doesn&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>and it is still working as good as the day I first got it.</li>
            <li>It healthy to cut or shave hair where it make you more handsome or comfortable.</li>

            <li>Works pretty good but can pull the hairs at times.</li>
            <li>Its pretty good for the price, but there was another one that I got</li>
            <li>However, it works exactly as advertised for a fair price.</li>
            <li>but he says it&#x27;s good, and he&#x27;s reallllly picky (no pun intended), so you should believe him ;-)</li>

            <li>BUT does a pretty darn good job.  </li>
            <li>Works pretty good</li>
            <li>well this is a good trimmer for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li>It does its job pretty good.</li>
            <li>I trim the long eyebrow hair and it works perfect.  </li>
            <li>First time trying out a nose trimmer, and surprisingly there wasn&#x27;t any slightest level of discomfort.</li>

            <li>While it did work it did the job pretty good.</li>
            <li>Battery life is pretty good too.</li>
            <li>At first when I saw this I laughed.</li>

            <li>This is a fairly good device that&#x27;s made pretty well.</li>

            <li>Still using the original battery too!</li>
            <li>my friends, def worth the money!!</li>
            <li>He is so happy with his new trimmer.  </li>
            <li>new Panasonic is great though.</li>
            <li>I had another trimmer for years and never thought I would find one I liked more, but this one wins out.</li>
            <li>It works great, cuts cleanly and, even more importantly, is super easy to clean after use.</li>
            <li>Great value, easy to use and decent battery life.</li>
            <li>Works great ,much better than my old one i got at the 99 cent store.</li>
            <li>Easy cleaning - just turn the top portion, run some water through, and you&#x27;re done</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that a strong rechargeable battery will work, but an alkaline with 1.5 volts is better.</li>
            <li>Works nicely and it was super affordable.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a safe and easy item to use for nose and ear hair, quite safe and easy.</li>
            <li>While it does the job, I find it to be overly bulky and the ergonomic design doesn&#x27;t make it any more easy to use than a &#x27;stick&#x27; model.  </li>
            <li>Kudos to Amazon for very quick delivery :) Would buy again.</li>
            <li>Excellent product, would recomend to men and woman, easy to use,fits hand very well, is much better than straight head razor.</li>
            <li>I love the easy wash out with water.</li>
            <li>Good price, great performance, simple to clean.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s more easily openable...</li>
            <li>I am totally pleased with how this trimmer works and have been telling all my friends about it and how easy it works.</li>
            <li>But realizing that the blade is removable and can therefore be easily cleaned, I was pleased with this.  </li>
            <li>Love it, easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li>It works best on dry hair.</li>
            <li>Every time I do it, I am sure some of my nerves are being pulled but with this product, it&#x27;s painless and easy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing but the battery drains out too quickly.</li>
            <li>It is easy on the AA battery it requires and the business end can be rinsed under the faucet or, if you are so inclined, the top can be removed, the hairs can be collected and woven into a cloth for a biblical haircloth shirt,</li>
            <li>It can be used in so many ways, and it is an easy addition to any grooming routine.</li>
            <li>The unit is easily \\&quot;wash/rinse\\&quot; able; set it on the counter for an hour</li>
            <li>This is an effective trimmer that is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I should mention that I think its smallish size makes it ideal for travel, and for the hand size of most women, and smaller guys.</li>
            <li>This cutter is nice and quiet, does a great job.</li>
            <li>best on the market,works better than expected.</li>
            <li>It is light quiet and performs its job flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>Effective, easy to use and clean up is a snap.</li>

            <li>Nice device, easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>it is good - cuts fairly close and doesn&#x27;t pull.&lt;br /&gt;For facial hair</li>
            <li>Nice compact unit that is easy to clean out.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several of these over the years and believe this to be the best available for the price.</li>
            <li>It has a nice ergonomic design and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Does require a good cleaning to run properly, but healthwise that&#x27;s a good idea anyway.</li>

            <li>Mostly for nasal hair .. seems to work fine</li>
            <li>Still haven&#x27;t got the hang of the &#x27;water flushing&#x27; system, but seems to work by just blowing it clean!</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for nose and some fine hairs on the sides of my ears...</li>
            <li>Love it, works fine.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It uses 1 AA battery which is fine and lasts for many sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and a nice size to travel with.</li>
            <li>I first got this trimmer it worked exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>I am VERY happy with this purchase, it works better than the other 3 I have had over the years and wore out.</li>
            <li>This thing is perfect, and will take only seconds to clean up the nose, ears, and eye brows.</li>
            <li>Better than most others I have tried, but I haven&#x27;t found one yet that cuts nose hair cleanly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Also, I love being able to clean it by running it under the tap.</li>
            <li>Very pleased on this and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Very cool.</li>
            <li>Very good, I can finally breathe out of my nose!</li>
            <li>/&gt;IF you are like most people and feel very queasy about sticking a rotating RAZER UP YOUR NOSE, fear not; for this is actually a very comfortable and effective tool.</li>
            <li>but this does make it easier and overall does a very good job.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and shape of the trimmer makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean it and very easy to use as well</li>

            <li>This product is a HUGE time saver and works so much better than using scissors.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s great so far.</li>
            <li>It works great so far</li>
            <li>got this item as a gift, works great so far.</li>

            <li>Congratulations on a fine product -- you could easily charge more for it.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m one happy 53 year old,</li>
            <li>The cheap Harbour Freight one does much better.</li>
            <li>So far, it does a great job of trimming excess hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but so far the trimmer works great.  </li>
            <li>Although not a permanent solution, it is a lot cheaper and safer than a visit to the dermatologist for laser therapy and safer and more comfortable than electrolysis or plucking.</li>
            <li>The model I got was this one, and so far, it has been great...</li>
            <li>Does a great job at getting nose hairs near the opening of the nose.  </li>
            <li>Happy to say I&#x27;ve had no trouble with this newer</li>
            <li>At first I was worried about butchering the insides of my nose, but after doing it for over a week, It&#x27;s very safe.</li>
            <li>I look much more civilized.</li>
            <li>Once in a while, you will get a pulled hair but it is light and compact and it is just better than any others I have tried.  </li>
            <li>Does a great job and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive nostrils.  </li>
            <li>So far it works great.  </li>
            <li>It is more powerful and does a pretty good job on nose and OK on ears.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this trimmer a couple of times so far since my purchase and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Was better priced than in-store models and I received free shipping.</li>
            <li>I love the zapping sound that it makes.  </li>
            <li>This is great to keep you from looking like an old man whose given up on life.</li>
            <li>This Node Hair Trimmer is working great so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The is a great upgrade over my old one.  </li>
            <li>price cheap, work ok for 1 month ,</li>
            <li>Fortunately, Panasonic has found a much better way to get those hairs with no pain.</li>
            <li>is a lot more comfortable for my nostrils.</li>
            <li>far, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li>Another cheap Panasonic product that should be FREE!</li>
            <li>Just tried this and so far works great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone so far as to use this trimmer to even out the lines on my beard and it works great.</li>
            <li>but overall this does an excellent job and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>So far, this trimmer has worked great.</li>
            <li>Great product so far.</li>
            <li>Just be careful, this is an excellent device</li>
            <li>Keeps my nose looking like a teenagers nose, I am a happy old fart...</li>
            <li>uses for a similarly cheap groomer, and it worked infinitely better.</li>
            <li>It is probably the best 18 bucks I have ever spent.  </li>
            <li>Replacement for an old one, this works great.</li>
            <li>It does not cut too close to the skin which works great for me as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>though it&#x27;s an old one, it still works great.</li>
            <li>Works great so far.</li>
            <li>I bought this solely because of the 1100+ reviews to replace my old trimmer which I never have been happy with.</li>
            <li>This product has been working great so far.</li>
            <li>So far this is a great product that does what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li>I think the motor will loosen up over time and spin more freely and seem stronger.</li>
            <li>This product is great for soft nose hairs, and I assume ear hairs</li>
            <li>so I find it more comfortable.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean but MOST importantly, it works!</li>
            <li>Does a great job, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I had an old one and this is a great replacement.</li>
            <li>the best way to cut hair nose, use only a one baterry AA, easy to wash and clean, and cut pefectly...</li>
            <li>But after a bit they became more comfortable.</li>
            <li>I had an old clipper that worked but not that great.</li>
            <li>Great purchase so far.</li>
            <li>This thing has many confirmed kills.</li>
            <li>Works great so far.</li>
            <li>i got a free Remington one that works way better.</li>
            <li>Best money spent.</li>
            <li>This might be the best $15 I have ever spent in my life.  </li>
            <li>So far a great product.</li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t have a good reference point but can&#x27;t really see what else they could offer</li>
            <li>Really works good on trimming my nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, effective, and pain free.</li>
            <li>Does a good job provided you do not apply too much pressure to the nose.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works gently and fairly well.</li>
            <li>It is definitely useful for that kind of thing</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer,works good for my hubby.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well, and is not fancy, which is good.</li>
            <li>dont even really work that good</li>
            <li>Does a good job for the nose and brows but can&#x27;t really get a close shave for shaping beard.</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>not crazy about the cleaning function, as it honestly doesn&#x27;t work too well, and I considered dropping the review to five stars as a result, but for the price I can&#x27;t bring myself to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m feeling good &amp; ready for anything now.</li>
            <li>Just a good item that has proven itself very reliable.</li>
            <li>Good purchase and highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve wondered about how effective these could be and I am at an age where it is useful.</li>
            <li>The ergonomic curve allows you to really attack hairs at a good angle.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really do that good of a job trimming inside the nose, tons of areas get missed.  </li>
            <li>This is washable, doesn&#x27;t tug or pull (good because that&#x27;s what nobody wants) and you&#x27;re done in a flash.</li>
            <li>As good as I could reasonably want a nose hair trimmer to be.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price, good utility.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good thing they are reasonably priced, because they eventually die.</li>
            <li>head is really good and fast</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ticklish, but the blades do a good job of trimming them hairs fast and pain-free.</li>
            <li>In fact, it feels good in the ear. hahaha</li>
            <li>works well, is of good build quality, and so far is the best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;ve tried two electric and three manual prior to this one).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a very good buy for the money - well made and easy to use - and hope this one is as good as the first one he used for so long.</li>
            <li>It is adequately built, works well, and cleans up very easily.</li>
            <li>The price is right because it gets the job done!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good they&#x27;re not very expensive.</li>
            <li>Easy to use &amp; clean!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean!</li>
            <li>easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li>And my husband is NOT the kind of guy who cares about maintaining a healthy glow or the right look, so it&#x27;s pretty darn handy and easy</li>
            <li>Wow.. Easy to use and does a great job just by a nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store and does all it says it will do!</li>
            <li>just cuts it smooth and close , very easy to clean .</li>
            <li>works great and is nicely compact havent had  single problem with it for ear nose and eyebrow even parts of mustache</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and easy to clean - which is a plus!  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, gets the job done for nose trimming!</li>
            <li>Bottom line, I strongly recommend this trimmer for any man who want to safely and quickly trim his more hair.</li>
            <li>The slight curve was excellent as it was easy for gripping.</li>
            <li>its easy to hold and seems to catch the hairs more quickly and easily at more angles than the mangroomer and others.</li>
            <li>I liked their older ones better, but this is ok.</li>
            <li>Excellent little tool that does an pretty good job with nose hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was highly rated and I see why it works great, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The head is perfectly shaped for use in the nose or ears, it&#x27;s pain free, very quiet, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>not the quality i expected, the deal was perfect everything fine by the seller</li>
            <li>I really expected more maybe like using it twice!!!</li>
            <li>super fast shipping very nice product</li>
            <li>Cool!</li>
            <li>Other than that its awesome!</li>
            <li>The cleaning ability and ease of battery change, and other features are excellent, however.</li>
            <li>This baby is sharp and cuts with the greatest of ease.</li>
            <li>and I know that&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>thousands of other Amazon customers, I am very happy with this product.</li>
            <li>I also think the other review was perfect</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what other products are like, so maybe this is the best one on the market.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ordered hundreds of things off of Amazon, yet I&#x27;ve never been more excited for a package to come in the mail.</li>
            <li>My man has very coarse nose hair and swore that no trimmer has ever done any good until I bought this!</li>
            <li>Works the best of any other brands I have bought.  </li>

            <li>perfect shape, perfectly powerful, really nicely made, the rest of the small and cute nose trimmers were trashed immediately.</li>
            <li>My husband liked it very much.  </li>
            <li>That being said, this trimmer is very fast and effective.</li>
            <li>Battery life seems pretty good and cleanup is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li>so right now I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>

            <li>It is easy to handle, easy to clean, trims my nose, ears, eyebrows, very cleanly, painlessly, and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Have a drawer full of hair trimmers and this is the best by far at a very reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ever bought .. very powerful and easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Very pleased I bought one, very inexpensive at about $15-$20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works great and this style works so much better than the flat</li>
            <li>In fact, the first couple of times were amazing.  </li>
            <li>So, ordered this one; easy to use and seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li>This trimmer has worked just fine for a number of years and seems easy on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very durable,easy to operate and is very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li>Amazingly this nose trimmer just worked the first time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Had an issue with the tickling sensation when trying to use it (not an issue with the trimmer, just with dealing with nose hair in general), and my wife had a great tip: blow out through your nose when using it.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty nice feature to have.  </li>
            <li>Probably the best civilized way to remove hair in  the nostrils due to aging.  </li>
            <li>however, I found that this trimmer works just FINE with a Eneloop battery and is just as strong as with an Alkaline battery.  </li>
            <li>Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer is a perfect choice for a good function and low price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Just make sure you have a rechargeable battery as it looses its effectiveness if its not at full power.</li>
            <li>Nice size, works very well!</li>
            <li>The best of the average trimmers on the market.</li>
            <li>It works, not as good as the other brand I used to use, but it does work better than many others that I have tried!.</li>
            <li>It really worked and has made me much more confident :).</li>
            <li>NIce sharp (protected ) blades - does a great job.</li>
            <li>It was kind of a joke at first</li>
            <li>Always nice when its not expensive as well.</li>
            <li>I still need  a fresh AA battery to get the fill effect, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>This thing is pretty nice.</li>
            <li>not bad, better than pulling it out</li>
            <li>The best, hands down, I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>this fixes that problem quickly and easily. :)</li>
            <li>Impressively trims nose and ear hair down to the skin without any pulling whatsoever.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best trimmer for my ever changing hair growth patterns...</li>
            <li>Anyway, with this, as long as you have good batteries in it, it will un-terraform the landscape easily without pain, to get rid of the extraterrestrial plants here and there, just make sure to clean and change the battery on a regular basis, so that it will work at its best.</li>
            <li>Clean up is very easy and quick.</li>
            <li>It just works perfect,  great for trimming my mustache and all the other facial places a razor doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>Seems like a good product, still kinda new, but I like it.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s as good as new.</li>
            <li>Cuts good, but it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>Seems to be as good as new aver</li>
            <li>Mine is still working fine after a couple of months.</li>
            <li>Then I took off the tip and tried it, and it would spin just fine.</li>
            <li>It seems to work fine once it powers up.</li>
            <li>The interior of my nose is hair-free as a result of using this fine device.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>But then again it works fine</li>
            <li>kind of cheap feeling, but consistent with the price.  </li>

            <li>I received it and it looked fine.</li>

            <li>Easy to clean &amp; easy to reassemble.</li>
            <li>But it was easy to put in a battery, worked well, and was easy to clean.</li>

            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Great trimmer, plenty strong for tougher hairs, no snagging, might buy another one for the future.</li>
            <li>So far no issues, battery life seems really good, tip comes off easy for cleaning</li>
            <li>The tip is smooth and rounded and fits perfectly into odd shaped nasal and aural cavities.</li>
            <li>My first time using it, it was very successful at clearing out all that extra hair up there.</li>
            <li>It;s comfortable and easy to use, works well, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The design is the key--the rounded top allows the blades to get really close and to safely and easily navigate ears and nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>4 stars given tge price, it works just fine but feels kinda cheap like it might break soon.  </li>
            <li>Works fine but seems important to give a thorough cleaning of the blades assembly after each use.</li>
            <li>I bought it primarily to trim my nose hair and it worked just fine, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li>, of course) jumped on the computer, and bought this wonderful item on Amazon.com, for less that 13 bucks; no tax and no delivery charge (I have Amazon Prime for an extremely cheap 79 bucks a year, which gives me free two-day shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, I&#x27;m gonna keep it more hidden than my vibrator, but I am just so happy I have it.</li>
            <li>It works fantastic, is easy to use, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This worked fine but after 9 months of light use, it just stopped working.  </li>
            <li>First of all, it has an ergonomic design, it is very easy to hold it.</li>
            <li>For my first trimmer I find this very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Such a good product, but very VERY cheap design.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, powerful (it better be), and very cost effective.</li>
            <li>Works great, quiet, easy to use, easy to clean. . .</li>
            <li>Have been using all sorts of various nose hair trimmers and this is by far the best, most efficient and easy to use hair trimmer I ever used.  </li>

            <li>I bought this little guy on a whim years ago and it has served me perfectly.</li>
            <li>This little guy worked impressively well - for two weeks.</li>
            <li>After reading the excellent reviews on this little gem</li>
            <li>and I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;It cuts like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li>Best little trimmer I ver had.</li>
            <li>This little guy is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve found yet.</li>

            <li>This trimmer is comfortable to use, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>All in all, a nice tool for taming a balding Wookie - and much cheaper than a light saber.</li>
            <li>So cheap and I can&#x27;t believe how quiet and great it works.</li>
            <li>Cuts beautifully, accurately with ease.  </li>
            <li>What a great grooming tool, easy to clean, batteries last and last and a great feel.</li>
            <li>For one, the hair has to get in there a ways, so it won&#x27;t get close or accurate.  </li>
            <li>Took a couple of times using it to feel comfortable (was concerned about nipping and snipping) but found it to work smoothly and comfortably.  </li>
            <li>Smooth, easy to clean, and...</li>
            <li>That is a huge plus to me.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in the military, so it&#x27;s great for trimming my hair from touching my ears.</li>
            <li>It is a huge upgrade.  </li>
            <li>huge improvement in quality</li>
            <li>Its a lot smaller than the picture looks, which is a good thing because the picture makes this thing look huge!  </li>
            <li>much more effective than the old clunker I had...</li>
            <li>its better than expected, great colors</li>
            <li>Pain free and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several hair trimmers, including that manual one that got all the 5-star reviews (but is worthless).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never have I experienced one that works as smoothly and trims as closely as this one.  </li>
            <li>Another huge plus is the fact it runs off of AA batteries.  </li>
            <li>Up my nose, or in my ears, this trimmer trims closed and more thoroughly than I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li>but I will say that using this before a ride has made a HUGE difference in the nose</li>
            <li>Seems easy to maintain and keep clean.</li>
            <li>,form fits your hand not a lot of noise and easy to clean in the sink.</li>

            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>I know replacement blades are available, but it doesn&#x27;t seem that replacement tips/hair guards are.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m taking off a star because a flimsy hair guard like this ought to have replacements available.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need anything any more powerful to get the job done.  </li>
            <li>Really easy to clean, too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*should have been bit more powerful</li>

            <li>Cheaply Made</li>
            <li>It works just like it did when I bought it - smooth trimming with no discomfort.</li>
            <li>At a relatively inexpensive price, it&#x27;s a great investment.</li>
            <li>It reaches well in the nose and the sound of the nose hair getting trimmed is so...</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is one of some products that are worth more than the price.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and uses one AA battery.</li>
            <li>But it was cheaply made.</li>
            <li>I like that it is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>comfortable ergonomic handle, cuts what needs to be cut.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This device is great, especially for the price.</li>

            <li>This trimmer does the the job neatly in nose and ears and is easy to keep clean and maintain.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t someone make a trimmer that works and can be used in a pain free manner?</li>
            <li>have tried a number of trimmers - mostly your garden variety brand from the local drugstore - and these are BY FAR the best I have owned.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic nose and facial hair trimmer is a really great product.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>Works great and cleans well with a simple rinse.</li>

            <li>The item works great on nose and ear hair issues, but when it comes to visible touch-up work, it falls short.</li>
            <li>The case is slim and comfortable and has a storage unit.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>After repeatedly trying the cheap Remington trash nose hair clippers  sold @</li>

            <li>When it died (happy it did), I went back to panasonic with this model.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>there is no battery light</li>
            <li>I actually lightly burnt the inside of my nostril (</li>
            <li>My nose is now the porcelain smooth palace it was meant to be.</li>
            <li>trimmer works great or nose, ear and facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found the product that works great for me.</li>
            <li>But while cleaning it (running water through it), I shook off the water (quite lightly mind you) and the tip happened to touch the ceramic basin bottom.</li>

            <li>It is fairly quiet and works great.  </li>
            <li>It does feel a bit cheap with regards to plasticy, but I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too.  </li>
            <li>but I wanted to shed light on some of the issues others have had with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Took it apart again and noticed a curved piece of plastic in the chamber that holds the hair that was blocking the blade from moving freely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
            <li>But replacement blades are not made available by Panasonic.</li>

            <li>My Instagram page has never been so popular with the amount of likes I am receiving from my popular selfies (especially now that I don’t have fiber optic cables growing out of my nose).</li>

            <li>So good so far.</li>
            <li>So far so good, seems to work well.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely the best nose and facial hair trimmer that I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t need it as much as some, but I needed it more than most.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the ear trimmer, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>Works good so far..</li>
            <li>Having said that, very easy to use, easy on the battery, quiet and effective.</li>
            <li>super easy to use, and super easy to clean!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I found trimmers that worked amazingly well and was quick and painless.</li>
            <li>First off it doesn&#x27;t cause any pain so no plucking or anything, its very easy to clean and it does what it is intended to do with ease.</li>
            <li>This item is easy to use, light weight, and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Priced right, couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>The designed is outstanding and works great&lt;br /&gt;on nose hair, cuts it just right.</li>
            <li>However, this product is very good due to speed and power of it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to disassemble for cleaning, but as with most of these, doesn&#x27;t really seem to spin very quickly.  </li>
            <li>I received this trimmer just about four months ago and after using it several times a week on both my nose and ear hair I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m still on the original battery I installed the day I got</li>
            <li>and I really wasn&#x27;t impressed with how clean it left the unit.</li>
            <li>works great more than I expected!</li>
            <li>Easy to disassemble for cleaning, but as with most of these, doesn&#x27;t really seem to spin very quickly.</li>
            <li>It gives the same good trim, and  the trimmer head seems strong and does not jam easily.</li>
            <li>This is a great item, I had their original trimmer for over 20 years until it finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>When things are easy to use and easy to take care of they are in an overall sense - good.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have any loose hair remaining afterwards and was very impressed after the first use.</li>
            <li>and I never knew how much of a difference they make!!!</li>
            <li>This little $12 piece gives me the best, most consistent results.  </li>
            <li>It is very effective and amazingly quiet.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful.  </li>
            <li>IS VERY USEFUL.</li>
            <li>I know some reviews says it breaks, but mine did not answer it is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product after reading somewhere where plucking your nose hair can cause fatal infection in a very rare cases.</li>
            <li>Well-made, quiet, and very effective.  </li>
            <li>Panasonic trimmer has been a very effective and simple solution.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and efficient.  </li>

            <li>This is a very handy personal grooming tool to have.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t very useful for my ears, but I bought it for my nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li>The fact that you can clean it out with water is great and all, however the motor always sounds like it&#x27;s on its last leg.</li>
            <li>Never clogged, easy to clean, cuts clean, does not pinch or pull the hairs.  </li>
            <li>like I do to make sure its spotless, make sure you use a steady hand.</li>
            <li>My husband bought one from Best Buy and has been using it for the past 4 years and it still works fine.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean although you have to dissemble the cutter to clean.</li>
            <li>quick, easy and pain free.  </li>
            <li>its ok my older panasonic trimmer was much better....</li>
            <li>I hear the familiar crackling sound as the blades touch my nose hairs</li>
            <li>It works really well; it&#x27;s not the first trimmer I&#x27;ve gotten, but it&#x27;s the best one so far</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re really high quality and work better (a lot better) than any others I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li>and I found it very efficient, safe, comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>removed hair clean and smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s amazing as you get older, you find hair growing in places</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use; safe; light; and the price is reasonable.</li>

            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and super results.</li>
            <li>You probably bent the metal part at the top ever so slightly, and that will make the blade rattle, and you will never be able to align it again, and you will never find replacement blades at a fair price.  </li>
            <li>This one, you just stick up there and it zaps everything quickly and easily.  </li>

            <li>im pretty sure i will lose the cleaning brush eventually since its always separated from the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>It does exactly what it was planned to do and with a price of 10 dollars you cant expect for more</li>
            <li>but the tip can run a bit hot if you run it for more than a min or two.</li>

            <li>My initial impression is that it&#x27;s an excellent product for what you pay for it, and would gladly recommend it to those who are seeking a similar product.</li>
            <li>ORIGINAL REVIEW:  </li>
            <li>Worth the money!</li>
            <li>For $ 9.99, it&#x27;s well worth it.!</li>
            <li>it is not the closest shave but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li>wonderful small appliance for man</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t trim eyebrows, like the Remington could, but I find this a minor inconvenience, considering the great job it does otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: Trimmed hair is contained within the cutter housing, doesn&#x27;t get all over your nostrils</li>
            <li>It does what it is designed to do and it also works great for those ear hairs that seem to grow long as you age.</li>
            <li>It is still running on the original AA battery.</li>
            <li>The first one worked but mostly by yanking the hair out of my nose.  </li>
            <li>I read somewhere that there are a significant amount of lemons and if you get one, it will stop working within a year.</li>
            <li>Great product and not loud.</li>
            <li>I got him this mostly to handle his nose hairs, which he wasn&#x27;t aware</li>
            <li>Not loud and seem to run great.</li>
            <li>This is well worth the money as well!  </li>
            <li>AND this one is significantly quieter.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best electric small trimmer ever.  </li>
            <li>I have purchased nose, ear &amp; hair trimmers in the past, but this is the best model I have used.</li>
            <li>Have purchased many different types of Nose trimmers over the years and finest be the most satisfying for this purchase</li>
            <li>Used it about 3 times so far and very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Worked ok for first month or so.</li>
            <li>Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Works, did not take long to use, happy with the results.</li>
            <li>love it, really works!</li>
            <li>Not much more to say, best on the market IMO.</li>
            <li>No more embarrassing nose hairs, this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li>When I first used this, I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything because I felt no tugging as I do with most nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li>Twist the top, place the end in hot water while it is running</li>
            <li>/&gt;I can now smell the fresh scent of life without any obstruction!</li>
            <li>No more nose hair tickles.....works perfectly!</li>
            <li>I have had a Panasonic in the past and it was awesome.</li>
            <li>and the battery lasts a bit longer than the original.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed</li>
            <li>Works as originally described.</li>
            <li>It manages to efficiently trim away those most embarrassing gray bristles that seem to grow out of the nostrils like dandelions in an unkempt yard without vibrating at the decibel level of a weedwacker, and it handles the finer follicles that pop out of the ears pretty well, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SMILE!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many others in the past with not so good results, including pulling and scraping inside the nose (ouch!).  </li>
            <li>The performance is so much better that I was amazed the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Works perfectly and is small and lightweight.</li>
            <li>At first I thought he meant his panda, but I wasn&#x27;t sure he had one anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>original review 5 star:&lt;br /&gt;I have been through about 5 brands and the issues were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have no comment on battery life as of yet, the original batteries I have in it have yet to give sign</li>
            <li>Most people aren&#x27;t interested in checking out flies legs hanging out your nostrils.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>If you need a small trimmer for hair in unwanted places, this would be an excellent choice.</li>
            <li>Love it ... not going to explain exactly why.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad this was my first nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>: About one year out, and I will still uphold my original rating.</li>
            <li>Well worth it!</li>
            <li>The long battery life is also a great plus.</li>
            <li>but i&#x27;m pretty sure thats just from the hairs.  </li>
            <li>But I think with this kind of product function is the most important issue and the panasonic falls short IMO.</li>
            <li>my wife can&#x27;t believe i&#x27;m excited about a nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>WELL worth the $10 I paid for it!</li>
            <li>You will LOVE it when you first use it...</li>
            <li>This is a kindlier, gentler version, which at first felt like it had no oomph, but now that I am used to it, I kick myself for thinking that the original power mower was better.  </li>
            <li>Small and works great!!!</li>
            <li>Small inconvenience for an otherwise excellent prduct.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not going to extol its virtues to the skies or pretend that it&#x27;s any more than what it is: an inexpensive gadget that basically does just one thing and does it pretty well.</li>
            <li>seller was respectful and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>Satisfactory but not the best trimmer I have had in the past.</li>
            <li>It really should be more powerful and cut more</li>
            <li>The ER-GN30 is the first trimmer that I have been truly pleased with.</li>
            <li>It worked OK for the first couple months</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made in China, but with Panasonic&#x27;s name on it, it has to meet higher engineering and manufacturing standards than most made-in-China junk.</li>
            <li>unit does get warm with some continuous use, but this normal, just in case you were wondering.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much fun to use!</li>
            <li>Works great and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li>Good product it just happens to have its own personality and works only when it wants to</li>
            <li>When I use a rechargeable one, even right from the charger, it doesn&#x27;t seem to sound as strong.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to use, easy to set up, and the price was right.</li>
            <li>:Does the job really well, looks elegant, easy to clean, battery lasts very long, doesn&#x27;t hurt you and great price!&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Nice and reliable trimmer, works fine so far.</li>
            <li>Pretty decent, waterproof as described and work good</li>
            <li>He looks better, my whole family feels better and all is right with the world.</li>
            <li>It is not loud, it is very easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li>Works well easy to clean, highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean and does exactly what is needed.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, they are pretty cheap and easy to replace.</li>
            <li>This is the first of it&#x27;s type I have purchased, but it works really well, painless, easy to use and clean, and effective.  </li>
            <li>This is a simple trimmer that works very well at a very good price.  </li>
            <li>After seeing all of the other great reviews of this item, I easily decided that this was the trimmer I would purchase for myself.</li>
            <li>After trying so many other brands, I am completely convinced this is the best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful and practical for nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is great: it is sharp, lots of power, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Nice new technology.</li>
            <li>but this new design is must effective to cut.</li>
            <li>Honestly, the shipping would probably warrant just buying a new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although the older one still spun happily, blades cost nearly as much as a new one</li>
            <li>The new unit is quieter, curved to fit the hand and more easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li>so you can run it under the water, can trim in the shower or just clean it out&lt;br</li>
            <li>It gets kind of hot after prolonged use, but considering that this is my first nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li>to clean on wash mode turn switch on the device.&lt;br /&gt;*Needs</li>
            <li>Still have not figured out how to clean it.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean,easy to use well worth the money if your thinking about buying it.</li>
            <li>to clean, too.  </li>
            <li>Maybe that is my lack of understanding on how to clean it.  </li>
            <li>I also like how you can turn the dial and clean it under the faucet...</li>
            <li>Like the clean feature too.</li>
            <li>It works, it rinses clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, waterproof, powerful, priced-welled.  </li>
            <li>To be honest - I have no idea if there are better competing models, but that&#x27;s only because this one does what I expect it to do - keep my ear and nose hair in check.</li>
            <li>This was purchased for my husband so he can clean his ears.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve got a clean device.</li>
            <li>on dads wiry hair it takes a lot of repeat passes to clean him up.  </li>
            <li>I do like the ability to clean it whilst the motor runs under the tap.</li>
            <li>like the fact you can put it under running water to clean</li>
            <li>and you could see the results since you needed to clean it out versus flushing.</li>
            <li>My nose has been cleanly trimmed ever since it arrived two or three weeks ago.</li>
            <li>This is the third trimmer I have owned and by far the best .</li>
            <li>if you want to clean the blades that becomes complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use it to clean up around my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;other brands and the ability to clean the tip should keep the unit from clogging up over time.  </li>
            <li>But I can&#x27;t figure out how you clean this thing out with water.</li>
            <li>Based on my experience with various brands and styles of trimmers, this is the best I&#x27;ve used, so far.</li>
            <li>and you can clean it without taking it apart.</li>
            <li>This is the third type of trimmer I have purchased and by far the best.</li>
            <li>thank you for offer such a good stuff and cheap on this site.</li>
            <li>Never tested the water clean out feature.</li>
            <li>I am been struggling with buying a lot of different nose trimmers but this one is BY FAR THE BEST.  </li>
            <li>I also like that you can wash it under water to quickly clean it</li>
            <li>Likes how you can turn it and clean it out with water.</li>
            <li>Gets all of the nose hairs clean as a whistle with no muss or fuss.</li>
            <li>, so you feel/are clean after using.</li>
            <li>Provides clean cuts flush with the skin.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a knob to twist to clean with water which is the option I use to clean it.  </li>
            <li>I like this trimmer because it cuts clean without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>No pulling or tugging, just clean cuts.  </li>
            <li>It rinses clean.  </li>
            <li>You must keep it clean, else it would stop working.</li>
            <li>The ability to rinse it in flowing water while it is running keeps it really clean.</li>
            <li>It can even be cleaned under the faucet with running water, although I opted to just brush it clean with the included cleaning brush.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to men and women who want to have a clean appearance.</li>
            <li>So I finally just went with the most popular.</li>
            <li>I use this for far more than my nose, and I love it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but so far, vary happy.</li>
            <li>The brush cleans the blades in seconds and an alcohol-soaked Q-Tip fits neatly into the metal guard to sanatize and clean.</li>
            <li>It trims nose hair close and clean, with no pulling.  </li>
            <li>I returned that one and bought another one of these fantastic panasonic trimmers and love it as much as the one I broke.</li>
            <li>Improves breathing and keeps the nose clean</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s built well and trims cleanly.</li>
            <li>i have had several trimmers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>with antiseptic instead of trying to take it apart to clean.</li>
            <li>Clean.</li>
            <li>Does not pull the hair, cuts clean</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t pull your hair and they have a setting to clean them under a faucet.</li>
            <li>This one appears to be well made, does a nice job and has actually worked more than once.</li>
            <li>Two hands are needed to use and clean this.  </li>
            <li>Two hands are needed to use and clean this.  </li>

            <li>Look clean and presentable again.</li>
            <li>Keep it clean.</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer because of its excellent reviews, but unfortunately, I can&#x27;t recommend it based on my own experiences.  </li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly and never pulls.</li>
            <li>One of the many fun things about getting older, you start to lose hair on top of your head and it start to grow faster out your nose and ears.</li>
            <li>to clean by holding it under a running faucet.  </li>
            <li>Best nose trimmer we&#x27;ve owned so far, and this is the fourth one.</li>
            <li>so you can clean or replace it</li>
            <li>It also has a function where you can let water run through the blades as they are on to clean it</li>
            <li>but I always prefer to disassemble it and clean it that way.</li>
            <li>Helps keep the blades and blade chamber clean when running it under the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Panasonic makes a number of trimmers that do the hair-trimming job nicely, and many of them are about the same price.  </li>
            <li>I will probably try not to use the brush to clean the blades with this</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer, better then my last one.</li>
            <li>like the fact that I can rinse it under the water to clean it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it under water or washed it under water but the dry use is great.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that you can clean this after using it.  </li>
            <li>Twist the cap as instructed when you are done, and everything rinses clean away.</li>
            <li>in the head, blades, etc to clean it</li>
            <li>If you read the instructions in the language of choice you can even igure out how to keep it clean.</li>
            <li>I like the feature where you can clean it while running under a faucet.</li>
            <li>to clean.</li>
            <li>What makes it noteworthy is that it&#x27;s washable so it gets clean.  </li>
            <li>Clean up, no problem.</li>
            <li>It was a great gift for my husband who has more trouble with his nose hair than anyone I&#x27;ve ever known.</li>
            <li>Clean cut</li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly without pulling or irritation.</li>
            <li>motor is reasonably powerful and it is really easy to clean.</li>
            <li>One word of caution: You can use the water rinse method to clean this, but if you take the trimmer section apart</li>
            <li>I clean it with rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps if from getting sticky or clogged.</li>
            <li>The trimmer quickly and precisely removes nose, eyebrow and ear fuzz in a conservative manner</li>
            <li>I can run under water to clean without any problems.</li>
            <li>trims nicley, good battery life, doesnt pull hair, doesnt sound like a weekeater, and keeps the hair short.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t figure out from the instruction on howto remove trimmer to clean.</li>
            <li>It seems like it&#x27;s there to clean it out,</li>
            <li>but it cuts cleanly,</li>
            <li>because I do like to use water to clean and not the brush.</li>
            <li>My husband have bought several Nose and Face trimmers and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and need to have it clean all the time after...</li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly, with no tugging.  </li>
            <li>Not overly thrilled, but it&#x27;s better than the last two I purchased.</li>
            <li>A bit cheaply made but works adequately.</li>
            <li>Just twist the switch and run the device under water to clean.  </li>
            <li>This is a nice product, well made, and i am sure it will last.  </li>
            <li>Until you have to clean it.  </li>
            <li>We are now noses clean per the Queen&#x27;s request.</li>
            <li>but after you remove the head to wash and clean it</li>
            <li>, it started pulling at hairs instead of making clean cuts like it did before.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course at only $12 I could just get another one, it&#x27;d just be nice to be able to buy replacement blades/etc</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li>I wanted a nose trimmer that I could rinse with water to clean, based on the review I purchased this Panasonic.</li>
            <li>but when I got done and looked into my nostrils, they were both quite clean.</li>
            <li>Easier to clean  and</li>
            <li>Snips away at nose hair cleanly, comfortably and quickly.</li>
            <li>its easly to clean and hasnt rusted.</li>
            <li>I like that I can clean it with water after use.</li>
            <li>Never dropped it, always kept it clean.</li>
            <li>no problems... helps clean up all the errant hairs nose, ears etc...</li>
            <li>Leaves be clean and trimmed.  </li>
            <li>won&#x27;t clean it)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Looks like it&#x27;ll be easier to clean as well.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, better blade system than older trimmers.</li>
            <li>The blade could be bent if you don&#x27;t take care to gently clean off the clipped hairs.  </li>
            <li>Ran water through to clean it and was shaking it when the tip assembly just came apart from the inertial force of shaking the water out........</li>
            <li>a breeze to clean.</li>
            <li>works great dry.</li>
            <li>to clean out the head.</li>
            <li>better than my last one and a nice price.  </li>
            <li>but I still pull the head off to give it a thorough clean once in a while.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used multiple trimmers and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Also has a water rinse feature where you move a knob to a setting and place it under running water to clean it out.  </li>
            <li>to clean and wash.</li>
            <li>Clean up beard/mustach lines, eyebrowns, nose hair...</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull on hairs and cleanly cuts the hairs.</li>
            <li>Just turn to flush mode and put under running water and its clean.</li>
            <li>and you can clean it with water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It cuts clean and meets my requirements to a tee.</li>
            <li>how the heck do I clean it though?</li>
            <li>The cutter detaches so that you can dump and clean.  </li>
            <li>Do remember to brush/ clean the blades after use.</li>
            <li>It is designed to rinse clean after</li>
            <li>Hacks away at my nose hairs and gives a clean cut.</li>
            <li>This is our third one and the best so far.</li>
            <li>Must clean thoroughly after each use.</li>
            <li>The nose trimmer arrived on time, undamaged and clean.</li>
            <li>I used three different products but this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li>It has clean feature</li>
            <li>Takes me 10 seconds to  clip hair - and another 10 secs to clean the device.</li>
            <li>like the water clean out fearure</li>
            <li>I have to hold my breath when I use it and quickly clean out my nose before taking a breath in, or else I get sickened by the smell.</li>
            <li>That works great and is worth shelling out the extra money for.</li>
            <li>You just can&#x27;t use the brush they give to clean it well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>Clean shaving.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer three times, but so far, it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>It works well and is easier to clean.</li>
            <li>Using fresh rechargeable Ni-MH batteries, the motor would spin nice and fast once turned on</li>
            <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t very loud which is nice, unlike clippers or beard</li>
            <li>However, with all the new battery technology and companies making products that consumers will have to continuously replace I decided that the best replacement would be this one as you can load your own batteries in it (just make sure to take your battery out of the product when not in use as to prolong the life of the battery and to reduce corrosion so that the product lasts as long as possible.  </li>
            <li>I ordered this based off the many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I bought this product after seeing so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>I chose it because most reviews were positive, they were correct.</li>
            <li>How can this have so many positive reviews?</li>
            <li>Hey, it always helps to add one more positive voice to the chorus, no?  </li>
            <li>It is far better than any micro-trimmer I have ever used!</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s far better than the mechanical, twisting one that I used to use!</li>
            <li>I find it&#x27;s best to remove the hairs by gently touching the tips and trim each hair gradually rather than trying to remove a hair in one shot, especially the long hairs.</li>
            <li>This baby is extremely well made and works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Cuts the hair right off and easy to clean the device.</li>
            <li>I did a lot of research before purchasing this product and  it turned out to be a smart buy,  compact and easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li>I have used it for several months now and work great right out of the box.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good trimmer, a little lite n</li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer, smooth, easy no pain.</li>
            <li>While almost all reviews for heavy hair use aren&#x27;t that great for this as it eventually breaks down; this is wonderful for your nose.</li>
            <li>Works great for nose hairs as long as you use it quickly.</li>
            <li>very comfortable and fast</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable and really gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Is very precise and fast.</li>
            <li>We got this very quickly and used it right away.</li>
            <li>The cutter is just the right size and it is easy to use and trim the hair efficiently.</li>
            <li>The price was right and it easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use right away out of the box.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and to keep running right.</li>
            <li>Worth the money, still working fine.</li>
            <li>Does the job very quick and safe, no need to worry about touching your inner skin.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know any other men who own a trimmer like this - the men in my family seem to just consider tufts of wayward hair coming out their head holes to enhance character or something - so I was on my own.</li>
            <li>It works well and rarely misses any hairs, and it&#x27;s super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy with the water flush through feature, and taking it apart to clean is fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>The price makes it worth it, and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Most other electric trimmers do not do as good a job.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad someone finally invented a super effective weapon for the war on nasal tendrils.</li>
            <li>The jet rinse feature is nice, good to know all that gunk is being flushed out and not becoming residue inside the blade.</li>
            <li>Quiet, safe, efficient, and very easy to clean using the rinse feature.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and clean (interesting to have multiple cleaning options), works well, compact, performs as advertised.</li>
            <li>It is always advisable not to pluck hair and scissors is anyways risky specially if you want to cut hair in your nose.</li>
            <li>Nothing special about the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>I have also used this to trim around a beard that I have grown out for a special event.  </li>
            <li>nothing special.</li>
            <li>For the money it does what it should but certainly nothing more.  </li>
            <li>Nothing special.</li>
            <li>Nothing special to say one way or another.  </li>
            <li>Most trimmers just don&#x27;t get close enough, especially right inside the nose on that septum area.  </li>
            <li>Does the job right!</li>
            <li>It arrived right before Xmas!</li>
            <li>There were some hairs that it just wouldn&#x27;t touch (even though they&#x27;re right there!).</li>
            <li>I thought the price was right too!  </li>
            <li>Priced right!</li>
            <li>Reviews have led me to the right product!</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very easy to set up, and requires a AA battery (not included), and washable.last but not least, gets rid of hair with no pull or tuck feeling</li>
            <li>Very good trimmer - highly recommended especially for its price.</li>
            <li>The trimmer worked great right out of the box -- it operates quickly, efficiently, and surprisingly silently.  </li>

            <li>, it&#x27;s an awesome bang for your buck, does the job VERY VERY well, and last but certainly not least, its a wet/dry trimmer.</li>

            <li>Features I like, does not cut too close (avoids in grown hair), easy to use, quite, very easy to clean (great feature), long lasting battery, does not take up a lot of room in travel case...</li>
            <li>Lol haven&#x27;t tried it wet ;-?</li>
            <li>works great and is quieter than I was expected</li>
            <li>Seems to do exactly what it is supposed to and is easy use and clean.  </li>
            <li>I will do so like four or five times before I just sigh and give up because it&#x27;s not cutting any more hair after its first pass through.</li>
            <li>easy to clean and does exactly what is promised.  </li>
            <li>but WOW, this is amazing.  </li>
            <li>Does tend to choke pretty easily so you have to clean it out every 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>I love it because there are no more stray hairs coming out of his nose and ears (lol).</li>
            <li>Works great and is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>I am pretty much done with trying to buy this kind of device.</li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer that I have bought that actually works great product</li>
            <li>Used many nose hair trimmers in the past, this is great for the money.</li>
            <li>I have tried many trimmers in the past and have always experienced irritation and discomfort.  </li>
            <li>This product worked great the first time, then wouldn&#x27;t work when I went to use it the second time.</li>
            <li>Its pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to take apart and clean it well.</li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to clean though.</li>
            <li>It was quiet and worked great when I first received the item.</li>
            <li>Yes, it does get a bit warm if it&#x27;s on for more than 2 or 3 minutes, but that&#x27;s an extrememly minor</li>
            <li>Works great as long as the batteries are fresh.</li>
            <li>Works great and as expected.</li>
            <li>This product works great, just be careful how you use it.</li>
            <li>Not painful.</li>
            <li>The overall shape and usage of this product are nice and simple, which is great.</li>
            <li>Not too loud, which is nice.</li>
            <li>It is better than anything else on the market, which isn&#x27;t saying much.</li>
            <li>This is good for trimming nose,ear and facial hair.</li>
            <li>If I have to be at the age where this has become necessary, it&#x27;s nice to have a tool that makes it easy, clean and painless.</li>
            <li>Very simple but good design.</li>
            <li>Overall good though.</li>
            <li>With both of us using this product, I really like being able to rinse it with water.</li>
            <li>The cool thing is convenient and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Even looks better (although I really don&#x27;t care about that, but you might).  </li>
            <li>This makes for much easier and more sanitary cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not give the fifth star only because I would have loved it were rechargeable.</li>
            <li>Save your money, buy something that parts are replaceable at a reasonable cost, and that is more durable.  </li>
            <li>I have had multiple nose/facial hair trimmers and while they all worked fairly well, none of them were anything I would write home to mom about.</li>
            <li>and I am full of regret.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer does a fantastic job and worth every cent.</li>
            <li>For most people this is really all you should need.</li>
            <li>Absolutely no painful pulling</li>
            <li>Impressed with how powerful and good the cutting mechanism is.</li>
            <li>Being able to rinse it out is really helpful.</li>
            <li>Can I return it for full refund?</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t have a good connection and have to remove the batteries to get it to work properly</li>
            <li>Quick and clean.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t spend as much time trimming my nose hairs because it cuts better.  </li>
            <li>It seems to be more efficient that the straight handles - easier grip.  </li>
            <li>Like most warranties, the user is responsible for shipping to get it fixed/replacement.</li>
            <li>Quick clean.</li>
            <li>Does a good job of removing unwanted nasal, ear, and facial hair.  </li>
            <li>good ear and facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Overall good product thought.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad she did it works very well</li>
            <li>It works well and the cap and the ability to rinse it under water are nice features my old trimmer didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>Even with a battery with a full charge, it ripped hair out instead of trimming.</li>
            <li>The instructions are good and simple.</li>
            <li>but it is good on initially clearing of nose hair.</li>
            <li>Many years ago I gently raised one into a nostril where it set about yanking out every nostril hair it could grab.</li>
            <li>I think I should get a full rebate.</li>
            <li>I know that have full on bushes growing out of their nose.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>good quality and simple to use works just like it says it does.</li>
            <li>Really really cuts close but is safe.</li>
            <li>Cheap and useful product.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a clipper I used for years that was a third the size of this Panasonic yet twice as good.</li>
            <li>only thing is it works so good</li>
            <li>It works really well, and the cost was appropriate.</li>
            <li>but this is much quicker and does a way better job.</li>
            <li>but it is so superior to a different one that I threw in the trash.  </li>
            <li>well i&#x27;ve only used it once, but this is working out good.</li>
            <li>This is not a tool that good hygiene principles allow for occasional cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Then again, glad it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>A good buy overall.</li>
            <li>My nostrils haven’t looked this good since before I started growing facial</li>
            <li>This one really works, unlike so many others that look identical, but do nothing.</li>
            <li>the packaging is good enough, instructions, even the motor and assembly are not and issue.</li>
            <li>Overall, though, it works well and the price is good.</li>
            <li>Although it looks cool in the bathroom, that&#x27;s where it should stay.</li>
            <li>It is so good that I bought second one for my dad.</li>
            <li>Not painful</li>
            <li>but overall works good and serves it purpose for nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t write many review</li>
            <li>It is relatively painless which is good.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is a good buy, especially for the price</li>
            <li>/&gt;It felt cheaply made and the cost wasn&#x27;t worth all the effort to try and use utilize its warranty.</li>
            <li>This my second Panasonic trimmer and it does a good job of trimming, but eats batteries.  </li>
            <li>Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li>Not as good as the one I bought years ago that finally wore out.</li>
            <li>Well,.. as real men age, unsightly hair can get more so.  </li>
            <li>Second, it didn&#x27;t do a good job trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li>and overall it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li>Works really good, doesn&#x27;t cut you and takes the hair out, only need to use it every week or so.</li>
            <li>they are dying after 3 full uses.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li>it really be any better then</li>
            <li>This is a useful and cheap tool that gets the job done.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cool to see it pump the pieces of cut hair into the pool of water in the bottom of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I like all the features listed in the description, so this should be the last one I have to purchase for a good while</li>
            <li>it cuts the hair cleanly and quickly with no pulling...  </li>
            <li>I really can&#x27;t say how many trimmers I&#x27;ve bought over the years and discarded because they didn&#x27;t work as they should.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li>Much better than using scissors, &amp; reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li>I thought I&#x27;d try it from all the good reviews but after only using maybe 4 times, it has died.  </li>
            <li>In this case, that wasn&#x27;t such a good idea.</li>
            <li>We enjoyed ours so much, we bought one for my dad.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I did not feel that it was worth it to return it as it was cheap to start</li>
            <li>For human use, this is a good product</li>
            <li>it is a cool thing arrived in time</li>
            <li>/&gt;Very solidly built and good feel.</li>
            <li>It does such a good job trimming nose hair that I even use it for edging my mustache.</li>
            <li>I an hoping that this one will last longer &amp; do as good of a job.</li>
            <li>Really good and essential thing for every man.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good on ear hairs and trimming up facial hair, as well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a pro-Amazon customer so this is a true review.  </li>
            <li>recommend it more, really.</li>
            <li>Worked like a charm, only good for noise.</li>
            <li>good upgrade from my last one.</li>
            <li>To my surprise, it cuts really well, and I didn&#x27;t feel any hair pulling or irritation even when pressing the top against skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Fast, efficient and safe to use</li>
            <li>There are more options for cheaper that wouldn&#x27;t stop working as fast as this did.</li>
            <li>I like this simple and good work</li>
            <li>Works better than any nose trimmer I&#x27;ve seen before, really like.</li>
            <li>Loving it so far.</li>
            <li>It is good enough at what it does.  </li>
            <li>but I can replace one to have a full power.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s good to go for next time.</li>
            <li>I have a drawer full of nose hair trimmers that don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Looks cool.</li>
            <li>There are certainly much better ones on the market but they are also much pricier.</li>
            <li>It really works, better than I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li>Cool device, it does what it says.</li>
            <li>This tool is a man&#x27;s nose hair dream come true, for me.  </li>
            <li>and I must combat this with full force.  </li>
            <li>Yes sure did, thanks for paying attention.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s battery life is good 9running on the same one for 3 months now).</li>
            <li>Good grip and very quiet motor.</li>
            <li>Only used once, but did a good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is powered by a regular battery; which is SUPERIOR to the units with a &amp;#34;charging base.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>true description.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s quick to clean.  </li>
            <li>I thought that by purchasing a Panasonic device, it would last a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li>I have been using this since last 1 month, Its quite good with its price range,</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s a cool feature.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much nicer than many others I had.</li>
            <li>I think that since these cut on the top and side it really improves the performance.  </li>
            <li>Most all of them have a cheap feel to them and tend to be a bit loud (cheap motors).  </li>
            <li>So far ths trimmer works pretty good.</li>
            <li>Not bad for $10.</li>
            <li>Not bad when it works.</li>
            <li>For $8 not a bad deal.</li>
            <li>All in all, not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad for the price either.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product for the price</li>
            <li>I should have known that it was too good to be true, it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not a bad grooming tool.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product for $13.</li>
            <li>if u have re-chargeble batteries its probably not bad.</li>
            <li>Not a bad trimmer.  </li>
            <li>A not bad as we put in maind the price paid...</li>
            <li>thing works and so far the battery lasts pretty good.</li>
            <li>Not bad.</li>
            <li>Just the joy of that weed wacker like sound chopping down those ear hairs.  </li>
            <li>Works great work or dry!!</li>
            <li>the price was very reasonable and the delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and very fast</li>
            <li>I think he&#x27;s actually grooming more often now that he has something that is doing such an easy and great job for him.</li>
            <li>Really nice product, very effective and solid in my hand, will probabl last for a while.</li>
            <li>If you need a trimmer, this is just as good or better than the others I&#x27;ve tried, for less money.</li>
            <li>Overall, the trimmer was easy to set-up and use, and has been effective at cleaning up any unwanted ear/nose hair.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, effective, very quiet.  </li>
            <li>So easy to use by far way better than scissors.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet when it&#x27;s in operation; and it also disassembles for easy cleaning, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>For just over 10 dollars and free shipping with a $35 purchase, this was just right for me.</li>
            <li>Limited use thus far, but best trimmer of this sort I have ever had.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is pretty easy.</li>
            <li>- not expensive, can be used with one hand, easily replaceable&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>If you just need a quick trim before the full work up, these are for you.</li>
            <li>this here Panasonic hair trimmer has been a good first step in my comeback: clean, bare, downy earlobes &amp; the nostrils of a George Clooney in a close-up.</li>
            <li>Cleaning the trimmer is pretty easy as well.  </li>
            <li>But its not expensive and easy to carry.</li>
            <li>It is easy to hold and feels pretty sturdy in construction.  </li>
            <li>seems well made and can be cleaned pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I had the previous one for many years and the excellent performance and durability influenced me to buy another when the original finally wore out.  </li>
            <li>Battery (I believe one &amp;#34;AAA&amp;#34;) drains very quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived quicker than was expected and the Panasonic hair trimmer is the absolute best I&#x27;ve ever had especially being so cost effective.</li>
            <li>It delivers a clean, fast cut, and is easy and quick to clean.</li>
            <li>After much research I found a superior Nose &amp; Ear trimmer which really works &amp; appears to be a far better</li>
            <li>It tickles a little, but very effective in quickly and easily trimming those hairs.</li>
            <li>Does a great job; had other trimmers that would miss or not get as close.  </li>
            <li>but the thing is still good for minor touch-ups and was worth the purchase given its cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>At our age hair grows out of every place you never expected, except on top of your head!</li>
            <li>I have used many of these devices in the past and this is by far the best one i have come across.</li>
            <li>takes a few mins once a month or so, and am good to go!  </li>
            <li>No pulling of hairs that I have experienced from other units.</li>
            <li>I purchased it as an impulse buy due to all the great reviews..</li>
            <li>Does the job wonderfully, easy to clean, small and compact, great product.</li>
            <li>I read the other reviews and thought this would be great for trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li>I have a really hairy nose, and this little gizmo does a great job of trimming the werewolfness away!</li>
            <li>With a good battery this little guy keeps me looking in top trim.</li>
            <li>Awesome performance, light weight, does not heat up on tough jobs.</li>
            <li>No one will see this, as there are like a thousand positive reviews... but they are all right!!</li>
            <li>Unlike others that seem to pull more hair than they cut, this one does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this unit for about a year now and the batter is still good; since motors drain batteries quite quickly, and I use this cutter at least once a month, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li>The Trimmer while not perfect is still deserving of a very good rating.</li>
            <li>So far It works very good and is better than the Wahl trimmer I had previous.</li>
            <li>The older original model was more powerful but this one does the job.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this product and certainly look at Panasonic trimming products through new eyes now.</li>
            <li>worked fine at first, now it keeps shutting off like the battery is dying</li>
            <li>It worked fine the first couple of times.  </li>
            <li>This is not the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned, but it works as expected and it&#x27;s easy enough to maintain.</li>
            <li>convenient, clean and powerful.</li>
            <li>In both cases they worked fine at first, but they soon began making whirring noises which became louder and louder.</li>
            <li>Worked fine for the first 2 months.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>Works quickly.</li>
            <li>I have used several different nose hair trimmers but this one works the best for me.  </li>
            <li>The blade/motor spin quickly which reduces hair from being yanked out from your skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple of weeks, but it works very well and was a great price.</li>
            <li>Or one that would leave a hair or two untrimmed, making you spend the better part of an HOUR trying to cut that particular hair?</li>
            <li>Very well built and extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li>A quick pass through keeps nose hair at bay</li>
            <li>Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>It works very well and easy to clean it.</li>
            <li>, so I can quickly replace the battery instead of waiting for a charge.</li>
            <li>The item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on the fence as to whether this product is worthy of the Panasonic name.  </li>
            <li>Cheap enough that everyone can own one.</li>
            <li>Priced well, Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Nice and quiet, comfortable, and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li>it cools quickly though.</li>
            <li>This trimmer arrived quickly as was estimated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s painless, quick and convenient.</li>
            <li>It works- quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li>Works very well &amp; easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li>This is better than some but not as good as the Heavy Duty Nose Trimmer</li>
            <li>Have not had time to use it much yet, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>The older you get the more hair in the nose and ears.  </li>
            <li>This arrived quickly and was packaged to protect the product.  </li>
            <li>Does the job and arrived quickly</li>
            <li>It quickly and efficiently cuts off that unwanted hair with no problems.</li>
            <li>Glad I purchased this particular trimmer.</li>
            <li>Works perfectly, easy to clean  very close shave and NO PAIN</li>
            <li>Its light, but looks well made and is water-washable and has a hole in it that you can open to flush out the hair which is nice.</li>
            <li>So let me tell you a quick story.  </li>
            <li>issue is upgright posture, which tends to make it fall over if the cabinet door is opened quickly</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that the blades inside dulled quickly and/or never repositioned correctly after cleaning and reassembling.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull and does the job quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li>Then after the third use, the top broke off and I have not been able to fix it.  </li>
            <li>Breaks absurdly quickly.</li>
            <li>As I have gotten older, I find myself having to trim my nose hair much more often, about once a month.</li>
            <li>No pinching, just a quick removal of hair.  </li>
            <li>For such a low price this thing is great!</li>
            <li>A good powerful burst of air serves the same function.  </li>
            <li>Ergonomic design, easy to clean, and really does the job on nose and ears.</li>
            <li>A decent set of batteries makes it a much better tool.</li>
            <li>quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>Nothing better than my 5-year old ER-409 which I plan to get rid off soon, this one is cheaply made, that matching the cheaper price.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to rinse clean and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the drawer.  </li>
            <li>I anticipated paying more for decent quality but this thing delivers.</li>
            <li>I kind of expected more in this trimmer.</li>
            <li>maybe you will get lucky and get one that lasts.</li>
            <li>Lucky I&#x27;ll have these trimmers</li>
            <li>You are lucky if you get a 1 year warranty on stuff these days.</li>
            <li>make sure you have a decent battery with plenty of juice in</li>
            <li>but it takes a while to adequately trim.  </li>
            <li>... deteriorates quickly.</li>
            <li>Goes through batteries quickly.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and surpassed all my needs.</li>
            <li>Works great, fairly quiet and does not drain the batteries fast.</li>
            <li>It trims nose hair very well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Serves it purpose, does it well, but goes thru batteries quickly.</li>
            <li>quick shipment.</li>
            <li>worthy choice and investment.</li>
            <li>He likes it - quick, no pain, inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It handles well and does the job quickly...</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to drain the battery too quickly.</li>
            <li>Much better than the old cheap one I had.</li>
            <li>Thankfully, this Panasonic device makes quick work of this evolutionary dead-end.  </li>
            <li>I broke an older model after dropping it to many times.</li>
            <li>Lucky me.  </li>
            <li>Shipped quickly and have had no problems.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s face it guys, as you get older more hair crops up where it isn&#x27;t wanted.  </li>
            <li>I really like that it has a built in drain so that you can clean it easily.</li>
            <li>It gets every stray hair and I love being able to wash it out for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li>Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li>TO GET ALL OF THE HAIRS FROM  EARS AND NOSE; BUT, IT IS ADEQUATE</li>
            <li>This trimmer is extremely easy to clean thanks to the water diverting channel that allows water to flow out of it when you are washing it.</li>
            <li>and I replaced it with one I quickly bought at the store.  </li>
            <li>Quickly shipped.</li>
            <li>One of the pains of growing older is hair sprouting out of the most unflattering places.  </li>
            <li>Replacing an older panasonic trimmer that seemed to cut better than this one.</li>
            <li>Works good, not great, but good.  </li>
            <li>It drains a battery quickly, even if it is just sitting in a drawer.</li>
            <li>Im only writing more because it says more words are required for posting</li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>This really works well and is quiet, attractive and even washable.</li>
            <li>If you are timid and pull it away from you, it can pull hair and cause pain, but if you are brave and go slow, no pain :)    </li>
            <li>but this one doesn&#x27;t seem worthy of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been lucky to get this one on sale at $12 and it has been working well for me ever since.</li>
            <li>A lot of reviews describe this product as failing fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li>This Trimmer arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also will allow you to quickly touch up your mustache around the lip area.</li>
            <li>Much better than the cheap $1.00 ones you can buy on eBay that are shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The vendor shipped this product quickly too.</li>
            <li>This gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li>A quick rinse in the sink cleans the tip.  </li>
            <li>It gets the job done quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li>Nothing extraordinary...</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;ve tried three different of these type trimmers in as many years.</li>
            <li>A quick rinse in the sink cleans the tip.</li>
            <li>Cuts super close with no pulling or irritation to the skin.</li>
            <li>I have tried a lot of different nose hair trimmers and this is definitely the best one for me.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is super.  </li>
            <li>Barbers don&#x27;t do it any more and as I got older</li>
            <li>I remember reading some reviews indicating that the product died relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>delivered quickly</li>
            <li>so I am hoping it doesn&#x27;t break quickly</li>
            <li>does the job quickly</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut quickly and  you have to work at it to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Cuts hair quickly without pinching you.  </li>
            <li>Was blown away at how quickly Amazon delivered this item.  </li>
            <li>I like it better since it is smaller and more compact.</li>
            <li>Now I am starting to doubt great reviews on Amazon, defeats the whole purpose of me shopping here.</li>
            <li>It does a super job and never hurts.</li>
            <li>I have bought several of these types of devices over the years, and this one is simply the best.</li>
            <li>Better than an older model I had years ago</li>
            <li>It is amazing how gentle it is and how fast the problem is resolved.  </li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do, but the batteries run out quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>I have used this trimmer and I find it adequate for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li>It does what it&#x27;s supposed to quickly and painlessly, &#x27;nuff said.</li>
            <li>It makes quick work of nose and ear hair and doesn&#x27;t skip a beat.</li>
            <li>Does it&#x27;s job well and quickly.  </li>
            <li>It performs as advertized and is a super value.  </li>
            <li>I tried several brands during the years and found every time that Panasonic is simple the best.</li>
            <li>And most importantly, don&#x27;t expect this device to completely eliminate your nose hairs, because it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It cuts quickly and without tugging out the nostril roots, which can make a burly man tear up something fierce.</li>
            <li>This solves an issue most people have for sure I would grab this low cost product!</li>
            <li>This one works very well for me and it makes it easy to clean after each use.</li>
            <li>does* clip hair quickly and efficiently, if you don&#x27;t mind having the roar of a chainsaw blasting your eardrums.</li>
            <li>It makes stray hair disappear quickly and with no discomfort.  </li>
            <li>ripped the hairs out of my nose, but thankfully, this trimmer takes care of them quickly, without any pain at all.  </li>
            <li>Works and isn&#x27;t painful....very sturdy and cleans quickly.  </li>
            <li>Quick shipping.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic, once upon a time, made outstanding nose hair trimmers (most especially the Panasonic ER112).  </li>
            <li>Quickly sent and everything was well done.</li>
            <li>Does the job quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li>Heats up rather quickly.</li>
            <li>Trims hair quickly.  </li>
            <li>What else can i say ,You have  another loyal customer</li>
            <li>Much better than an older style I had.  </li>
            <li>I will say the item was received quickly and packaging was ample to keep from shipping damage.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m lucky my mom had this</li>
            <li>It came quickly.  </li>
            <li>better than most of the similar products that i had used.</li>
            <li>Item arrived quickly,  cuts without pulling.  </li>
            <li>Nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li>The older I get the more hair grew where I didn&#x27;t want it - and fell out of where I did want it.  </li>
            <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>The older I get, the more time I need to groom.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cleaning it is a piece of cake, and you can throw it in a drawer with its cover or just leave it boldly on your sink (</li>
            <li>love this product, had other trimmers but this one is great SO FAR !!  </li>
            <li>Uses only one AA battery vs Two AA&#x27;s, features LED light to see unwanted hairs, very easy to clean unlike the Panasonic version.</li>
            <li>But...when I opened the battery compartment for the first time an incredibly fowl fish odor about knocked me down.</li>
            <li>Tight tolerances, easy to clean, does a good job at getting close to the skin without dragging or pulling.</li>
            <li>This one spins very fast and runs smoothly.  </li>
            <li>Most of the stuff I have is Panasonic and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>But it is clearly very cheaply made and feels like it will last maybe a few months at best.  </li>
            <li>works very good no more hairy nostrils.</li>
            <li>This one is powerful right out of the box!</li>
            <li>It worked marginally well at best - tended to catch more than my prior trimmer, causing little bits of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very convenient and useful little device, quite happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do a great job, and it has small, easy to lose parts.</li>
            <li>If you clean it after each use, it stays pretty clean.</li>
            <li>Frankly, I don&#x27;t know the first thing about how strong nor how effective something like this is supposed to be, but this unit appears to do exactly what it is designed to do - clear the hairs from your nostrils.</li>
            <li>as it&#x27;s pretty cheap and does come with a protective cap.</li>
            <li>Also pretty compact and light.</li>
            <li>This thing is cheap and does exactly what it states, and does it well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to replace the battery a couple times, but nothing more than I would normally expect.</li>
            <li>Great product works better than product from local big box stores.</li>
            <li>Coincidentally I dropped it the very first time I was using it and had to go to wall greens and by one to finish trimming.</li>
            <li>Thankfully it was cheap in the first place.</li>
            <li>Much more effective than some other products on the market.</li>
            <li>Also, the tip gets very hot after just a minute or two of use.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, it simply works great on both my nose-hair and ear hair, which, at my age, are a constant issue.</li>
            <li>After using it for several months I can say that I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It is easy to turn a bezel around the top to open a slot to run water through and clean it.  </li>
            <li>Comparing this trimmer to the other three I&#x27;ve owned I would say this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The very first thing I did when I received this trimmer and installed the battery</li>
            <li>When it works its barely functional and isnt effective.</li>
            <li>I sent my original product back to Panasonic (at my own expense) for a warranty replacement.</li>
            <li>Quiet and easy to clean, love it.</li>
            <li>This works well and is cheap, however the blade assembly is pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reassemble, enjoy ;)</li>
            <li>First surprise was frustration free packaging.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much !</li>
            <li>No complaint and satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>No weird whirling/grinding sound</li>
            <li>Fantastic products dies exactly what it says..</li>
            <li>Overall I am very pleased with the trimming ability and wet/dry aspects of this product.  </li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this purchase, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>Being easy to clean is also a big plus. :)</li>
            <li>Does as it is advertised, we are very satisfied with this total purchase.</li>
            <li>The water cleaning system in this is fantastic and works exactly as it should.  </li>
            <li>the first was a no name cheap one from TJ Max which broke in 4 months.</li>
            <li>I enjoy this trimmer so much that I bought one to gift away to someone else!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, light, made well, and most important works</li>
            <li>He said he had 3 other trimmers and this one, by far, is the best.  </li>
            <li>My husband and I have had other manufacturer models of hair trimmers, and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li>It was nice to finally find a good trimmer at a low price.</li>
            <li>If it lasts as long as &amp;quot;Old Yeller&amp;quot; then it will really be a good deal.</li>
            <li>Good product, battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer that works really well, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The rinse through feature is fantastic &amp; really works to clean it out after use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Great at trimming down nasal shame.  </li>
            <li>It appears to be decently built and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>A nice clean quiet cutter.  </li>
            <li>Broke down after just 1 month, but worked great while it lasted.</li>
            <li>It worked great at the start, but is showing signs of slowing down.  </li>
            <li>So far, it has a decent motor and does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just isn&#x27;t as good as the older model I have, its about 10 years old or so.</li>
            <li>but otherwise it is a great buy for all other people and it won&#x27;t hurt when you are trimming (in case any one had any doubts)!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure most people are familiar with the cheap, $5 or less nose hair trimmers that fall apart and rip the hairs out.  </li>
            <li>It can be washed with water with a special switch right below the blade.</li>
            <li>Love it ,is it really nice , small, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and is really high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended, practical and easy to use, also is also to clean, this article need to be presentable to us.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good to go for a long time!</li>
            <li>But for the price I am going to live with it, just wish it had some more strength.</li>
            <li>This is my new favorite trimmer.  </li>
            <li>ahead and paid 3-4 dollars to ship it to Panasonic, figured I might as well since a new one of any brand would cost more than that</li>
            <li>I tried a new battery and also 2 more still doesn&#x27;t work</li>

            <li>The product has a great feel for Quality and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like some of the ones I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>This ergonomic model performed well on nose and ear hair (not so great for eyebrow trimming &amp; sculpting) for the first 5 months - before it jammed.</li>

            <li>works great for nose hairs and ear hairs, doesn&#x27;t pull like previous one I had by another manufacturer</li>
            <li>Typical Panasonic product; works great</li>
            <li>I feel really old having to say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this nose and ear hair trimmer, but it isn&#x27;t my first of this kind of grooming tool</li>

            <li>My husband finds it easy to use, and it really clips away all the unwanted hairs without pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li>Clean, need, fast, good battery life, solid construction.</li>

            <li>Very well pleased with the trimmer, it does exactly what I purchased it for.</li>
            <li>it only &amp;#34;yanked&amp;#34; on me once out of maybe 20 times that I&#x27;ve used it (pretty good if you ask me).</li>

            <li>Good product - use it regularly - does exactly what it is supposed</li>
            <li>When first using it, I was very scared it would pull the hair or scrape the skin (looking at the top, it seems like it would).  </li>
            <li>I really like the Panasonic ER-GN30 because it is an easy and efficient product.</li>
            <li>A very compact and easy to use product.</li>
            <li>As long as you keep fresh batteries in it your good.  </li>
            <li>this works like a charm and is fast and easy to boot</li>
            <li>This is the first time, after many thousands of dollars of purchases, that I really feel that I got ripped off.  </li>
            <li>The battery last a long time, and the price is perfect.  </li>
            <li>It is very lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it comes apart for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li>The battery I put in (uses 1 AA battery) has lasted the whole time and it seems like it&#x27;s going strong</li>
            <li>Fast and easy.</li>
            <li>This trimmer runs for a long time on the battery, trims close, is comfortable to use, and has a nice clean-out feature.  </li>
            <li>I am pretty happy the way I am able to get those long hairs that seem to come more and more with age in places hard to manage otherwise.</li>
            <li>And it really does cut and clean out nose and ear hair very fast and easy.</li>
            <li>but more power would be nice chop it down</li>
            <li>This trimmer is easy to use, tackles those hard to reach/hard to trim hairs and does the job for a great price.</li>

            <li>Hot damb!  </li>
            <li>Bought it for my husband &amp; he really likes it!!</li>
            <li>I owned 4 to 5 cheap nose hair trimmers in the past, Panasonic ER-GN30-K is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Before that, it sported a weak motor even with an excellent battery.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!!  </li>
            <li>It works exactly as described!</li>
            <li>Whats more remarkable than the very short 6 week life span is that I only used this thing about 4 times.  </li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason in the first place!  </li>
            <li>As described in other reviews ... sturdy build, painless &amp; effective!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bigger unit, sure, but am looking forward to another 15 years of service with this one!</li>
            <li>Jesus, this thing gets hot!</li>
            <li>Pretty straightforward - it does what it needs to do and does it well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended !!!</li>
            <li>When I first used this, I clenched my teeth expecting the familiar feel of yanking nose hairs out, but felt almost nothing.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason in the first place!</li>
            <li>I think the size is great because it is small enough that it would be good to travel with.</li>
            <li>exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Every man should own one of these and for the price I paid everyone has no excuse not to have one.</li>
            <li>This does exactly what it says it does!</li>
            <li>So much easier and safer than using scissors, a razor or tweezers - and NO pain!!</li>
            <li>I want to give it 4.5 but not quite 5 since I find the power a bit weak, perfect for me</li>
            <li>Most guys are not excessive &amp;#34;groomers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>and then it starts feeling hot!  </li>
            <li>First time i buy a panasonic article and doesn t fill my expectations!</li>
            <li>The washable nature is an excellent idea and keeps it clean as long as you allow it to dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Though, I recommend that the batteries be changed out consistently, because if not, it&#x27;ll get ya!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>This REALLY does the trick!!</li>
            <li>its great have had 1 before but quit working in short time even with new battery hope</li>
            <li>My new Panasonic nose and facial hair trimmer works great.  </li>

            <li>I have tried three different trimmers, and this one gets the job done quickly and effectively.  </li>
            <li>I needed something cheap and easy to use to help clear out my nose</li>
            <li>Thus far, it works  fine!</li>
            <li>Its very easy to clean, simply requiring you turn the head to the water setting, and stick it under the faucet.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also quiet and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It is very comfortable to handle and so far it does not pull the hairs.</li>

            <li>But, it works fine, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li>Easy to operate, easy to clean, and totally painless.</li>
            <li>This product has been engineered to make it perfect for what it is to be used for, quiet, heavy duty, grip makes it easy to handle</li>

            <li>This trimmer really works, quickly and painlessly!</li>
            <li>Cuts pretty well and is easier to clean than others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>so you can clean it out with hot water if you unearth burried treasures.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the quick shipping!</li>
            <li>It is better than the most expensive ones I have bought and does not pull which is extremely pleasant.</li>
            <li>Ah, the joys of becoming older, hair starts showing up in places that it never was a problem before, and this solves it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer really works, quickly and painlessly!  </li>
            <li>at a low price, it is reasonable effective in solving problems that aren&#x27;t easy</li>

            <li>and wow, how much easier and more efficient this is!  </li>
            <li>My barber made some light hearted cracks about how men when reaching a certain age just start sprouting the uglies.</li>
            <li>Great design, ease of use and ability to keep clean and extremely quiet without the hair pulls or snags I&#x27;ve experienced with other similar products.</li>
            <li>Worked great right out of the box but with way less than a year&#x27;s use it doesn&#x27;t cut.</li>

            <li>Great device, but after only about 20 uses, the top came loose and rattles when I use the thing, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to trim as well anymore.</li>
            <li>but ours is working fine since last so many</li>
            <li>You can also clean it under running water and I find that great for washing out small hairs.</li>
            <li>Unit is very quiet, nicely angled, amply powered, easy to maneuver, easy to clean, and runs on one standard AA battery.</li>
            <li>I got each new - they were very effective, never pinching, relatively quiet, functioning quite well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>

            <li>First time buyer of this type of trimmer and got it on special 9$.  </li>
            <li>It is firm in the hand; very good build quality and just a very well thought out product.</li>
            <li>Finally, the Norelco got to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and happily replaced it with this nice little unit from Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice little feature is the wash feature which allows you to clean easily.</li>

            <li>Its much quieter then my cheap junk conair trimmer.</li>
            <li>The low price is amazing.</li>
            <li>it worked great at beginning but went off after a few times of using.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t complain too much as it was cheap.</li>
            <li>It is compact, light weight, and very well-built.  </li>
            <li>Great product, assuming it doesn&#x27;t break in a few months.</li>

            <li>You feel great, and well  groomed, in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>I tried a cheaper Panasonic nose hair trimmer, the one with the light on it, and it worked very well but died after 2 months.</li>
            <li>THIS ONE SEEMS VERY SUBSTANTIAL AND NOT LIKE CHEAP PLASTIC.</li>
            <li>Fits my hand well, is relatively quiet and is amazingly efficient at what it is suppsoed to do .. cut hair in places you don&#x27;t want to be weilding scissors.</li>
            <li>It is cheap and I was very disapointed.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is by far the best one I have purchased, and I have been through a few.</li>
            <li>comfortable to use, easy to clean- too soon to tell relaibility, but seems made well enough</li>
            <li>I primarily use this for my nose and it has worked really well.</li>
            <li>This really was a fantastic buy.  </li>
            <li>Simplicity in design with few moving parts make this a great product.</li>
            <li>Unless you enjoy a trimmer that tugs and pulls instead of gently clipping out your gnarly nose, eyebrow, and ear hair, I would stay away.  </li>
            <li>Very efficient and light.....</li>
            <li>Its cheap and works very well and is well built</li>
            <li>But took out 1 star because it doesn&#x27;t perform its primary function of trimming very well.</li>
            <li>Great for fighting back any signs of old age.</li>
            <li>Nice personal groomer to have</li>
            <li>I tried two fresh batteries, nothing.</li>
            <li>Also, it would be nice if they had different settings for the razor, but there is just the one on/off switch.</li>
            <li>Much better than the old one I had.  </li>
            <li>Was not a battery problem as I tried fresh batteries.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s extraordinarily quiet and cuts effectively.  </li>
            <li>Worth the $$.</li>
            <li>well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll have to make the call yourself if the pain is worth it.</li>
            <li>East to use and powerful.</li>
            <li>it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Thank You Golden Bird</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and effectively does its job.  </li>
            <li>Today it is making a humming noise, but not cutting any hairs.</li>
            <li>Just pop in a freshly charged NiMH rechargeable and I&#x27;m off and trimming again.</li>
            <li>More money in their pockets if you have to replace it frequently.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a few trimmers and this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li>No snagging and a close cut make it worth buying.</li>
            <li>From various rotary or micro trimmers this blade design seems to catch every hair without catching any skin.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.</li>
            <li>The dual-edge blade really is better than the old blades.</li>
            <li>The cleaning drain is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li>I would keep looking, this one does not seem to be worth it unless you want a lot of frustration.</li>
            <li>Inexpensive and worth the money.</li>
            <li>Really useful tool.</li>
            <li>This unit has a nice amount of power and is great for trimming off nose hairs that might be difficult to reach and remove.     </li>
            <li>Way better than my old method of using the Swiss army knife&#x27;s scissor to trim my nose hair.</li>
            <li>I decided to try a different kind Philips Norelco NT9110 Nose and Ear Trimmer.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an awesome trimmer, and I really can&#x27;t find any negative things to say about it.  </li>
            <li>And for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t mind a good cry or sneeze or two, I needed something modern, something hygienic, and something that would keep me from plucking my nose hairs in public.</li>
            <li>So if you think $15 bucks is worth 2 years, then go for it</li>
            <li>Boy, getting old sure does suck...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so useful</li>
            <li>Works so well that I bought this latest one for my 13yr old son.</li>
            <li>I replaced it with this one and it is a nose of fresh air.</li>
            <li>After having owned a few of these, I can say that this is by far the best trimmer I have used.  </li>
            <li>My old one was in use more then 3 years without any problem until I accidentally dropped it.</li>
            <li>The trimming is quite good, and I really like the ease of disassembly for simple cleaning.</li>
            <li>All in all, it&#x27;s well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/03/2013:</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a considerable amount of time, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I want to reduce one star even though it is useful.</li>
            <li>I use this tool more often to complete my shave than I use it to trim nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>this product is worth about .50 cents.   </li>
            <li>It was worth ever penny and in case you didn&#x27;t notice it has a 2 year guarantee.</li>
            <li>I have used several brands before and they have ever not been too effective or just quit running.</li>
            <li>Just worth the price.</li>
            <li>This groomer is way under-powered, even with fresh batteries.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money</li>
            <li>but this is far better quality and does a far better job.</li>
            <li>So far OK.</li>
            <li>It was pulling and pulling the hair and not cutting it.  </li>
            <li>Not any better tnen the old one I replaced.</li>
            <li>It works better than my old one</li>
            <li>With a fresh battery, it worked well.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have tried a number of electronic and old school scissor methods to trim hair and more sensitve skin areas.  </li>
            <li>Those areas are more sensitive and take it from someone that takes blood thinners, you do not want to cut yourself there.  </li>
            <li>he said this is what he needs and really useful to him.</li>
            <li>and it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of gross to think about, but my ears and nose have never been cleaner.</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, I threw out my old one.  </li>
            <li>wish there was a powerful model.</li>
            <li>but this one does do a far better job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d own such a product.  </li>
            <li>But, alas, when I looked into my nostril, nicely trimmed nose hairs!!!  </li>
            <li>My old one had seen better days.</li>
            <li>- So, all in all, a success.  </li>
            <li>When this has happened, i have coaxed more life out of them by (carefully) striking against my palm (or harder surface, damn it) with the unit ON, which seems to shake away the glitch for awhile, months even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not enough power to be totally effective.</li>
            <li>100% satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>excellent, all as expected, no complaints, overall satisfaction</li>
            <li>powerful and doesnt pull the hair.</li>
            <li>Powerful and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>Clean cutting, easy to use, easy to clean; great unit.  </li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>This one is a lot better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Overall the tool is nice.</li>
            <li>Will probably purchase another though now that I know its useful life expectancy and cost per use is about $0.50 per month.</li>
            <li>This is a great nose hair trimmer (I have only used it for that so far).  </li>
            <li>This one is so nice that I would not go back to the cheaper model.</li>
            <li>Still, we liked it enough to buy another.</li>
            <li>This groomer is a powerful accessory to any mans trimming options.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>and it went downhill from there to the point that I rarely used it anymore.</li>
            <li>I like this a lot more than my old trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is also insanely easy to clean and is about as loud as a whisper.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth the money.</li>
            <li>WORTH EVERY PENNY</li>
            <li>It does as good as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li>it is worth for this prize</li>
            <li>Not to mention it is fun to play around with friends who exit my bathroom asking me &amp;#</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it to see the puzzled expression in their eyes.</li>
            <li>simple but effective design: All you need is an AA battery , no cords, no adapters are needed...</li>
            <li>It is powerful and well made.</li>
            <li>The blades are close enough to the foil to get the hairs nice and short without catching the skin inside your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>SO far I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>No problems so far after many months of use.</li>
            <li>As much as I liked how that one simplified mustache gardening, it left my nose tender, inflamed, and unacceptably hairy.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li>It is powerful, and does not tug the hair.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the risk, but that&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li>That alone is makes it worth twice the price.</li>
            <li>I have used Remington trimmer before and this one by far is the better of the two.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic warranty claim isn&#x27;t the best since they expect the broken unit to be mailed at our cost to them for them to honor their warranty.</li>
            <li>Clips a lot more hair than my old unit.</li>
            <li>Well worth it.</li>
            <li>No pulling hair and is nice and quiet.</li>
            <li>Nice nose, ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer.</li>
            <li>of this was when I got the trimmer fresh out of the box too.</li>
            <li>Not as good as I expected</li>
            <li>It looks like it doesn&#x27;t turn on anymore, and there is no motor noise even with a fresh battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and that is well built, durable, and not the kind of junk they sell at dollar stores, marshalls, or tjmaxxs for the same price.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Powerful motor, and</li>
            <li>Well worth the $$$ to keep the nasal jungle under control.</li>
            <li>The power would not stay on, even with a fresh alkaline battery, as if the battery wasn&#x27;t connecting with the unit.</li>
            <li>, it is light height and works better than the last Panasonic I had.</li>
            <li>At this cost worth the buy</li>
            <li>This trimmer is worth every cent.</li>
            <li>My old &amp;#34;Harbor-Freight&amp;#34; nose hair razor worked better than this one...</li>
            <li>Not that powerful</li>
            <li>Not as powerful as I had wanted</li>
            <li>but what people don&#x27;t realize that with years China manufacturing got a lot better and today you can find same product in low quality and good quality.</li>
            <li>Not really fast, you need to pass a lot of time at the same place for have the best cut...</li>
            <li>End cap protects the trimming components, which is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;- Solid build.  </li>
            <li>This works as expected, good value for the money.</li>
            <li>Cleans up nicely and simple to disassemble.  </li>
            <li>You could say this product wins by a nose.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipment.</li>
            <li>These are handy for properly cleaning and maintaining the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has 2 speed settings and effectively manages hair in the nose, ears but can also be used on facial hair and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I give it my highest recommendation as it&#x27;s been worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Safety alone makes it worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li>Does a lot better than my old one.</li>
            <li>Worth it.</li>
            <li>You grow old and hairs pop out more often and in stranger places.</li>
            <li>I had this one for over 6 months and so far I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>It is powerful and cuts close to the skin without ever nicking.</li>
            <li>Even with all the good things to say, I don&#x27;t think I would take it in the shower and use the wet setting.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s useful life.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>Mine worked great for about six months, and then it got really loud and stopped functioning properly.</li>
            <li>this just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li>Currently, I am sporting the popular Spring 2015</li>
            <li>The round cutter on the end of the tip is much more effective than the design that uses a linear set of cutters along the side of the tip.</li>
            <li>I put fresh batteries in it and it still sometimes doesn&#x27;t want to work.</li>
            <li>Yes, and I did put a fresh battery in it, hoping that would do the trick&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful and versatile.</li>
            <li>Cuts my nose hairs nicely, and it only takes one battery and it lasts a while!</li>
            <li>If it lasts a year, it will be worth what I paid.</li>
            <li>my husband has gone through dozens of trimmers and this is by far his favorite</li>
            <li>Runs off batteries, which rarely need changing.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I THOUGHT THE BATTERY MIGHT BE OLD, PURCHASED MORE</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Thanks for such good service/</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean. - gets in all those nooks and crannies a must for those with hair in unwanted places (the mature)</li>
            <li>Yes, kind of a personal item, but needed.  </li>
            <li>Very simple and effective.</li>
            <li>Silent and effective.</li>
            <li>So far I love it.</li>
            <li>I changed to fresh batteries, but nothing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t eat through batteries like my old trimmers.</li>
            <li>Keep a fresh battery on hand.</li>
            <li>Useful and works as specified.  </li>
            <li>Far superior to the old school trimmer that it replaced.</li>
            <li>Not even worth the hassle and money to check the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>It is powerful, it does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li>Very quiet and works quite nicely.</li>
            <li>This is so much better than my old name brand trimmer, no comparison.</li>
            <li>A rare instance where you don&#x27;t get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>but well worth it.</li>
            <li>My old one landed in the trash can after I realized how much better this one was.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re quiet and cut nicely.  </li>
            <li>Worth the money.  </li>
            <li>only drawback is that my husband refuses to trim his own hairs, so I have to do it, and he squirms and hates it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely some kind of defect in my device.  </li>
            <li>Powerful...</li>
            <li>Having used various nose &amp; ear trimers over the years with marginal success, it&#x27;s nice to see that the ER-GN30-K trimmer hit the bulls eye in performance and value.</li>
            <li>My shorter friends tell me that they appreciate my freshly maintained nostrils.</li>
            <li>Quiet, effective, does not pull.</li>
            <li>Good and ergonomic, Gives close cut and can be operated wet and also washed with water.</li>
            <li>Simple and effective.  </li>
            <li>It works great and is much quieter than I expected.  </li>
            <li>and I like this on far better.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li>It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Much better than the old one I had.</li>
            <li>totally worth 12.50$.</li>
            <li>it is nice trimmer and let&#x27;s me remove hairs from my ears without any bleeding like when i do it with my gilettes back blade on the cartridge.</li>
            <li>* Burns through batteries: After 2 uses, a fresh battery had no juice left.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a nice touch that you can open up a port to help water flow through and rinse this out.</li>
            <li>I bought one of these for my boyfriend and one for his father for Christmas and not only is it well worth the money, it&#x27;s very well made and good quality.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace an old Wahl unit and this one does a lot better of a job.</li>
            <li>internal seems to emit some kind of foul smell (smells like something rotten to be</li>
            <li>Remarkably effective as well as very quiet product.  </li>
            <li>It literally made me laugh when I did my nose</li>
            <li>it is the best option, till it falls and breaks because it&#x27;s made of thin plastic and once it&#x27;s broke.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li>it is advertised with multiple uses but lets be honest and call that a bit of a stretch.</li>
            <li>Works OK but is too loud when in operation.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s powerful.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li>so you really have to move it around from different angles in order to do a good job.</li>
            <li>This is an extremely useful product.</li>
            <li>Breathing freshly and no longer showing my nose friends.</li>
            <li>My husband reports that he &amp;#34;loves it!&amp;#34; and says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;so much better than his old one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Its powerful and trims without snagging a hair.</li>
            <li>Works but not as powerful as I would like.</li>
            <li>For the price, this was totally worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>so don&#x27;t have any expectation that the two year warranty is worth anything.</li>
            <li>Easily worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li>The rinse feature is nice but it takes reading the directions to understand how to use it properly.</li>
            <li>A thousand times better than the junky ones at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;For old folks who are growing hair everywhere</li>
            <li>worth the $$$</li>
            <li>I especially like how it stands tall on its own.  </li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Useful, inexpensive, should have bought one sooner.</li>
            <li>Not that useful</li>
            <li>Fun to play with it on hubbys ears and nose hairs.</li>
            <li>A simple yet effective tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I expect that if it goes 1.5 to 2 years, I&#x27;ll have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>This razor works well for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Purchased as a replacement and find this works better than the old trimmer.</li>
            <li>I decided to finally get a trimmer when an ear hair spouted out and made me contemplate my own mortality.  </li>
            <li>but so far its okay</li>
            <li>This trimmer works much better than my old one</li>
            <li>Lasted me 9 months but now won&#x27;t turn on, even with a fresh battery.</li>
            <li>its not painful at all no pulling very portable!</li>
            <li>I have used it for a couple of times and I&#x27;m complete satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and clips nicely.</li>
            <li>Works as described, worth the price.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The device for only $10ish is a good investment to get rid of nose hairs, however this does get fairly hot in the first  90 seconds</li>
            <li>A lot more acoustically pleasing -- not so loud..</li>
            <li>no complains so far :)</li>
            <li>Clipper is much better than my old one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clipper is much better than my old one.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Clipper is much better than my old one.</li>
            <li>I bought this nose hair trimmer because I wanted a well made product that will last and this seems to be very sturdy and does a good job at trimming.</li>
            <li>Works much better than my old trimmer.</li>
            <li>This handy device takes care of a very personal matter.  </li>
            <li>Better than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Have fun..</li>
            <li>Worth the buy.</li>
            <li>My husband says it works better then his old one.</li>
            <li>For such a cheap items shipping would be more than it is worth.</li>
            <li>And once one starts, I SWEAR that others join in the fun.  </li>
            <li>...curiosity finally got the best of me after a particularly long day of riding (and itching), so I went to all kinds of sites to read up on resolving this....and the Panasonic consistently was the recommendation.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic is far better.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic has a very high velocity of blade spin making a pulled hair very rare.</li>
            <li>So far, so good - LOVING it compared to my previous one!</li>
            <li>It is simple to use, easy to clean and it works!</li>
            <li>The trimmer is light weight, small, and accurate which is what i wanted, plus it&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to take apart.</li>
            <li>The unit, itself is extremely quiet and really easy to clean!  </li>
            <li>As others have stated, its quiet, easy to use and to clean, &amp; doesn&#x27;t pinch!</li>
            <li>Could be a little more compact, but other than that, functions perfectly.</li>
            <li>A strong brand name (Panasonic) with a high reputation of quality items.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This style works much better than some of the new trimmers I have tried in the past, the Panasonic is still working great</li>
            <li>Very handy little device.</li>
            <li>Would have been better if it has a light like other similar products but overall it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li>Fourth, it runs smooth, cleans easily, and looks tres cool.  </li>
            <li>It is efficient and affective and easy to use and feels more stout in the hand than most trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>very powerful but gentle...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful and the battery is holding up very well</li>
            <li>It is very powerful and seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li>I bought it purely based on reviews and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Hard to get excited about a nose hair teimmer but works great.</li>
            <li>The instructions were easy to follow, although it&#x27;s use is pretty straight forward.  </li>
            <li>Product works very well; Quick and easy with no pulling or tearing; Lightweight and easy to clean; Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li>came with batteries, very easy to use, does the job and is little and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Trims nose hairs just right, is easy to clean (as long as you do it with each use) and is easy to charge and use.</li>
            <li>Works great for nose hair and very slight beard trimming.</li>
            <li>Its a great simple product, and simple to clean too.</li>
            <li>does a great job its fast and sharp</li>
            <li>Other brands may or may not be better, but these can cost a lot more $$$.</li>
            <li>I only clean it every two weeks, and it&#x27;s relatively easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li>Ok, more like a sharp pain and a realization to throw the battery</li>
            <li>Seems to burn through the battery pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li>GETS HOT QUICKLY.</li>
            <li>thing about cleaning is the way they want you to clean it using running water really isn&#x27;t the best and leaves alot of hair behind inside the chamber.</li>
            <li>Gets hot a bit too quick imo.</li>
            <li>I got the item quickly and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>but I get used to it pretty quick</li>
            <li>My son stole my first one, so I quickly ordered another one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty lightweight, so I&#x27;m not expecting it to outlive me, but the battery seems to hold a charge, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do quickly</li>
            <li>First, it consumed power too quickly.</li>
            <li>Trimming nose hair is pretty quick.</li>
            <li>Does the job, but gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li>heats up pretty quickly</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>This one chews through a batter pretty quick.</li>
            <li>have been using for a few weeks now and it is very nice and virtually painless.</li>
            <li>Worked good at first, but then the tip made a noise, and now just makes a loud grinding sound and gets hot/doesn&#x27;t actually trim.</li>
            <li>I still use it since it works and don&#x27;t care enough to buy a new one, but to be honest I would pay more for a better product in the future.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is able to get deep up in my schnoz and clean the edges well.</li>
            <li>The cutters are to far off the surface of the skin to allow a clean smooth cut.</li>
            <li>used it the next day also, to clean up a lil bit more he had missed.</li>
            <li>The head comes off easily for cleaning and is easy to put back together.</li>
            <li>When you are able to discern from the manual how to remove the outer blade (which contains the inner blade) use the supplied cleaning brush to clean both off;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fact you can run it under the faucet to clean without taking it completely apart is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li>Overall, it seems like a decent trimmer at a good price.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed the trimmer as stated by instructions and was pleasantly mortified by all the hair that washed down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>A really fine product, high quality, cuts well, but mine will not start unless I take off the end cover ant twist the battery.....</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean and dry.</li>
            <li>Works other wise.</li>
            <li>(it didn&#x27;t trim very well, and tended to \\&quot;pull out\\&quot; hairs; why Panasonic ever decided to discontinue the original trimmer is beyond me).</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try any other trimmers just because i find these ones good.</li>
            <li>This prodcut is not as good for me as the reviews indicate it is for other reviewers.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do much other than look good on your counter.</li>
            <li>And very helpful and useful!</li>
            <li>So far it has been pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li>He had bought 2 other brands and neither did a good job of trimming.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is more sturdy and higher quality than my old Andis trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful.</li>
            <li>BTW, the batteries were still good as I put them in other devices.  </li>
            <li>the other features of this trimmer make it a good buy.</li>
            <li>, it makes it seem as though trimming other hairs would be good.  </li>
            <li>After 6 months of use, they&#x27;re doing a good job, and he hasn&#x27;t had any issues with them, other than to replace the battery.</li>
            <li>I have used other brands with good results but if i were to buy a nose trimmer again for any reason, i would buy this.</li>
            <li>price was fair , combo with other product for lower ship cost .</li>
            <li>I found out that this one works as good as the other one.  </li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t come with some of the attachments other trimmers do, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good trimmer for unattractive hair in the nose</li>
            <li>Cuts clean with no pulling and no skin abrasion  and rinses clean with a little warm water after each use.</li>
            <li>Been having chest pains and ma right arms hurts.  </li>
            <li>and I made the right choice.</li>
            <li>It couldn&#x27;t have been from over-use because right after I purchases it, I bought a ladies one for myself to use.</li>
            <li>Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave right to the skin but for the hairs you are trimming you don&#x27;t notice at all.  </li>
            <li>BUT, with the GN30, Panasonic got it right.  </li>
            <li>You just have to get the right angle for each application.</li>
            <li>I was right on all three counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does the job right...</li>
            <li>right and arrived in two days.</li>
            <li>Put the battery in (battery not included), and this one fired right up.  </li>
            <li>and I took a chance on this one after reading the reviews and when the price was right ($14.99).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for awhile now; it works well and the price was right.  </li>
            <li>Works well ,priced right.</li>
            <li>Panasonic got this one right</li>
            <li>I guess that they were just waiting for the right time to pop out and greet the world.  </li>
            <li>When I got the trimmer I tried out right away.</li>
            <li>It was a snap right out of the box, and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li>but it was hurting me and not working that right.  </li>
            <li>When it arrived we took it right out and set it up</li>
            <li>Price is right.  </li>
            <li>This product is right on target, has the twist head wash out.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Panasonic and it came right away.  </li>
            <li>Heard right.  </li>
            <li>Took a chance and ordered two because the price was right.  </li>
            <li>The hair has to be RIGHT on in order for it to be cut.</li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>After receiving the Panasonic, I used it right away.  </li>
            <li>Who in their right mind is reviewing nose hair trimmers these days anyway</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, the price is in the right range and</li>
            <li>The unit was inoperable right out of the packaging.</li>
            <li>and it goes right through them.</li>
            <li>The price was good, it runs on a single double A battery, and appears to be easy to clean.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great for ear, nose and that spot right between your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shakespeare was right.</li>
            <li>The price is right so there</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>The unicorn hair that grows right between my husband&#x27;s brows?  </li>
            <li>Have to hold it exactly right</li>
            <li>right.  </li>
            <li>Tapping it at the right angle and adjusting the battery seemed to help for a while</li>
            <li>and this is no hair in my nose right now.</li>
            <li>, i tryed it right away</li>
            <li>It kicks my nose right in the butt, eliminating nostril-vines like a machete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The price is right too.</li>
            <li>Right away, it chopped off hair in my nose and ears that had escaped my Conair for years.  </li>
            <li>The price is right and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li>* right here gets all my nose hairs and it works on eye brows too</li>
            <li>Pros: it cuts well, and that&#x27;s what you want right?    </li>
            <li>and it was priced just right.</li>
            <li>I remember right</li>
            <li>Would give 5 stars, but after a year they seem to just break- which is right out of the warranty time zone.</li>
            <li>Received the item on time but did not work right out of the box.</li>
            <li>The price was right.  </li>
            <li>Just about right for the price</li>
            <li>Price is right for what it does.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex is just the right one to consider.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a GREAT trimmer (quiet, fast, accurate, sharp and cleans up easily) - until it SLIPS from your hand onto tile bathroom floor while you&#x27;re taking off the protective cap.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a shame because it performed great the first few times, but</li>
            <li>Worked great for first few months and then stopped running.</li>
            <li>am very happy so far with it, it takes no more than 2 minutes to remove every unwanted hair from my nose or ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked great for the first few times.  </li>
            <li>Had two in the past, but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>Decently well-built for the cheap cost to me.</li>
            <li>Much easier to clean.</li>
            <li>The product do the job, I like the fact that you can clean it with water, very portable and lightweight.</li>
            <li>I had one like it many years ago and could not find one exactly like my old one until I found on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It will not remove your hair clean, but it trims very well.</li>
            <li>I had another shaver that did ok, but when I first used this on my nose hairs, I realizied what a piece of junk my old one was.  </li>
            <li>My older one had a led light but that is a feature I didn&#x27;t need or use.  </li>
            <li>It would have been nice to have an LED light on the end to see progress in the dark places.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and pain free if you go nice and slow.  </li>
            <li>It cleaned VERY well with the &#x27;turbo&#x27; clean feature.</li>
            <li>FAST BLADE CUTS CLEANLY AND THOROUGHLY.</li>
            <li>really convenient and make my hair clean.</li>
            <li>Or installing a bigger foam cone filter on a restrictive factory air intake on an e36 BMW M3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean fresh,  feeling of being able to feet a few more cubic feet of air per minute through the nose is worth more than the price of admission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>anything that can cut you that easy, can&#x27;t get more than 1 star, although it does work very well when it&#x27;s not slicing me open.</li>
            <li>It easy to handle, it rinses and cleans easily, and you can get it as wet as you want when you use or clean it.  </li>
            <li>On first use it&#x27;s really nice, quiet and it works.</li>
            <li>After reading a number of reviews about this trimmer, I was expecting a cheap, but decent product</li>
            <li>guess if you want something cheap and works decently for your nose hairs, this does the job.  </li>
            <li>Pretty quiet and effective.  </li>
            <li>When you do clean it, the running water make it very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this is the first nose hair trimmer that has actually worked well.</li>
            <li>Very nice...durable...easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried to clean it yet, but works very well.</li>
            <li>This bugger is fast, cuts clean with no pulling.  </li>
            <li>Would be nice if there was an easy demarcation letting you know how far to place the blade back in.  </li>
            <li>This thing doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, it cuts fast and clean.</li>
            <li>Has a nice solid feel and it trims very well!  </li>
            <li>Far more superior than my previous one, would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>Great little product!</li>
            <li>For the price I think this is a great little trimmer!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is a great little trimmer!</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer for the price!</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer!</li>
            <li>Great little gizmo for problems we don&#x27;t like to tallk about!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is much gentler on the inside of my nose than my last one and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and runs on only one AA battery.</li>
            <li>I think it is enough for you using is very easy and also cleaning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also very easy to keep which is a big plus</li>
            <li>This Panasonic trimmer cuts very easily and very short.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is very easy to use, but does include an instruction manual if you prefer specific details.  </li>
            <li>I finally broke down and decided to get this Panasonic and it works great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light weight but made of high quality product.</li>
            <li>The design looks good and quality feels better compared  to previous trimmers, yet it still made in China and has feature that allows rinsing with soap and water which is neat as I don&#x27;t have to disassemble and clean occasionally</li>
            <li>It does its job quick easy to handle not heavy first time having one</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s painless, trims nose hair closely &amp; completely and is a dream to clean!  </li>
            <li>Good for fine / tiny hair, I suppose, but that ain&#x27;t what you&#x27;re gonna find in the tender nostrils of the Northern Outdoors Male.</li>
            <li>This new unit is for wet use also, a great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Nick</li>
            <li>Excellent little groomer ... powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li>just would have liked the item to include a battery and charged a little more instead of buying a whole package of them.</li>
            <li>Works great at getting at those odd places where hair wants to grow, but you don&#x27;t want it to be there.</li>
            <li>smooth operation, no nicking, fairly quiet, easy to wash&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer is fairly quiet, easy to handle, and pain free.</li>
            <li>Its OK Ive found better in the stores for less money</li>
            <li>Works excellent wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Washing it is easy as well as well and taking it apart to wash the blade is even easier (you can really see how much hair it picks up when the blade is exposed).</li>
            <li>Removes hair fairly well after a few quick passes.</li>
            <li>If the tip hits a hard surface, it can bend the tip and that ultimately destroys the perfect fit of the rotary blades inside.</li>
            <li>You do have be careful when taking tool apart to clean it because the blades will bend very easily.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast, easy, painless, and does such a great job on my nose hairs, that I don&#x27;t have to worry about them for a long time between trimmings.  </li>
            <li>I like that it is very easy to keep clean and hasn&#x27;t had any damage from getting wet.</li>
            <li>I find it very easy to use and clean because it can get wet.</li>
            <li>I checked the (new) batery life and was fine.</li>
            <li>It has no broken, which is surprising since every single one out there has.</li>
            <li>And they say you rarely have to change the batteries - which makes sense since most people don&#x27;t use it for more than a few seconds every couple weeks or so</li>
            <li>It trims pretty well, and it was well worth the money paid for it.</li>
            <li>Does have some \\&quot;metallicky\\&quot; smell at first, but worth it to have one that works.</li>
            <li>I have bought several nose and ear hair trimmers and this is definitely the best one so far.  </li>
            <li>It does not make much noise and trims close and true.</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t feel that I have full control and worry that i might trim off to much.  </li>
            <li>although it isn&#x27;t as slim and slick as some of the others, it definitely is a great buy.  </li>
            <li>Apparently none of these are meant to lSt more than 3 months.</li>
            <li>I have bought several different nose hair trimmers over the years, and will have to say this is the best one I have ever owned by far.</li>
            <li>but I got my money&#x27;s worth out of the first one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through several different types and brands of trimmers, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>In general, I have been pleased with the price/performance balance of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Pretty fast, pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li>Using this daily makes me a whole lot more comfortable and I look neater as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is fast, quiet, powerful and effective.</li>
            <li>Big improvement over my old Norelco, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be much better</li>
            <li>I felt no pinching or pulling of my hair in any section of my face probably because it runs on one AA battery, either way completely pleased with no regrets of this purchase recommended for all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean if you read the instruction book - you just take apart the top few pieces.  </li>
            <li>MUCH NOT BAD</li>
            <li>this is not a cheap made idem, works very good, easy to clean, can get new blades, i can not say enough.</li>
            <li>It is a pretty powerful little tool and I have been pleasantly suprised at how well it takes care of nose hair and eyebrow hair</li>
            <li>Also very light but powerful enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li>Get your old self cleaned up right now!!</li>
            <li>To be fair, this cutter works but not nearly as well as my older one.  </li>
            <li>We both break it down and give it a good cleaning after each use.  </li>
            <li>Cleans easily and is pretty quiet if that is important to you.</li>
            <li>It feels a little cheap, but it was so kind of what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s excellent for nose hair, or those tiny little hairs you always manage to miss with the razor.</li>
            <li>If I sky-dived I would be more streamlined, and I can tell you that while I was not quite at the point of my nose and ear hair interfering with my meals, I do eat a little better knowing I am not threatened by hair growing willy-nilly all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Panasonic, on the other hand, works exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li>It does, however, get pretty hot, pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a little too guarded, so it doesn&#x27;t cut as easily as our old one, but it definitely does the job at a good price!</li>
            <li>It does occasionally pull on some long hairs but is pain free for the most part and is much better than using tweezers.</li>
            <li>considering what it&#x27;s used for, and have a very heavy goatee that I shape with this, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It simple to use and knives inside very good, they cut hairs carefully.  </li>
            <li>Quite a pleasant experience using it, really, and it certainly feels firm and comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t think there is what I would call the cream of the crop in nose hair trimmers so maybe this one is better to people with more experience using other brands.  </li>
            <li>It has a very clean and strong motor in it and it is largely water/rustproof as long as you maintain it well.</li>
            <li>The unit is very easy to clean and still quite sharp.</li>
            <li>This new one is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li>but I have to lightly bang it to get it to start even with a new battery.</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I replaced an older Panasonic that lasted for many years with this new one.  </li>
            <li>So chalking that up to my own fault, and promising myself to be more careful, I went ahead and ordered another new one.</li>
            <li>Recent purchase so haven&#x27;t tested it&#x27;s durability over time, but it has demonstrated itself as having the most power to cut my strong Italian nose hairs compared to cheap ones I&#x27;ve bought over the years.  </li>
            <li>I read so many bad reviews, but the price was great!  </li>
            <li>I have had a few of these before, but this one you can clean with water, and it&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li>I really like how you can take it in the shower with you if you need to quickly trim those unsightly hairs.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s way more powerful than the last one I had.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and I like the larger barrel size for hand comfort and ease of use.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic trimmer is far superior for the same price.</li>
            <li>Every ear/ nose trimmer I have ever owned has just felt cheap (but how much technology do you need to trim the hairs out of your nose and ears, really?)</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s working strong, but I&#x27;ll update if that changes.</li>
            <li>I only gave it four stars comparing it to my mental image of what an ideal trimmer would be.</li>
            <li>Trims closely, easy to clean, quiet, no pulling.</li>
            <li>Very close, comfortable and fast trim.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as their previous models.</li>
            <li>I have had a few different brands, this is the best one.  </li>
            <li>It came super fast and he loves it.</li>
            <li>Overall its a great product that I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>This worked great until it simply died after about 3 mos of occasional use.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, uses a AA battery which seems to last forever.  </li>
            <li>Gets rid of nose and ear hair in seconds, it&#x27;s fairly quiet, and it&#x27;s easy to clean...</li>
            <li>Is quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>After trying a few different brands and models, this is the best one around.</li>
            <li>So far so good, just as described and looks the same.</li>
            <li>Not quite as good as the one I had previous to this, but serves it&#x27;s function</li>
            <li>It was great for a short while though, quiet with no hair pulling.</li>
            <li>We really like these and have ordered a second one so everyone has their own trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It seems more powerful than the earlier ones.</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate and simple to clean.</li>
            <li>Works great, although i have only tested it for a short period.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Shipping was insanely fast and got the product quickly.</li>
            <li>It actually gets all the hair in my ears and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through 4 of these, after a few months they stop working, I finally switched to another brand and have been very happy.</li>
            <li>Very silent and effective and also very confortable to use.</li>
            <li>it was quick and now all those fine hairs all over my face are gone with no rough stubble (like when using a razor, which I will never do</li>
            <li>Seems built well enough to get more than my moneys worth on a periodically used item.</li>
            <li>This is a great tool for those of us that now have unwanted hair now growing out of many wrong places.</li>
            <li>Totally painless and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>Simple to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Ok, so I&#x27;m at 32 year old guy with straight hair.  </li>
            <li>Not too loud, easy on the batteries.</li>
            <li>It did a such a great job that I may only need to use it as often as I trim my hair.&lt;br /&gt;GUYS</li>
            <li>My husband uses it quite regularly for all of its functions (ears, nose, eyebrows, etc), and it is still working great and only now in 2014 did we have to change the battery.</li>
            <li>This works very well and quickly.  </li>
            <li>I just wish more companies could make a solid product like this that lasts and is economical.</li>
            <li>Much to my dismay, \\&quot;Brand X\\&quot; just never seemed to do an adequate job.....</li>
            <li>Have only used it a handful of times but have nothing to report in regards to cons about it, and it is extremely easy to clean with whatever method you choose.</li>
            <li>Much better than my old one, inexpensive and works really well.</li>
            <li>Delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li>Just a great all around product for such a low price.</li>
            <li>I never used it for more than 20-30 seconds, always cleaned it with a brush, kept it clean and dry.  </li>
            <li>Not as good as I had hoped from the previous reviews.</li>
            <li>I bought this with the idea of having a quick and fast way of trimming my nose</li>
            <li>Easy enough to clean in spite of the rather verbose instruction sheet.</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for quick delivery.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, and simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I did not find it easy to determine how far to insert it for trimming nose hair, so caution is recommended.</li>
            <li>It works very well for nose and ear grooming, not so effective for facial hairs.</li>
            <li>I found it quiet, efficient and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Motor spins fast, does quick and efficient job.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is far superior to the tiny fingernail scissors I used to use to trim nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is relatively easy, the seal around the battery compartment has held so far, and the unit does its job.</li>
            <li>my husband liked this product so much he started using it not only for his nose hairs but for his eye brows.  </li>
            <li>easy to clean, one battery can last 6 months.  </li>
            <li>As the old joke goes, &amp;#34;I have as much hair as ever, but more of it is in my nose and ears.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and ample instructions on different cleaning procedures.</li>
            <li>batteries go in the bottom and the hatch for them is fairly strong with no breakage problems so far.  </li>
            <li>Even with a rechargeable AA battery...it spins up super fast.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Noste, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer does as described and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>So far the panasonic trimmer has been a painless and easy to use/maintain.</li>
            <li>It runs on 2 AA batteries, which are still going strong after nearly 6 months of periodic use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean, simple</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s very quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to open and clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use with clear instructions.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, effective, and gentle on even the nose hairs.</li>
            <li>It works so much better than our old one (which died), and the price was reasonable, too.  </li>
            <li>Very quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean, neat and quiet operation.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good for average size nostrils.</li>
            <li>It does the job, not a lot of noticeable difference between it and a cheaper trimmer, except the build seems solid and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>good stuff as I expected, thanks to seller</li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well and has a nice solid feel to it.</li>
            <li>great little machine, sure  beats scissors, should&#x27;ve bought it long ago</li>
            <li>The speed is high, cutting ability is excellent, and comfort is top notch.</li>
            <li>It does get quite warm during use and I turn it off to cool down if I am not finished yet.</li>
            <li>I have had this one several months and the original battery is still fine.</li>
            <li>Worked great on my first use, then I went to tap it on the sink to get the loose hairs out, and the top fell apart and the blade went down</li>
            <li>It was great for the first 3 months (only used it occasionally during that time).  </li>
            <li>Liked it so much, I got my significant other one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty quiet and easy to clean too.  </li>
            <li>first initial reaction when I had unboxed this, was this thing was light and felt cheap.  </li>
            <li>So I went back in, closer to the sides of the nostril this time, and cleaned out as many more hairs as I could bare.</li>
            <li>It works good, but its not durable I dropped and broke my first one with less than a 1ft drop.  </li>
            <li>It can run hot quickly at the stainless steel tip if you have it in the water mode and aren&#x27;t contacting water.</li>
            <li>Big beefy men with large hands may find this trimmer a bit light and small, but it works beautifully!</li>
            <li>Moreover, the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Trims very fast.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was very reasonable, too.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t consume battery very much.</li>
            <li>My husband likes this product very much.  </li>
            <li>Got it very fast.</li>
            <li>Arrived very fast and the product does work as advertised, I would purchase again...</li>
            <li>The price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li>I very much like this nose/ear hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much and I recommend this appliance.</li>
            <li>I do recommend it very much.</li>
            <li>you very much</li>
            <li>This device goes downhill very fast.</li>
            <li>I like it very much.</li>
            <li>still on the process of getting used to it and becoming more comfortable of the idea.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll probably won&#x27;t use it as often as a shaver, so the battery juice last a long time</li>
            <li>Does the job at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>After being such a skeptic, I decided to give this one a try simply for the low price and the many great reviews others have posted.</li>
            <li>The mechanism runs very smooth and quiet.  </li>
            <li>it does not spin very fast, but the blades are well made, they cut efficiently.</li>
            <li>Price was very reasonable too.</li>
            <li>These are actually very reasonable priced</li>
            <li>something like the Panasonic ER421, and it just didn&#x27;t want to spin up very fast...</li>
            <li>Very smooth and quiet.  </li>
            <li>But it doesn&#x27;t seem to turn very fast.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.</li>
            <li>So far it works as expected and is a very handy item.</li>
            <li>Very smooth and quiet operation.</li>
            <li>I have developed more nose hairs after 40 years old than I really felt comfortable</li>
            <li>Nice little trimmer, works well and gives a clean close nostril shave.</li>
            <li>Okay, so &#x27;take&#x27; off the protective shell blade covering and note that the insertable dimensions are VERY large for a regular nose...</li>
            <li>Plus, when it trims the hair, it makes a really satisfying &amp;#34;snap.&amp;#34; I like to think that this sound is putting all of the other stray hairs on notice.</li>
            <li>This thing is way better than other cheap ones.</li>
            <li>Had an old Panasonic nose trimmer which after years of fine service - gave out.</li>
            <li>Have tried multiple trimmers before but the reach and ability to get stubborn hairs that dont get caught by other trimmers is incredible.</li>
            <li>Working fine for 6 months, and so far no complaints.</li>
            <li>Product working fine so far.</li>
            <li>Much better than other cheap trimmers I have bought.  </li>
            <li>So far, this item is working just fine.</li>
            <li>The whole combination has made me really self-conscious about my face in general, especially because the hairs would show more when I smiled.</li>
            <li>then this is a fine way to clear them away.</li>
            <li>Works fine so far.</li>
            <li>trimmers are light weight plastic on the outside, I had originally thought from the image that the silver part may be made out of metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really a good product much better than my previous facial hair trimmer!</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is just because my old hair trimmer was crummy, but this one is SUPER!  </li>
            <li>I wish it were a little more powerful, but otherwise it is fine.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t figure out how this item got so many great reviews, there is nothing great about it, it takes time to remove the hair, after many attempts it still leaves hair behind, had to use scissors to trim my nose after using it because it did such a poor job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little surprising at first-then you get used to the vibrations.  </li>
            <li>It works very well-the first trimmer I&#x27;ve seen that does!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s efficient and gentle and gets the job done;) get it today!</li>
            <li>It takes a little bit of effort but does a fair job.  </li>
            <li>My husband laughed at me when I gave him this little trimmer</li>
            <li>Works well , good little trimmer for ear and nose hairs.</li>
            <li>I tried them I noticed that they seemed to warm up quickly, perhaps from being previously used by my husband.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and quick, I use it several times a week after shaving.</li>
            <li>Since the trimmer is my own, no sharing, I clean it with a few swipes of my blow dryer and a cotton swab with alcohol.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy, quiet and quick.</li>
            <li>I have had it for approximately one year, and it is still working very good.</li>
            <li>Much more effective than ear and nose trimmers I have tried in the past, including older Panasonic models.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m not good at cleaning things, so I was happy that I didn&#x27;t have to clean it very often.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER-GN30-K trims those hard to get to ear and nose hairs great.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but this is so much more effective than my older Conair.</li>
            <li>great product gets those hard to get areas</li>
            <li>For the price, this little hair trimmer does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li>Works great in hard to get to places in your nose.  </li>
            <li>Quick and safe, has never pulled a single hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Well this little guy is light, quite, and fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Not fun to clean, but it is really easy!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is super quiet and works great to trim nose, ear and other hairs that you just don&#x27;t want.  </li>
            <li>before i had to use scissors and it was hard to reach all the hairs.this trimmer is magic and easy to clean with water rinse</li>
            <li>Several of the more popular (read advertised) nose and facial hair trimmers did not receive the high marks this one did.</li>
            <li>my new panasonic cuts hairs cleanly, without \\&quot;grabbing.\\</li>
            <li>the real test is how well it&#x27;s performing in a couple of years!  </li>
            <li>Here&#x27;s hoping it holds out better than the last Remington I bought at Target!!</li>
            <li>This Panasonic trimmer is much better than a Panasonic trimmer we ordered from Amazon last year  (Model #ER430).  </li>
            <li>Who knows what I did with the first one, but I digress).  </li>
            <li>We have tried several trimmers mostly for, eh, his nose hair.  </li>
            <li>Works well, long battery life, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It eats batteries, the blades seem &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; even on first time use, etc.</li>
            <li>Exactly works as advertised</li>
            <li>The nose trim took 2 minutes and was absolutely painless!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t seem to find a logical reason why it turns on if you wiggle the battery around.</li>
            <li>Cons: Gets hot after about 20 seconds of operation.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t bring myself to rate it higher because I resent its necessity.  </li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t comment on longevity, but quite pleased with overall quality.</li>
            <li>It is not expensive and serves the purpose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used scissors from time to time, but this makes life so much easier!</li>
            <li>Thanks panasonic!</li>
            <li>Works exactly how described.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, Recommend!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what he needed.  </li>
            <li>Really efficient product!</li>
            <li>I have used this for a year now and it still works like a charm and does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li>My first nose hair trimmer had scarred me for life, because every time I tried to use it, I felt like I was being tortured.</li>
            <li>The first one stopped working after about a year.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this and the first time I went to use it</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>This hair trimmer does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>I use to have a different brand one, I believe it was Braun and this one is significantly better.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>For nose hairs,change the batteries at even the slightest hint of loss of power (a lower pitched &amp;#34;hum&amp;#34;) because if you don&#x27;t, the blade will pull, instead of cut, the hair.</li>
            <li>First class unit.</li>
            <li>Does EXACTLY what is needed.  </li>
            <li>made to last for many years of service.  </li>
            <li>This thing works okay, but for some reason it just feels and sounds fragile.</li>
            <li>This one is more solid.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Decently quiet, no snagging (important!).</li>
            <li>Like most men, I have used several nose-hair trimmers over the years.</li>
            <li>Much better than the last generation.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have an electric trimmer</li>
            <li>The difference is visible from the first time I used it upon its arrival.</li>
            <li>This is my first experience owning an electric Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through many nose hair trimmers and this one definitely is the sturdiest.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer trims safely from various angles, even head on.</li>
            <li>Instead of trying to tap or scrape out the hairs, you just open up the top and rinse everything out.  </li>
            <li>Bot were cheaply made and both broke near the blade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>if no for the performance is because if I turn it off but leave the battery on it gets hot I&#x27;dk</li>
            <li>This is a must have for any guy who wants to keep their ear, nose, and brows in check!</li>
            <li>I tried multiple batteries and was able to play with the switch and got it running again for another 10 -15 seconds</li>
            <li>Stopped working after the first time I washed it.</li>
            <li>This is the most quiet trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>I would give this trimmer more then 5 stars if it were possible to do so.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t complain don&#x27;t rush using it the first time you can get razor burn in your nose.</li>
            <li>It runs hot if used longer than a minute.  </li>
            <li>I was worried that it would pull the hair more then trim, but that&#x27;s definitely not the case.  </li>
            <li>Blades wear out, start to get hot and make a lot of noise..</li>
            <li>Had to reorder this because the first package was lost.</li>
            <li>exactly do I review this\\&quot; type of item.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i needed</li>
            <li>First time buyer.</li>
            <li>Eventual started to pull more than it would cut &amp; finally stopped working all together.</li>
            <li>Purchased a multi-tool Panasonic trimmer from Costco for 4x the price of this just to get the same functionality, thinking it&#x27;ll be better.</li>
            <li>This one gives equal or better performance without any struggle.</li>
            <li>I was first introduced to this product by my Audiologist.  </li>
            <li>It is about okay product compared to my last Panasonic product, which has more details (larger trench on the head tip)</li>
            <li>Glad I finally took the step.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anytime I come across an item that I absolutely love, I buy an extra one and stick in a box at home.</li>
            <li>Quiet, light, and thorough!  </li>
            <li>get a bit hot.</li>
            <li>Makes my wife happy that I am at least somewhat groomed.</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li>I have finally been able to get my nose hair under control.</li>
            <li>Second one worked much better.</li>
            <li>pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to stop wasting my money on those super-cheap nose hair trimmers that fall apart.</li>
            <li>This thing is sturdy, reliable and offers fantastic battery life.</li>
            <li>He said the action of the blades was smooth, the cut close, and the clean-up</li>
            <li>Works like most ten dollars trimmers</li>
            <li>Makes you sneeze the first couple of times.</li>
            <li>It doesnt pull your hair or anything and doesnt get hot.</li>
            <li>So I bought three more for the next decade.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought three of these since first time.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li>it does exactly what the product description says it will do.</li>
            <li>Was skeptical but perfect for nose</li>
            <li>It runs off batteries so be aware of when you need to change them.</li>
            <li>I gave these as a gift to a friend and at first they were offended, but then they got over it,</li>
            <li>Just used this for first time on nose.&lt;br /&gt;No pinching.  </li>
            <li>Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li>(My first one was dropped on the floor tip first and broke it)&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>Completely pain free.</li>
            <li>Prompt delivery and the product is a lot better at removing nose hair than the final touch hair remover.</li>
            <li>He has had several, but this is the first one that compares to the first one he had which was his favorite.</li>
            <li>My last trimmer was manual and it was okay, but I dropped it once</li>
            <li>My only worry was that a trimmer would yank/pull hairs out of my nose, but I am glad to say that there is no pulling, and there is no yanking of hairs.  </li>
            <li>Inexpensive, and does exactly what you need it to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for five months now (maybe used it 6-7 times) and am just about to change the batteries for the first time.  </li>
            <li>I am really satisfied with the product quality as well as overall operation.</li>
            <li>exactly what i needed for.</li>
            <li>I have a very hairy nose!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li>It gets hot some reason.</li>
            <li>It functioned correctly during the first use, but will no longer operate.</li>
            <li>It gets all ear and nose hair the first time and painlessly.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a trimmer</li>
            <li>I read the directions and configured properly, but I wasn&#x27;t able to get the product to work.  </li>
            <li>My first nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Pretty format.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any hairs in your nose or ears, and it cleans up very well!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has now been exactly 2 months since I submitted my contact information to Panasonic for warranty service.  </li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s nothing more romantic than when your partner looks longingly at you and says, &amp;#34;can I pull that nose hair?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer</li>
            <li>Stopped working after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work at first.</li>
            <li>Exactly as described.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s not expensive at all.</li>
            <li>Does the job really well!</li>
            <li>Learn how to remove the blades or replace them, I accidentally dropped this on the first day and</li>
            <li>Exactly what the marketing promised.</li>
            <li>The thing that makes this trimmer better that the rest is that it actually cuts on the end and not just on the sides.</li>
            <li>First time I use one of these and would recommend it.</li>
            <li>feel like it&#x27;s lost a bit of power / sharpness since I first bought it</li>
            <li>It trims the hairs in my nose, ears &amp; eyebrows very well!</li>
            <li>This is my first experience owning an electric nose hair trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will update that score if more use results in different information.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want it to do and trims the nose hairs well.  </li>
            <li>No pain and really works!</li>
            <li>Overall, it seems to be more efficient.  </li>
            <li>i bought two of them, and dropped one on the floor the first week.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars instead of 1 only because there seems to be nothing else on the market that works any better.</li>
            <li>I rate it better than the Sharper Image product for several reasons:  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, the battery seems to last forever, and it does a nice job of trimming all those sensitive facial areas.</li>
            <li>First Unit -</li>
            <li>Also, has a feature to use while wet, which is pretty handy for grooming and cleaning.</li>
            <li>That first one lasted me almost a year before stopping.</li>
            <li>and it performs very well!  </li>
            <li>This works much better than any similar trimmer I have tried.</li>
            <li>If somehow it dies I will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>It might be solved by higher rim or sharper blades.</li>
            <li>You should know more about what you are doing than to ask questions of persons who simply purchase goods.</li>
            <li>Matches the picture/description exactly.</li>
            <li>It makes me feel like it is really getting the job done!</li>
            <li>one side, I&#x27;m no fool) because the damn metal gets way too hot.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m not that interested in going through that $%^# again.</li>
            <li>Be sure to pick up an extra just in case</li>
            <li>When I remove the top cover and the blade, it spins well and vigorously, but as soon as I put the pieces back in place it gets stuck when I try to use it.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to keep it because it ultimately gets the job done and none of the others get better reviews, but it&#x27;s not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thank you people that create the so advanced algorithms that create search results for \\&quot;gifts for 50 year old women\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD BE THE SECOND!!!!!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li>I am glad they were still making the same one.</li>
            <li>On top of that Panasonic &#x27;guaranteed&#x27; mea &#x27;similar&#x27; item as replacement or a &#x27;refurbished&#x27; one.</li>
            <li>and this is the first one to consistently work well.</li>
            <li>first one, I made the mistake of knocking over, from the basin edge into the basin where it landed on the silver tip.</li>
            <li>if he&#x27;s willing to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still on the first battery.  </li>
            <li>device seems to clean easily and lasts a long time before needing to change batteries.</li>
            <li>Yep, that&#x27;s exactly what this product is.</li>
            <li>Will rip out hairs and gets too hot for my liking.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>The first was a Panasonic as well, but a cheaper model.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>The batteries need to be changed very often, but it&#x27;s still going!</li>
            <li>Need to work more with it to see how does it last!</li>
            <li>first nose trimmer</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure if there is better but its better than using a blade</li>
            <li>newer one by Norelco with a different design works much better.</li>
            <li>Probably should rinse this before using it otherwise it smells like oil/lubrication during first use.</li>
            <li>(&amp;#34;Follicles&amp;#34; is surely one of the ickier words in the English language!)</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I have tried several units and most just don&#x27;t perform that well.  </li>
            <li>Over the years I have gone through a lot of trimmers, they typically don&#x27;t last too many years.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I just twist open the top and rinse out the blades that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Stopped working the first time I used it - changed battery - still didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>Seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li>The device itself calls for a specialized AA battery, but I was able to get it to work with a regular Duracell.  </li>
            <li>but it should last more than 5 months.</li>
            <li>but it is pretty painless.</li>
            <li>For years men have been willing to show off their Nose Hair Anemones.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer helps pull men one more step up the evolutionary ladder by painlessly chopping up our unruly sniffer</li>
            <li>/&gt;And for those who think that manscaping the facial caverns might squelch your BroPowers, ask yourselves what could be more manly than sticking a power-tool up your nose?  </li>
            <li>My first one just wore out after 7 years.  </li>
            <li>Tried many types but finally got the one that does the job</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve had that did not.</li>
            <li>This trimmer seems ok, after several weeks of use.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>It gets pretty hot after about a minute.  </li>
            <li>Works well and does exactly what it is intended to do.  </li>
            <li>The first one broke with 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>It started making a loud buzzing sound and it wouldn&#x27;t cut anymore.</li>
            <li>panasonic website lists the replacement blades at a higher cost than the amazon price for the trimmer.</li>
            <li>We never realized how much hair we had until it was gone!</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li>Replaced the battery and the same problem occurred after about eight more uses.  </li>
            <li>my Panasonic ER-GN30 and hair starts wishing it never grew in the first place.</li>
            <li>Works very well indeed!</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it should do and leave my nose hairless</li>
            <li>The first thing I said to this thing when I took it out of the box was &amp;</li>
            <li>It Really Does Work, and close too!  </li>
            <li>This is the first to truly work without using a razor with the cutter on it</li>
            <li>It broke first use.</li>
            <li>However, the first one that I bought did not work out of the box.</li>
            <li>is really what you would want the trimmer to do!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve Used it to trim nose and ear hairs for the first time.</li>
            <li>but it worked really well!</li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer</li>
            <li>As with first, it worked for about 1 month and then stopped.  </li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>This works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>the blade outside the device, turn the device on and make sure it makes noise/</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>First trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li>Pretty quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>The first unit I ordered worked for a month or two, and then started draining batteries.</li>
            <li>It was really more of a joke, but he actually likes it and it works really well!</li>
            <li>works exactly as described,  </li>
            <li>Not like oven hot, or surface of the sun hot, or even pop-tart filling hot.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Simply put, it works well for exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li>I also like that it comes complete with a cleaning brush and detailed information on washing the blades when needed.  </li>
            <li>I had a different brand that had much more power.</li>
            <li>I did drop the first one I bought in the sink after about a year, oops</li>
            <li>I just rinse in hot water after each use.</li>
            <li>The first one lasted years and didn&#x27;t cause any problems.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic Nose, Ear and Facial hair trimmer performed greater than my expectations.  </li>
            <li>so I guess it will last more time.</li>
            <li>Should have bought it the first time.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li>I will be buying another one when i wear the blades out on this one in several more years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many and none of them belong in the same category as this product.  </li>
            <li>This is my first nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li>After I received it, I realized that I had an exact duplicate which I thought didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric trimmer I bought and</li>
            <li>I will replace it with a different make, see if that does any better.</li>
            <li>the motor doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power (even with fresh batteries), so it can take a while to get the job done, but</li>
            <li>i used it once, when i first got it, then my nose hair got stuck in the cutters, i panic,</li>
            <li>You may know be well aware of this</li>
            <li>So last week i bought 2 more.</li>
            <li>So when you buy similar products, make sure you buy from known brand from quality perspective like Panasonic in this case.</li>
            <li>but I picked up a different brand at Target that worked much better</li>
            <li>I love how this is cleaned out by water and uses a regular battery (I use a rechargeable).</li>
            <li>Works way better than the interchangeable attachments I&#x27;ve used on various beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>To my surprise it was just an example of just how far the technology had advanced.</li>
            <li>your experience with the Panasonic ER-GN30 nose hair trimmer is as stellar as mine.</li>
            <li>This does the job, but my first one died after about 18 months.</li>
            <li>Tickles a bit when I first used it</li>
            <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>At first I thought replacing the battery...</li>
            <li>This thing does exactly what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li>Make sure you either have a double a battery or can get one before you plan on using</li>
            <li>I have used several Panasonic trimmers before, and no one works better than this one.</li>
            <li>You better believe I&#x27;ll ask for my money back as well.</li>
            <li>Probably more often than anyone would possibly need to have their nose hair removed.</li>
            <li>Fast and efficient!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive&lt;br</li>
            <li>OK, even talking about nose and ear hair is gross, but I have both and don&#x27;t like to be seen with it sprouting out everywhere.</li>
            <li>Completely satisfied and would totally recommend!</li>
            <li>my first ever of these.</li>
            <li>need to replaced the first Panasonic trimmer</li>
            <li>This trimmer does exactly that.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li>He actually said, &amp;#34;I love this.  </li>
            <li>My boyfriend has a beard, as most guys these days do and needed a facial hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>and he was enjoying using it every week with the various attachments it came with.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d have given a higher rating if it had lasted longer.</li>
            <li>Cuts smoothly without any problems so far.</li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer of this type.  </li>
            <li>The battery life is much better than similar models.</li>
            <li>Well designed and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do with no pain.</li>
            <li>First one I bought</li>
            <li>results, after using on nose and ears, are exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit larger than others, which I had hoped would translate to better quality and durability...</li>
            <li>trimmer does exactly that.</li>
            <li>I really like this gaget!</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had philips bodygroomers in the past and this one is no different, meaning it works PERFECT, no irritation,</li>
            <li>Otherwise it trims pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>2 stars because at first, it kicked ass</li>
            <li>exactly what I needed</li>
            <li>Works fast and does not hurt!.</li>
            <li>Thanks, Panasonic!</li>
            <li>, if I miss anything shaving, it gets that really close to the skin too!  </li>
            <li>;-)  </li>
            <li>Does exactly what you want.</li>
            <li>Completely pain free.  </li>
            <li>purchased for my husband, he said this is the first trimmer that didnt yank out the nose hair</li>
            <li>Works slightly better than earlier models.</li>
            <li>Funny</li>
            <li>Works pretty well as a nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li>The latest one, the ER-GN30, was bought only four months ago.</li>
            <li>I am going to be spending a bit more on a different product.</li>
            <li>Does have a bit of a funny chemical smell, maybe the lubricant in the motor?</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a nose hair trimmer and was worried that it would hurt by pulling/pinching hairs.</li>
            <li>When the top was put back on it would not spin.  </li>
            <li>I didn’t see any spring in the first trimmer I owned</li>
            <li>Seem to work really well too!</li>
            <li>When I washed it for the first time, the spinning blade part fell out into the sink.</li>
            <li>its the first time i have bought something like this.  </li>
            <li>ill stay optimistic and say its the best trimmer</li>
            <li>First time I used it, it worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I was only able to use it twice before it quit working.</li>
            <li>I have used  a different brand that worked better.</li>
            <li>Much better than a Conair brand I had a while back.  </li>
            <li>First I thought it was the battery, but it&#x27;s the design.</li>
            <li>At first I thought replacing the battery...</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had it too long, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>Only downside is he has to do it more often.</li>
            <li>This works very well!..</li>
            <li>but it seems to be made pretty well</li>
            <li>Does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li>First of all, I am not one of those Vine writers.</li>
            <li>This thing rips through my nasal hairs like a black-robed villain&#x27;s light saber through a young Jedi&#x27;s forearm.</li>
            <li>He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li>The first time he used it he said it actually helped him breathe better.</li>
            <li>it should last 2-4 years or more.</li>
            <li>I have switched out the battery more time than i think is necessary</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that this device does exactly what you want.  </li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>My first nose hair trimmer was one of these:</li>
            <li>And on top of that is runs fairly quietly!  </li>
            <li>This item wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had in mind; it turns out I think I might need something stronger.</li>
            <li>Worked well, at first.</li>
            <li>A $10 confidence boost is pretty sweet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also very simple and safe to use.  </li>
            <li>Bought one for myself not to long ago, liked it so much bought this one for my son.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>THe most recent time i picked it up</li>
            <li>Glad I finally bought one.</li>
            <li>;) its just me.</li>
            <li>It might like the slightly higher voltage of an alkaline battery, but I&#x27;ll never buy one of those again.</li>
            <li>The first was rotary and it worked but not all that efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>Several people thought I was snorting the magic dust.</li>
            <li>He really likes it!  </li>
            <li>Its well made and it does exactly what you want it to do.  </li>
            <li>Not really too effective for getting those stubborn ear hairs.  </li>
            <li>This Panasonic GN30 nose hair trimmer was gifted to me ~7 months ago, and since then I&#x27;ve had no problems with it whatsoever; it&#x27;s built simply yet sturdily</li>
            <li>It works great and the battery last a long time.</li>
            <li>but this thing works pretty well.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for those interested.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see how long the battery lasts, but this is a well built product that is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>They all seem to give out pretty soon.  </li>
            <li>This is what you need for doing exactly what you think.</li>
            <li>I put the battery in for the first use and the on/off switch does not work.</li>
            <li>Does the job fast and without pulling any hairs!</li>
            <li>For the price you absolutely cannot beat this trimmer!</li>
            <li>My old one would cut my skin and this is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is wash the blade and the top guard before you use it, with water</li>
            <li>This is the first one to work consistently.</li>
            <li>The product is exactly I was looking for.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned several of these devices over the years and mostly by Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>They all worked okay, but I found I had to go over and over the same areas to get all the hair</li>
            <li>first time using this model</li>
            <li>Fast, powerful, and no pulling.  </li>
            <li>After about 5 minutes of different directions and patterns, i was able to get 95% of my nose hairs</li>
            <li>the  Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer does an okay job but not as thorough as I would like.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this type of item, so take this review with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only thing you have to be aware of is that you have to make sure</li>
            <li>Obviously the blade had trimmed more than just the hairs in there.</li>
            <li>So hot</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll update as soon as I find a better durable unit which actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Third, my cheapo one does better even though it sometimes pulls and sounds noisy.  </li>
            <li>I love this one compared to another I had purchased at a local store.  </li>
            <li>In the future, I would spend more money for something similar, but better construction quality.</li>
            <li>him about it! ;-)</li>
            <li>This is the first electric nose trimmer I had ever tried.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it quite well.  </li>
            <li>First time I ever buy\use one of these gadgets</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband and he really likes it!</li>
            <li>Had many different models over the years.  </li>
            <li>This is the first time I have used something like thisl</li>
            <li>I was finally able to saw it open with a hacksaw.</li>
            <li>This product works really well!</li>
            <li>So work fast!</li>
            <li>This trimmer does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li>This one is quiet, smooth, and not painful.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - gets rid of unwanted nose</li>
            <li>This is my first nose trimmer</li>
            <li>/&gt;After my first use.</li>
            <li>Died after first battery change...</li>
            <li>Overall does the job though, and much better than the no-name brand one that came with my travel kit.</li>
            <li>I found this trimmer to be just short of okay.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Conair purchased at our local pharmacy.</li>
            <li>So, overall, I am satisfied</li>
            <li>Did exactly what its supposed to.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works much better than the last one I had....</li>
            <li>Feels a bit funny when using it the first time</li>
            <li>Works very well, no pinching!  </li>
            <li>Love this Panasonic Nose and Facial Trimmer!</li>
            <li>It doesnt get hot.</li>
            <li>This is the same looking model that I seen in so many advertisements and reviews.</li>
            <li>This was my first nose trimmer I purchased and</li>
            <li>My son took the first one.</li>
            <li>The only part that is ok is that I guess I can afford the loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So perhaps if I just use them for touch ups they won&#x27;t get as hot.  </li>
            <li>It does exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li>, i gifted it to my father in India so could not even send it back</li>
            <li>Works pretty well over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When it does work for the first 10 seconds, it pulls rather than cuts hair.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and was expecting from the reviews.  </li>
            <li>I recently purchased a $10.00 Wahl micro trimmer from the grocery store to replace this Panasonic trimmer and the Wahl trimmer is 10 times better.</li>
            <li>Your first trimming session will probably be longer than it needs to be, until you see how efficient this weed whacker is.  </li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thankfully it is most definitely a keeper!  </li>
            <li>Have nothing to compare this with as this is the first trimmer that I have ever bought</li>
            <li>Yes, I followed the instructions exactly:</li>
            <li>when i first got it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>Sure, scissors can do the same</li>
            <li>sure can only be rivaled to childbirth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Yes, I totally recommend it :)</li>
            <li>It does its job very well!</li>
            <li>The first time I ordered it, the rest of my order came in but this product didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>You cannot find a better trimmer that is as efficient, quiet &amp;amp; gets the job done than this one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>only wish I could find one that cuts even better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Service was fast too!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a trimmer</li>
            <li>Does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>I have pretty bodacious nose hair, but that&#x27;s why I need this tool in the first</li>
            <li>Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li>Over all it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>Sometimes after I smack it against my hand several times it will start or if I take the top off it will start</li>
            <li>Goods as described, fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Silent, smooth, and does not hurt!  </li>
            <li>Still on first battery.  </li>
            <li>most likely purchase one for all my family members for Xmas.</li>
            <li>My first nose hair trimmer, works great.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li>2nd one I&#x27;ve owned MUST be something better out there</li>
            <li>I just received this product and tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li>And the trimmer went through it all like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li>crisp trimming of nostril hair.</li>
            <li>It was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li>The first machine I received was defective.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Following is the experience I had with the first machine I ordered.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li>In fact in over a month of use I can only think of one time a hair got yanked out by this trimmer, an outstanding track record.  </li>
            <li>That said, it is clear that even if this trimmer does lose it&#x27;s edge, it will still have lasted longer by far than it&#x27;s cheaper brethren and in the meantime I would have had a far superior trimming experience.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>seems built fairly cheap but has held up well so far.</li>
            <li>I first time they swelled, the glands were so tender, I didn&#x27;t want to touch my neck.</li>
            <li>It was also unclear from the directions, exactly how one is supposed to hold it, in order to trim nose hair.  </li>
            <li>and this one has worked pretty well since we got it.</li>
            <li>Good batteries don&#x27;t go dead after 5 minutes of usage.</li>
            <li>So far so good - hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>It does a good job, but still has trouble with those \\&quot;tricky\\&quot; hairs.</li>
            <li>Some have cost me more, but no other is as effective and pain less.</li>
            <li>It has a strong little motor that puts out more rpms.  </li>
            <li>got it last year just after Black Friday for a very good price...</li>
            <li>Though I love the trimmer, it is certainly not meant to replace a true beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li>and they all gave super high praise for this.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, works effectively, easy to clean, small and lightweight.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, easy to clean, small to store.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic vacuum trimmer is 10x better.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t too loud and is very powerful.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise it worked great and in half the time as my old trimmers.  </li>
            <li>this is even less than many cheap plastic toys.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s just design psychology, but the slightly bent body seems to fit my hand better and make trimming accuracy easier.</li>
            <li>I think using it as a facial hair trimmer as it is advertised would be less than ideal.</li>
            <li>So far it works really well and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, requires common batteries, and is effective.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is comfortable, quiet, and does an adequate job.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have a 10 year old previous model which has worked great.  </li>
            <li>You might have to go over an area a few times to get everything, but this thing is super nice for the price.</li>
            <li>Quiet, painless, and more effective than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li>Works great and no more fuzz!</li>
            <li>I have used several other trimmers - this one is by far the best!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;I might even start carving some cool new hairdos in my nostrils.</li>
            <li>other day I noticed all the fine hair on the sides of my face (if I were a man I would probably have a full beard!).</li>
            <li>a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a single battery, the humbly ubiquitous AA, and I must say that it&#x27;s a great value!</li>
            <li>But because there are so many positive reviews, took my chances and ordered a second one.</li>
            <li>With so many positive reviews, I hoped this would actually work reliably.</li>
            <li>A great buy and the cutting technology cuts quickly and easily.</li>
            <li>As most have stated on all these type of trimmers, a AA battery powered device will be kind of weak, but they do get the job done.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is way better made and better functioning than the cheap eBay nose trimmer I was using, which only cut well in the first few uses.</li>
            <li>So far it&#x27;s held up pretty well on the original battery.  </li>
            <li>Its so easy, quick and fast to trim it actually doesnt feel like a chore anymore!  </li>
            <li>The trimmer feels gentle, its easy to hold, and its super quiet.</li>
            <li>It is just not sharp or powerful enough to cut through those kind of hairs.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, for my husband who has had a stroke, and has the use of only his right hand.</li>
            <li>wanted something cheap to put in my suitcase to take on trips that I wouldn&#x27;t care as much if tsa stole.&lt;br /&gt;Works great just don&#x27;t forget to put in new battery before leaving for trip if last trip it was starting to get weak, but that&#x27;s what Siri is for :P</li>
            <li>Panny cuts clean and clear on first attempt.</li>
            <li>It has been working fine a few months since purchased, and I was satisfied.</li>
            <li>Do not jam it in you nose looking for positive results or you will get your first scorpion bite followed by some tears.</li>
            <li>Its been a great little trimmer so far.  </li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s a comfortable and quality trim that I wish was a little more reliable.</li>
            <li>First nose trimmer I have purchased works as expected, easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>The first time you take the cap and blade apart, it will never be as quiet again, the blade does make some fair amount of noise, but not enough to bother/affect your hearing, imo.  </li>
            <li>a nose trimmer this thing works a lot better than the flat bladed ones.  </li>
            <li>OK, it sort of looks like a sleek dildo at first, but it is really a quite practical and necessary grooming aide!.</li>
            <li>Does not pull hair out, its nice and sharp.</li>
            <li>The rinse out feature seems to work and is a nice addition over other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>we t on Amazon to see what other people liked.</li>
            <li>Sooo much better than the flat blade style trimmers.  </li>
            <li>This little guy does the job nicely if you take your time and have a fresh battery.  </li>
            <li>This little shaver gits all the hairs real dang good</li>
            <li>packaging was super straightforward to open.</li>
            <li>Great for those hard to reach nose hairs, it really does the trick</li>
            <li>I would find it hard to believe spending more would yield anything better.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s simply just excellent for trimming nose, ear and hard to reach hairs.  </li>
            <li>Contrary to other devices of this kind, it has a powerful, smooth running and quiet motor.</li>
            <li>The girls especially enjoy using my new trimmer to initial their name into my back hair!</li>
            <li>But seriously it works great</li>
            <li>Keep the blade clean and clear, rinse often.  </li>
            <li>Great wet rinse that cleans all hair left from the brush.</li>
            <li>Works as expected and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Worked great, here&#x27;s a serious word of caution though...</li>
            <li>I have generally been very pleased with Panasonic personal care products.  </li>
            <li>Confidence the trimmer is clean when the flow-through runs clear.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean works as expected</li>
            <li>Cuts hairs cleanly without pulling, so far.</li>
            <li>This one is compact and by far the easiest to keep clean.  </li>
            <li>My old unit that it replaced you had to take it apart to clean.</li>
            <li>I would clean out the old Panasonic unit with a moistened Q-tip</li>
            <li>Nothing to dislike about it, comes apart easily to clean and has worked well so far.</li>
            <li>I appreciate both the ease of use, and the clean, professional look it gives my</li>
            <li>/no pain, I did give it 4/stars because you can not disassemble/remove spinning blade part to really clean it like my old Wahl nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>This thing is really unbalanced (top heavy) and easy to knockover.</li>
            <li>Apparently, Panasonic is fine with the fact that the manufacturer in China would ship this product without even testing whether it would power on.</li>
            <li>The item is sleek, sturdy, portable, easy to use, and looks good in the bathroom as it stands on it&#x27;s own base like handle.  </li>
            <li>Cuts quick, clean and short.</li>
            <li>Lets face it, nose hair is really one of the most unattractive things that grows on the human body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super simple to clean.</li>
            <li>This also has a nice cleaning feature that allows to to open a channel in the shaver to run water completely through.  </li>
            <li>I have used several of these kinds of trimmers but none of them were actually any good at what you bought them for.  </li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t open it until July when his old one broke, and he&#x27;s been kicking himself for not opening it sooner because it really is a nice trimmer.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know how the razor people can improve on these products but this one seems to be better than my last one.  </li>
            <li>It does eat batteries and has an occasional tug, but overall is a good product.</li>
            <li>Panasonic ER-GN30-K is the best nose trimmer I have ever used, and I have used at least 4 different models.  </li>
            <li>dropped my first one and dented the blade guard, which is pretty much the end.  </li>
            <li>Easily worth the few bucks it costs to keep yourself neat and tidy.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product last February and it did a good job of trimming both nose hairs and facial hair</li>
            <li>This is a great nose hair trimmer, as long as it works, which isn&#x27;t long.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be better, and I hope it lasts as long as the first one.</li>
            <li>Really... that&#x27;s a big one.  :-)</li>
            <li>Wow Really Far better than the TV nose clipper I had been using.</li>
            <li>The price is fair and I like the cleaning option of washing the cutting head with warm water.</li>
            <li>It really needs a better blade than the tiny one it comes with.</li>
            <li>My old one was better, but I bought this one thinking it would out perform the old one.</li>
            <li>Liked design of old unit and found tis to be the only one with this dexign.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is small, light, quiet, very nicely engineered and made.</li>
            <li>The first time I unscrewed the top portion to clean it out, a tiiiiny little spring that holds the blade up fell out.</li>
            <li>Wow, it Works Great for a limited time period then stops completely working.</li>
            <li>And the wet cleaning is VERY easy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light, no sharp edges, and works.</li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic for developing this trimmer at a very reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li>and NO HAIR was left inside, spotless clean!</li>
            <li>This trimmer was not expensive but does a decent job!</li>
            <li>Its light to handle, &amp; the construction is just right - simple; cap fits well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nose</li>
            <li>Once you put the battery in, it feels more natural and it does a decent job of trimming those unsightly nose hairs (and I&#x27;m sure other hairs as well,</li>
            <li>It costs a little more but it really works compared to the cheap ones you get at the drug store.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is easy, the only thing to be aware of is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a battery and the tip that cuts the hair</li>
            <li>The trimmer is easy to use and is pretty quiet to boot.  </li>
            <li>After removing the screw-on top to clean the blades under running sink water only, I put the top back on and the tiny blades never worked again.</li>
            <li>Getting the ladies has never been so easy and I am consistently having coitus on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>Pretty easy to use and works well enough.</li>
            <li>In any event, in my pursuit to find something of quality, I was convinced by the positive reviews and decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li>Bought it after reading the positive reviews on amazon.  </li>
            <li>the positive reviews were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sounds like there are lots of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>I bought this because of all the positive reviews</li>
            <li>Got this based on all the positive reviews here, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it should work better, but maybe having a wicked fast super sharp blade in your nose/ears/</li>
            <li>This works without pulling or tugging, very simple, very effective, not very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works pretty well.i&#x27;ve been staying away from the &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; trimmers and more toward single purpose trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is made of cheap plastic and breaks down easily.</li>
            <li>got this trimmer a few weeks ago and it has been working fine!!</li>
            <li>For $10 it works well, is easy to clean and has a fairly sharp blade.</li>
            <li>This is the first one that really does what it says.</li>
            <li>Ok, I&#x27;ll see how long the battery lasts</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several expensive / cheap versions and this one is the best in my book.</li>
            <li>This product cannot help with the latter issue, but it is great at trimming hair from ears, noses, and other unwanted places.  </li>
            <li>Pretty much won&#x27;t run now.  </li>
            <li>Often it wouldn&#x27;t get those long hairs were sticking out the most.</li>
            <li>but I clearly experienced the same issues as all the other 1 star posters...</li>
            <li>Compact, smooth, quiet, reasonable durable, easy to clean, battery lasts long.</li>
            <li>He loves it, easy clean up and is extremely quite.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s see, how long it lasts :)</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a device like this that really works and this device really works!</li>
            <li>First set of nose and hair trimmers I have ever owned, so I don&#x27;t have anything to really compare them against.</li>
            <li>It is very tickly when you use it for the first time</li>
            <li>I prefer units that do not have built in batteries because they always lose their charge over time and then it&#x27;s pretty much chuck in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First time using a real nose trimmer</li>
            <li>After purchasing it I read a lot of other great reviews about this same product.</li>
            <li>Blades are still extremely sharp, never pulls a hair, so easy to clean and a battery lasts forever.</li>
            <li>This product works extremely well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Pretty much.  </li>
            <li>This was the first nose/ear trimmer I have owned, so I really had no basis for comparison.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all you really need and reasonable in price!</li>
            <li>I was scared at first to shove any object up my nose that has razors spinning fast.</li>
            <li>This baby deforests very well ;-)</li>
            <li>My last trimmer was one of those cheap Avon/Sharper Image ones and this one works much better and costs the same amount.</li>
            <li>Battery (name brand starts with a &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; :-)) lasts a long time</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through a few different brands and styles of trimmers and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Despite the first impression, or maybe because of it, I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li>First, it tickles too much.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted a while and like the others have said, it works very well.</li>
            <li>Works great and not flimsy like other similar products</li>
            <li>: Works very well, tickled at first but then didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>At first I thought this trimmer was the solution I was looking for, but it&#x27;s ready for the junk pile after 4 months of use.</li>
            <li>The trimming shroud does get very warm,not hot.</li>
            <li>Its a few bucks more but well worth it!</li>
            <li>It works well and does pretty much what you expect and want it to.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and reaches places other trimmers did not.</li>
            <li>Also, the trimmer pretty much wants to YANK OUT your hair rather than cut.  </li>
            <li>As an older person, I&#x27;ve been spoiled by the good, old-fashioned products that were previous made in the USA, so my expectations are much lower these days.  </li>
            <li>trimmer has almost no vibration (a good sign in small electric motors) and does not pull at all.  </li>
            <li>Super easy to clean by turning the knob to the little &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; icon, and running it under the faucet!</li>
            <li>Super easy to clean by turning the knob to the little &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; icon, and running it under the faucet!</li>
            <li>Men interested in looking upwardly mobile and competent should seriously consider this well-designed, effective trimmer to keep natural hair in check.</li>
            <li>Works well, tickles my nose, I need to study how to clean it, a bargain, five more redundant words required.</li>
            <li>She&#x27;s never let her handicap get her down, but it truly is nice to get hold of a product that can be used with one hand, in case there&#x27;s a need.  </li>
            <li>More quiet and easier to handle than an older Panasonic model I owned.</li>
            <li>good trimmer for men and women - easy to use, small enough to carry with you or pack for a trip.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is the best I have tried to tame the hairs in your nose simply and completely.  </li>
            <li>Gets a little warm after a couple of minutes but not uncomfortably so.</li>
            <li>Pretty nice little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>You really cant go wrong with this purchase, for me personally, the rotary style trimmer works the best, i also have the philips norelco \\&quot;tube\\&quot; style trimmer, I never got comfortable using it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet, smooth and cuts very very well.</li>
            <li>I can imagine a different outcome for someone with wiry hair but for me it was very fast and smooth.</li>
            <li>but I wish I could take it apart just a little more to clean it really well.</li>
            <li>It makes it feel more clean versus just wiping down like my older models.</li>
            <li>This one seems like the motor is very strong in it and does not every lose power like the other one did.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy that I purchased this item over the trash on TV infomercials and other significantly more expensive products.  </li>
            <li>While others may have been a bit more powerful, they also vibrated too much and pulled the nose hair, which was extremely</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t it &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; that as we get older, some of us lose hair in certain areas and it begins sprouting like crab grass in others!  </li>
            <li>Great little helper!!!</li>
            <li>It fixed a problem and did it quickly and neatly.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy way to trim nose hair.</li>
            <li>Runs quietly and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>In addition to quitting after a short time, they also go through batteries very quickly.  </li>
            <li>However, this product is very solid and easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to take a part and put back together.</li>
            <li>So far it was strong enough to do the job and quick without pulling my hairs.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thought might be to go to a local shaver shop first and find out the choices available.  </li>
            <li>It is painless, fairly quiet, easy to use, and works well.</li>
            <li>It cuts short, doesn&#x27;t pull on any hair, and is easy to move around.</li>
            <li>When the battery begins to lose charge the trimmer is less effective.</li>
            <li>Luckily I&#x27;m don&#x27;t have old man ear hair yet, but if I did, this would be my go to.</li>
            <li>Works really well but heats up pretty fast when using.</li>
            <li>It cuts easily and quietly.  </li>
            <li>You can turn the head portion of the devise and open this release hole so that the water will run through the trimmer and exit the hole for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li>Does what it is supposed to do pretty well (actually better than I expected).  </li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>A lot of hair removing can become such a process, but with this product, it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li>The only problem I have is that it&#x27;s not that easy to navigate through the nose.</li>
            <li>Be careful when taking off the top for cleaning  - the blade looks pretty flimsy, although I did not appear to cause any damage, take it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use; very simple.</li>
            <li>The first one looked like cheap plastic junk from the second I saw it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Seems to be quiet and easy to operate.</li>
            <li>An effective way to trim nose hair, but the trimmer broke in less than a year.  </li>
            <li>Could put instructions easily on one short page-</li>
            <li>Fairly quiet machine, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Removal the top cap, tissue dry the pieces, reassemble.</li>
            <li>It runs on a battery and you can easily tell when the battery gets low.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to change the battery, and only uses one AA</li>
            <li>This thing does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and cleanup is easy and simple.</li>
            <li>Easy enough to use</li>
            <li>I like that this one takes standard AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a quality unit, and is easy to take apart and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>My only concern is it feels  pretty lightweight and cheap</li>
            <li>I thought when I bought it in a portable, easy to use, low cost and durable and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li>Very quiet and cleans easy by running water thru the cleaning port.</li>
            <li>Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The product works well, cuts even short hairs easily and does not pull or snag.  </li>
            <li>It is reasonably quiet, and easily cuts those pesky nasal or ear hairs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely painless and quick and removes all visible hair.  </li>
            <li>It made facial trimming exceptionally easy, with this you can do basically anytype of \\&quot;clean-up grooming\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Everything disassembled easily and was assembled back together just as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Cleans easy, simple to store.</li>
            <li>This makes it easy to take care of the hair in the areas where it shouldn&#x27;t be growing, yet it doesn&#x27;t do anything to bring back the hair that is falling out where it should be growing.</li>
            <li>Simple operation and easy maintenance.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been buying the old style trimmer for years and they always quick working.  </li>
            <li>- still need to unscrew the top, remove the blade shake off the excess water and allow it to dry on some paper</li>
            <li>easy, convenient and quiet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s convenient, quick, not messy, and the rotating blade doesn&#x27;t catch skin.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This actually cuts the nose hair close and it is easy and non-irritating.</li>
            <li>veey easy to use and he batteries last for loooooooong!!!</li>
            <li>Strongly built, quiet.</li>
            <li>This is still going strong --- my husband uses it regularly and it has been over 2 years with no problems.</li>
            <li>And after 4-5 months it is still going strong on the same battery.  </li>
            <li>The batteries are still strong after two months, but I only use it weekly.</li>
            <li>so should last good , long time.</li>
            <li>Good product at very low cost,really does the job and runs a long time on the battery. .</li>
            <li>Strong enough to do the job well.</li>
            <li>I would concur with others that using a strong double A battery as opposed to rechargeable or cheaper batteries is a must.</li>
            <li>It sounds powerful and keeps running at full steam the entire time.  </li>
            <li>No idea how long it will last, but it&#x27;s good in the meantime.</li>
            <li>Works well, but it doesn&#x27;t feel strong or like it is going to last.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, but does not live up to the reviews I read before purchasing.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how this little trimmer consumed the energy in a AA battery so quickly.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different nose trimmers from other manufacturers and this is absolutely the best one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li>it trims down to the skin - does not pull hair and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Easy to break down and clean.</li>
            <li>, I know this comparison as like comparing apples to oranges as the multi-tool was wireless and could do much more, but my need was limited to what this trimmer can do</li>
            <li>/&gt;It runs off a single AAA battery, and one of my favorite features is the ease of cleaning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had one for years, this is a replacement and certainly does the job.</li>
            <li>: I just had to return and make certain that I didn&#x27;t give this but one star.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ll certainly appreciate it.</li>
            <li>The angled head is smart.</li>
            <li>I have fairly large nostrils.</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t say for certain how this would hold up against an amazon jungle level of nose hairs or a Frida Kahlo-esque unibrow</li>
            <li>It leaves quite a large amount of stubble which still must be dealt with using another kid of blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but if you&#x27;re like me and hit a certain age when hair starts growing where you&#x27;d prefer it didn&#x27;t, here&#x27;s your solution.</li>
            <li>I would certainly reccommend this item.</li>
            <li>Consequently, as men age, they must groom certain areas to avoid looking like a bald Wookie.  </li>
            <li>Plucking is certainly one solution.</li>
            <li>I would certainly buy another one.</li>
            <li>and this certainly works for that.</li>
            <li>But they are for women and too large for the eyebrow area.)  </li>
            <li>Well guys, you get to a certain age and the hair starts sprouting.  </li>
            <li>I would certainly consider purchasing one as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li>My nose hair runs in pure fear when I pull these from the drawer.  </li>
            <li>I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li>Certainly must have.</li>
            <li>Tried changing battery...didn&#x27;t seem to work until, by pure luck, it started running when I pinched the battery in a certain position with the cover off.</li>
            <li>If you have a mustache watch out around the lips, can nick certain areas.</li>
            <li>It works but it certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like a well made trimmer.  </li>
            <li>but it certainly does not do the job I thought it would</li>
            <li>Buy two if you&#x27;re smart.</li>
            <li>The new model is basically similar to the old and yet has excellent improvements to the previous design.  </li>
            <li>Undoing and doing those small parts is not so easy for everyone.!!</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why everyone else makes their product so darn weak, but I&#x27;m happy with this one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had others that were similar in shape, but being able to run this under a stream of water with a little soap, gives me a better sense that it is really being cleaned!</li>
            <li>My husband liked this trimmer enough to order it a second time when the first one broke.</li>
            <li>This new one is a bit different with a more contoured body and some sort of wash lock</li>
            <li>It seems like it would be a battery problem however,  I did put a new battery in initially and have replaced them twice more.  </li>
            <li>It is very quiet and does an excellent job of  trimming nose hair and hard to get at ear hair!</li>
            <li>It can be used wet or dry and makes a great gift for any occasion.  </li>
            <li>You see, I discovered the joy that is the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great that you can use it dry or wet</li>
            <li>It works well and is indeed waterproof and easy to clean unlike a previous model I had years ago.  </li>
            <li>Second one I popped off the top and the blade fell off the the top and went down the sink- replacement &#x3D; 22</li>
            <li>I recommend this unit for anyone needing an easy to use, trouble free product.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works good as a nose trimmer and all around face trimmer, I&#x27;ve only used it on a dry face though.</li>
            <li>but cleaning it isn&#x27;t very user-friendly since they suggest taking the top portion apart to dry.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve purchased two of these trimmers, and when they worked they were great -- but both failed extremely quickly.</li>
            <li>Use a fresh alkaline battery for best results as cheaper ones slow it down.</li>
            <li>The battery compartment has a nice tight seal with a rubber o-ring to prevent water from getting inside.  </li>
            <li>Easy as a simple razor to clean, just open the &#x27;valve&#x27; and pour some hot water through it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a well built, high quality trimmer at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>The circular blade system works much better than my single straight arm trimmer did.</li>
            <li>It works well, is easy to clean, and is cheap enough that if I only get a year&#x27;s worth (or less) out of it, I&#x27;ll have no regrets about buying a couple more to cope with the onslaught of unwanted hirsute characteristics where I don&#x27;t want them.</li>
            <li>This one is comfortable, right-sized, cleans easily with water, takes standard batteries, is quiet, and is virtually pain-free.</li>
            <li>It worked fine the last time I used it a month or so ago.</li>
            <li>Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer arrived on time and works fine.</li>
            <li>Much more quiet and does a better job of trimming with less nose tickle.</li>
            <li>It handles the big stuff fine</li>
            <li>It really does do a great job, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>I had my doubts at first, Had other type/brands that were ok</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s larger and ergonomically shaped for better handling than my previous trimmer and the fact that it&#x27;s a wet/dry makes it even better.</li>
            <li>......bent the guard back into position and has been working fine since.</li>
            <li>Works fine, low price, no problem of discomfort.</li>
            <li>I had an earlier version which was fine, and am baffled by all the glowing reviews on this one?  </li>
            <li>It is simple to use and seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, it worked OK, and I used it on my eyebrows and other places with embarrassing hair growth.  </li>
            <li>Decent for the price and does the job on nose hairs!</li>
            <li>I got it for my boyfriend whose gotten older and his nose hairs longer!</li>
            <li>pretty decent tool for trimming unwanted hairs</li>
            <li>Usually have to change the battery once a year (unless you are exceptionally hairy).</li>
            <li>Very high quality, works without problems.</li>
            <li>He would recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t get real excited about battery powered items like this, because I&#x27;d prefer more raw, longer lasting power, but</li>
            <li>You can press it very hard against the skin and hear a view more hairs getting zapped but even when applying way more strength then you ever should with this</li>
            <li>I feel like the blades get a little warm</li>
            <li>At just over $10, this is an unbelievably effective and versatile little tool.</li>
            <li>My barber would often trim the hairs with scissors, now I can keep up with the little buggers, not boogers, on my own.</li>
            <li>The tip gets a little warm but nothing uncomforable</li>
            <li>is worth the money for a good trimmer and it stays sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li>Nice little trimmer, battery powered.  </li>
            <li>It gets a little warm after using it for a while</li>
            <li>The end part does get a little warm if it&#x27;s been running for a minute or two but doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s something that will hurt you.</li>
            <li>Say us men admit to using such an item once a week, then the single AA battery will last about 2 months or more, effectively.  </li>
            <li>I think the blades are better suited to fine hair, and sometimes cannot quite zip through a thick hair.  </li>
            <li>Works great wet or dry!  </li>
            <li>It works so much better than the older model he had for a long time.  </li>
            <li>This nose trimmer is sharp, small, handy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AS IT REMOVES EXCESS HAIRS IN AREAS WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO GET</li>
            <li>Great little trimmer - noise level is very low</li>
            <li>So overall, this Panasonic unit is working fine for me, but I&#x27;m just much more careful now when I use it.</li>
            <li>It gets a little warm at the tip and tickles my nose to the point of making me cry a bit, but it does the job haha.</li>
            <li>The best feature is the little drain built in so that the blade can be rinsed and dried.</li>
            <li>It is also easy to clean and maintain since all you have to do it twist the head off to get the little hairs out.</li>
            <li>This little thing is great and it gets the job done, especially with nose hair.</li>
            <li>costs just a little bit more, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>you pretty much have to take it apart to clean the hair out properly.</li>
            <li>Oh it has a flat bottom that makes it easy to stand up.</li>
            <li>A good nose trimmer is hard to find.</li>
            <li>I had worked so hard to get my intestinal flora in good shape</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t have to make sure hairs only hit the cutter from certain angles like the old trimmer</li>
            <li>It claims yu can trim your beard with it, I do not have one, and am not sure it would survive long doing that, but for nose, ears and eyebrows, its very good indeed.</li>
            <li>I tried my best to straighten it back out, and it works now, but it sounds a little gritty.</li>
            <li>Wish it worked a little better - it doesnt seem to last more than a year.  </li>
            <li>Shop around for a better one and spend a little more on your personal grooming.</li>
            <li>Overall a great little unit a a reasonable price...</li>
            <li>Works great, first one I have ever owned and wish I would have purchased on long ago instead of using little scissors...</li>
            <li>I would spend a little more the next time and get something better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried $10 and $20 versions of these trimmers, the generic kind you get at Wal-mart, they are always cheap, they always cut a little hair.  </li>
            <li>works awesome just a little scary putting something in you nose but makes me look so much better.</li>
            <li>Economical, easy to use, and works extremely well.</li>
            <li>first one that actually worked right and is durable!</li>
            <li>I like to leave the removable pieces in a glass of 91% alcohoI before I give them a scrub with an old toothbrush to keep them looking new and clean.</li>
            <li>It is very portable and has a low humming sound.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is quiet, comfortable and very efficient.</li>
            <li>I use it every few days and the battery life seems to be amazing.</li>
            <li>Accurate, neat and quiet.</li>
            <li>but this one trims great, only had a few months</li>
            <li>If you have a huge nose with big nostrils</li>
            <li>this sucker up your nose and watch the magic pour from nostril heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair free.</li>
            <li>One pen light battery isn&#x27;t enough to really make this work to</li>
            <li>The replacement works great, although I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days.  </li>
            <li>I really like that</li>
            <li>very good,easy to use.</li>
            <li>I have no idea, but I accomplished it.</li>
            <li>My husband is very virile and his hair amount and consistency are congruent.  </li>
            <li>The pros about this is that it is very sleek in design and does it job 98% of the time.</li>
            <li>This works really well.</li>
            <li>Worked well for about a month, but it no longer cuts very well.</li>
            <li>hitting the button too easily&amp;#34;, &amp; it&#x27;s very comfy for the hand.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend if you don&#x27;t like tweezers and can&#x27;t stand even a smallest amount of pain!</li>
            <li>this is a very neat trimmer.  </li>
            <li>so I cannot discuss its durability, but it performs really well taking care of my husband&#x27;s nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>I would recomend this product as it fulfilled my needs at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>very well functioning trimmer.</li>
            <li>works very well and is very thorough</li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>it is not painless at all and works fast.</li>
            <li>too so the whole world doesn&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see how it can be a &amp;#34;Facial&amp;#34; hair trimer.</li>
            <li>Nothing much to complain about.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Works very well,  </li>
            <li>Panasonic has always gone above and beyond in my book but this device seems cheaply put together.  </li>
            <li>My husband didn&#x27;t have much luck with electric trimmers before.  </li>
            <li>But it does work really well.</li>
            <li>Does not cut very well.</li>
            <li>I really like this clipper.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>But I can tell you that, much like my battery powered toothbrush, I can audibly hear, and feel, the motor losing power...</li>
            <li>This works very well for nose and ear hair.  </li>
            <li>Worked really well out of the package .</li>
            <li>After 2 months of use it gets really noisy, but it gets the work done.</li>
            <li>This trimmer really works, unlike others I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li>I find customer reviews very persuasive.</li>
            <li>This works very well for both me and my husband.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out, which hurts, but it really cuts and works well.</li>
            <li>I really, really like this nose-hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>husband looks much neater now.  </li>
            <li>Does best job of cutting ear hair.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li>Each seemed to work well in the begenning but went downhill fast.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works much better than I expected.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t mind too much.</li>
            <li>&quot; but if you&#x27;re looking for a primary clipper ... I&#x27;d suggest further investigation.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cuts hairs fast and without pulling.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>This task is easily accomplished.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what battery life will be like, but the trimmer works very well for</li>
            <li>This works really well.  </li>
            <li>These worked very well and will hopefully continue to do so.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t leave as much of a stubble problem.</li>
            <li>This unit is designed to do one thing real well</li>
            <li>The manufacturer also claims that its water-resistant, making it capable of use in the shower, though I haven&#x27;t tried this myself.</li>
            <li>Much quieter.</li>
            <li>For that QC - modern look in a man, this it the product for you.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.</li>
            <li>Really like this shaver.</li>
            <li>Worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li>Really you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Nose and ear hair... who wants to discuss that?  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say it works very well</li>
            <li>There is no pulling and they are very versatile, whether trimming nose, ears, eyebrows etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>highly recommend this trimmer if you are considering them!</li>
            <li>It is also a capable eyebrow trimmer as well, but I don&#x27;t have any ear hair to test it on.</li>
            <li>This product worked really well until I dropped it.</li>
            <li>To remove these, nothing really works except a nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This one really works.</li>
            <li>, I immediately ordered another one (though ironic that it&#x27;s cheaper to re-buy than get a replacement blade...).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have much in the way of ear hair</li>
            <li>In fact it works very well.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend because he&#x27;s much taller than me</li>
            <li>I have a fast rate growing of hair</li>
            <li>This Panasonic hair trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li>The unit is constructed very well.  </li>
            <li>Nothing really to complain about.  </li>
            <li>Works very well for battery operated.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>and this doesn&#x27;t do very well.</li>
            <li>do a really thorough job &amp; still have to use scissors to get the ones waaaaaaay up in there.</li>
            <li>and they work really well.  </li>
            <li>Like, it didn&#x27;t look like it does when someone has a scar through their eyebrow or if you were to run a clipper through your eyebrow (or straight razor).</li>
            <li>My husband wants me to buy another one</li>
            <li>only downside I have to it, is that it feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li>very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>works better than expected, would recommend to everyone...</li>
            <li>Very compact and it works.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li>For the price it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>so I can get in really close, but I didn&#x27;t have to do that with this one.  </li>
            <li>A very neat &amp; efficient way of brushing up an aging face.</li>
            <li>That way if it ever breaks, I have another one ready to go.</li>
            <li>Its an absolute must have item in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Who wants to do a lot of reading anyway about a nasal hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve hand it for about two months and this trimmer really mows the grass.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>amazon thanks.</li>
            <li>It holds a charge well and seems to clip really well.</li>
            <li>Pulls a bit too much</li>
            <li>Works well and is more comfortable when cutting than most.</li>
            <li>These really do the job in trimming the hair unlike those made in China.  </li>
            <li>and it really hurts when you have to pluck it out.</li>
            <li>Or a rechargable built in for the price of this unit it really should.</li>
            <li>works very well.</li>
            <li>He really likes that you can use it even in the water.</li>
            <li>I would have paid twice as much for this trimmer.</li>
            <li>It is very well built for a inexpensive unit.  </li>
            <li>I really like the fact that all you have to do is rinse it out with water.</li>
            <li>Well built, cheap, quiet, cleans with running water</li>
            <li>/&gt;He appreciated that they included a Cleaning-brush with the Trimmer and a Cap to keep the blade-housing covered when not in use.</li>
            <li>It worked very well while it lasted.</li>
            <li>It buzzed and vibrated, and was much fussier to use.</li>
            <li>Cuts very close with no pinching or pulling of the hairs.</li>
            <li>The trimmer gently trims the hair, without hurting your nose.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;vortex&#x27; nonsense is just a bit of over-engineering; really Panasonic, it&#x27;s a nose hair trimmer, not a lawnmower.  </li>
            <li>It is fast and efficient.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>Works very well on nasal hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Even if it had not broken, I would have purchased something else.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon a lot.</li>
            <li>After my last two cheap nose/ear hair trimmers died I decided to give this fancier one a shot.</li>
            <li>It also holds ats battery life very well.</li>
            <li>Admittedly I do not have much nose hair, so I would use tweezers instaed.  </li>
            <li>Too soon to tell if merits 5 starts: if  the blades hold their sharpness for a reasonable period of time, I might boost my rating.</li>
            <li>Does a reasonable job, no complaints.  </li>
            <li>So far for the price though, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Thanks to it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I never realized how much nose hair I had since purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>Worth the money and recommend by hairy old men.</li>
            <li>and he really did not want another.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It is very thorough with the trimming.  </li>
            <li>but it a does a much quicker/better&lt;br /&gt;job.  </li>
            <li>the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>I have very curly hair.  </li>
            <li>but I may be asking too much because AA&#x27;s are so standardized.</li>
            <li>Unit worked very well for one year, then started making a grinding noise and promptly died.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping</li>
            <li>This model is very aggressive and gets the job done fast.</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t use this thing as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li>Really works.</li>
            <li>I really like the angle of the handle.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for making a product that works as advertised.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Stores wanted too much for this product.</li>
            <li>this  is a god as you can get very close and dose not cut you</li>
            <li>Skip the high price tag and go with this one!</li>
            <li>It just does not trim the nose hair very well.</li>
            <li>So much for it being waterproof.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>2 year warranty doesnt really help.  </li>
            <li>Very practical item, well known brand name Panasonic.</li>
            <li>The difference might be related to the design of the end of the blade guard, as the Wahl is wide open, where the Panasonic blade guard kind of wraps around the top or tip of the blade.     </li>
            <li>The design makes the rotating cutters much too ineffective.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak much for it being used as a trimmer for the ear, but for the nose it&#x27;s working really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much faster, too.</li>
            <li>it uses batteries FAST.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>very durable.</li>
            <li>This is a very convenient to trim nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>Trimmer does what is supposed to and a whole lot safer than scissors.</li>
            <li>It did its job very well.</li>
            <li>If you have nose hairs in need of trimming, this Panasonic is capable of the task.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>This item doesn&#x27;t really do anything except buzz when you turn it on.  </li>
            <li>I really wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased it.</li>
            <li>My last nose hair trimmer was a piece of cheap junk.</li>
            <li>He says they work very well</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;It also cuts nose hairs very close and gently</li>
            <li>Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have fast growing nose hairs for some reason...</li>
            <li>Jessica: Should you have any questions in the future, please feel free to chat with us again.</li>
            <li>I get groomed so fast now.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very cautious as to not knick the inside of my nose</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much you can say about a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>I was very hesitant to stick something electric with blades up my nose</li>
            <li>Trims really well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nose trimmer and it does its intended job very well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li>All @ a reasonable price point ...</li>
            <li>Very please with performance.</li>
            <li>I really just needed a product that I could turn on and use.  </li>
            <li>I really did not need a wet/dry trimmer any way.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li>This product does a fantastic job of trimming unwanted hair from various areas.</li>
            <li>I really like the Panasoni machine.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>The clipper makes a humming sound and the tip warms but it only clips a minimum amount of hair.</li>
            <li>My wife wants me to buy another one...</li>
            <li>Very seldom if ever does it YANK a hair.</li>
            <li>It works really well for that too.</li>
            <li>That outcome doesn&#x27;t happen too often with modern products.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks for getting my noise/ears/whatever else that needs trimming.  </li>
            <li>Very neat gadget to have.  </li>
            <li>This item works very well for trimming nasal hairs.  </li>
            <li>but when I do, it works very well.</li>
            <li>perhaps a really judgmental cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought this because over the years my nose hair has really started to grow longer for some reason.  </li>
            <li>Never thought I would like a nose trimmer so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well built and durable.</li>
            <li>Very painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I guess you can&#x27;t expect much for $10.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>works as promised  which is very well</li>
            <li>and it goes through batteries much faster.</li>
            <li>Very efficient trimmer that provides trouble-free efficiency.</li>
            <li>Well-designed and performs better than expected.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Working very well.  </li>
            <li>Like it so much.</li>
            <li>Works very well</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make much noise at all.  </li>
            <li>The grip/handle is comfortable and feels solid.</li>
            <li>but doesn&#x27;t really work well in practice.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Though for $12 what do you really get anymore?  </li>
            <li>The whole unit seems to be waterproof, although I&#x27;ve never submerged it.</li>
            <li>very good&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>very like it</li>
            <li>highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li>I have found this device also works very well for trimming stray hairs (like the 2 or three that grow between my eyebrows).</li>
            <li>This device works really well.</li>
            <li>Works very well and meets all my needs</li>
            <li>oh, say on their head - to where they don&#x27;t really want it - say tufting out of their nose and ears.</li>
            <li>fast delivery</li>
            <li>He really likes it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The product worked very well and on the note I would recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li>Does not pull hair, trims very close</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t really suggest giving this a try.</li>
            <li>I purchased this because I like this type over the straight blade type.  </li>
            <li>This is smooth, quiet, and cuts the hair like it is intended to.</li>
            <li>Most of these nose hair trimmers are cheaply made and only work minimally.</li>
            <li>Well made and the travel cover is very helpful.  </li>
            <li>Straight clippers work in some areas but not inside my nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>For a much lower price</li>
            <li>not so much a &amp;#34;facial</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband and it really works well.</li>
            <li>My husband was really looking forward to this device.</li>
            <li>A real power-combo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use this for my crazy nose hair and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li>/simpler straight design.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Seriously, it works very well.</li>
            <li>I contacted customer service, and I was offered a replacement part at a cost that was more than what I spent on the trimmer itself.  </li>
            <li>- he really likes this one.</li>
            <li>but it recovers fast.</li>
            <li>It trims very well both my nose hair and my ear hairs.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>The noise level is low and it cuts neatly and smoothly without any tugs.</li>
            <li>Really like this item.  </li>
            <li>I LOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVE it so much.</li>
            <li>It worked very well and it continues to work.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>This things really works.</li>
            <li>It trims his nose and ear hairs  very well with no problems.  </li>
            <li>With this one, my face looks spit-shined and ready for anything.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for women AND men!</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t think it trimmed hairs very well anyway.  </li>
            <li>When I called up the manufacturers&#x27; parts department to order another head, they wanted as much for the replacement head as I paid for the unit.  </li>
            <li>I found out, fortunately for me, that the Wahl beard trimmer that I had ordered actually came with a nose/ear hair trimmer accessory.  </li>
            <li>Wish I&#x27;d been more careful.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to use and does the job.  </li>
            <li>used it straight away</li>
            <li>He says it works really well</li>
            <li>fast result</li>
            <li>Just purchased this, but I really like it.</li>
            <li>but they use up the battery too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy them again because I do not use them very often.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work....unless you have so much nose hair that it is hanging two inches out of your nose.</li>
            <li>hahahaha</li>
            <li>I did get some gentle pulling at times, but no yanking.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t have to use it that much, so</li>
            <li>Very quiet and comfortable to hold when using..</li>
            <li>It is very convenient for you to carry when you go out.</li>
            <li>It does one thing very well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping...</li>
            <li>This product worked very well for my intended purpose.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Really cleans hairs</li>
            <li>Works really well for my nose as well as my ears.</li>
            <li>On a $13 trimmer, that doesn&#x27;t much sense.</li>
            <li>We really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li>This works really well and is very portable.</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t think this thing was going to work very well.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this trimmer!</li>
            <li>My husband really like this.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>I ran this thing over my whole face ...</li>
            <li>: If needed for trimming eyebrow hairs, it doesn&#x27;t really get the close &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; or close &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; or tweezed look.  </li>
            <li>When I did get it working and tried it out, it cut most hairs, but the blades would get jammed and pull my nosehairs out.  </li>
            <li>Somehow I expected more flash or power to the operation.  </li>
            <li>This panasonic nose trimmer is very well made.</li>
            <li>absolutely a keeper</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>Simple to use, cheap.</li>
            <li>It leaves stubble, very itchy.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really realize how visible my nose hair was until I got this and used it.</li>
            <li>Yea we needed to finally replace our cheap nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>This one is very well built</li>
            <li>and it does the job very well.</li>
            <li>nothing else really needs to be said.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic.</li>
            <li>But it took me about 30 minutes to shave my whole face with it.</li>
            <li>but works really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li>It works really well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li>I only wish it came with a free battery</li>
            <li>Even if you decide to use Alkaline, it won&#x27;t be as wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is much easier than cleaning an electric shaver.</li>
            <li>The amount of hair coming out of it isn&#x27;t that much, I sometimes skip it.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Works, but it drains the batteries really fast.</li>
            <li>This works very well and efficiently.  </li>
            <li>Does the job VERY well.  </li>
            <li>and you don&#x27;t really even need to use a mirror.</li>
            <li>proof.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to post pictures , but I don&#x27;t think you really want to see them .</li>
            <li>those more remote places.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>Opened the bottom, shoved in a cheap AA battery and starting rooting around places</li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m ready for all the ladies.</li>
            <li>The best for cutting unwanted nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>Use hearing aids so trimming close is very helpful.</li>
            <li>Price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>So I bought this, put a battery in it, turned it on, and gently inserted it into my nostrils.  </li>
            <li>really  works too.  </li>
            <li>Even when it was working it really didn&#x27;t do much for trimming hair.  </li>
            <li>It feels compact yet solidly built, and fits comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li>Only time will be the judge on the durability issue, but overall I think this is well worth the couple of dollars more that this trimmer cost me.</li>
            <li>The \\&quot;run through the faucet\\&quot; way of cleaning it works very well.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t really see how you would cut yourself with this tool.</li>
            <li>This one is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It works VERY well.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this.</li>
            <li>Bit more &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; than expected.</li>
            <li>I expected more from a Panasonic product.</li>
            <li>This trimmer work very well</li>
            <li>this one based on Amazon reviewer ratings (Thanks reviewers).  </li>
            <li>I really thought this would be a \\&quot;you</li>
            <li>this really works,  I do use it.</li>
            <li>Pulls nose hairs, get ready for some some tearful eyes.  </li>
            <li>This is very efficient, and gets everything in one or two passes.</li>
            <li>Quiet and pain free.</li>
            <li>I like it so much</li>
            <li>it seems to work really really well, without any discomfort, just does what I thought it would do.</li>
            <li>Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This made the task very simple and smooth..</li>
            <li>Trims very close.  </li>
            <li>Runs quiet and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The blade trims facial hair close and comfortably.</li>
            <li>This trimmer left the inside of my nose feeling as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li>I had 1 or 2 of these years ago and they didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic wants me to pay to ship it for repair.</li>
            <li>would also be still very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very reliable.  </li>
            <li>Very prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li>I think it rotates faster and cuts the hair much easier, with no pulling.  </li>
            <li>It cuts the nose hairs very well.  </li>
            <li>Way too much fun early in the morning.</li>
            <li>FAST</li>
            <li>I think the trick is how fast the motor runs and the fact that it can be rinsed under running water.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m really reviewing this, which means anyone reading this knows that I use an electronic device to remove nose hairs and stray body hairs.</li>
            <li>trims close and fast in meh nose.</li>
            <li>really wanted this to work....</li>
            <li>It shaves really close without pulling the hair(s).</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Got on my browser, went to the site, and with much trepidation, I cautiously typed in \\&quot;Panasonic trimmer\\&quot;....</li>
            <li>$12 bucks can you really complain?</li>
            <li>this works very well.</li>
            <li>Very well designed and engineered.</li>
            <li>This works as described and was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Just really takes care of the nose and ears.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used this product much since it arrived.  </li>
            <li>Works really well.  </li>
            <li>I never imagined buying one of these things because real men don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>Really?  </li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t like it much anyway.</li>
            <li>Very dissapointed in Panasonic for this product.</li>
            <li>I prefer the rotary one to straight edge clippers that i&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t really work well</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t as fast as I&#x27;d like but satisfactory.</li>
            <li>Trims very well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>durable smooth and quiet</li>

            <li>VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li>and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li>Flip the on/off switch and a low buzzing sound is heard.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>This item cuts the hairs very well without pulling as some others do.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s rotating strength on the inner blades is rather strong and it is so easy to do quick trimming in a few minutes and continue on with my day.</li>
            <li>Scissors, knifes, had to use the whole shebang.</li>
            <li>However, it really gets those whiskers.  </li>

            <li>The hair on my ears was just getting to be too much</li>
            <li>Especailly with ears and nose because you can&#x27;t really \\&quot;see\\&quot; as you cut.</li>

            <li>There nothing fancy or unusual about this product.</li>

            <li>it doesn&#x27;t fit back in.</li>
            <li>I am hearing unusual noises after I did this</li>
            <li>I much prefer this style of trimmer to some of the others on the market.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe there is so much out there that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t heatup too much either.  </li>
            <li>This is my third one I purchased and by far this one is the one I am most comfortable with because of its simple ergonomics.</li>
            <li>While using it to clean my nose hairs, it initially felt as if to not be strong enough</li>
            <li>Hopefully this will not only keep it sanitary but also keep it running smoothly.</li>
            <li>Also, the strength of the buzzer is great and doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind.</li>
            <li>I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull hair and can trim hair very closely</li>
            <li>careful Im sure u will hurt your fingers</li>
            <li>I was very uneasy about this product.</li>
            <li>did not cut the hairs very well</li>
            <li>It has worked really well and hasn&#x27;t pulled any of the hairs out making my eyes water....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve now purchased four of these - they work great in the beginning but all have broken within 6-12 months.  </li>
            <li>Got this for my husband&#x27;s nose hair and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li>They really work.</li>
            <li>The one thing that I really did like about this trimmer is that it does not pull your hair at all.</li>
            <li>I really like the cleaning features.</li>
            <li>very effeciant and works as described</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>I still use it so I would recommend it to someone who wants one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really amazed that this got rated so well.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t trim very well.</li>
            <li>Cheap Chinese product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much much quieter than the unit it replaces.  </li>
            <li>What&#x27;s there to say really.</li>
            <li>and i feel like it doesnt spin as fast as it once did.</li>
            <li>It does the job very well without tugging on my nose hairs.  </li>
            <li>Once I&#x27;ve finished gently brushing out the hairs, I proceed to use my Norelco shaver lubricant to aid in the cleaning and lubrication of the cutter blade.  </li>
            <li>I bought a cheap trimmer a while back</li>
            <li>This really works my husband loves it</li>
            <li>Hair...who wants it sticking out from your nose.</li>
            <li>Very dependable.  </li>
            <li>Cheaply manufactured, buy a different model or brand.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic cuts very well, &amp; is very well made.</li>
            <li>works well really gets in their    </li>
            <li>Not so much for ears.</li>
            <li>so you have to really work it for a while to get the job done.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t know how much I needed one until I bought this.  </li>
            <li>It has a very quality look and feel.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>We both highly recommend!</li>
            <li>The product worked very well for 6 weeks, and then promptly broke.</li>
            <li>haha...</li>
            <li>Not used very often</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A must have for everyone (male or female) that wants to be nicely groomed in the nose area or ears.  </li>
            <li>Very well designed.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well</li>
            <li>I am really pleased with the fact that it can be used in a wet environment.</li>
            <li>and it got here fast</li>
            <li>i found online, makes shopping so much easier for me</li>
            <li>It works very well</li>
            <li>But for nose and ears it works very well.  </li>
            <li>(Tip: be gentle in the nose.</li>
            <li>it works really well.  </li>
            <li>have not had any issues and its prices very well...</li>
            <li>but it really works really well</li>
            <li>and it really does what it claims,</li>
            <li>reasonably fast delivery.</li>
            <li>This one does the job very well.  </li>
            <li>HAHAHA</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that you can rinse it while running</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I did way to much research before buying this one, but it works very well indeed.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer head is a thinner metal, so the hairs get trimmed much shorter.</li>
            <li>It also doesn&#x27;t have the problem of corrosion buildup on the battery contacts, so I always get fast speeds.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I use it every now and again, Can&#x27;t say much about it.</li>
            <li>The price is reasonable and it&#x27;s convenient and non-intrusive.</li>
            <li>This product works very well.  </li>
            <li>I need to really use it throughly.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27; very grateful for it</li>
            <li>Only con is it feels cheap</li>
            <li>it is gentle at removing hair and does not hurt.</li>
            <li>This works very well and does not tug or cause any discomfort.  </li>
            <li>I like how it doesn&#x27;t make much noise.  </li>
            <li>Fast and quite.</li>
            <li>This is a very trustworthy shops.</li>
            <li>This thing runs very quietly and smoothly that i was not at all worried about jamming this into my nose.  </li>
            <li>I just felt so much cleaner</li>
            <li>light and works qith only one battery</li>
            <li>Gentle.  </li>
            <li>This thing worked fast and painless.</li>
            <li>but on my head, and this trimmer is a real harvester.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;First time in, I was rooting around inside my nose hoping that when I pulled the device out, all the hair would be gone (a reasonable expectation, I thought).</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do a superb job cutting nose hairs or ear hairs.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull at all, and you can get the nose hairs very close to the skin.  </li>
            <li>Very quiet and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic worked very well for me with no pinching or pulling.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect much based on the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Thanks for this.</li>
            <li>This is really efficient in trimming hair</li>
            <li>Purchased this for my husband for Christmas along with a 10x lighted mirror to really encourage him to trim.</li>
            <li>I got this for my hubby and he says it really does the job.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t quite seem to give a  real close shave.</li>
            <li>It really worked out real well.  </li>
            <li>I think this nose hair trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much for a trimmer, so I took the chance on buying this one.</li>
            <li>It does everything as it is supposed to, and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>you don&#x27;t really need it.  </li>
            <li>I was very leery with nose cutters.</li>
            <li>really tickles!&lt;br</li>
            <li>Additionally, head became very noisy after 10 uses...</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>After years of using models from gift sets and the drug store end caps this unit really impresses.  </li>
            <li>Makes a grooming job much easier.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>This works like an electric shaver, in that the hair is cut very close to the skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li>I primarily use this trimmer for my nose hair, not for facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s because they were coming straight from my nose...</li>
            <li>but they really do the job</li>
            <li>/&gt;Trimmed Ears: Works very well on ears as well</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Gently trims the hairs with no pulling or irritation at all.  </li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>so i can&#x27;t really comment on that part.  </li>
            <li>Worked better than expected.</li>
            <li>I debated and compared a whole slew of products before ordering anything.  </li>
            <li>This one really works, for nose hair anyway.</li>
            <li>Product works very well, would recommend.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>Trims hair really well</li>
            <li>bottom line is that it&#x27;s reasonably priced and gets the job done.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work very well in clipping the nose hairs.</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t really rave about anything</li>
            <li>It works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve hit the age when those nose hairs start getting really straggly.</li>
            <li>Works better than expected.</li>
            <li>Works very well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut as much as I would like.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t see them very well anymore.</li>
            <li>The panasonic trimmer really does the job well.</li>
            <li>So, really like this product.</li>
            <li>But not so much now.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband and it works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really got to jab it around in my nose to get the hair out</li>
            <li>Nothing really to complain about.</li>
            <li>Also very finicky about cleaning.</li>
            <li>This thing works really well.</li>
            <li>Whatever its cheap and solid.</li>
            <li>I was a plucker before, and this is soooo much nicer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t a whole heck of a lot involved in men&#x27;s grooming.</li>
            <li>Really like the way it cleans under running water.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li>The blades do have too be cleaned very often.</li>
            <li>very well built and the stock battery that comes with it</li>
            <li>Works really well and have had no issues at all.</li>
            <li>For the money it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li>thanks to Amazon and Panasonic.</li>
            <li>Thanks guys.</li>
            <li>Was gentle when removing hair.  </li>
            <li>Ergonomically very well designed.</li>
            <li>For home use or road warriors, this is a very dependable companion.</li>
            <li>my whole life.</li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really?</li>
            <li>But with this one he came  up to me and thanked me to buy it for him and said that it works really well</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product for anyone that wants to groom their ear and nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Ugh, who wants to even think about this grooming issue.</li>
            <li>I expected better from Panasonic.</li>
            <li>My husband really likes this product for his nose and ears.</li>
            <li>This product worked very well 4 or 5 times, then broke, and I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on, as if it had no power source.  </li>
            <li>It cleans very well, but requires patience if you do it once a week.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t stop them from growing, but now have a reasonable way to remove.  </li>
            <li>Returned it and Amazon issued a refund (hassle-free, thanks amazon).  </li>
            <li>This  &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; is the real McCoy....cuts through hair w/o pulls or tears.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t really see how this works</li>
            <li>Arrived fast and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s so much quieter—which is really helpful when trimming the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works very well for an inexpensive item.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, but only in price.</li>
            <li>so I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li>Functional, reasonable priced.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really work as well as described.</li>
            <li>It really is water proof.</li>
            <li>It really works well.</li>
            <li>But it does stay on very well when using it.</li>
            <li>Compared to cheap Chinese one I had:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li>Pulled nose hairs too much</li>
            <li>Nothing I can really complain about.</li>
            <li>Works even better than expected.</li>
            <li>Works very well.  </li>
            <li>Said it works very well and that it doesn&#x27;t tug or pinch when he&#x27;s using</li>
            <li>but perhaps that puts too much of a chance to suffer a skin abrasion.  </li>
            <li>None really did the job as these do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>And it does it fast.</li>
            <li>Work really well.</li>
            <li>he really likes it would recommend d</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon for taking care of this</li>
            <li>I bought this for my dad Christmas 2011, and he really likes it.</li>
            <li>It works really well, but for some reason it stopped working after not being used for a while, it lasted about 2 years.</li>
            <li>Very efficient</li>
            <li>They just never seemed to work very well</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a few similar nose/ear trimmers, but this is definitely the best ever.</li>
            <li>my dad really enjoys this shaver.</li>
            <li>Received a very damaged product.</li>
            <li>Thanks for the defective product.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>But, this continued for a whole month.</li>
            <li>My doctor gave my an antibiotic, but fornutately said not to use unless I really needed it.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic model cuts very close</li>
            <li>I really liked it and have been using for a few months without any issues.</li>
            <li>Just okay but not great as many stated.</li>
            <li>which is far better than the last trimmer</li>
            <li>Mine has lasted awhile so far, but I have this feeling that with more regular use it may not hold up</li>
            <li>This is worth paying a few dollars more for.  </li>
            <li>I got tired of trying to trim them the best I could with my regular electric shaver.</li>
            <li>I really liked it until it stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li>I have owned several nose hair trimmers and this is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li>I initially really liked this product, but after a few uses it was as if the razor became blunted</li>
            <li>We liked it enough to buy a second one for grandpa!</li>
            <li>The only thing it doesn&#x27;t do better than the old one is get stray neck hairs as well.  </li>
            <li>I got this to use for upper lip hair and it does a good job, not great but good enough.</li>
            <li>Fits nicely in either hand, not at all heavy.</li>
            <li>I have only had this for a short time, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact it takes regular old batteries too.</li>
            <li>although more frequent, is similar.  </li>
            <li>I could just imagine this getting wound up, grabbing and HOLDING a few nose hairs, and getting lodged for some hilarious pain bringing fun, but this trimmer conquers the job without even a wince.  </li>
            <li>Nice and small, has a cap for the top and it is not loud.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many different trimmers and they all have been complete junk.  </li>
            <li>The best I have ever had next to an underfed goat and does not leave behind reminders littering your yard that you must bag up for disposal.</li>
            <li>no.&lt;br /&gt;I would just have to say it is no worse than others and not a whole lot better.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my order and look forward in the near future to do business with this company again.</li>
            <li>So far so good, I would definitely recommend this if you just want a simple no nonsense</li>
            <li>Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a basic and effective trimmer.</li>
            <li>This is my third trimmer like this and by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>Overall better than the 15 year old unit it replaced.  </li>
            <li>it seems pretty safe as long as you don&#x27;t jam it up your nose way too far</li>
            <li>It also gets quite warm after using it for just a few minutes.</li>
            <li>Solid product that works as expected for a good price.</li>
            <li>At around $15 it won&#x27;t break the bank but at the same time is is made with far more attention to quality and utility.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update the review if it breaks down, but as of today, I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li>In fact, I busted my dad sniffing around this little guy at our house, so he received his very own for Christmas this last year &amp; loves it.</li>
            <li>Same as other reviewers- thing worked great initially, but after the first few uses I went to clean it, took the top apart to clean it and put it back together</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is a bit odd the first time using it - personally I was skittish</li>
            <li>While the flat blades have worked fine, the nose hair trimmer was worthless.&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li>I bought this new model Panasonic about a month ago and found it to be as good as the Panasonics of the past.  </li>
            <li>Very quiet  works very well !!!</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, efficient and just plain works.</li>
            <li>Rarely works, have to take out battery and twist the bottom back on just right for it to start.</li>
            <li>Well this little piece of magic is like a vibrator for your nose yet removes the thick bush you have growing up there very easily and pain free</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not tough at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a tough reviewed</li>
            <li>Mostly all with less than stellar results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other trimmers and this one has been BY FAR the best.</li>
            <li>while it worked properly, it did a good job with trimming those pesky nose hairs very closely without pulling or pinching (as some other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned have done).</li>
            <li>okay as well, but prefer a straight edge to do those areas as it&#x27;s hard to create a clean line with this.  </li>
            <li>Very handy, solid and heavy.</li>
            <li>Gets all the hair and is super easy to clean being a wet dry.</li>
            <li>, I decided to buy a new one hoping the first was just&lt;br /&gt;a &amp;#34;dud.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It does the job without getting hot or needing a new blade every year</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was just the battery, however even with a new battery it pulls the hair out...</li>
            <li>The first time I used it was like using a new lawn mower on a lawn that hadn&#x27;t been mown in months.</li>
            <li>Should have returned right away because within about 3 months it just stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very expensive, so I say \\&quot;grab</li>
            <li>I really like how fast it is and the multiple ways to clean the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li>the clip is always closed when you trim and open it when you clean the inside but always make sure to close it before you start</li>
            <li>It cuts quick and easy without pulling, even on the coarse facial beard hair.  </li>
            <li>Other facial hair, well not so good.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had other trimmers before but this one is much quieter and more efficient than others.</li>
            <li>Clean up is super each as the parts are removable and the blade continues to stay sharp.</li>
            <li>Instead of just buying another Panasonic, I tried 2 other brands that just weren&#x27;t as good and now have come back to Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>The original Panasonics provided a close trim but then there was a generation or two that left to much stubble.</li>
            <li>After a good rinsing it also seems to work well for trimming other stray facial hairs.</li>
            <li>but I still use a rechargeable because I already have it and keep them ready for many other things I have.</li>
            <li>The convenience of being able to use this in the shower really separates this from other brands.</li>
            <li>It does not, however, completely replace scissors for hairs that lie flat (and tickle the most).  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well, and much better than my Phillips (linear) trimmer, or any other trimmer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>It worked okay, though not amazing, each use to significant</li>
            <li>The real problem is that it eats through batteries fast, draining a new AA battery after a just a handful of uses!  </li>
            <li>This is very nice, works just as we needed it to with unnecessary hairs.  </li>
            <li>thing that would be great for a future model would be a small white LED light in the tip to make it easier to see the lighter colored hairs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer is pretty quiet, does a good trim on nose hair, the errant eyebrow hairs, inside my deep chin dimple and the occasional trim around the edge of my ears.</li>
            <li>The new trimmer is easy to hold and operates quietly.  </li>
            <li>New batteries didn&#x27;t help; they were simply drained of energy very quickly.</li>
            <li>So far has been working flawlessly for several months, same batteries and trims much closer than a previous trimmer I had.</li>
            <li>Disclaimer: although iPhones can be used in many social situations unobtrusively, I would discourage anyone from using nostril hair trimmer while dining, at a social function, or flying.</li>
            <li>I Guess I&#x27;m not a sasquatch like some of the reviewers, and need it for really the occasional trim, clean up, and stragglers.</li>
            <li>Okay, what the heck is up with getting older and having hair growing out of your nose and ears at an alarming rate?  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other one that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>Just bought this one because my other is better for travel.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any other nose clippers I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be better than than any other trimmer I have tried.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well, but I&#x27;ve picked up cheaper ones that work a little better.</li>
            <li>This little device was exactly the inexpensive solution i needed for a growing problem &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>I have not had to replace the batteries; still original that came with the unit several months ago.  </li>
            <li>Love this, doesn&#x27;t pull hair like the other one do.</li>
            <li>Works better than any other nose trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased for my husband.  </li>
            <li>Works so much better than other brands that I have used.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pull, at least yet, and is pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li>This unit is much better than my other one from Brookstone.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to have appropriate power and sharp blades.  </li>
            <li>Unlike other ones you are also able to wash it and use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li>a little warm around the metal tip, which is normal, but</li>
            <li>Seems like it&#x27;s more well made than most and will last longer than these trimmers usually do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Trims closer and has more power than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>The corrosion was easy enough to clean up, but the contacts needed to be stretched afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>After 5 mins the hairs in nose and ears are non-existent after being wookie-like for years!&lt;br /&gt;Blades are sharp and safe.</li>
            <li>My unit is not a lone, I have heard this from many other people who have owned this device....  </li>
            <li>It does the work much better than any other trimmers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li>The product feels sturdier and better made than the other&#x27;s</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t sure about this since other reviews said it quit working soon after they got it.  </li>
            <li>This thing works better than any other nose hair trimmer I have ever used</li>
            <li>This works much better than any other product or method I have used.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried three other trimmers before this, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>do I know if any of the other products listed on Amazon in this category are better.</li>
            <li>knew there was a better way for him to stay &amp;#34;manscaped&amp;#34; and leave sharp twinges of pain out of it.</li>
            <li>Quiet, painless, long battery life, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>Works much much better than the other two brands I bought from Amazon</li>
            <li>Panasonic&#x27;s other, cheaper version is better.</li>
            <li>It is better built than other nose hair removers that I have tried.</li>
            <li>but I already like it more than the other two piece-of-crap trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This works better than any other electric trimmer have tried.</li>
            <li>So much better to use than other products i have owned.</li>
            <li>Works better for ear/nose hair than any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li>Better than I expected!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Opting for automatic, I got this one, as there isn&#x27;t many other options out there.</li>
            <li>This product was much better than other Panasonic ones I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>Works better than other ones I have bought.</li>
            <li>Better than any other I have used.</li>
            <li>As described it works much better than the other type of nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>My husband has tried most of the other nose hair removal tools around, but they all hurt him.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, quiet and runs a long time on one battery.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s not very techie nor handy, and this is simple to use I didn&#x27;t notice him struggling with it for the first time or anything...</li>
            <li>This product trims nosehair better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>It cuts better than the 4 other brands I tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I left it with original pack for couple of weeks, then I started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>And after all that, I had to go back and use it again right away because it left huge conspicuous hairs untouched after the first use.  </li>
            <li>The best nose trimmer that I have ever used and highly recommend it because it has two cutting blades..</li>
            <li>Ideal for cleaning up the long hairs that are hard to get to otherwise.</li>
            <li>Really works deep and right!</li>
            <li>It just tickles my nose hairs without pulling on them and is very easy to clean with the little water spout in the back.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer it to have a little more power than the single AA battery is able to provide but the trimmer performs as advertised a with no problems.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheaper to buy a whole new one than buy parts for one!  </li>
            <li>Works great... not quite as robust as I expected, or as powerful, but generally meets or exceeds my expectations in all other areas.</li>
            <li>This is very light, much lighter than my previous trimmer, so I was concerned if it would perform as well.  </li>
            <li>Simple to clean.  </li>
            <li>He finds it simple to use and keep clean.  </li>
            <li>Should I open it up and clean it out?  </li>
            <li>use this probably once a week to just buzz areas, I&#x27;d recommend it to any guy who&#x27;s looking for a clean look, especially in the nose</li>
            <li>quiet operation, zero pulling, zero pinching, just clean to the skin &#x27;cut&#x27; of nasal hair or ear hair.</li>
            <li>It is tiny compared to most trimmers, it barely fits in my hand.  </li>
            <li>For ten bucks it&#x27;s everything I wanted to clean nose hairs.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Great unit, priced a bit higher then others but worth the extra $.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it has such great reviews.</li>
            <li>Has plenty of power and is simple to clean.  </li>
            <li>It will seem to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; with a low battery, but it really isn&#x27;t working at full speed.</li>
            <li>It is small, it works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product but doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave.</li>
            <li>After you are all done just open some cover and run this thing through some water and it will rinse itself clean.</li>
            <li>only suggestion is to take it apart and clean it out.  </li>
            <li>I ran into the same scenario; it stopped working after I went to clean it one time.</li>
            <li>I opened up the blades to clean with the included brush and put it back.</li>
            <li>simple to take apart and clean, and then reassemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean and simple.</li>
            <li>Used it for a long time and it works fine.</li>
            <li>only took me about a minute to clean my nose up</li>
            <li>This is much faster and has the added benefit of not cutting the inside of my nose if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li>Solid feeling and comes apart easily to clean.  </li>
            <li>but I can not get it open in order to clean it as per instructions.  </li>
            <li>the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Almost looks like oil mixed in with the water used to clean it.</li>
            <li>, I would suggest this to anyone need a Great Trimmer, I have tried other brands including Whal, Remington, And one or two other</li>
            <li>I can clean up my facial hair and nose hair for the price its a no brainer.</li>
            <li>When you remove to clean the device, it does not function properly.</li>
            <li>Works well simple to use and clean</li>
            <li>I especially like the way you just run it under the faucet to clean.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect that I&#x27;d have to remove the head and blade to clean, but it will probably make it last longer.</li>
            <li>Generally the item seems a bit inefficient and collectively more time consuming that manual options such as scissors etc.</li>
            <li>But this thing is powerful and actually pretty quiet.</li>
            <li>I bought it to replace an older, wall plugged nose trimmer and this one works very well.</li>
            <li>I especially like the rinse to clean feature</li>
            <li>Disappointed, after so many great reviews.</li>
            <li>Small, effective, and really well designed.</li>
            <li>First, this groomer is powerful enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Quiet and clean</li>
            <li>it does a much better job on the first go round.</li>
            <li>Sometimes words just can&#x27;t explain the way a tool can use a surprising amount of power to slice unwanted pieces of your body off so that you don&#x27;t look ridiculous when viewed from below by a shorter person, or</li>
            <li>Not cost effective if that&#x27;s how long they last.</li>
            <li>Also the clean aspect by flushing it with water design isn&#x27;t really applicable and is overall kind of pointless as it doesn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li>The product is not bad but for real it is a waste of money, I do not use it any more.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and only needs a single AAA battery.  </li>
            <li>I have used other products in the past and I have to say this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li>It is smooth and easy to trim and reach hard areas.</li>
            <li>When you don&#x27;t have time to clean up eyebrows, or bleach your top lip, this does the job in a very small amount of time.</li>
            <li>As I get older the more my hair grows from places other than my head.</li>
            <li>but if that&#x27;s the case I have other, older &amp; cheaper tools that do a much better job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick and easy to get ride of those pesky nose hairs in less than a minute, I can see myself buying a few more as christmas gifts for the clueless uncles and friends</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very well-made, solid in the hand and very smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li>very practical&lt;br /&gt;light, invisible in a pocket or brush my teeth, it is well done and thought I highly recommend</li>
            <li>Never a distraught day has gone by without the pain of me personally plucking out each individual nose hair that dared to grow outside of its limits with my own fingers.</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised at the quality given the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for the results and the reasonable price.</li>
            <li>I think it will eventually fall down to the original price of $12-13 whenever it becomes available directly through amazon.</li>
            <li>I finally decided to buy this for my husband as a joke, and he was the most excited for this gift over any other gift!</li>
            <li>Running the trimmer head under the faucet may not be enough for maintenance; consider keeping a can of Cool Care (B000LNB8HK) on hand to clean, lubricate and disinfect your clippers; it comes in a big 15.5 oz.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; batteries so much as it just won&#x27;t work, period, with brand new</li>
            <li>The trim is so incredibly close and with such little effort, no pulling, and such ease.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s not much to say really, its a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>it works but isn&#x27;t as easy and convenient as I anticipated; maybe I expected too much.</li>
            <li>Old unit was easy on the battery, I had one alkaline last for years and the one that&#x27;s in it</li>
            <li>Does a good job, wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and gets the hair off your ears, in your ears where ever that old age hair starts to grow next.</li>
            <li>lasting good time now almost one year and a half.</li>
            <li>They cut good and he likes the wet &amp; dry option as well.</li>
            <li>Works wet just as good as it does dry.</li>
            <li>is a ok item still too much money as a bundle deal,should be less as a bundle deal wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and get razor bumps easily, I use it to trim my nose and facial hair.</li>
            <li>Debated spending a tiny bit less with other models, but this one is awesome.  </li>
            <li>Product has lasted less than a year with very light use.</li>
            <li>little device is well worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly and without any problems!</li>
            <li>The clean up is NOT easy and I do not notice a significant change after use.</li>
            <li>I have only used it a few times but so far it works great.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean, performs as expected, and low price.</li>
            <li>if it breaks in a couple of months its cheap as dirt, I don&#x27;t care as long as I keep getting results like I</li>
            <li>Easy to use and clean, simple to operate, gets the job done with minimal hair pulling.  </li>
            <li>Quiet and more powerful than I expected.  </li>
            <li>The instructions are pretty clear there is an on/off switch and a dial indicating operational or cleaning mode.</li>
            <li>Actually, I can&#x27;t really imagine more expensive products doing a better job than this one.</li>
            <li>I recommend putting it near the area you want to trim first and then turn it on...</li>
            <li>Ive tried several different trimmers and most don&#x27;t trim very well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice, small, and eash to use.</li>
            <li>Small, inexpensive, lightweight, compact and effective.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet...  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s the only thing keeping me from giving it a full five stars.  </li>
            <li>The following is true</li>
            <li>Way cool facial hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I&#x27;ve been seeing ads for rotary nose hair trimmers all my life and when I was young</li>
            <li>My husband is pretty young.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s small, and you have to purchase your own AA batteries</li>
            <li>Well what better way to really look truly your best by trimming that disgusting nose hair sticking out of your nose!</li>
            <li>Both models not only remove hair similarly, but battery life is the same, despite the claimed superior specs of the ER GN30K model.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for both the occasional prune and, when necessary, massive deforestation.  </li>
            <li>Still catches nose hairs pretty frequently</li>
            <li>Small and effective.</li>
            <li>Tip is too small to effectively cover areas. .  </li>
            <li>: I bought this in early August, received it the first week of August and used it twice since its purchase.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not worth the time and money to bother, I know for sure</li>
            <li>Later, I ordered Andis Cool Care Plus for Clipper Blades and that did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I argue that if you go after a full beard with just an electric razor, it will probably offer similar hair plucking.  </li>
            <li>First thing I did was use my old nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Breaks after return period is up and warranty replacement and shipping is more than buying another, but who wants another that will only last 32 days?</li>
            <li>The key for a good personal trimmer seems to be enough power.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Unique to the Vortex is a spinning cutter and cone shape, which both contribute towards its better than average job.</li>
            <li>tweeze my nose hair sometimes, and while it&#x27;s not really painful it does put my sinuses on overdrive which makes my nose run and my eyes tear up briefly.</li>
            <li>Have used a few trimmers in my day and this particular trimmer stands out so far as being designed to be the most useful of the bunch.</li>
            <li>Cuts most of my hair in my nose, gets all the little hairs on my chin and cheeks, but when I tried it on my eyebrows it made my eyebrow bright red, so not really useful if you want to use it for that use.</li>
            <li>Like with anything, as long as you maintain this and regularly clean it, it works very well.</li>
            <li>I am glad my Conair broke down.  </li>
            <li>My hair has slowed down growing on top and is now sprouting from my nose and ears.  </li>
            <li>Better design allowing for quiet operation, quick cutting and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>My husband says this trimmer works better than any other he has ever owned and has lasted longer as well!</li>
            <li>Way better than all the other cheapo imposters!  </li>
            <li>MUCH better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li>So be sure to read the user&#x27;s manual carefully before using !!</li>
            <li>As everyone who follows this thread knows, a few years ago Panasonic had a very fine product, the er 411.</li>
            <li>Good little personal grooming device.  </li>
            <li>This little item keeps unwanted hair out of many places, and travels really well.</li>
            <li>He is the only one that uses it, so I believe just rinses the little tip off &amp; it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li>With so little motor RPM that is likely a good guess.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t encountered any problem so far, definitely much better than my previous unbranded one which I bought very cheap.</li>
            <li>Yes ( even with new batteries!)</li>
            <li>This was a gift for my husband  who needed a new trimmer and he loves this one!</li>
            <li>Lesson learned, use a new battery when you start!  </li>
            <li>You will see it in the photo along side my new Panasonic Trimmer!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bog down like most and has a clever water port for rinsing.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, quiet, and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I have used several similar products in the past and my Panasonic is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>Thirty dollar stainless still sharp scissors from two decades ago aren&#x27;t this easy.</li>
            <li>Actually works great, with no pain, cuts hard to reach places.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is a bit tricky and hard to get used to, but the locking mechanism confirms a secure fit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean, gets every hard to reach hair.</li>
            <li>Seems much more powerful than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used with the same battery.  </li>
            <li>though this product isn&#x27;t really for me, the combination of the warranty, the ability of using it with water / getting it wet, performance, and for the price, I would say this is a good buy for anyone who needs to trim some hair in their nose or ear without sticking sharp objects in it.  </li>

            <li>Far superior to other brands of a similar item.</li>
            <li>Even with a new alkaline battery, the chopping power falls off fast.  </li>
            <li>New to trimming nose hair, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this to.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Panasonic for my new friends.</li>
            <li>It was time to replace the blade anyway, and it&#x27;s easier and cheaper to just buy a whole new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That makes it cheaper to buy a whole new unit every 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I really needed one, had been putting off getting a new one.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s barely trimming any of my nose hair right now.</li>
            <li>I use it mainly for my ears, so that it is easier for me to insert ear plugs at night to sleep (We live in a really noisy neighbourhood.).</li>
            <li>The blade is the most expensive part of the trimmer according to panasonics website, its just better to purchase a whole new one on amazon.</li>
            <li>Really good for precise sculpting without risk of cutting yourself.</li>
            <li>but this was a better buy and less susceptible to injury and a trip to the hospital.</li>
            <li>Less is more with this.</li>
            <li>Works much better than the previous model.</li>
            <li>It does a much better job than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li>It works a lot better that the &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; model I had previously.</li>
            <li>The rounded cap on top has a blade on the inside, the blade is placed slightly lower than the tip of the cap.</li>
            <li>better than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li>So glad I got one of these, takes less time and it works so well....</li>
            <li>It does a much better job than the previous models.  </li>
            <li>Seems to be much better made than my previous con-air.  </li>
            <li>Is holding up better than the previous one (don&#x27;t recall the brand), but it eats batteries.</li>
            <li>Then, after owning it for less than 6 months and using it maybe a dozen times at most, it never turned on at all.</li>
            <li>Previous competitive models have done a better job of trimming.</li>
            <li>Easy clean-up using the wet feature for cleaning out the hair using tap water.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also used the Norelco NT9110, which I thought worked well compared to others, but I think the Panasonic Vortex is more thorough with less effort.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised and is better than the previous device I owned.  </li>
            <li>Way better than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li>The product is also made with a slight curve as to better maneuver inside your nostrils, and believe me it does make a difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving it a four because it works much better than the previous two I purchased (Wahl and Conaire).</li>
            <li>The cleanup is also super simple, with a twist water is allowed to flow freely through the appliance and dry as well.</li>
            <li>previously I had a trimmer that had vertical blades, the spinning blades on this work much better.</li>
            <li>Works well and seem to clip better than the ones I have had previously.</li>
            <li>Works well and seem to clip better than the ones I have had previously.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s not very noisy.</li>
            <li>This is a problem I&#x27;ve noticed in most nose-hair trimmers which I find odd, but it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Much better made than my previous one.</li>
            <li>Seems like after 50 you get less hair where you want it and a lot more where you don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>Works better trimming than previous versions.  </li>
            <li>Love that it has a slight curve making it easier to operate.  </li>
            <li>Previously had a Remington trimmer, and this is much better.</li>
            <li>Now, my life is like a beer commercial with my super shiny sniffer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li>It cleans easier than the older versions but doesn&#x27;t cut hair as well</li>
            <li>I HAD AN OLDER VERSION OF THIS THAT LASTED 10 YEARS</li>
            <li>Its quiet, quick, and efficient.</li>
            <li>As I got older nose hair become another grooming issue that I was not used to having to deal with.</li>
            <li>First off, this is my first and only nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li>My only issue, and I need to figure this out, is that it seems to have more energy when I use a regular battery.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I plan to do when my older Panasonic \\&quot;dies\\&quot;  ... \\&quot;perish the thought.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Worked well initially but quickly faded.</li>
            <li>My husband and I have been looking for a decent trimmer for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li>Tried many different batteries and it simply won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>It not only cuts better, but is quieter at the same time.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure you could find a more expensive one</li>
            <li>But, as I get older, I seem to be growing hair in all the areas that I would prefer not to.  </li>
            <li>as we get older we find we have hair growing out of spots that we could never imagine.  </li>
            <li>I particularly like the cleaning ability for this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I compared it to a older design (that I still have) of a Panasonic nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li>I mainly purchased this product as a way of getting a close trip on my mustache around the nose area.</li>
            <li>after buying the first one I bought a second just in case it is not longer sold when the first one wears out..</li>
            <li>This is a classic example of</li>
            <li>does a decent job</li>
            <li>Seems to do a decent job.  </li>
            <li>It has been working great and battery seems to last at least a couple of months.  </li>
            <li>Particularly on and in my ears and nose hair.  </li>
            <li>This item replaces an older Panasonic nose and ear hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>Work great so far, not sure if it will last long, but anyway it was cheap</li>
            <li>Decent product.</li>
            <li>No amount of care you take with this product can keep it alive when it is just made to be as cheap as possible.</li>
            <li>Granted, it&#x27;s only been used once, but it did the job quickly, efficiently and I wasn&#x27;t bleeding when I was done</li>
            <li>I expect this product to last for years, but even if it only makes it to the two year warranty, I&#x27;d be satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li>This replaced an older model that lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li>I even gave it one of those classic accidental drops upon opening and it was unscathed.</li>
            <li>hairs men get on their ears when they get older</li>
            <li>Takes a few passes and different angles but get the job done, good value.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using a older panasonic for over 10 years</li>
            <li>There is no pain involved with trimming nose hair only a tickling that luckily hasn&#x27;t caused me to sneeze... yet.</li>
            <li>It trims the places that us older guys want to trim, ears, nose, eyebrows..</li>
            <li>He wanted it mainly for nose hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older and hairy</li>
            <li>Decent.  </li>
            <li>but I mainly use it for nose hairs.</li>
            <li>(I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid ear hair so far, so I can’t speak to that.</li>
            <li>He said he likes them better than the last one I bought that lasted for several years.  </li>
            <li>I had a Panasonic a few years back that I loved.  </li>
            <li>Decent on nose hair but doesn&#x27;t get everything.</li>
            <li>However, motors do not last more than about a year with occasional use.</li>
            <li>Seems to work well and have a decent battery life.</li>
            <li>No pulling, quick, quiet.</li>
            <li>I once had one of these panasonic nose and facial hair trimmer and it was just ok, (earlier model).  </li>
            <li>(why is it as I grow older, I get less hair on my head and more in those places?)  </li>
            <li>Replaced an older style Panasonic trimer with this one and what a difference.</li>
            <li>Your getting older when you need one of these lol&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have nose hairs that stick out and are always tickling me and this thing does a decent job of getting rid of them.</li>
            <li>Build quality is decent for something in this price range.</li>
            <li>Battery life is decent.</li>
            <li>I had an older panasonic.</li>
            <li>This frankly doesn&#x27;t do that great a job, especially since I have some thick hair.</li>
            <li>This is done cleanly, quietly and quickly with no pain at all.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of this particular model, but in my experience, even with the &#x27;cheapest&#x27; models, longevity has never been the issue.  </li>
            <li>I have tried one or two other clippers and they didn&#x27;t work at all, so I am pleased so far!</li>
            <li>but it works decently.  </li>
            <li>I replaced on older Panasonic hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>The small size makes it sweet to fit into my cosmetic drawer.</li>
            <li>It seems as I get older hair is migrating from where I want it - to where I do not want it.</li>
            <li>As i stated in my review for my ER430K, I bought this item in order to use its blade as a replacement part for my much older</li>
            <li>This is a decent quality trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li>Decent trimmer.</li>
            <li>Way better then traditional scissors which has risk of damaging nose inner skins.</li>
            <li>It does seem to use a battery up sort of quick, but that is the only downside.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that the battery life isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li>Though, it&#x27;s still a decent buy for the price, I guess.</li>
            <li>have read where people have mixed reviews when it came to them touching up their facial hair and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>you will have to go back and touch up with a regular scissors every now and again, but mostly this will be all you need.</li>
            <li>After using several products totally in love with this one, especially for its performance, looks and ability to do what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li>As I get older, I have less hair on my head, and more everywhere else.  </li>
            <li>As I have gotten older</li>
            <li>Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li>Decent value for price.</li>
            <li>You can also do a quick, simple mustache touch up with it.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a gift &amp; it&#x27;s much more solid than the current 1</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m older and as I age</li>
            <li>The older one still worked, but I knew I&#x27;d never use it  again.</li>
            <li>, it was pretty quiet when I first got it, try not to drop yours.</li>
            <li>I have owned several of these in different brands, and this one is distinctly better than any of the others.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace an older Panasonic unit which needed to have the blades replaced.  </li>
            <li>As guys get older eyebrows, ears and nose hair grows.</li>
            <li>Trims hair quickly and painlessly and then stores away in a bathroom drawer until the next time you need some grooming.</li>
            <li>It seems the older</li>
            <li>Definitely a worthwhile purchase, especially if the barber is starting to trim nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>Bought it as a gift and the feedback is that it does a decent job on nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>My how things change when you get older.</li>
            <li>I thought that this would be great as I usually have long nose hairs</li>
            <li>It does the job - I use it mainly for nose hair.</li>
            <li>Works well and was decent value for the price.</li>
            <li>These tend to last me about 3-4 years but would probably last more if I didn&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li>This trimmer worked way better than one I had for several years prior.</li>
            <li>So simple to use, quick and painless.</li>
            <li>Had an older Panasonic  and</li>
            <li>I would use the Panasonic to target a particular area, but afterwards it did not do its job.</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;ve been getting older, hairs have begun sprouting out of areas</li>
            <li>Buy in a pinch decent price...</li>
            <li>As I&#x27;m getting older, these frikkin nose hairs have been just driving me nuts.  </li>
            <li>first I thought they might hurt my nose, but the exact opposite  happened.</li>
            <li>My son recommended it and its working better than I thought it would having had several over the years that simply did not do the job.</li>
            <li>decent product for a decent price</li>
            <li>Motor sounded powerful, but did not actually trim very well.  </li>
            <li>I use it mainly to maintain the hair in nostrils, over the ears a couple of times a month</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a series of cheapos (older wahl, etc.)</li>
            <li>This is a decent product.</li>
            <li>i would recommend it particularly for guys like me who have a wife with a nose hair problem and will not admit it..</li>
            <li>A quick twist and then blow out the clippings - simple.</li>
            <li>I am getting older now</li>
            <li>Does not do even a decent job.  </li>
            <li>I was using a less sophisticated nose trimmer, which was decent, but required turning and angling to get at the nasal hairs.</li>
            <li>its decent for the price.</li>
            <li>Decent for the price.  </li>
            <li>we get older</li>
            <li>Otherwise a decent value</li>
            <li>Save yourself the time and aggravation and just get a decent nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Top screen above the speaker was dented, and after pairing with my phone, there was simply no audio, even after turning the volume up.</li>
            <li>This is a decent nose trimmer for the cost.</li>
            <li>My older one&#x27;s blade got screwed up</li>
            <li>If it does, I doubt there&#x27;s a similar product in the same price range that&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li>This unit was purchased to replace an older  unit.  </li>
            <li>All of the reviews were strong, so I expected this to work well.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use full batteries.pulls a little with low batteries.</li>
            <li>Much more powerful than other cheap trimmers I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>, then it started making very loud noises, still seemed to work, but the noise was too much.  </li>
            <li>It took many passes whereas my previous trimmer cut the hair on the very first swipe with no extra pressure required.</li>
            <li>Ergonomically comfortable, it uses a single AA battery.  </li>
            <li>If you still have trouble breathing, get an air filter and a good vacuum for your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It has worked very well so far, even in the shower!</li>
            <li>Very please so far with this purchase!</li>
            <li>This seemingly oversized trimmer really does work, without the pain of rusty old scissors!  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t last long when they get wet as the blade rusts, but for the price they are great</li>
            <li>I got this for my fiance for Christmas because he really needed one and he has no complaints so far!</li>
            <li>Does the job very well, I like it so far!</li>
            <li>But, thanks to my Cro-Magnon buddies for me being alive!</li>
            <li>It works very well, pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li>Worked better than expected, easy to use, not much clean up.</li>
            <li>, cant say how long it will last but for the price if it last a year or 2 that will be good</li>
            <li>After a while, though, it stopped working because of too many hairs getting trapped inside, and my cleaning it out would not get it back to full operation.</li>
            <li>Said it was kind of loud especially in his ears but as long as it works</li>
            <li>Fair warning, if you are trimming your nose and the blade gets stuck on a particularly thick nose hair, you are in for a bit of pain!</li>
            <li>Also, when you clean the blade and put it back in place, if you push down too far the machine becomes a lot more noisy.  </li>
            <li>Great for quickly and painlessly trimming those pesky little hairs that grow in delicate areas.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted and expected, and the product got to my house quickly.</li>
            <li>Old unit wasn&#x27;t waterproof, new one not only is, but is much easier to clean with its flow through cutter head feature.  </li>
            <li>The blades come fairly sharp already and more or less cut the hair easily.</li>
            <li>Will highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>

            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>in all, this one comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li>So, if you want that clean look with no wild hair in your eye brows, ear and nose, this is the trimer for you.</li>
            <li>It can be rinsed when needed ( always clean with soap and water after using it in your nose) and has long battery life.</li>
            <li>my ears and nose have not been so clean of hair in a long time.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to use and that it is much safer than I expected.</li>
            <li>Works well and easy to clean WELL with the wet dry design.  </li>
            <li>As long as you keep it clean</li>
            <li>I like to stay clean, and this product does it for my long nose hairs.</li>
            <li>By far its better than the other trimmers I have bought.</li>
            <li>It leaves my nose trimmed as expected and has held up just fine.</li>
            <li>It seems to be well-made and I particularly like that it is warranteed and the battery life of one AA battery, with normal use, is about two years.  </li>
            <li>This meant that I&#x27;d always have to keep a super fresh battery in it, and was constantly dealing with low motor speeds and pulled hairs.</li>
            <li>Wow this nose trimmer blows my other one out of the water , love it</li>
            <li>Over all I think this light duty tool will be able to tame my nose hairs for a long time.</li>
            <li>A bit bulkier than expected, when compared to another Panasonic hair remover I had owned before, but works fine</li>
            <li>use it mostly for my ears(dry mode not in the shower),last thing you want in your 50&#x27;s-60&#x27;s is a buzz of high decibels taking out what little hearing you have left.&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li>U certainly have to be awake when using this even in the early morning</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, compact, and very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very cheaply made, and the battery does not last that long.</li>
            <li>But over the years it got older and older and I needed to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>No complaints so far!!</li>
            <li>I love this little device--I&#x27;ve had it about 2 or 3 weeks</li>
            <li>Avoid and get something a little more durable.</li>
            <li>Wish it felt a little better made</li>
            <li>Tickles a little bit, but not horrible.  </li>
            <li>(Dropped one too many times on its little trimmer head).  </li>
            <li>after two or three of those little beasts, I just happened to remember my favorite site.....</li>
            <li>Received this today and it works a lot better then those little scissors.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand why they have the rotating top that opens and closes a little port on the side.  </li>
            <li>Love this little trimmer.</li>
            <li>They definitely say go gentle!!</li>
            <li>A little more money</li>
            <li>I love this little thing.</li>
            <li>Could use a little more oomph.</li>
            <li>, I tried this little gadget and am quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li>I must say I am a little embarrassed, but if one person can avoid my experience that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>Well worth a few bucks to clean the excess.</li>
            <li>New one seems to be harder on the battery, take more juice to work, so I&#x27;ll be surprised if a brand new battery lasts 6 months.  </li>
            <li>The unit appears well built and has performed well for removing nose and other undesirable hair easily and painlessly.</li>
            <li>Sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Sharp an easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use and does not pull hair like other models.</li>
            <li>The sound is a little funny</li>
            <li>Makes what used to be a most unpleasant chore into a quick and easy task which takes no time at all.</li>
            <li>People who sell this kind of stuff should have a hard time sleeping at night.</li>
            <li>The motor is strong and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li>I was baffled by the price of this trimmer, as it almost seems hard to believe they can make something this nice for this cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use and much better than his previous Shaper Image trimmer, which was more expensive.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I need something a little more powerful, so if you are an especially hairy person, you might want to try something else.  </li>
            <li>that is pretty standard for a decent trimmer, but what sets this unit apart is that it washable!  </li>
            <li>After many years of use, the first one became dull.  </li>
            <li>I was super aprehensive about the first time of using this, but this thing seems to just trim the hairs instead of ripping them out like some other products.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable and my Dad likes it better than the more expensive one he had last.</li>
            <li>Had an older name brand trimmer that was worn out and a new brand name trimmer that I just opened.  </li>
            <li>I bought this one for less than half the price, and the new blade lacked the \\&quot;tug and yank\\&quot; feature that I had been accustomed to...for the price this is a great unit.</li>
            <li>Too bad because it would be perfect if it lasted.</li>
            <li>Excellent product in a minefield of bad versions of this type of thing.</li>
            <li>Nothing to complicated and great results.</li>
            <li>Not sure what I expected lol</li>
            <li>Since Panasonic doesn&#x27;t sell a cheap replacement top, the whole trimmer is useless.</li>
            <li>I found a great way if not perfect way to cut the hairs in my nostrils.</li>
            <li>The trimmer makes a grinding sound even after thorough cleanings and careful re-assembly.</li>
            <li>Cheap and works as expected</li>
            <li>He says it works really well and has had no issues with it so far.</li>
            <li>Does very well on ears and nose for this hirsute old man.  </li>
            <li>Wish I had not wasted so much time with the Remington.</li>
            <li>Be sure to clean it after every use, or  the cutting blade is going to get funky quickly.</li>
            <li>Great item for the price can not go wrong , I will recommend this item to any one who needs it</li>
            <li>This is as described and works very well so far.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve surprised myself with how much I use this.</li>
            <li>There is a stainless thimble-shaped-safety-cover which fits over the rotating blades that permit nostril hairs to be trimmed but avoiding direct contact of the blades to the skin.</li>
            <li>My wife and I believe in keeping a neat and professional appearance and now that I am 35 I have to keep up with the areas that use to not require so much attention.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised to find it is gentle but efficient.  </li>
            <li>but I had expected that from a detailed trimmer.</li>
            <li>I dutifully clean it after every use and dry as recommended.  </li>
            <li>So here&#x27;s the deal: I was embarrassed to buy a trimmer like this because I find the whole nose hair thing--the fact that I am so old that I have to contend with it--humiliating.  </li>
            <li>After a very noisy experience with my old, shameful trimmer that died,  I ordered this one based on the overwheming reviews.</li>
            <li>This is an awesome trimmer and my husband was shocked at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>Works very well and haven&#x27;t had a problem in nearly 6 months.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be surprised if the handle even stays attached for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>but I have to say that this one works very well so far.</li>
            <li>Much better than another one I had picked up a few years ago.  </li>
            <li>Seems powerful enough.</li>
            <li>Trimmed hair in my ear and instant success.</li>
            <li>As this is my first nose and facial hair trimmer, I don&#x27;t have much to compare with.</li>
            <li>Only had it a few weeks, but so far so good.</li>
            <li>It truly is worth the extra money.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it worked just ok for a few weeks then just quit.</li>
            <li>The motor is powerful and does not choke like similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Spend few more dollars or wait till price is $10 for this one.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll use more than once every few months.</li>
            <li>Come to think of it, though ... for the price, if it only lasts six months it would still be worth it.</li>
            <li>Ladies, Gents, pay a few dollars more for the Brookstone.</li>
            <li>My husband loved this gift - if only I had known sooner what pleasure small things can make in one&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li>After reading the reviews it seemed like a nice buy, although I did notice 5-10% of the negative reviews indicated that it quit working soon after arrival.  </li>
            <li>;, but given the proximity to the olfactory senses while in use, I suppose any oddities like that would be pretty apparent.</li>
            <li>It is not overly powerful as it only requires one AA battery.</li>
            <li>Powerful but quiet.</li>
            <li>You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I got this item 2 years ago and it has been getting progressively weaker (as if a battery was getting weaker, even though I placed fresh batteries inside constantly).</li>
            <li>also like that it uses normal AA batteries.</li>
            <li>so will see how long it will last. :)</li>
            <li>It is powerful enough that it doesn&#x27;t pull any hairs.</li>
            <li>Wasnt&#x27; worth to send back</li>
            <li>sure didnt last long</li>
            <li>but I think it is not relevant to the product. :)</li>
            <li>I have a couple different brands of the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; style personal trimmer (not rotary a blade, but the kind that vibrate back and forth like a barber&#x27;s clippers).</li>
            <li>I usually trust Panasonic to make good quality electronics, but this item fell apart after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>have about ten nose trimmers now, none worth 5 cents.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t openly weep when my nose hairs get pulled out, but honestly, it isn&#x27;t fun.  </li>
            <li>I feel like I barely used it so pretty bummed out that I have to pay for another one so soon.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than sticking a pair of scissors up your nose; however, on occasion takes a few pass-throughs to achieve the job.</li>
            <li>I cannot comment on longevity because I have not had it for more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li>This seems to be a powerful enough trimmer for me.</li>
            <li>34;WHAT is that strange thing in your bathroom?!&amp;#34; I tell them it is neither an instrument of pleasure nor torture, only a most practical item to get me out of hairy situations.</li>
            <li>The next brand just didn&#x27;t trim worth a darn.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought a few of these over the years, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned a few over the years, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>for $12 it isn&#x27;t worth sending back or complaining.</li>
            <li>sure beats the alternative (not living long enough to experience hairy nostrils)</li>
            <li>Battery doesn&#x27;t last long even though it sits in a drawer most of the time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After using it the first time, I even feel like my noise has a different airflow, didn&#x27;t know how much difference it would make.</li>
            <li>I normally use for nose hair.</li>
            <li>These trimmers are all pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used numerous nose hair trimmers with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li>First one lasted barely one year.</li>
            <li>Well worth the (low) price.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned two different trimmers in the past, and neither was as good as this one.</li>
            <li>For such a low price I didn&#x27;t expect such a nice product.</li>
            <li>it really is quiet like all of reviewers mention and seems to be worth what I paid.  </li>
            <li>He ruined the first one and now wants to order a second one.</li>
            <li>I use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li>Not much else to say than that it works effectively without a whole lot of fluff.</li>
            <li>Powerful, efficient, and simple to use.</li>
            <li>Works as intended, long battery life, fairly quiet, great for male or female.  </li>
            <li>So much so that I&#x27;m willing to publicly admit I use it.  </li>
            <li>Powerful, yet quiet.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t fully satisfied with the nose hairs that were still in my nose after whirling this thing around a few times.  </li>
            <li>Should survive accidental drops and normal wear and tear.  </li>
            <li>But after reading the reviews and seeing the low price I decided that it was worth giving a shot.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li>I tried without success to pry it open.</li>
            <li>Works ok nothing to write home about...eats batteries  died after 2 months waste of money</li>
            <li>I used it many times without any trouble.</li>
            <li>On off switch big and useful.</li>
            <li>There is nothing cool about walking around with daddy long legs hanging out.</li>
            <li>Its worth keeping for the low price.</li>
            <li>Given the better quality of this model, I expect we&#x27;ll be using it for quite a few years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what more to say: this works very well.  </li>
            <li>Worked better for few months but now replacing.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s mentioned it a few times saying I love the nose trimmer you got.</li>
            <li>I usually go all over as much as I can and it gets most hair out.</li>
            <li>it is good but not great...</li>
            <li>Works good not great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not a good design with poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Still doesnt live up to my, apparently high, standards though.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the cheap Remington ones, or the ones from Walmart before, and they always seem to break down or not cut very well.  </li>
            <li>It would be great to have a vacuum system to catch the hairs and for literally a few extra dollars, panasonic has a model that does just that</li>
            <li>I used it for about 9 months and it just died completely, under very normal use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The speed of the trimmer blades is very much dependent on the batteries, so make sure to use new or charged batteries before using.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works well for both dry and wet conditions and trims without causing pain.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s small and easy to use...enough said!</li>
            <li>This is the first nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased that has lasted more than six months and works well wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>This works every bit as well or better and costs much less!</li>
            <li>This one does the job just fine like the other one did.</li>
            <li>This shaver worked fine for a while until the other day...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting on in years and hair is growing in new places, this is the thing to have to keep myself well-groomed and looking like a responsible adult.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to let it air dry before putting it back together after cleaning it.</li>
            <li>Nice that it&#x27;s wet dry</li>
            <li>Wet dry is nice feature.  </li>
            <li>I only used it about 8-10 times at most (always dry).</li>
            <li>So far it seems to work well, better than a previous model...</li>
            <li>But easy either way.&lt;br /&gt;Little on the big side, smaller would be easier to control.</li>
            <li>it then can kind of pull your hair rather then burning it off quickly which results in an uncomfortable pinching of your nose hair</li>
            <li>I keep it hidden because it&#x27;s not the most classy rasor to have.</li>
            <li>If I hadn&#x27;t been trimming on a regular basis I would have enough ear hair now to easily braid them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So quiet, in fact, that you wonder if it is strong enough.  </li>
            <li>Nothing amazing, I mean, it&#x27;s a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>So far my husband is happy with this trimmer he has had a few other brands over the years</li>
            <li>Was delighted that this is stronger, faster, mad more versatile since I can even trim the beard  growing out of the deep dimple in my chin.  </li>
            <li>We&#x27;ve had several other types but this one really prefer the most.</li>
            <li>They finally got it right.</li>
            <li>Right away, I ordered a trimmer for him, which he uses regularly and frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It is possible that the one I have is just not quite right.</li>
            <li>The price was right and it came in a very short time.</li>
            <li>If I remember right I payed $20 for the last pare of scissors and this thing is a lot safer to use.</li>
            <li>so I am in the market for a different brand right now.  </li>
            <li>, I might go for the next model up, which vacuums the trimmings right out of your proboscis.</li>
            <li>I have had a full beard for a very long time</li>
            <li>It is definitely cheap and not long lasting.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a Remington trimmer that was becoming a nuisance due to frequent jamming.</li>
            <li>This is much quieter than the old one and gives you a wet option to clean.</li>
            <li>I bought it to clean up the edges of my very mild beard, and instead of cutting cleanly, it pulls and cuts the hair.</li>
            <li>This little trimmer is great for those embarrassing little hairs that ladies sometimes get on their face, ears, nose, etc.  </li>
            <li>instructrons not clear, battery used up too quickly.  </li>
            <li>The price is unbeatable, particularly considering I paid almost this much for a manual device that didn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;Now, instead of looking like an old hobbit, I look like an old elf.</li>
            <li>first few times got a little cuts but when you use to it it works good.</li>
            <li>I have tried a few of the trimmers over the last few year, This one is by far the best of the lot.  </li>
            <li>it is MUCH quieter, it has less vibration and which leads to less tickling, it is smaller in overall size and more portable, and it has better \\&quot;first</li>
            <li>Evidently my blades on my old one had gotten dull, as this did a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sure, you could replace it with an entire new set for the price of a takeout meal, but it feels like such a huge waste.</li>
            <li>Even on a single AA battery, it works at full speed.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re not going to shave a beard off with it or anything, but it works fine for touching up spots after shaving or in around difficult areas like the nose and ears and whatnot.</li>
            <li>Not a lot of power, bogs down too easily, and battery life is so-so with this</li>
            <li>It cuts the nose hairs down easily.</li>
            <li>I bought this by mistake to remove fine female facial hair.</li>
            <li>Switch does not seem cheap like some other models.</li>
            <li>With replacement blades and nose assembly no longer available, I was due, overdue, for an update.  </li>
            <li>For the price (I ordered some other items, making shipping free)</li>
            <li>This is easy to clean, relatively quiet and small to store.</li>
            <li>I was afraid to use it at first because my skin is so sensitive anyway, but it works great.  </li>
            <li>I do ears, eyebrows, nose, and other precise areas of thinner</li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and it provides a comfortable trim.  </li>
            <li>Kept it germ free and sharp for 3 yrs.</li>
            <li>It stopped working due to cheaply made battery compartment.</li>
            <li>I can rub my nose freely without fear of a sharp unforgiving pain, one that I’m</li>
            <li>its works ok on nose, little loud for ears</li>
            <li>I expected it to have a more powerful motor or sharper blades or something for all the rave reviews, but it&#x27;s entirely average.</li>
            <li>This handy little trimmer trimmed it back with no irritation.</li>
            <li>sometimes gets a little warm, but I use it once a week or so now so it doesn&#x27;t have to be on very long and thus that isn&#x27;t much of an issue for me.  </li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed about this Panasonic trimmer is that it looks and feels like a high quality precision instrument, and it performs the same way.</li>
            <li>If it is a somewhat less full battery it is only is able to give some power then when it trims your facial hair (I use it for my nose)...</li>
            <li>My husband wanted a new nose hair trimmer for awhile.  </li>
            <li>I replaced it with a new AA battery</li>
            <li>Needed a new one and this one &amp;#34;fits the bill&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Have tried a number of new batteries to no avail.</li>
            <li>had to buy a new one from the pharmacy on a urgent basis.</li>
            <li>Bring in the new.</li>
            <li>The new one runs quieter.</li>
            <li>I have tried putting new batteries and whatnot but still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>After a year or so, it wasn&#x27;t working as well as it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li>None of them were dropped or hit on anything; they just no longer turned on one day and new batteries made no difference.</li>
            <li>Mine needs a new battery every time to use.</li>
            <li>would not buy another of this type, and will try something else out when I decide to get a new one.</li>
            <li>every time i used it i feel like new</li>
            <li>I was shopping for a new nose hair trimmer after my trimmer from The Sharper Image stopped working.  </li>
            <li>This new unit is about 2.5 times the height, but all is well.</li>
            <li>and I just wanted a new one.  </li>
            <li>He has tried to replace the batteries thinking it was the lack of battery power but even with new batteries it is no longer turning on or working.</li>
            <li>After using one for 6 years that conked out my husband needed a new one and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li>new batteries revealed that the unit was grasping for life.</li>
            <li>Inserted a new, fully charged Eneloop AA battery.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stopped working despite a new battery.</li>
            <li>how new a batter I put in it</li>
            <li>I shopped for a new one quite a bit.</li>
            <li>The battery is brand new.  </li>
            <li>I just know with new batteries, it still didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>My husband  live it .</li>
            <li>so I am in the market for a new one</li>
            <li>although i cant speak of its durability since it is new.</li>
            <li>Yes I did try new batteries to no avail.</li>
            <li>Today it stopped working despite a new battery.  </li>
            <li>and I am a new man</li>
            <li>The battery compartment for this brand new one also smells like fish</li>
            <li>I put in a brand new battery and still nothing.  </li>
            <li>I tied to put a new battery in it</li>
            <li>All it needed was a new battery.  </li>
            <li>(I checked by replacing the battery with a brand new battery).  </li>
            <li>Compared to new scissors, Panasonic was competitive in price.</li>
            <li>it had been updated with a new design.  </li>
            <li>I put a brand new battery in my brand new trimmer.  </li>
            <li>, I figured it was easier and cheaper not to try and find the part, but just order a new trimmer.  </li>
            <li>And always requires a new blade.</li>
            <li>This was a new product for me</li>
            <li>Panasonic says mail it in, but shipping costs almost what a new one does.  </li>
            <li>We live in a disposable world.</li>
            <li>A new battery did nothing.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t look like the hairy creature from Star-wars, I do find that as I age hair sprouts from ever new places.  </li>
            <li>The shocker came at 6 months when, despite new batteries, the unit started to pull.  </li>
            <li>So I went to buy a new blade.  </li>
            <li>The new trimmer itself sold for $12.50, a replacement blade cost $17 even on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Even with a brand new battery, the trimmer lacks power and behaves as if it is about to run out of juice.</li>
            <li>Tried new batteries, still nothing.</li>
            <li>I buy a new one every 1.5 years.</li>
            <li>My husband asked me to buy him new scissors to trim his nose hairs.  </li>
            <li>Not even a brand new battery could save it, and yes I triple checked that I inserted the battery correctly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried new batteries, but it hasn&#x27;t helped.  </li>
            <li>So I decided to buy a new one, and got the Panasonic ER-GN30-K instead.</li>
            <li>The new one has a way of cleaning the blades without removing the head.  </li>
            <li>and I needed a new one just like it.</li>
            <li>In the market for a new gizmo that would eradicate my Andy Rooney-like eyebrows, I chose these.  </li>
            <li>I bought a couple of $10 trimmers before and the all stop and snag nose hair even when the batteries are new...</li>
            <li>I think there&#x27;s a moment when you say: I need my nose to stop looking like a New Year&#x27;s Eve party favor.</li>
            <li>New out of the box.</li>
            <li>even with a brand new battery in.</li>
            <li>I bought it abt 9 months ago and never cared to post a review, just ordered a new hair clipper and saw this was the #1 in the clipepr/trimmer categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But again, for the price, i can live with this.</li>
            <li>yes I put in a new AA alkaline battery</li>
            <li>New Batteries didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li>New batteries did not solve the problem.</li>
            <li>Or just buy new for 20 bucks.</li>
            <li>i needed a new nose trimmer.</li>
            <li>Byproduct of a new item.</li>
            <li>but for now I can live with it.</li>
            <li>I am not looking for a new one.</li>
            <li>Bought a new one, and the motor switch was faulty... and Amazon would not ACCEPT a RETURN of the faulty item.</li>
            <li>so I will live with it until it dies again, then throw it out.</li>
            <li>seems very high quality for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>was a birthday gift and works better than any other previously tried thank you for making it affordable and the quick shipping</li>
            <li>I picked up a cheapo battery powered trimmer from a local drugstore when I got a little older, and hair began migrating from my head to less preferred areas, and while it kind of did the job, I knew there had to be one out there that didn&#x27;t sound like a woodworking tool, didn&#x27;t grab and pull, and just basically did what it was supposed to do...</li>
            <li>I have wasted too much money on other trimming products to finally find this great product.</li>
            <li>What I mean by that, is that it seems to only give you the full power it can give if you have a battery that has most of it&#x27;s life in it.</li>
            <li>Clean up is a breeze with the wet wash option at a turn of a dial.  </li>
            <li>Just be careful when you clean it.</li>
            <li>easy to grip, I like the slight angle.  </li>
            <li>(It&#x27;s an older guy&#x27;s tool, clearly).  </li>
            <li>My husband loves it so far, he mainly uses it for his nose.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make much noise, much quieter than a traditional shaver.  </li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend it at this price and considering how important it is to personal grooming.</li>
            <li>This has a different design which allows the hairs to fall in the center and provides a much more efficient cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Also, he didn&#x27;t have to \\&quot;baby\\&quot; the trimmer or the trimming process - i.e. not much care is necessary to make sure you don&#x27;t nick yourself with the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Able to trim nose and ear hair very close with no hint of nicking the delicate skin inside.</li>
            <li>Especially for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s small and light and pretty quite.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is big enough to hold comfortably.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; - Cleaning without full head disassembly isn&#x27;t easy (twisting to open the small side hole to run water through</li>
            <li>I have these cheap batteries and they only last for one clipping.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer does only a marginal job with that chore and takes many repeated tries to accomplish the task at that.</li>
            <li>Works well, light weight big improvement over older 10+ year old Panasonic trimmer I had prior.  </li>
            <li>so much so that I cannot stand to use it near my ear.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>A quality devise that any person wanting proper daily grooming would enjoy and benefit from its purchase.</li>
            <li>I had a few others, and was pleasantly surprised how much better this one works.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my light blonde hairs on upper lip.......</li>
            <li>It does not pull my nose hairs, but the machine is not super strong</li>
            <li>I had a very old hair trimmer that worked not so well, so decided to buy a new one.</li>
            <li>This nose and ear trimmer is a much better alternative to digging in his nose with little scissors!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little intimidating at first, but it works quickly with no pulling and no pain.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use and I have not found anything negative about it.</li>
            <li>No sharp edges visible yet cuts the hair really well.</li>
            <li>It worked well for 3 weeks and than it started making very loud noise.</li>
            <li>The blades and the nozzle has unwanted friction bcos of which it makes very loud noise.</li>
            <li>Very gentle and quiet,</li>
            <li>Very loud and nothing like the reviews I read.</li>
            <li>If you use this sort of item very frequently the battery usage is a consideration.</li>
            <li>Very sensitive instrument.</li>
            <li>I had a very old model from Panasonic, and it worked</li>
            <li>My husband loves it even thought it&#x27;s very loud</li>
            <li>and now it makes a very loud noise.</li>
            <li>The little slot for running water through does a decent job if you&#x27;re in a hurry, but it&#x27;s better to open it up and use the brush to clean it, then rinse it, then leave the parts out to dry</li>
            <li>This is totally normal for any new electrical &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; where the contact surfaces are completely polished.</li>
            <li>Works well but not very powerful (PRO) but after using it a few times, being battery operated is a good deal.  </li>
            <li>The manufacturer claims 90 minutes of battery life, a claim I take with a grain of salt, but the battery life is still strong after several uses, so clearly not something I&#x27;m going to have to change every trim or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to get into tight places.</li>
            <li>It got a little warm after a couple minutes but not a major problem.</li>
            <li>, pretty much right down to the surface leaving no discernible hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it seems to meet my expectations, and, after having done some prior research I am comfortable with my buying decision, which in the end, was swayed by the positive feedback of other purchasers and reviewers.</li>
            <li>Took a random shot at this trimmer and it&#x27;s been amazing!</li>
            <li>Second one I&#x27;ve bought because I dropped the first one and the metal things at the tip bent.</li>
            <li>tend to buy Panasonic products TOO much, I think, as they&#x27;re generally middle-of-the-road in quality and price.</li>
            <li>This is my first nose/facial hair trimmer and it&#x27;s quite simple to use.</li>
            <li>It works better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used, and everything about it is simple:</li>
            <li>The cleanup is pretty simple too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>At first, I did not think that it could possibly trim the finer and shorter hairs.</li>
            <li>First of all, I gave 1 star to this product since it stopped working after I used it ONLY ONCE.</li>
            <li>So far still in one piece!</li>
            <li>I bought a second one after using the first one for over 6 months.</li>
            <li>First time using any electric accessory for nose and facial hair trimming and must say, this product is pretty solid.</li>
            <li>It is a better quality than the ones he&#x27;s had in the past.  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>First of all it is higher quality than any other nose hair trimmer I have ever owned including wahl.</li>
            <li>I received the Panasonic ER-GN30-k as a gift, among many other bathroom items, as I recently had an airline lose my luggage</li>
            <li>So I&#x27;m buying another one of these Panasonics, and hope it will last longer than the first one.</li>
            <li>As said in most of the other reviews, this thing actually works.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple in design and purpose.</li>
            <li>The first one was DOA the 2nd one sent worked for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>Seems a tad more sturdy than ones we have had in the past.</li>
            <li>Definitely better than the crappy discount store models I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li>No complaints at all, much better than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>They are 22 years old!</li>
            <li>I tried mine for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>It work the first two times, but then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, and when it finally did, it did not trim.</li>
            <li>There is a small opening in the top cap that can be exposed by rotating the head of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Its a pretty basic man-scaping tool, and for the price, you cant beat it.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning</li>
            <li>I would suggest a product that &#x27;protrudes&#x27; and has &#x27;an edge&#x27; with which you can carefully trim hair far more deeply recessed or in ear crevasses.</li>
            <li>but my goodness this is SOO much better than the small trimmer I have been using...</li>
            <li>This trimmer works much better than others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Like many of the other one star reviews, I had the same problem.</li>
            <li>It does get some of the stuff, just not enough for me to rate it any higher.</li>
            <li>First nose trimmer I have owned that actually worked...</li>
            <li>The old on was worn out and it was time to replace it!  </li>
            <li>I have yet to find a trimmer that actually works as advertised, and although this one has received stellar reviews, in my opinion it&#x27;s a piece of junk.</li>
            <li>I have had better trimmers in the past that were cheaper.</li>
            <li>I have used scissors and my regular clippers for trimming my nose hair for years - and first time I used these - I was cringing.  </li>
            <li>I have had many of these in the past from Panasonic, Sharper Image, etc..</li>
            <li>If you view this purchase as a short term throw away then rate it higher.  </li>
            <li>Keeps me from looking like a disheveled old man with a bush of nose hair coming out!</li>
            <li>Overall I am very happy I made this purchase and if you are looking for such a device to trim those difficult areas I would suggest this one.</li>
            <li>too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the opening lines from her review, &amp;#34;Nature has a funny way of tormenting the male species as they age.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so cheap that the cost of shipping was not worth the return.</li>
            <li>It works well enough, but the first one broke within 4 months (</li>
            <li>this was the first such device I have used.  </li>
            <li>The first one had a side-opening and the second one had notched edges around the tip.</li>
            <li>Worked at first, but didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li>I have bought many trimmers in my past.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>I first bought this trimmer in 2000 and have been using it 15 years later.</li>
            <li>In fact, the first time you use it you will question whether it did anything at all until you actually check.</li>
            <li>My first trimmer finally died to I switched to this Panasonic model.</li>
            <li>just ok, no more comment</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it says for ear and facial hair and cleaning is a breeze.</li>
            <li>No more dangling hairs or concerns that the scissors are going to cut more than they should...  </li>
            <li>It might be cheap, but really not worth the money.</li>
            <li>Overall exactly what I was looking for though.</li>
            <li>This is my second one since I broke my first nose trimmer by accident.  </li>
            <li>Likely better than the more expensive model.</li>
            <li>Works better than a couple of other trimmers (different technology/method)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been given things like this in the past - most worked so so&lt;</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had better luck with Panasonic devices in the past - perhaps I just had a dud.</li>
            <li>This trimmer worked well when I first got it, but stopped working after only a dozen uses.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>He says it seems to have weight and is more solid than the other one he purchased.</li>
            <li>This works pretty well especially if you do not like to get your nose hairs pulled like some cheaper models tend to do.</li>
            <li>I dropped my first one and it broke, ordered a second one.</li>
            <li>Much better than what I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>It quite sharp and most time he does only one pass</li>
            <li>many other brands I tried, the blade gets stacked and won&#x27;t start even with daily cleaning.</li>
            <li>but had to send the first one ordered back because it wouldn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li>This trimmer also works famously for getting stray hairs around your eyebrow line, or around your nose that you may have missed with your razor that morning because your a lazy schmuck when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li>This is my first and only purchase of a product like this</li>
            <li>higher for their personal care</li>
            <li>Nose hairs are pretty coarse yet this trimmer cuts through them like the</li>
            <li>Pretty simple: It trims hair.</li>
            <li>I just received this today and ordered it because my  nose hairs were getting wild and out of control!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Admittedly, this is my first time with a nosehair trimmer, and the spiky results left me twitching and sneezing for days after!</li>
            <li>and I gave up on most areas and got out a small razor and some tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Been trying to get my hubby to buy me a nose hair trimmer since we got married three years ago - apparently it&#x27;s not romantic?</li>
            <li>Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what more can be said about the product than that.</li>
            <li>Thought this model looked pretty well designed and it was very low in cost.  </li>
            <li>Usually Panasonic products are better than this.</li>
            <li>The build quality is substantially higher than the generic trimmer that I a  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted about two months (maybe about 8 uses), while the second one lasted about 3 weeks (2 uses).</li>
            <li>This is the second one, the first one was ruined by moisture</li>
            <li>If I wanted to yank out my eyebrow hairs one-by-one, I would enlist the services of Connie, the friendly Korean lady who does my my wife&#x27;s nail, as well as some other &amp;#34;grooming.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>So yea, it does see what I would consider normal, frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it, your significant other will thank you.</li>
            <li>I have bought other removal nose, ear and facial hair items and this one seems more sturdy and reliable.</li>
            <li>For the first day after, I felt like I was taking massive breaths through my nostrils.</li>
            <li>I bought these on the basis of other Amazon recommendations and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>Apparently the &#x27;guard&#x27; used over the blade will bend if you so much as breathe on it.  </li>
            <li>I had to buy a second one because I dropped the first one on its tip</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Finally trimmed my nose hair for the first time.</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>I read reviews for many different trimmers, and I chose this model due to those I read.</li>
            <li>I purchased this as a Christmas present and the first time he used it, he was amazed at what a close trim this thing gives him.  </li>
            <li>They actually tickled my nose at first.</li>
            <li>First time I&#x27;ve tried such a trimmer for my nose.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, the product did not work out of the box the first several times I turned it on.</li>
            <li>I am told there are other trimmers in the same price range that will do much better job.</li>
            <li>first impression was it seemed well constructed and simple to use.</li>
            <li>No complaint so far after 2 months of usage.</li>
            <li>but it actually works pretty well</li>
            <li>Not that you want to hear about my prior hairy nose and ears but this item works better than any other I have used - A+</li>
            <li>better than any other that I purchased as it ACTUALLY WORKS</li>
            <li>There are better products out there that I had in the past, like Remmel?</li>
            <li>As long as it holds up it is worth the price.</li>
            <li>Although i had recently purchased it, Panasonic said they would fix it only if i paid the shipping to Texas, which would have cost a significant percent of just buying one from another manufacturer.  </li>
            <li>Just shaking it out with the top part off usually gets all of it out</li>
            <li>Let me first say that I used to wax my entire body once a month to include my nose</li>
            <li>No complains so far!</li>
            <li>I use it so my wife isnt trying to pluck one of those wild hairs out of my nose!</li>
            <li>WOW, what a difference!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is recommended, but I feel it does a better job keeping it</li>
            <li>Good product but only last for a few months and then stop working.</li>
            <li>If it&#x27;s dropped, may not survive and the head comes off a little too easy.</li>
            <li>It easily snips out those pesky little hairs in the ear and nostrils without pulling or pinching.  </li>
            <li>It easily snips out those pesky little hairs in the ear and nostrils without pulling or pinching.</li>
            <li>Bcoz contain a little thing inside that comes out and can be easily lost.</li>
            <li>This little gadget makes it easy to take grooming to the inside edges.  </li>
            <li>This little guy gets them all, nose and ears, very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This little device is easy to maintain and takes care my unwanted nose hair (yuck).</li>
            <li>Also, it is easy cleanup with a little soap and water rinse.  </li>
            <li>this little thing rocks...had one for like 3yrs and still going strong...</li>
            <li>Simple to use, simple to clean, etc.</li>
            <li>seems more complicated than it should to clean.</li>
            <li>If you open it to clean inside, you will see how fragile it is.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>clean enough, quiet, won&#x27;t hurt me, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li>It is simple to use and simple to clean.  </li>
            <li>The ear hair gets chopped and I can open it up to clean it out without worry if it will ever get back together again.</li>
            <li>Does not pull at all , is simple to clean, and is rather quiet for something you jam up your nose.</li>
            <li>for a cheap nose ear hairtrimmer this has not let me down.  </li>
            <li>The cleaning feature keeps it clean and oderless too unlike other brands and models.</li>
            <li>It does not pull the hairs as other manual turn around trimmers that are cumbersome to clean and do not work.  </li>
            <li>read a lot of Reviews here at Amazon before buying one of these things; and it seemed to me the biggest fault was in pulling the hair instead of providing a clean, sharp cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only own this trimmer for a couple days, so I&#x27;m interested in seeing how it stands up to repeated uses, consider the poor reviews regarding longevity from other confirmed owners.</li>
            <li>They are quiet, easily washable, powered by a single AA battery which is not included, no tugging or pulling sensation when using them.</li>
            <li>Because the product is new, the inner &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; cuts perfectly, but I doubt will due so in the future once the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; starts to dull.</li>
            <li>The plastic body feels like it&#x27;s made of cheap china plastic that would break or crack on your first accidental drop on a hard floor.  </li>
            <li>I cannot comment on the durability of this product as I have used it only for a month, but my experience so far has been better than with any other trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely bizzare to stick this up your nose in order to cut nose hairs, and can hurt a tiny bit when ripping out some hairs, but overall, it keeps those nose hairs nice and trim, no complaints.</li>
            <li>So far, this clipper looks like it will live up to it&#x27;s battery life estimate.  </li>
            <li>The day my five year old charge told me I have fuzz in my ears was the day I decided I needed a new tool for my collection.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me a bit long in the tooth, and your body hair has run amuck, check out this dude right here.</li>
            <li>This little device might pass as a cheap version of other similar devices with a greater price tag, but it works just wonders.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>to my joy, I&#x27;ve found that this bad boy really gets the job done!  </li>
            <li>wondering why you&#x27;re shoving what looks and sounds like a vibe up your nose - but honestly, it&#x27;s just as cheap as a pair of decent blunt nose scissors and it quells the masochist desire in me to painfully pluck those distracting hairs.</li>
            <li>The slightly bent body is ergonomically designed to perfectly fit in the hand.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic is fantastic compared to my previous Wahl.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable enough to hold, although I can&#x27;t imagine needing to hold this for a really long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had previously bought one of those $10 cheap trimmers you see on TV which lasted like a month.</li>
            <li>I get a few snags that are very quick.</li>
            <li>trimmer’s curved design and rubberized grip make it easy to use, and the narrow, rounded head reaches into nostrils with minimum irritation.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There are various optional instructions on how to clean it, but I just plan on rinsing it with water like I did with my old one, and if I need to buy another one in a year or so, no big deal.  </li>
            <li>Easy to pack for travel and isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li>Anyway this trimmer always trims without pulling or snagging my nose hair or any hair for that matter, it fits in the hand nice &amp; the head is small enough to get anywhere</li>
            <li>This worked at a 4-star level at first, but far too briefly.  </li>
            <li>Once in a while, it would grab a hair instead of cutting, which hurts pretty good.  </li>
            <li>I even use it to touch up my eyebrows and it does a pretty good job getting close to the skin without cutting me.</li>
            <li>It gets the job done quickly and with minimal pulling.  </li>
            <li>For one, it only effective on small amounts of hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause cutting on the face and its pretty good.</li>
            <li>Good trimmer but be careful not to drop the small blade parts into the drain while cleaning it.</li>
            <li>Not to big, not too small - it fits the orifice quite nicely and doesn&#x27;t tug and pull at the sides.</li>
            <li>Works pretty good, could have a cleaner cutting head.</li>
            <li>Its low tech and does exactly what its supposed to to without having to stick scissors near or inside body cavities where they don&#x27;t belong.  </li>
            <li>First thing I noticed was how quiet this shaver is,nice when you use it near your ears.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience with these things, but it seems pretty solid so far.</li>
            <li>Better than your average low quality trimmer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an avid Amazon buyer and am surprised they would sell such a POS.</li>
            <li>At first, it worked ok but not great.  </li>
            <li>This is the second Panasonic trimmer I have purchased - the first one I dropped five feet onto a tile floor directly on the head.</li>
            <li>Be cool if there were different heads to use but no big deal.</li>
            <li>Evidently, I was not as careful as I should have been and remove to much or to close or both.</li>
            <li>Its been a few years and this trimmer is still going strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going strong after a few months of ownership.</li>
            <li>As for my first week of review, without an included triple A battery, I had to use an older one I had with limited power.  </li>
            <li>It replaces a very old Windmere unit that until now I didn&#x27;t truly realize just how ineffective the old one was.</li>
            <li>This thing really bogs down when I try to trim my nose hairs, even with a fresh battery.</li>
            <li>Just twist off the top, pull out the blade, brush it down with the included brush, wash if you desire, then put back together.</li>
            <li>Though it worked fine, it was noisy and did pull a little.</li>
            <li>Works fine, but some tendency to trim nasal hair a little too close, leading to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>If you have a little hair, it should work fine for you though.</li>
            <li>Fits my hand perfectly, trims well, and is much less noisy than other trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>I wish it trimmed a little bit closer on the nose hair, but all in all, its fine.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brand for years, and while the original version (gosh, 20 years ago!) was extremely powerful and ultra sharp, I do recall being a little sore.  </li>
            <li>I was using an attachment to my Remington (not an actual nose trimmer attachment) and it was ok but only got the long hairs.  </li>
            <li>There is another model with a light, but not sure that feature is worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li>I had something similar in the past, but definitely did not work as good as this one.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, leaves hair sometimes but pretty good all the same.</li>
            <li>Not painful like a couple of other ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I had tried several from our local Walmart that were worse than this one, but I liked my old, old Panasonic version better (but it finally wore out, heh).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a cheap product and works well, but understand that it may not last very long.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very powerful which means less nose hair getting caught</li>
            <li>This little trimmer is comfortable to use (minimal tugging and vibrating) and makes quick work of maintenance.</li>
            <li>i would highly recommend this nose groomer to anyone looking to buy a groomer, go with this one and you will have no regrets!</li>
            <li>In fact with the wet dry feature, more than I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>After struggling with it for a while trying to push it out of the chamber and back into it&#x27;s slot on the side (where it looked like it should have gone), I tried installing the blade this time without putting it fully into the chamber, but resting the black plastic legs of the blade on top of this curved plastic piece, and reinstalling the cap.</li>
            <li>It is much more quiet than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li>OK, maybe it&#x27;s just me who&#x27;s anal enough to notice something as odd as that.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>My big sharper image trimmer finally died, so I did some quick review searching.</li>
            <li>I had another one that got rotted smelling quickly because it wasn&#x27;t designed to be cleaned in any simple manner), and it cleans hairs out if you give it the time to do so and swish it around enough.</li>
            <li>With this version we once again have a trimmer that cuts the whole hair right down to the skin level.</li>
            <li>feels very cheaply made and it cuts slowly.  </li>
            <li>This new version is a little more stylistic, but it has the same quality as my old one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still using the original batteries with no signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few other trimmers, even more expensive ones by this same brand, and this model is by far the most effective for me.</li>
            <li>did notice that when i clean the head with water there is sometimes a dark liquid which washes into</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and still working fine</li>
            <li>Actually works, and since it is easily and completely cleanable, it doesn&#x27;t stop working after 10 uses because it is jammed with snot and hair.</li>
            <li>wet dry feature is nice since it sits on my counter next to my sink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty small and easy to carry around, and cleanup is relatively easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It worked fine a few times, then stopped.</li>
            <li>It was fine for a few weeks.</li>
            <li>Once your nose is hair free you will be able to breathe easier and have less boogers caught in the thick bush.  </li>
            <li>Its build quailty is good though and the wet dry function worked as expected.</li>
            <li>In the few weeks I have used it, it works fine.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s not for heavy grooming like a beard but nose or ear hair would be fine.  </li>
            <li>Works good, could use an extra battery (seems a bit weak on power)</li>
            <li>you should only cut a bit away at first, ,dont try to cut to remove every single hair the first time.  </li>
            <li>but you get to a certain age and suddenly you&#x27;re sprouting hairs in places</li>
            <li>It heats up pretty quickly when you start using it, takes quite a while to actually trim all the hair, and so far has proven fairly difficult to clean very well.  </li>
            <li>I have a problem with certain hairs that grow in places that is too gross to mention.</li>
            <li>I HAVE OWN TWO OTHER BRANDS AND HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li>Perhaps a little light oil on the blade would lessen the resistance...</li>
            <li>It is smooth and does not hurt when it pulls out the little hairs inside of you.</li>
            <li>Although this little battery operated nose trimmer seems cheap, it works.</li>
            <li>Whatever the case, I find this little baby indispensable.</li>
            <li>A little cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li>Feels a little cheap in the hand, but for the price, what do you expect?</li>
            <li>With a little practice, jamming the device can be avoided and the device will operate smoothly.</li>
            <li>In defense of that cheap little trimmer, I did keep it running for two or three years.  </li>
            <li>Seems a little cheaply made.</li>
            <li>product works well but feels a little cheap.</li>
            <li>but for now, if you are getting older or if your nose hairs grow extremely long and fast, this is for you, don&#x27;t wait</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent trimmer for a long time at a reasonable price</li>
            <li>This is a significant improvement over previous nose trimmers.  </li>
            <li>This one is a little more solid.  </li>
            <li>For the same amount of money, I picked up a full-on grooming kit with addons that works much, much better than this little thing.</li>
            <li>Sure beats using those little scissors you get in dopp kits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: definite upgrade!</li>
            <li>On thing I would like tonsee like my old one is a little light thatnshines in area</li>
            <li>This one is a little more solid.</li>
            <li>This little guy does exactly what it is supposed to do - quickly, gently and efficiently!  </li>
            <li>I had another brand version that I had lost and was not super excited about this one.  </li>
            <li>I am satisfied with this wet/dry personal shaver, but wish it cut hairs a little closer than it does.</li>
            <li>However, after my first use the trimmer will suddenly die and stop working (snagging on skin and on hairs) and doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up small fine hairs.</li>
            <li>OKAY, CANT HARDLY HEAR IT RUN</li>
            <li>I am hard to please when it comes to this type of stuff, and I can say for sure, this seems to be number one.</li>
            <li>and it will be hard to find better...</li>
            <li>Works well for those hard to pick places. :-)</li>
            <li>It cuts hard to reach hair in ears and nose much better than scissors.</li>
            <li>This one, on the other hand, does the job quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>I understand that lithium based batteries have higher power density, but the rechargeables wear out quickly and are expensive (if not impossible) to replace.</li>
            <li>Very good cutting and very quiet.  </li>
            <li>It is quite effective it less time compared to trimmers and other models.  </li>
            <li>Hard to complain too much about something that is so cheap, though.</li>
            <li>When dull it will start pulling hair more frequently.  </li>
            <li>As I said the flat close trimer that everybody sells probly works better but they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li>I found this Panasonic model with very good reviews but was skeptical because my Sharper Image model was 3 times more expensive when I purchased it 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>falls apart easily and not very effective.</li>
            <li>cutting my nose hair perfectly lol</li>
            <li>Instructions aren&#x27;t great and opening the package was a dangerous ordeal if you don&#x27;t have bolt cutters.    </li>
            <li>Great for cutting nostril and ear opening hair.</li>
            <li>Great cutting angle and performance.</li>
            <li>Great close cutting</li>
            <li>Directions are clear on care and maintenance.</li>
            <li>I clean it every time I use it (followed directions with it) and let it dry out for an hour or two before putting it back together.</li>
            <li>It did not leave a clear streak through it.</li>
            <li>I would steer clear of this item.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t bother to look at the directions clearly.</li>
            <li>Just turn the outer plastic ring that opens the drain and run some water through it while it is running, it&#x27;s clean in less than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li>(To be clear, even when the blade head is removed, the shaft will not spin.)</li>
            <li>I am a woman, not a hairy nosed man, but this product is great for nasal hair and facial hair too difficult to tweeze.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easier to clean than my previous model as well.</li>
            <li>Opened and read clear instructions.  </li>
            <li>In less than one minute I can clean out my nose hairs.</li>
            <li>The instruction manuel gives clear instructions.</li>
            <li>As for me, I am still too young to be one of those old guys with epic nose hair.  </li>
            <li>It still worked great, but unfortunately, I dropped it on the floor, and one of the internal parts fell out, so it no longer cuts.</li>
            <li>While hair doesn&#x27;t readily grow on my head, it grows wild in unwanted areas such as ears and nose.  </li>
            <li>Unit goes in the drawer when I don&#x27;t need it and keeps the counter clear.</li>
            <li>I bought several to give as gifts because some people in my family really needed it and did not find them in stores they frequent.</li>
            <li>You can clearly hear when it encounters hairs.</li>
            <li>Those clear hairs under your eyebrows</li>
            <li>but this one is easy to clean does not feel that uncomfortable as others</li>
            <li>:B00E4PMQAO Professional Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose Trimmer with LED light.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;The machine comes on fast for about 5 seconds and in the next 2 seconds it nearly stops.  </li>
            <li>Just move it around and it will clear the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would have replaced the batter in my old clipper by this time.</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t pulled or pinched anything.</li>
            <li>No issues with it so far.</li>
            <li>do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>I hope my nose hair grows fast enough, can&#x27;t stop of using it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not sure on the long term how durable this is, however for the price I don&#x27;t expect it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I´ve been using this product for several months and have no complains about it; it trims very well and does not hurt the inside of your nose tissues while doing it.</li>
            <li>I dropped my 10 year old Conair trimmer and was in need of a replacement.  </li>
            <li>so far keeps my nose hair in check.</li>
            <li>but it is overpriced as far as I am concerned;</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and power of this trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer worked really well, but did not last a year.</li>
            <li>have so much hair in my body, especially nose, so I have to trim it every one week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, after 3 or 4 uses, the trimmer completely stopped turning on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It quit working completely after a month.</li>
            <li>He was pleasantly surprised at the performance of the Panasonic trimmer and continues rave about it.</li>
            <li>Just what the old nose needed</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, it&#x27;s quiet,</li>
            <li>Why look like a cave man when you can look like the modern man that anyone would want to be next to.</li>
            <li>Works as advertised so far.</li>
            <li>I was surprised by how well this worked.</li>
            <li>He loves this &amp; surprised how well it does what it says it can do.</li>
            <li>The batteries in this product also lasted a pretty long time.  </li>
            <li>This is a quality grooming tool as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li>then it quit completely.  </li>
            <li>He has had several and really likes this one.</li>
            <li>What a glorious time to be alive.</li>
            <li>It performs very well in trimmming nose hair, which is its only purpose for me.</li>
            <li>Very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>Was surprised how well this works.  </li>
            <li>after just a short time of using this product I am ready to get rid of it.</li>
            <li>He was reaching that point in old man years where his nose hair was longer than his head hair.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t make me hesitant at all to put it near sensitive places.</li>
            <li>If the battery gets old or you try and use a weaker battery</li>
            <li>My old unit was so loud that it hurt my ears when grooming them.</li>
            <li>so I like it so far.</li>
            <li>I had an old Panasonic that I lost in a move.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t get a close enough shave with this thing to warrant using it on your face really..</li>
            <li>I am 50+ years old and have hair growing places now that I never had problems with before.  </li>
            <li>I think so far it has done this maybe 3 or 4 times with me.</li>
            <li>He loves this Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer and says it does not pull his nose hairs and works very well.</li>
            <li>Finally, a hair trimmer that really works.  </li>
            <li>This puts my old Remington to shame.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this one.</li>
            <li>Purchased 3 so far as gifts.</li>
            <li>and so far I&#x27;ve had no issues with it...</li>
            <li>This one will buzzz that hair away fast and short.</li>
            <li>I was actually surprised to see a brand name trimmer being sold at this price</li>
            <li>this to me is the best-so far anyway.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is simple to operate, and trims very well.  </li>
            <li>This unit is also very lightweight and quiet.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco trimmer never worked as well as the old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>This thing kinda sucks, in the age of the rechargeable battery why get a AA operated  when there are better products out there.</li>
            <li>After washing and re-assembling the thing I was astounded at how loud the thing was.</li>
            <li>I attack it with this contraption on a regular basis and it really clears out all the foliage.</li>
            <li>works very well only used it once since I bought</li>
            <li>With the old blade style of electric trimmer I would always dread it because because I had to stick the blades all the way up to the offending hairs in my nose.</li>
            <li>And I had to remove these hairs the old fashioned way, using my fingernails.</li>
            <li>Being that this product cost me $20, I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li>works by softly removing the hair, it doesn&#x27;t pull them as others, it doesn&#x27;t get stuck, and there&#x27;s no chance of getting blood anywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Used about 5 times so far.</li>
            <li>And not too loud, like some others.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy, not too light .So</li>
            <li>Of course this was a stocking stuffer I purchased early and the return period had expired before we ever opened it, so I am SOL</li>
            <li>and so far has not given me any problems.</li>
            <li>I got maybe one hour of use out of it before it started making a loud noise.  </li>
            <li>So loud it hurt my ears when trimming ear hair.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is used only on my ears and performs very well in that capacity.  </li>
            <li>I wanted trimmer for nose and ear hair which is a problem for us old guys.</li>
            <li>So far I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money on the one with the LED light...</li>
            <li>This one is completely painless and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my 89 year old dad to use.  </li>
            <li>After maybe 4 months it just stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>Is not too loud.</li>
            <li>I have had no issues so far and have been using it for around a year now</li>
            <li>I was surprised at how sturdy it was considering the cost.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this trimmer to be (by far) the easiest to use with the closest cut.</li>
            <li>The internal motor mechanism is really glitchy, and will sometimes just stop working.</li>
            <li>using it for 2 months now, no issue so far.</li>
            <li>For the price, I am surprised at the quality of the build and the fact you can buy replacement parts.</li>
            <li>I saw this trimmer on sale and decided that maybe it was time to retire my old one.</li>
            <li>SO far, I am four for four on getting lemons.</li>
            <li>It gently and quietly went to work civilizing and youth-ifying my nose and ears.</li>
            <li>This one seems to be a keeper, others we have tried were too loud and pulled hair.</li>
            <li>My old one was 15 years old</li>
            <li>It replaces an old one that has done its time.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>This trimmer is inexpensive and does one thing only, but it does it VERY well.  </li>
            <li>and that was loud</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well</li>
            <li>The battery compartment seems to frequently lose connectivity with the inserted battery resulting in the trimmer failing to turn on.  </li>
            <li>Also, the angled design of the trimmer caused it to frequently fall over on my medicine cabinet shelf.</li>
            <li>One problem fixed at a time, I suppose.</li>
            <li>completely stopped working, when I managed to jiggle it, to get it to run - it just made a loud noise and did not cut at all.</li>
            <li>He has a sensitive nose that reacts with a lot of sneezing to a lot of stuff, but this did not prompt a sinus attack as I feared..</li>
            <li>But after several months of use, I am very dissatisfied with it.</li>
            <li>Quiet and gentle.  </li>
            <li>As a man getting old sux, items like this become a necessity.</li>
            <li>so they are doing their job so far.</li>
            <li>But, watching a mature man tear up with every nose hair extracted is a pitiful site.</li>
            <li>Quiet and very efficient</li>
            <li>It does still work somewhat but it heats up and is loud as hell.</li>
            <li>so far hope it is reliable.</li>
            <li>Ordered in May of 2014 and used very sparingly and now just over a year later the product will not turn on.  </li>
            <li>The old one would do the job in a 5-10 seconds.</li>
            <li>This was a gift and the recipient said &amp;#34;so far so good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my 25 year old son and he loves it.</li>
            <li>But so far, at the price point I paid, no problems and would buy again.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li>This device works very well and is very solidly built.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want hairs coming out of my nose looking like an old man.  </li>
            <li>one get old, hair does one of two things . . .</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really trim eyebrow or facial hair like they say, but who cares?</li>
            <li>After contacting Panasonic support to see about getting it fixed, I was told the replacement blade would cost 13 dollars.....</li>
            <li>Balanced too for a longer device than my old one.  </li>
            <li>Tried it today on ears and nose and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>This works very well especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>must have to maintain professional appearance.</li>
            <li>Though it did not cost much to begin with, it only worked a few months - using it only once or twice a month at most.  </li>
            <li>It took 5 minutes to completely trim all the hair in my nose so that it was no longer noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Considering you&#x27;re using it on sensitive areas, makes me nervous.  </li>
            <li>I found this will diminish hair but not get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li>When the trimmer is used, the edges of the blades brush against the cover and make the loud buzzing sound.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As far as nose trimmers go, you can&#x27;t lose.</li>
            <li>had one from a beard trimming kit before this that just didn&#x27;t work...was pleasantly surprised with this one</li>
            <li>This item was completely inoperable, not even the tiniest buzz.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>Old guys.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut as well as my old one.  </li>
            <li>You can wash this by running water directly from faucet.</li>
            <li>: none so far</li>
            <li>After an extensive review, I decided for this product and it really worked as promised.</li>
            <li>As a man(?) who doesn&#x27;t grow much facial hair, I don&#x27;t have to shave very often.</li>
            <li>Has worked well so far.</li>
            <li>The first was dropped on the bathroom floor, and it started making a strange noise, so I needed</li>
            <li>We have tried others which have caused nicks in the skin, but so far these have not.</li>
            <li>This thing is gentle and quiet.  </li>
            <li>My old trimmer gave up the ghost - should have been sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t do a complete job for both nose and ear.</li>
            <li>So far this has worked like a peach.</li>
            <li>The battery compartment of my old panasonic had a fishy smell.</li>
            <li>your ears the old fashioned way</li>
            <li>This product stopped working completely after about three months.  </li>
            <li>Ready for the next grooming!</li>
            <li>He uses it weekly - so it gets used frequently.  </li>
            <li>this might be a problem for those people who have extremely sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>Had an old Remington PG350 beard trimmer with 4 attachment.  </li>
            <li>You know your getting old when you have to buy one of these.  </li>
            <li>No issues so far.</li>
            <li>Now this hospital was an old goat herder&#x27;s hut who used shears</li>
            <li>Love that its battery operated so it can used on the go if running late.</li>
            <li>and then it stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li>Working well so far.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>old and has arthritis in his hands.</li>
            <li>It works well so far (one month).  </li>
            <li>My Braun Shaver requires blade replacement about as frequently.  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m quite surprised it hasn&#x27;t required replacement sooner than</li>
            <li>Even at two years I&#x27;m still surprised</li>
            <li>just moves it around, wish I didn&#x27;t throw away my old one</li>
            <li>Nothing says &amp;#34;ungroomed,&amp;#34; like a white untrimmed nose hair in a very tan senior nose.</li>
            <li>Cons: none so far.</li>
            <li>So far works as advertised.</li>
            <li>It is completely painless.</li>
            <li>So far I like the product.</li>
            <li>While I wouldn&#x27;t take it into the shower you can rinse it with water and its ready to go the next time.  </li>
            <li>I looked for a product that would work for my 78 year old father.</li>
            <li>Picture makes it look a lot bigger than it really is.  </li>
            <li>For once I found a trimmer that actually worked and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Kinda loud</li>
            <li>Seems to work well for nose hair thus far.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from him, so I&#x27;m giving it five stars.</li>
            <li>When your nose hairs still sticking out of your nose and tickling your nose when you breath that means you&#x27;re getting old.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably just get the multi groomer since I don&#x27;t really need multiple nose hair trimmers</li>
            <li>Works well and is not so loud that you feel like your damaging your ears</li>
            <li>All my old trimmers would nick and cut the inside of my nose.  </li>
            <li>no problems so far.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get an exchange from Amazon as it&#x27;s one week outside of their return policy, Panasonic wants me to ship it to them at my cost for repair or replacement.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than my last trimmer</li>
            <li>have used 3 times so far.</li>
            <li>So far no problems, i like it a lot.</li>
            <li>so far.</li>
            <li>So far though, it has not done that.</li>
            <li>so I assume I will not have to change the batteries frequently.  </li>
            <li>and so far seems sturdy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s modestly priced (under $15); and 2)</li>
            <li>Bought it in the middle of the night from my phone when my nose was bothering me too much.</li>
            <li>I replaced my 10 yr old Panasonic unit with this one.  </li>
            <li>it AT LEAST CUTS THE HAIRS, which is more than the others will do.</li>
            <li>Yesterday it started making a loud buzzing noise, which it had not made previously.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t pinch the inside of my nose like my old trimmers.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a cheap $5-6 off-brand version of one of these trimmers a few years ago.</li>
            <li>I am admitting that I&#x27;m getting old.</li>
            <li>my old one</li>
            <li>DOES THE JOB INTENDED, NO PROBLEMS SO FAR.</li>
            <li>But it obviously shows how much he likes the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>but so far haven&#x27;t had an issue.</li>
            <li>It does the job on nose and ears completely painlessly.</li>
            <li>Now I don&#x27;t have hair coming out of my nose like an old dude.</li>
            <li>After cleaning and reassembly (in accordance with the user guide), the product clattered loudly and just never worked.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
            <li>No problem using one AA alkaline battery so far.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer definitely works really well..</li>
            <li>Seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li>Fast, efficient, quiet.</li>
            <li>This was a replacement for another trimmer that was too old.  </li>
            <li>/&gt; - Pull your hair often since it doesn&#x27;t spin fast enough</li>
            <li>This is so much easier to use then the type that goes back and forth.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m an old guy and was getting hairy ears.  </li>
            <li>(hear a tip on how I cleaned my old Wahl trimmer and it should work for this trimmer also)</li>
            <li>it works and seems to be made well, battery life is reasonable and in line with similar products.</li>
            <li>I had an old sharper image one that was about 14 years old.</li>
            <li>Seems to pull on a hair every now and again, but really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
            <li>The rinse head cleaning is also handier than the disassemble-clean-reassemble routine on the old model.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t pull or tug sensitive hairs.</li>
            <li>It does work well when needed, however it does seem to be quite sensitive to batteries.</li>
            <li>&#x27;s completely bitten the dust.</li>
            <li>Cuts cleanly so far.</li>
            <li>so far...</li>
            <li>but both get too old or something</li>
            <li>and then the motor starts sounding loud and will not perform as well.  </li>
            <li>Yeah, so I got old and invested in a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised with this unit&#x27;s clipping ability.  </li>
            <li>The battery also lasts pretty long.  </li>
            <li>Mine got to be over 4 years old.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend loves how it works, it cleans his facial hair very well.</li>
            <li>I like it so far.  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement/upgrade from my old trimmer.</li>
            <li>Plunge it into the old nostrils and root around a bit.  </li>
            <li>These are the kinds of things a man in his early 30&#x27;s has to deal with.  </li>
            <li>so i was really surprised it did not come with one..</li>
            <li>It is very quiet and cuts really close without any discomfort.[[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110/60 Nose and Ear Trimmer]]</li>
            <li>So far it gets the job done without any problems.</li>
            <li>However, if you have deep nostrils (Who really knows this about themselves?)</li>
            <li>but so far the Panasonic ER-GN30-K does NOT.</li>
            <li>like it because it can be washed directly by water.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I have only used it once, but it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li>Does not trim well at all...do not waste your money on this model.  </li>
            <li>It works alright, but it heats up really fast and you could possibly burn your nose or face with it.</li>
            <li>Old man, hair growing everywhere</li>
            <li>Used very infrequently at 2nd home....</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I can use it inside my ears and is not to loud.</li>
            <li>Still works, but motor is completely whiny and trimmer just stops when I try to trim anything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to buy one of these for a couple old men</li>
            <li>at 29 i bit the bullet and accepted that im old</li>
            <li>It trims facial hair very well.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because my old trimmer wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I just don&#x27;t like using the exposed ones in sensitive areas like my nose..</li>
            <li>Dropped my old one and it broke.</li>
            <li>Quieter and heavier than the old Panasonic unit.</li>
            <li>No problems noticed so far.</li>
            <li>So far no pulling on the hairs</li>
            <li>Now they are white and very noticeable.</li>
            <li>And then completely died.</li>
            <li>I just use once so far.</li>
            <li>It fell all of 10\\&quot; to the sink, and now is extremely loud and doesn&#x27;t cut as well.  </li>
            <li>You know, trimming nose hairs being the sign that I&#x27;m getting old and all that jazz.</li>
            <li>It wants to spin initially after reseating the blades, but then it gets caught up on the blade guard and stops.  </li>
            <li>this trimmer can be used to trim nose hair, no one is surprised at this.</li>
            <li>I have an old Sears electric trimmer from the sixties that has worked on three generations.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t notice much hair left after being cut either, I think the machine captures it.</li>
            <li>There is no pulling and no pain even in the sensitive nostril</li>
            <li>Worked until early Feb., then just died.  </li>
            <li>I had an old Panasonic trimmer...</li>
            <li>Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li>Being 28 years old, I never had to use a nose hair trimmer, and for the majority of my life I never thought I&#x27;d have to.</li>
            <li>For something you&#x27;re meant to hold up close to your ears, the trimmer is painfully loud.</li>
            <li>Hair is contained by the device as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>My wife reminds me that I&#x27;m getting old.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised how well this trimmer worked.  </li>
            <li>When you buy one of these, you know you&#x27;re getting old.</li>
            <li>This is an early review and may change in time should reliability turn out to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It beats my old trimmer by a mile.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, thanks for this nose, ear and facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer exceeded my expectations by far.</li>
            <li>Haha sounds gross I know.</li>
            <li>I have used this product twice and it cuts very close and runs very quiet.  </li>
            <li>It has lasted amazingly long on its first battery.</li>
            <li>way improved over my 10 yr old one</li>
            <li>And it trims all the hair in your nose completely.</li>
            <li>Although the build is sturdy, I wouldn&#x27;t trust it in soft checked luggage.</li>
            <li>But the only thing that matters really is how well it cuts the hair</li>
            <li>No problems so far.</li>
            <li>then it got really loud.</li>
            <li>This far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>This is a simple tool that works well and doesn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li>I decided to torture myself by reading the reviews; I for one don’t play the odds, I see 95 five star ratings and pay more attention to the one negative.  </li>
            <li>Unless you jam it directly into your ear (and why you&#x27;ll want to that, I don&#x27;t know)</li>
            <li>all you&#x27;ll hear is a soft hum.</li>
            <li>no complaints thus far.</li>
            <li>As we age, we sprout hair in the least sexy places.  </li>
            <li>my 66 year old body was experiencing.  </li>
            <li>must change the angle of the trimmer frequently but that has been the case with all trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Its simple and ready to use.</li>
            <li>Who really wants to acknowledge a nose hair trimmer as an essential grooming tool?</li>
            <li>i.e men&#x27;s nose hair.so far, it has been durable.</li>
            <li>wont be surprised when it gives up the ghost.</li>
            <li>I like the rotary action but wish a device could have a combination of rotary and &#x27;scissor shave&#x27; action.</li>
            <li>I have used mine about 6 times so far and I still like.</li>
            <li>tip  feels so soft</li>
            <li>and you really have to rotate it around to get all of the hair which is why I only give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li>Rating of the Panasonic vs my old Remington Wet/Dry  Panasonic 10  Remington 0    </li>
            <li>Wow.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it tickles (really tickles) when used for nose hair.  </li>
            <li>My old one did not.  </li>
            <li>and I like it so far</li>
            <li>So Far</li>
            <li>I know I&#x27;m about twenty years too young to be using one of these, but I&#x27;m still wondering how the hell I ever lived without it.</li>
            <li>It makes a loud grinding nose as the blade hits the guard and doesn&#x27;t cut well after that.</li>
            <li>One batter has lasted me a month so far.</li>
            <li>Often people can go through several of these types of trimmers in a year and not think much about it.  </li>
            <li>Only use it on nose, works very well.</li>
            <li>My old man groomer broke and I was looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer (man groomer) used to pluck hairs</li>
            <li>No complaints whatsoever thus far.</li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised by how close this rotary trimmer cuts hair.</li>
            <li>ONLY real downside has been that it&#x27;ll go throw a AA battery in about two trims.  </li>
            <li>and then it stopped working completely within six weeks.  </li>
            <li>have always used an old Remington nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li>I use it mostly on my nose but have used it a few times to get those out of place facial hairs.</li>
            <li>I have had a few of the so called universal trimmers that have the nose hair attachments, and they are mostly uselss...</li>
            <li>Not very sturdy or powerful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d like to add that this one now buzzes when fully battery charged really fast when I hold it at one angle and really slow and grinding with a sound like a rusty electric</li>
            <li>Rarely used, never under wet conditions, and cleaned after each use.  </li>
            <li>Only trouble was getting the most elusive nose hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that a bunch of 10 second maintenance jobs is better than hacking away at a forrest every few weeks.</li>
            <li>It does get warm after using it for a couple minutes, but not warm enough to cause discomfort.</li>
            <li>Of Caution: be careful where you use; it is powerful like I stated already, so you may create some unintended damage.</li>
            <li>I tried it with 4 different sets of fresh batteries, and it simply refuses to turn on.</li>
            <li>Works as expected and worth the price</li>
            <li>It is worth the money spent if you are looking for an in-expensive trimmer.</li>
            <li>It appears to be much better than the last trimmer I had, but have not used it but a few times.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a weird shape like some erotic Batman toy, but it does the job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t think Panasonic trimmers weren&#x27;t good, but I bought multi-purpose trimmers that were just mediocre nose-hair trimmers.  </li>
            <li>But I was kind of annoyed that it isn&#x27;t even a year old</li>
            <li>Maybe I am using it wrong, but doesn&#x27;t see to do a good job.</li>
            <li>I think ill put it to good use</li>
            <li>Just buy a good, expensive one, and save yourself the hustle.</li>
            <li>I think my hair grows more slowly after I started using this because it realized the futility.</li>
            <li>It is difficult  and time consuming to to do a good job.</li>
            <li>However, the manufacturer claims it&#x27;s good for edging beards and mustaches, but when I tried it out, it failed abysmally.</li>
            <li>Ok I hate the fact that to own this</li>
            <li>Go slow and it works better.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately it only lasted 1 months Had high hopes for the product but the durability is poor.i also had new battery could save it, and</li>
            <li>I tried several new batteries of high quality and no results.</li>
            <li>Works OK, but it made pretty cheap and sounds noisy in a way that its unlikely to last very long.</li>
            <li>It handles both coarse and fine hair extremely well.  </li>
            <li>Using it to trim facial hair from side burns, eyebrows, and other surface areas is fine.</li>
            <li>All of these trimmer will require you to go back to clean up loose ends...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very expensive anyway, so replacing is not a big deal.</li>
            <li>Just wish they had one that was a little less sexy and more utilitarian at a slightly lower price.</li>
            <li>The tip does get a little warm during use but other that that I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
            <li>Easy use, easy to clean &amp; it must be efficient as the battery hasn&#x27;t been changed &amp; it&#x27;s been buzzing along cutting down the geezer hairs.</li>
            <li>I am a long time panasonic user (shavers, clippers and other various things) and normally I am always satisfied with their build quality and how well they work.</li>
            <li>i do very little maintenance on it, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li>Previously, I would actually be able to grab that lone long hair with tweezers and pull it.</li>
            <li>The first time you use this, is slightly unnerving putting a spinning blade into your nose even knowing it can&#x27;t really hurt you.</li>
            <li>Really that machine helps me less embarrassing about my nostril hair ;).</li>
            <li>The angle is really very helpful and the blades do a better job than my previous trimmer, getting down to 1/64&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>this product is priced at the right level, however, its functionality could be better: not fast and sharp enough, and requires a fair amount of &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34; inside the nostrils to cut what needs cutting.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is a lot more solid than any other similar product I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple ways and finally red so many of the other reviewers on here, I agree with them DO NOT BUY THIS product.</li>
            <li>Most folks know what I mean...</li>
            <li>I mean, what more can you say about an ear and nose hair trimmer?</li>
            <li>Much better than the two others we&#x27;ve had in the past!</li>
            <li>The device works decently when it first arrived, however after it&#x27;s second or third use it&#x27;s barely working.</li>
            <li>Even with new batteries, barely works.</li>
            <li>It is, to be sure, somewhat anxiety-inducing to use at first, as the idea of putting a little twirling razor in one&#x27;s nose sounds alarming and potentially treacherous, but it works like a dream in actuality.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, care for, pretty quiet, and not painful if you press a little too hard.</li>
            <li>Small, compact and really easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is small and compact, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It is small and could be easy to lose, so you have to keep up with it.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t lose any of the small parts in the head, it is easy to do so.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s bizarre - other than the two times I briefly used it, the product has sat dormant in a bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li>small and easy to carry around for travel</li>
            <li>The unit is easily cleaned and includes a small brush for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s small and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>The small size and curved body makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li>But the cutting end is so friendly and safe</li>
            <li>The product is small and easy to take with you when traveling.</li>
            <li>I remove it, run it under hot water, and blow it dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for the past 6 months and still runs strong.</li>
            <li>Not sure if I got a lemon or, just have unusually strong nose hair.  </li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend it to any male specie out there under the same torment of having unwanted hair in really, really, blunt areas.</li>
            <li>Comes with a little brush to clean it with.</li>
            <li>little note on how to clean</li>
            <li>This works really well, trims nose hairs with very little discomfort, is comfortable to hold, not too noisy, with a low price also.</li>
            <li>It rinses well, and the ergonomics at the handle actually make this easy to use at odd angles.</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate, inexpensive, hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled or stuck, can be used either wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t clean with antibacterial soap it dulls tiny rotating blades.</li>
            <li>I get some dark hair on the outside edges of my ears and it takes care of that just fine.</li>
            <li>The cleaning instructions and methodology are less than clear, and certainly more complex than most of us expected.</li>
            <li>It worked, it didn&#x27;t hurt, and now all I have is a cute Jewish nose, not a huge Jewish nose filled with black hair.</li>
            <li>Works way better than some other ones that really pull and pinch, and it cuts down super close to the skin, you can actually press pretty hard on the skin</li>
            <li>I believe it was a defective unit since it broke down so quickly.</li>
            <li>Powerful, sharp blades, easy to use and does work well when wet or dry.</li>
            <li>This does serve the purpose but the razor edge is not sharp enough to cut through  my husband&#x27;s very tpugh beard.</li>
            <li>He is only in his 30&#x27;s but in last year or so   developed nose and ear hair much to his dismay!</li>
            <li>Had it for a few months with the original battery</li>
            <li>There is no mess, no fuss, no pain.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seize up like other models and has a powerful motor for its size.</li>
            <li>Then I tried scissors, a sharp knife, and wire cutters without success.</li>
            <li>I thought I was buying a professional trimmer, it was high priced but basically the same as the crappy unit I already owned</li>
            <li>you feel the first time you drive it into your nose and all hell breaks loose</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok but no big deal... no better than the older similar Panasonic device that is already 7 years old</li>
            <li>comfortable shave action, very little pulling</li>
            <li>Looks identical but when compared to the original, the sound quality is very poor.</li>
            <li>Not phenomenal, but it seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit heavy and cumbersome to clean but otherwise has worked quite well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pain to clean though, and after a few uses it stopped working as well.</li>
            <li>It takes a few seconds to clean everything up</li>
            <li>I just turned on my faucet and stuck it underneath until I saw water coming out of the side port for a few seconds to clean it</li>
            <li>Cleanup is really easy, drop some liquid hand soap in on the closed setting, run for a short time then on the open setting rinse it out.  </li>
            <li>Now I&#x27;m back here shopping for a decent one after throwing this one in the trash.</li>
            <li>Helps me stay groomed and the battery seems to last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>I was worried that it would be too large (as the photo appears), but it is actually small (the right size).</li>
            <li>Otherwise this is a solid trimmer at a decent price.</li>
            <li>This has the exact same head mechanism as the prior model.</li>
            <li>This is the third brand I&#x27;ve tried but the first one that actually worked.</li>
            <li>I have not yet had it pull on any hairs which my older one was constantly doing.</li>
            <li>So simple to use mainly for use for Men.</li>
            <li>but I have to be careful to not go full bore into my nostrils with it, or I have to pull it apart and rinse it out before it will run back up to speed.</li>
            <li>I have an older Panasonic clipper that still works well after several years use.</li>
            <li>I had an older Panasonic unit that had occasional issues with the battery connection.</li>
            <li>Better at getting hair outside the nose than inside, I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li>i have bought many trimmers in the past and finally got something for the job.</li>
            <li>Worked decently when it would actually turn on.</li>
            <li>If the blade is not spinning fast enough it can snag your skin if your not careful.</li>
            <li>I had an older model Panasonic hair trimmer similar to this one.</li>
            <li>However, that generation left everyone bidding for the older versions on Ebay.</li>
            <li>This trimmer worked very well for the first few weeks, then it began to stop intermittently and eat batteries.</li>
            <li>Really decent, my last trimmer was a Panasonic I bought in 1987.</li>
            <li>Gets a bit warm while in-use which can be awkward at first</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t reallize it at first, and when I finally did a couple of days later, I couldn&#x27;t find the part.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll start this review out by saying that I mainly use this as a nose hair trimmer and with ocassional facial hair and eyebrow trimming as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Not loud, not low quality, not dirty, well packaged...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried different trimmers, including an older model Panasonic, and none came close to this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it to trim my nose hairs mostly, but I&#x27;ve also trimmed some small hairs that were starting to grow out of my ear canal.</li>
            <li>I replace an older Panasonic that I had for years, this replacement is the epitome of Chinese junk.</li>
            <li>Gets rid of all unwanted hair and is small enough to store most places.</li>
            <li>My problem is that I can&#x27;t wrap my mind around the fact that I&#x27;ve growing older and nostril hairs are starting to hang lower than they used to.  </li>
            <li>ok, i was skeptical at first..</li>
            <li>I had a difficult time to get the battery to take, but once the metal connections within the battery compartment was stretched, I&#x27;ve had no problems and it is great for the price.</li>
            <li>I had an older model Panasonic for about five years that finally burned out on the nose and</li>
            <li>Panasonic you Finally came out with a decent product.</li>
            <li>This is my third nose hair trimmer, but actually the first one that works ...</li>
            <li>As I get older I&#x27;m starting to get the unwanted hair in my ears ans nose.</li>
            <li>I recently contacted Panasonic for a warranty replacement, which they were able to offer but we&#x27;re not able to send a call tag.</li>
            <li>Hair is trimmed fairly close when using tool vertically and a little closer when down flat.  </li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t come with any sort of protective case, instead it just comes with a little cap that can easily pop off.</li>
            <li>Cleans easily, battery changes are very simple and rechargeable batts can be used to power this little beast.  </li>
            <li>He says that it cuts well and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs out; that the sensation is a little ticklish, but not painful at all.</li>
            <li>No need to hand clean the gross nose hairs by hand like the other brands.</li>
            <li>right out of the box &#x27;sharp&#x27;.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had two of these due to dropping one and having it land right on the trimmer tip.</li>
            <li>It does not pull the nose hair like earlier model did; I would highly recommend this nose hair trimmer to anyone</li>
            <li>Broke when I dropped it from 2 feet (not really the manufacturer&#x27;s fault that I dropped it, but I still don&#x27;t like the product very much).</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as high RPM as my prior Panasonic (purchased in Japan) trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Not because it works poorly or broke fast, but mostly because I have to admit that I&#x27;m old enough to need a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>My only complaint thus  far is that when in the nose if left own for longer than 30 seconds the metal tip with the blade in it begins to heat up and gives me a bit of a scared reaction.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Simply because it feels like a high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li>I do like the washable feature where it lets water out of the vent in the back - highly recommend to users looking for a nose</li>
            <li>I cannot believe the high quality build given the low price.  </li>
            <li>The guard is so high up on the razor that it doesn&#x27;t actually allow it to cut.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend these for anyone needing to trim facial hair.</li>
            <li>Male member of the family appreciates this item, highly recommend.</li>
            <li>The blades are very sharp &amp; according to instructions extra blades are available for purchase.</li>
            <li>Oh, and the knives are very sharp and precise - nose and ear trimming are not marathon events - short sprint</li>
            <li>/&gt;Reminds me of my beard trimmers: each time I need new one, the latest models are worse than the one before.</li>
            <li>The Panasonic device is a big step ahead in allowing you to purchase replacement a cutter blade and housing without buying a complete new unit.</li>
            <li>Finally replaced my old one for this new one.  </li>
            <li>am giving 4 stars right now because I want to see how long the unit and batteries last.  </li>
            <li>I guess I am a little old school and expected more.  </li>
            <li>, it was a Braun, and because it was a piece of junk and just stopped working, I decided to look at something a little more expensive, and with better reviews.  </li>
            <li>While rather inexpensive, didn&#x27;t expect it would last less than 2 years under light use.  </li>
            <li>I prefer the other unit because it has a built in vacuum to clean up as it does its job.</li>
            <li>I had the previous model - which lasted years - but this one is taller, and angled to allow for a better grip and positioning on harder to reach areas.</li>
            <li>Luckily I don&#x27;t have to use it very often but it has lasted for at least 2 years from when I purchased it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use and is sharp to remove hair from most difficult to remove places.</li>
            <li>The round end is superior to the flat end trimmer I previously owned.</li>
            <li>Never jams or catches hair, actually enjoyable to use, as it makes very rapid, gentle clicking noise (low and not loud) when it&#x27;s cutting, giving you audio feedback that it&#x27;s in the right spot.</li>
            <li>Works very well, a little in the large side</li>
            <li>The circular cutting head on this trimmer is amazing!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small, compact, and curved to fit the hand</li>
            <li>Strange, really.  </li>
            <li>Got this to do some minor trimming ,and it really does the trick.</li>
            <li>It is relatively small and light weight.  </li>
            <li>Small and light</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not exactly sure i enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li>well, worked as it shd, comfortable using it as comparable to those that i used/owned in the past.</li>
            <li>really lasts LONG</li>
            <li>Does not get everything the first time and tickles but that is expected.</li>
            <li>On the other hand Amazon gave me an instant full credit and sent me a label to print out so the</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li>The flat small trimer works better</li>
            <li>On my first use, I popped a AA battery into the unit, went into the bathroom, turned it on, stuck it up my nose and expected nothing.  </li>
            <li>When he first showed this to me, I was worried he had bought something from sharper image or a store of that sort and spent $$.  </li>
            <li>It was working as I expected at first.</li>
            <li>Works just as expected, nothing much else to say!</li>
            <li>The first one lasted for about three years, functions as expected, no complaints.</li>
            <li>But do you look and feel normal walking around in public?  </li>
            <li>It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Pretty much as expected.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have described, it worked quietly at first, and would have earned 4 stars, but after some months it became too loud to use in my ears.</li>
            <li>This i exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is about Panasonic&#x27;s packaging - I don&#x27;t know why they, or just anyone, use that kind of plastic package, which is awfully hard to open and can easily hurt your fingers.</li>
            <li>Only down side is that it burns through batteries pretty fast.</li>
            <li>The previous reviews were so right as far as &amp;#34;no pulls&amp;#34;, cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li>Hardest part was figuring out how to open it to put the battery in (NOT hard at all)  </li>
            <li>super little trimmer.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get super close, you can still feel a little fuzz.  </li>
            <li>Still working fine after a few years of admittedly occasional use.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not quite a powerful as the small older model, but it does work.</li>
            <li>I expected something a little better than this.</li>
            <li>After that the only thing that came on was the little light.  </li>
            <li>it is a tiny little thing, lightly built.</li>
            <li>My only complaint, it does get hot quickly.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that it goes thru batteries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>Has plenty of power and is easy to maneuver in hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li>, eyebrows take a little more careful use.  </li>
            <li>Those little hand held manual ones always did a good job too, but they are so clumsy.  </li>
            <li>Most of these last a year or so,  so I&#x27;m curious how long this will last.</li>
            <li>I made sure not to press hard on my face or nose to avoid potential bleeding.  </li>
            <li>It works well, fast and lasts for a long time between trims!</li>
            <li>After years using small scissors which was not satisfactory due to small nips/cuts, I found the Panasonic ear and nose trimmer to be the ideal tool.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap little device and worked well enough and suited my purposes just fine, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t last for a full year.  </li>
            <li>New one is significantly larger, but that also makes it easier to grasp, so sort of a trade</li>
            <li>I last one died after 3 years, so replaced with this new model.  </li>
            <li>The blade replacement was the same price as a new product, so I decided to purchase another one.</li>
            <li>I changed the batteries several times with new ones.</li>
            <li>Anyways, adding an item to this kit is basically the biggest compliment I can give an item as I only do it with items that I cant live without.</li>
            <li>but ive tried numerous new batterys</li>
            <li>- If you purchase a replacement tip (set), the cost is about the same as just buying a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer was bought new, I put the battery in, used it for about six minutes total.</li>
            <li>I am going to have to purchase a new one from a different company now.</li>
            <li>When new it instantly shaved the hair so you never feel it.  </li>
            <li>Summery: They do the job as advertised, and last for a couple of years or so, and then you&#x27;re shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li>Perhaps they would prefer to make a larger profit by sell entirely new units instead of replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I inserted a new battery and double checked the polarity, but couldn&#x27;t get it to power up.  </li>
            <li>I think we can live with that, even though we might not admit the use of such an item.</li>
            <li>I had my last one 10 years before buying a new one.</li>
            <li>It does a remarkable job in the trimming of all your facial hair including those little hard to get to places.</li>
            <li>I dropped mine on the hard floor and now it makes a little more noise than at first</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this one, it&#x27;s for your nose not general use?</li>
            <li>I have not had it for very long, but it works very well.</li>
            <li>As I expected, not so excellent nor not too bad.</li>
            <li>and it does a great job of trimming the area immediately beneath the nose which is impossible to reach with my electric shaver/trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several of these all with disappointment, I have used this for a while now and it works great.</li>
            <li>Can clean it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li>Bought to replace an older model (I lost) that looks similar but is no longer made,  Was skeptical give the negative reviews, but have used it several times and works great - closer cut and much quieter than my older unit for nose and ear trimming.</li>
            <li>It works really well and is sturdy, the last 2 I bought broke (a different model and company something like a micro touch and then the micro touch 2?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few weeks, now and it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I am not a person that cares much about physical appearance, but I have to admit that sometimes things go out of control and growing facial hair</li>
            <li>I had difficulty making it travel a straight line along my upper lip, and accidentally cut a notch over my philtrum, which will have to grow back out.</li>
            <li>Facial hair is gently removed and heavier hair such as around hair line is not problem either.</li>
            <li>I was using what I thought was a cheap ($9.99) one from Ross a few years back.</li>
            <li>Got it on a gold box sale for a lot less than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li>Now if only Panasonic would come up with a unit with both systems and actually sell a reasonably priced blade...</li>
            <li>After trying several similar products, this is the one that really works.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to any gentleman.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>so it will last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>At least he has not grumbled about it as yet and he sure does enough of it when he does not like something.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had excessive nose hair as long as I can remember and it just gets better with age - not.  </li>
            <li>At the end of the day, it wasn&#x27;t too big a hit at only $15 or so, but for it to die out that quickly really irked me.  </li>
            <li>instructions for cleaning the trimmer are more confusing than they need to be (a Panasonic trademark) and the actual cleaning is tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>so I think it should at least last a year, maybe more.</li>
            <li>Why does hair - at least more hair than is need for basic filtration - grow in your nose anyway.</li>
            <li>were so cheaply made they broke after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li>Re re-inserting the inner blade into the outer blade-just push it in gently, but there is no way to &#x27;lock&#x27; it in AFAIK, so no real proper orientation or grooves to slide into-don&#x27;t worry about it;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money for the trimmer that cost less than $20</li>
            <li>No pulling, trims very close without having to go back several times to get the job done.</li>
            <li>Works very well, but we&#x27;ll check back later to see how it endures.</li>
            <li>The only beef I&#x27;ve got is that you should definitely keep some rechargeable batteries on hand as it is very draining on them.</li>
            <li>This is my second trimmer, after the first bit the dust after long use.  </li>
            <li>After reading reviews, I spent a few bucks more on this one.</li>
            <li>I feel all these small home electronics are designed pretty well and do work fine for a while, but tend to break down somehow over time.</li>
            <li>I use it a lot on my nose, neck, and ears and it will take them right down to the skin.</li>
            <li>This product does a very nice job and isn&#x27;t very difficult to use.</li>
            <li>I can get it to work on occasion if I unscrew the bottom cap and play with the positioning of the battery, but even then the RPMs rev up and down, the blade makes a grinding sound and the unit puts off a strange odor.  </li>
            <li>This hair trimmer works reasonably well for an inexpensive single AA battery powered device.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works very well on a single AA battery.  </li>
            <li>I generally redistribute the AA battery in about 2-3 months!</li>
            <li>Small, easy to clean but no battery included, always a negative to me.</li>
            <li>It looks the same as many of the others Panasonic put out in the in the past, but it actually works and works well - bravo!  </li>
            <li>After having tried and given up on many other brands, I am extremely grateful to have discovered one that actually works the way I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I expected of it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankful for all the reviews on this item that lead me to trust this purchase!</li>
            <li>Finally; a nose hair trimmer that actually lasts more than a few uses!  </li>
            <li>and my nose is BARE!  </li>
            <li>If you have those stiffies way back in the nostril that have been bothering you, this isn&#x27;t meant to be stuffed deep and has a pretty short barrel tip which causes your nose opening to distort and move the hairs if you do try to reach them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not perfect, but better than most others that have been tried in the past.</li>
            <li>If manufacturers would concentrate on mechanical quality over extra useless marketing settings, I&#x27;d be willing to pay much more $.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t compare this to other makes and models because this is the first one I ever used.</li>
            <li>so I just reverted back to the old tweezer method-ouch!</li>
            <li>It cuts pretty short so for the first day or two afterwards, if you squeeze your nose it hurts a little because of the short prickly hairs.</li>
            <li>A little flimsy, just as many other&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It sucks getting old, but at least I can keep my nose and ear hair trimmed nicely!  </li>
            <li>By &amp;#34;stopped working&amp;#34; I mean that the rotary blade simply refused to spin any more.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it was designed and performs extremely well.  </li>
            <li>The first one just stopped working after about 2 months of infrequent use (1 – 2 min every other week).  </li>
            <li>It has started to vary a bit on the RPM, and it is not due to the battery.</li>
            <li>There no other way to go.</li>
            <li>Some other trimmers can make you feel like Arnold in that scene from the original Total Recall, in which he extracts a homing device from somewhere in his upper nostril.  </li>
            <li>No other problems.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have a major nose hair issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it does exactly like other consumers have indicated.</li>
            <li>I wish that some manufacturer would simply build one that stayed sharp, where they offered reasonably priced replacement parts, and one that will last more than a few months.  </li>
            <li>First battery did not seem to last very long though.</li>
            <li>Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black also tends to get a little warm after a minute or two.</li>
            <li>As the hair grows back, if you scratch your nose (or lets be honest, go digging for gold), you&#x27;ve got these odd little prickly hairs in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works and didn&#x27;t break in half the first time it was turned on like my old one.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to pack in your shaving kit and easily washed.</li>
            <li>This product is easy to clean and hasn&#x27;t broken down yet.</li>
            <li>Does the job, hasn&#x27;t cut me, hasn&#x27;t broken (had it a year) and is pretty mild on the batteries.  </li>
            <li>This model does have a decent battery life but other than that not much else is worth noting.</li>
            <li>Not only is this the best trimmer in the world, but it&#x27;s nearly the least expensive.</li>
            <li>This trimmer eliminates those pesky little hairs cleanly and quietly with no drama.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is, that, while a battery seems to run the thing for a long time,&lt;br /&gt;it really only runs it at an impressive, optimal speed for a dozen or so uses, so, somewhat hard on batteries.</li>
            <li>The real issue I have with it is that it&#x27;s tough and time consuming to clean.</li>
            <li>It comes with a small brush to clean the head--a plus.</li>
            <li>My previous such tool ran off a AAA battery and really didn&#x27;t have much power.  </li>
            <li>Blade is sharp so there is no pulling, and the motor seems powerful enough.</li>
            <li>I replaced a much older off-brand one and this out performs it by a long shot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other electric trimmers that pulled and grabbed and obviously weren&#x27;t fun to use.  </li>
            <li>: I use a bathroom tissue or a q-tip to clean the hair stuck near the blade, also blow air to remove any hard one&#x27;s and has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>/&gt;This really doesn&#x27;t do much for any other spots like your ears or eyebrows, unless you are planning on spending a long time feeding hairs in one by one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i got ever all my other ones where cheap did not last long</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll admit, I was a little nervous shoving this thing around in my nose (a cut inside the nose would not be fun...)</li>
            <li>I own a few other panasonic units from long ago.  </li>
            <li>This drain hole is important so that water can drain when running water over the cutting head to clean it.  </li>
            <li>For the coup de grace, he trimmed the monobrow connector at the top of his nose (something I have to keep reminding him to do), and it worked almost as well as tweezers, in much less time, with much less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li>I like the slight curve design it  has, much better than my previous one</li>
            <li>It worked fine, and still does as long as I change the battery every few uses.</li>
            <li>You are supposed to clean it with every use, but this only takes a few seconds.  </li>
            <li>You might have to go over the same area a few times, but in 1-2 minutes, your nose and ears are clean.</li>
            <li>When it worked, it was fine, but didn&#x27;t last past 2 uses</li>
            <li>It is easy to operate, but not easy to cut long hairs.</li>
            <li>Especially for those of us older males who consider hairs sprouting from one&#x27;s nostrils or ears sort of gross.</li>
            <li>I have read reports that it dies rather quick, less than or around 1 year of solid use before it goes belly up.  </li>
            <li>I thought I should have to pay more for a decent trimmer, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li>It is quick, easy and painless!&lt;br /&gt;Better than cutting the nose hairs with scissors</li>
            <li>I eventually determined that to ship it back for warranty repair would cost more than the original price, so I gave up and tossed it in the garbage, which appears to be the proper storage container for this disappointing product from Panasonic.</li>
            <li>This one never does, I would highly recommend it for anyone with an odd shaped nose or if you haven&#x27;t had luck with older model Panasonics.</li>
            <li>This seems to work okay, haven&#x27;t used in wet applications yet, however seems to work about the same as another brand bought at the drug store - just a little fancier design.  </li>
            <li>In my experience many trimmers don&#x27;t have very powerful motors, or they fail in some other way after a short time.  </li>
            <li>IF you ever have trouble breathing, are short of breathe, exercise, and just plain want more energy, use these!</li>
            <li>Although the design looks about the same as the other models there must be a slight change in the design to make it work better.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is quiet and cuts better (less hair pulled out by the roots) than other trimmers.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used several trimmers and while the blades eventually become dull and render the trimmer useless, Panasonic makes the best trimmers.  </li>
            <li>I had struggled with bad trimmers for years, but this Panasonic trimmer is great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s too bad, it would otherwise have been a great product.</li>
            <li>- it&#x27;s too bad because they work great - until they don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>works amazing, you can use it in your nose and it does not feel weird or like it&#x27;s going to cut you.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and has metal cutting blades not those plastic ones that never last.</li>
            <li>At least they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li>I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier at how well these perform and how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li>The build quality etc seem to be alright, but generally it seems to be underpowered.</li>
            <li>it really doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should.</li>
            <li>I really like this thing and since it is from Panasonic,I know it will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Looks like other cheap nose hair trimmers that I have had, but this thing is really sharp.  </li>
            <li>Its light, it&#x27;s quiet, it&#x27;s small and compact.</li>
            <li>It is very well made and should last a long time.</li>
            <li>When I opened the box, I wondered about the performance of such a light small device.  </li>
            <li>I used to go to important events with a small number of 3 inch hairs protruding from chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s small enough to fit in my backpack</li>
            <li>This may very well be the last in a long line of trimmers for me.</li>
            <li>I am very curios to see how long it will last.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the instruction book is as clear as it could be (for cleaning purposes) and that&#x27;s the only downfall to the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Small enough to fit in a convenient place at home or on the road.</li>
            <li>Not a fun item to have to purchase in life, however, when that sad day comes, this is a great item to buy.</li>
            <li>By design,tip does not go in far enough to hit eardrum,also too blount.</li>
            <li>During my recent move I lost my old one</li>
            <li>This model is barely acceptable.</li>
            <li>Apparently you can replace the blade after a suggested three years, but for the price of the unit (I paid $10)</li>
            <li>Panasonic quality is apparent.</li>
            <li>product works very well and as expected</li>
            <li>I found they didn&#x27;t last, they nicked too much, didn&#x27;t cut close enough, etc, and always went back to scissors.&lt;br</li>
            <li>not where it burns you, but enough that you cant use it near skin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t allow you to go to far and irritate the hair back in your nose.  </li>
            <li>Bought this trimmer cause my old trimmer finally gave out on me.</li>
            <li>Trimming nose and facial hair is now a 100% completely painless endeavor.</li>
            <li>This one you barely notice.</li>
            <li>Big improvement over my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I tried to use it on my 5 year old&#x27;s overly extensive eyebrows but it ended up pulling out a eyebrow hair which hurt her</li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>I purchased this mid-July 2013 and it barely made it to the end of November 2013.</li>
            <li>Apparently nothing broke</li>
            <li>I thought all these trimmers were the same so when my old Panasonic died I bought this one.  </li>
            <li>I bought the trimmer with no regrets.</li>
            <li>Just rotate the collar to the well marked faucet simple on the trimmer and run it under water with the power on.  </li>
            <li>I had been using an inexpensive old noisy thing , and this is a vast improvement.  </li>
            <li>Thankfully, my husband is still young enough not to have ear hair, but his nose hair is another story.</li>
            <li>Apparently my body hates me.  </li>
            <li>Never dropped, never wet.</li>
            <li>I tend to have longer nose hairs and have frequently picked at them for my entire life.  </li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t be surprised if it wears out sooner than later.</li>
            <li>This thing works, but you need to be careful not to be too liberal with it because it can really be aggressive on its taking hair out.</li>
            <li>Apparently my body hates me.</li>
            <li>Not wanting to put a razor to such sensitive skin, I looked for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>That said, I only put it in my ear to see how loud it would be and hopefully won&#x27;t need it for that functionality for some time.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s near whisper quiet, and doesn&#x27;t seem to use my charge at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I barely have need to use these once every 3 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t attest to how it operates next to the ear drum, but as far as cleaning out nose hair</li>
            <li>He actually used it though and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>This worked very well although I have never used it in the shower or in the wet</li>
            <li>ONLY cut the longer hairs near the front of your nose.  </li>
            <li>Battery life, so far, has been several months.  </li>
            <li>The Panasonic people apparently designed this device with ergonomic principles in mind.</li>
            <li>It painlessly removes hair from sensitive areas such as the ears and nose.</li>
            <li>Back to trimming hair the old fashioned way, I guess.</li>
            <li>Barely gets the job done.</li>
            <li>Never would go back to old method.</li>
            <li>Apparently quality control was skipped for the trimmer I received.</li>
            <li>Have only used mine 3 times so far</li>
            <li>Well made, quiet, does not pull or tug on hairs in sensitive areas - does the job it was intended to do.  </li>
            <li>Now it barely turns on, and i need to tweak the metal connector to make it work.</li>
            <li>I was surprised how it works without any possible pain.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>This modestly priced grooming tool is my weapon of choice in the escalating war against facial hair that I am now prepared to face.  </li>
            <li>No regrets.</li>
            <li>Replaced an old unit of a different brand which had lasted for years.  </li>
            <li>To start, I am a 25 year old mostly-Italian male.</li>
            <li>and it recently just stopped working completely.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far</li>
            <li>Only used it about 4 times so far.</li>
            <li>Never thought I would be old enough to write a review about a nose hair trimmer,  sigh.</li>
            <li>last week the blade makes loud mechanical noise.</li>
            <li>was picturing chainsaw action when I read &amp;#34;nose hair clipper&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s actually painless, no pulling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It barely cut nose hairs and quit working after 6 or 7 uses over 4 month period.  </li>
            <li>having owned several of these devices, i&#x27;ve still not seen anything comparable to the old heavy-duty sharper image \\&quot;turbo groomer 2.0\\</li>
            <li>So far the only brand I have found that works is Panasonic.  </li>
            <li>after 5 months this stopped working, my husband barely used it at all.</li>
            <li>and when I put it back together it started making a loud buzzing noise when I turned it on and when I tried using it</li>
            <li>Have only just used it once so far on nose &amp; ears.</li>
            <li>I got this about a week ago and have used it several times so far.</li>
            <li>I have yet to use this item because we apparently threw out the &#x27;blades&#x27; that come with it?  </li>
            <li>This is a replacement for my old reliable Panasonic trimmer that finally gave out.</li>
            <li>It cuts very close and with minimal pulling.</li>
            <li>It was never dropped or mishandled, just lived its short existence in my medicine cabinet before failing completely.</li>
            <li>Something about the idea of a nose hair trimmer made me feel old even though I am only 25.</li>
            <li>Growing old is definitely not for sissies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>old Panasonic trimmer finally wore out after three days of plowing through the nose beard.</li>
            <li>Once you have nicked the interior of your nasal passage by trying to maneuver another trimmer, you will so appreciate the double blade action and smoothness of this item.</li>
            <li>I had a old panisonic like this one that has seen it&#x27;s final days</li>
            <li>this barely works.</li>
            <li>Only used it twice so far - for nose hair removal.</li>
            <li>and i could barely tell that it was on.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not prone to dropping things, but I was surprised when it smashed the entire metal &amp;#34;head&amp;#34;, making it useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Barely worked ...</li>
            <li>Cuts very close and works just as I expected it would.</li>
            <li>my only problem was that it would not work with the battery seated correctly, it would work with the battery almost completely out of it&#x27;s bracket ( don&#x27;t remember how discovered that ), then you couldn&#x27;t put on the bottom battery cover.</li>
            <li>I have only used a couple of times so far.</li>
            <li>Not much to say really.</li>
            <li>At that time, it stopped working, but after around a week, I tried it again, and it worked, albeit, barely.  </li>
            <li>Thanks  everything expected.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness he is now back in action.</li>
            <li>Bought this for my husband when his old one finally died after 15 years.  </li>
            <li>Quiet and soft to both ears and nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bought as a belated Christmas present for my 28 year old son.  </li>
            <li>put the old one back in and it worked.  </li>
            <li>I had an old style Panasonic that lasted for years and expect this one to last too.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost next to impossible to get a good steady stream of water to flush it out as it is depicted.  </li>
            <li>After a few uses, it will start buzzing loudly and the tip will get really hot and it won&#x27;t cut anything.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve bought it for a few weeks, and by far it works pretty well:</li>
            <li>My husband really liked this this trimmer for his random nose and ear hairs.  </li>
            <li>Kind of expensive, but in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer does a good job of cutting close.</li>
            <li>Not quite as effective as I was hoping for, but then again it wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used these things before and good lord sometimes instead of cutting the hair it just pulls it.  </li>
            <li>The blade does a good job of cutting through hairs without snagging.</li>
            <li>Decreased sexual stamina.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know why some have found this to crap out in a short period of time, as I&#x27;ve been using mine regularly for almost three years, and it still works great!</li>
            <li>The guys with none on top seem to have it worse.  </li>
            <li>and I figured cutting them out would be a good idea.</li>
            <li>It works ok, but not great.</li>
            <li>It works perfectly, no pulling the hair, so no discomfort of any kind.</li>
            <li>They stand behind the products more than anyone else on the internet.</li>
            <li>It does a good job of cutting the hair close without hurting or pulling.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t do a good job cutting the hairs.</li>
            <li>It does a good job at cutting hair though.</li>
            <li>It does a good job cutting hairs and not pulling them out.</li>
            <li>I’ll have to go back to maintaining my mustache with a razor and the little scissors, which is a pain in the kiester, but at least works right, consistently, the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Superior to the less expensive Panasonic model I used previously; although both use a single AA battery, this model has better speed and perhaps sharper blades</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d bought a WAHL brand nose trimmer in the past and it hardly did a thing, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this nose trimmer only once, but it got any hairs, for sure and right away.</li>
            <li>This little guy gets the job done easily and with minimal pain.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it arrived damaged or not, but the inner blade rubs on the outer blade quite a bit thus slowing it down and making kind of a racket.</li>
            <li>I would give it a 5 stars &#x27;cause it is very comfortable and safer than other used in the past.</li>
            <li>Bought this as a Christmas gift for my other half and it does the trick easily and painlessly.  </li>
            <li>Reminder to myself (and anyone else):  to avoid pain, replace the battery at the first sign it&#x27;s slowing down.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It was not very expensive by itself but given its lifespan, I spent $3 a trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another attribute of the Vortex that is different, yet at the same time brilliant, is a small ring near the cone tip that when twisted, opens a small hole where you can run water through to clean it.  </li>
            <li>cool for few weeks but easy to be broken</li>
            <li>Nice, no pulling, my only complaint is that the single battery design means that as soon as voltage drops a tad, it doesn&#x27;t have enough torque to start.</li>
            <li>I have always swore by this trimmer and only had to buy a new one because I left it at a hotel while traveling.</li>
            <li>4 different, new, different brand batteries tried and still nothing.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works really well and the battery last a very long time (of course you don&#x27;t need to use it too often).</li>
            <li>This one is far better than other similar products that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li>easy to store, cheap; there&#x27;s nothing bad to say about it</li>
            <li>I was able to get done is less than few mins.</li>
            <li>This ear &amp; nose trimmer is much smaller &amp; less powerful than I thought.</li>
            <li>I have a Norelco all-in-one that is twice as loud and not nearly as effective with quick trims</li>
            <li>After a few months it would studder and stop a need a quick take apart and put back together to keep going.</li>
            <li>but you can easily injure yourself in a incredibly annoying but mostly harmless way if you get overzealous.</li>
            <li>I felt mild stinging in my nose for the next few days while it healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In my case (probably due to so much hair) the trimmer did indeed get warm but it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable or anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>No, it doesn&#x27;t trim right down to the skin level, but that&#x27;s not necessary, and not even desirable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It seems to not go too long before new batteries are needed</li>
            <li>Did take a few uses to get the procedure right</li>
            <li>you&#x27;d be surprised to know that this little gadget is used on the space shuttle to gyrate a powerful telescope, and circulate the oxygen in ratios similar to those present here on earth.</li>
            <li>Works well for keeping those ugly nose hairs from making unsightly public appearances; love the ability to run water through the head to clean it without having to take it apart</li>
            <li>First one I&#x27;ve used, purchased based on previous reviews.</li>
            <li>Better than other units I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s okay... but doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs as well as other units i have owned, including some past panasonic units.</li>
            <li>This trimmer works well, and lasts longer due to its larger battery and being a higher quality item.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure it works better than any other.  </li>
            <li>Head and shoulders better than any of the other Nose/Ear trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>A review a product is essential for other s who are interested is buying it.</li>
            <li>They work better than other clippers I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li>My one, minor criticism is that unlike other trimmers, it doesn&#x27;t have a optional &#x27;hedge-trimmer&#x27; attachment, which would be so useful to keep sideburns and eyebrows tamed.</li>
            <li>It is a small appliance and tucks away quickly.</li>
            <li>The small, but sleek design, fits in a drawer and out of the way when not in use, or sits on the counter as a bold statement that you care.</li>
            <li>quick, painless, slick-</li>
            <li>Hard to get too excited about a nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li>Fast, easy and quick way to get rid of annoying nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li>Every so often I would notice hairs both long and short poking out around the edges, which I would hedge back with scissors, fingertips (did I say that I have large nostrils?) and  tweezers.</li>
            <li>The first powered trimmer that I used was a generic, shipped directly from China and cost a little under $3.</li>
            <li>Finally needed to replace my old Wahl ear and nose trimmer, was surprised how mediocre reviews are for most models these days.</li>
            <li>My only  complaint is battery operated and when the battery is low the spinning is slow and catches the hair at times,  Pther than that is great</li>
            <li>Good power and not the hard to hold onto tiny things usually associated with this style of grooming.</li>
            <li>Maybe that&#x27;s to be expected with a less expensive item like this, but I&#x27;d gladly pay extra for something more reliable.</li>
            <li>Bought to replace a previous Panasonic trimmer (which was becoming less sharp/effective).</li>
            <li>The cutting action is far superior to cheaper models, with hair being caught and ripped out far less often.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not very heavy, but it feels solid and durable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a little obsessed when it comes to this type of grooming &amp; I&#x27;m happy I got this.  </li>
            <li>Works great for those silly little husband nose whiskers.</li>
            <li>It is small enough to easily fit into a nostril or ear and actually cuts the hair, rather than ripping them out like another brand he tried.  </li>
            <li>The blades are really sharp &amp; fast, so no hairs get pulled.</li>
            <li>They cut the hairs in the nose and ear very well, and seem to work well in other areas also.</li>
            <li>It removes the hairs that are hard to remove and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li>tried other trimmers so I can&#x27;t really compare</li>
            <li>but NOTHING... maybe a little ticklish, but WOW it worked really well...</li>
            <li>/&gt;We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time, but at its extremely affordable price, I won&#x27;t mind too much if it konks out in 18 months or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>hard to clean.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have too much experience with this type of product, I did buy one other nose and ear groomer about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li>This battery powered unit works very well, but it is a bit louder than the other Wahl unit I had with the crappy rechargable battery.</li>
            <li>This item was very well priced and worked extremely well.  </li>
            <li>I have no complaints other than the fact that i think mine might be a bit defective because it seems like the AA battery in it drains extremely fast.</li>
            <li>I have used other models, and they just did not cut the hairs very well, so it took forever to use, and they were really hard to clean</li>
            <li>Works really well without pulling the hair or causing pain, like some of the other products out there.</li>
            <li>With hundreds of other reviews, I don&#x27;t have much to add.  </li>
            <li>I find that it work very well and no pulling of hairs or any other discomfort.</li>
            <li>So much easier than any other method that I&#x27;ve tried of managing nose hairs.</li>
            <li>Blade is sharp and trims very close and doesn&#x27;t pull or cut skin.</li>
            <li>Took me awhile (a few times) to get used to sticking a buzzing device up my nose, but I love this little guy.</li>
            <li>I recommend it if you don&#x27;t need something a little more heavy duty.</li>
            <li>No girl wants to see a rogue curly-que coming out of your nostrils on a first date or a 500th date for that matter so cut those bad boys back with this easy to use man-scaping tool.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not easy following the instructions as they make it more complex than it really is.</li>
            <li>For the low price I can&#x27;t complain but it certainly did not live up to the numerous 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li>The nose trimmer I previously owned is no longer on the market and although it worked well, the Panasonic outperforms it in the areas of pinch due to hair pull, design, size and sound.</li>
            <li>the inner blade is very small and easily lost.</li>
            <li>Definitely more \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; than the 2 or 3 other similar products I&#x27;ve tried in the same price range.</li>
            <li>I bought it because of the positive reviews, but after I used it several times I am not sure why this product is rated so high.</li>
            <li>As a warning, make sure you have new batteries, using old ones can tug on the nose hairs rather than cutting them.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was simply over taken by the extreme amount of positive reviews on Amazon for this Nose &amp; Ear Trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried at least twelve different models over the years (including that huge trimmer from Sharper Image)</li>
            <li>So far so good on this bad boy.</li>
            <li>And I really did like this up until it completely stopped working a few months into its life.  </li>
            <li>Cutting is quick and clean, no pulling or tearing.  </li>
            <li>trimmers that all started out great but then failed within a few months.</li>
            <li>Gives me illusions of adequacy in close social situations.</li>
            <li>Thing does NOT spin fat enough (a problem the old one exhibited but after several years of use)</li>
            <li>The blades seem set back just a bit too far for short hair, but it gets the job done well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very picky about electronics and gadgets that I buy and spent hours looking at reviews for nose and facial hair</li>
            <li>I have spent so much time &amp; money trying different trimmers &amp; none</li>
            <li>So, I am old enough to need to actually replace one of these.  </li>
            <li>If you buy this for a frail old man, please do him a big favor and open it for him.</li>
            <li>My only advice is to get as far away from this product as possible.</li>
            <li>Seemed to work pretty slick so far.</li>
            <li>This one does a much quicker, better cutting job</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll purchase next time something from a brand that will stand behind their product, even if it costs more.</li>
            <li>unit is worth the few extra dollars</li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t a game changer of nose hair trimming or anything, So far battery life is sound.</li>
            <li>Felt only 2 small tugs (not painful)...</li>
            <li>I see Panasonic sells a model similar to that still...but can&#x27;t say if it works better or worse than this</li>
            <li>Not as good at cutting as my last trimmer.</li>
            <li>This trimmer had the most positive stars and least negative stars.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, works flawlessly, no pain at all!!  </li>
            <li>The blades could very easily get bent and render this useless.</li>
            <li>However, if you place it about half way down, it will rotate just fine.</li>
            <li>I love it, no more plucking my nose hair and tears dripping down my cheeks.</li>
            <li>Does tickle the nose a little at first, but one gets used to that.</li>
            <li>This little unit does exactly what it say&#x27;s it will do and does not pinch or hurt.  </li>
            <li>This little thing works wonders but first timers should use caution not to over cut your nose hair.</li>
            <li>Woks better than other similar devices I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>He said it felt a little funny to use, but worked well.</li>
            <li>At first he was a little worried that it might cut him but after giving it a try he loves it.</li>
            <li>The quiet motor and the little drain hole make this one a little better than the others that I have used.  </li>
            <li>Feels a little flimsy at first but does the job without problem.</li>
            <li>Does the job better than any other similar trimmer I have used in the past.</li>
            <li>the ones that lay flat against the bottom inside part of your nostril, that you can only see with a small mirror and light.</li>
            <li>and I actually own several differnet panasonic models over the last 10+ years, this one is up there with being the best, these will last you a couple of years(2)  depending on use, after that be prepared to buy a new one, they dull out and start pulling which can be extremely painful, but 15 bucks every other year is a small price to pay to not have to creep out folks and digust them with nose or ear hair dangling!</li>
            <li>I had a brand new one not just go dead, but apparently the motor burned out or something in transit, because even with a new battery, it wouldn&#x27;t work again.</li>
            <li>I see that Panasonic offers several models, even one with a vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li>it has little pieces you can easily drop down the sink.</li>
            <li>Replaced my old trimmer which had gotten dull and did not have much power left in it even with new batteries.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and shaped just right for holding it without it being awkward.  </li>
            <li>It always takes me a few minutes to get it back on just the right way in order to continue to trim.</li>
            <li>Even thought they are a little more expensive, they are worth it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately I am missing the little back blade that fits at the top.</li>
            <li>The tip does get a little warm, but that&#x27;s the only negative I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li>It does not get that dirty in the first place, but it cleans easily too.</li>
            <li>It does the job but am not sure how well it will hold on over a year, Electric / powered grooming products typically are made and feel more robust and sturdier than this unit.</li>
            <li>This product is better than all previous brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty quiet and makes way less noise than my beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had several trimmers in the past that died quickly or pulled rather than trimmed</li>
            <li>Much smaller units but quiet powerful motors that last very long on a a single set of batteries.  </li>
            <li>However, even though the trimmer is under warranty, I&#x27;m not willing to spent the cost of shipping (which is more than half of the cost of the trimmer itself) to find out whether my hunch is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other sites sell replacement heads, but they generally cost more than even the fancy ER430 vacuum-model (which, thankfully, uses the same head as this one, so at least I can cannabilize this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Generally speaking, the panasonic trimmer simply does its job, and</li>
            <li>but it certainly is strange that we can&#x27;t find anything that works like the old one, which was also a Panasonic, but</li>
            <li>Apparently I have spider legs that like to hang out of my big nose.</li>
            <li>This is totally waterproof and has never jammed or pulled hair.</li>
            <li>I can no long use this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>was just barely peeking at the world (only a wife would notice).</li>
            <li>Barely has enough power to trim any hair</li>
            <li>The next time I used it, it barely did anything.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several other models of electric trimmers bought at local big box stores, but while they did OK starting out, they tended to fall apart after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li>-- I misplaced the first one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different brands for nose trimmer, but they don&#x27;t last literally 6 months; they are flimsy, easily broken, and not working well.</li>
            <li>well worth the small price, no chance to stab yourself</li>
            <li>At first I just thought it was dead batt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s round, so you don&#x27;t have to doing any funny maneuvers.</li>
            <li>The first I had for a few weeks</li>
            <li>After a few seconds of use it gets too hot for my nostrils.</li>
            <li>That is likely something that is unavoidable with devices such as this, but I cant help feeling kind of weird using this.</li>
            <li>My old one was more expensive and used a rechargeable internal battery.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first round of batteries.</li>
            <li>After a few uses(about 8 or so) I heard this horrendous grinding noise and the tip got really hot and even quit working...</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was a bit worried, at first, after a few sitcoms spoofed this type of product.  </li>
            <li>My first one died after a few months of not-that-heavy use, hopefully it was just a fluke.</li>
            <li>If you purchase, I think you&#x27;ll agree that this product is worth the small cost.</li>
            <li>only thing is if the product came with a  small cloth, it would have been easy to dry it off immediately, instead keeping it outside for 10 mins or so.</li>
            <li>My allergies make a little nose hair feel like a log in my nasal passage; how many hours did I waste with a little clipper trying to precisely cut one little hair.</li>
            <li>, this product cut it down very close to the skin&lt;br</li>
            <li>this one is the real deal: Trims me down to my baby-soft nostril lining in no time, and doesn&#x27;t slime over in the process.</li>
            <li>i have gone through soo many batteries on this thing, and i dont even hardly use it!!</li>
            <li>$14.99 very well spent!!</li>
            <li>This is a huge disappointment since it was a gift and had such positive reviews!</li>
            <li>You cannot go wrong with this purchase and the seller I had got it to me very quickly!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Panasonic had a model number previous to this one, which was otherwise the exact same (on the outside).</li>
            <li>maybe the internal is not sharp enough.</li>
            <li>The first day or so it felt like little prickers after the initial cut.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband to use and at first I think he was a little miffed at me (because I was obviously telling him that he needed one).  </li>
            <li>This one&#x27;s nice because the trimmed hairs are not sharp and do not poke after cutting.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is just what the well groomed older dude needs to look sharp.</li>
            <li>The old model needed to clean taking off the metal blade and with the time it is affected and the motion axel also (finally after 5 years it failed), this new model do not need to disassemble the system</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought quite a few different nose and facial trimmers, spend far too much money over the years trying to find something that works well on these stubborn nose hairs.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a normal 3rd generation Irish Californian American with probably less hair than my New York counterparts.</li>
            <li>Tends to wear down battery fairly quickly - and cutting is just &#x27;OK&#x27;</li>
            <li>The blade seems to be very sharp, too, because it cuts hair very close.</li>
            <li>I saw at a local store other trimmers at a similar price but these all had a much thicker metal end.</li>
            <li>Cutting action does not seem to be superior to other brands.</li>
            <li>Tried a new battery and found a bit of rust in the battery compartment, which was completely closed.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times and not a single nick or pull.  </li>
            <li>blades are super sharp and trimmed all down to the root.  </li>
            <li>Received high rating on other sites.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t owned this item very long,  but so far it has met all  required needs.  </li>
            <li>Due to the concern over long-term durability, I give this four stars, but still recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li>It was far easier and you can get the trimmer much cleaner by disassembling it and cleaning it with the small brush</li>
            <li>I am really disappointed that such a low-use product that does not require a great amount of components could just stop working.  </li>
            <li>There also a slight curve to the unit, why settle for a straight one?&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>(the whole black area is the head and can be unscrewed by hand, counter clockwise.</li>
            <li>Battery life is much longer that my previous trimmer, and this one trims faster.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really a lot less concerned about a stray hair popping out.</li>
            <li>Trims hair that my previous trimmers could not get to.&lt;br /&gt;The washable head makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li>All the ones I have previously bought cost about $20 and the batteries wore out fast.</li>
            <li>day when I was visiting my 96 year old Dad, I caught him trimming his nose hairs with a small very pointy pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>My own personal nasal hedge trimmer that actually works, I guess the double blade cutting action is the thing to look for in these devices.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t reach far enough into your nostril to clip the really long hairs before they start growing out of your nose again by 5 o&#x27;clock.</li>
            <li>So after each use it is simple and quick enough to just twist open the cleaning port, shoot some clean cold tap water through it, give a shake, and put it away.  </li>
            <li>but it seems there is a poor connection inside the unit that has happened pretty much from day one.</li>
            <li>My first month worked with one pill of battery but next, it wasted 5 per shave.</li>
            <li>Bought it the last day of January and now the first day of June it is dead.</li>
            <li>Performs the same as my first Panasonic noise/ear remover purchased  in 2000.........still sold and a few dollars cheaper</li>
            <li>Worked well for the first few months, but now it only sporadically turns on.</li>
            <li>Without warning, a few months after owning my first one it suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li>This is basically the same design, but it seems like it has just a little less power than the old model - Still adequate</li>
            <li>Once I got past that rude awakening, I saw the product as the great little device it is.</li>
            <li>Much better than the Wahl I had before which seemed to slow down quite a bit.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not rechargeable, but runs on a single AA battery which you won&#x27;t have to change too frequently.</li>
            <li>It turns out that the one I had was dull and for sure this one will not yank half of my nostril into the blades.</li>
            <li>So I stick with light pressure and numerous repetition, and still end up with some dark stubble and a few stubborn hairs that won&#x27;t stand up where they can be cut.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how normal that would be or any other to compare it to.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a few weeks into my first battery with regular use and there&#x27;s no sign of low juice yet.</li>
            <li>To quote another reviewer because the same thing happened to me after several uses:  &amp;#34;After a few uses(about 8 or so) I heard this horrendous grinding noise and the tip got really hot and even quit working...</li>
            <li>Seeing as how I live in the deep woods and am writing this from an e-ternet cafe in unknown location of London</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this over other similar products.</li>
            <li>This really works well for nose-hair trimming and when it comes to cleaning the cutting chamber it is almost too easy.</li>
            <li>I have not used a whole lot just yet,  but big improvement over my previous device.  </li>
            <li>The ability to wash it with water with the vortex action is convenient but I believe it is still necessary to remove the head after washing to allow it to dry fully.</li>
            <li>My previous trimmer, which broke, had a straight blade with a comb-like blade guard, which left exposed nose hair stubble and irritated tender skin inside my nostrils.</li>
            <li>i even take this thing to my eyebrows (because im a real man) and it keeps things tight up</li>
            <li>My only real complaint is bits of hair it can leave in your nostril - I think their is a model with a vacuum on it, but it will cost you more for that feature.</li>
            <li>Works really well, doesn&#x27;t pull sensitive hairs as it is cutting and has lasted pretty well for battery life so far.</li>
            <li>It has a very comfortable handle, and is not too complicated to figure out.</li>
            <li>I had two purchased and the other is still working, and offers a fine comfortable cut of hair that my nose seems more anxious to grow hair than on the top of my head, but given the other one failed with such little use, I was disappointed given I normally have always been a Panasonic brand fan.</li>
            <li>No problems so far except the double A battery doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li>Industrial strength because one of the hairs was long and gnarly and very resistant to other methods.</li>
            <li>This is a well-made bathroom utensil, and is likely to last much longer than previous one I have bought.</li>
            <li>Only negative is that it does go through batteries quickly, about every month or so with regular use.</li>
            <li>This ear and nose hair trimmer barely runs--almost from the start, it slowed down and sounds as though the battery is low, but the battery is new.</li>
            <li>I dropped my 15 year old Panasonic &#x27;personal groomer&#x27; and the tip must have bent slightly because noise level increased and the cutting was not as good as before the fall.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m shocked.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway..this little thing works very well.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I think I would like the trim to be a little closer.  </li>
            <li>Construction feels a little sacrificed on this unit, it doesn&#x27;t have a very robust feel to it, nor does it carry heft.  </li>
            <li>How can one purchase do so much for so little money.</li>
            <li>This little trimmer really works well for trimming those pesky nose and ear hairs.  </li>
            <li>Not a game changer, but it works with a little patience.</li>
            <li>This little jewel really does the job.  </li>
            <li>The single AA battery gets tired fast and isn&#x27;t really powerful enough to demolish ear and nose hair.  </li>
            <li>After the first use I took the cutting head off to clean it and everything came apart.</li>
            <li>but I really like the potential of this little product.</li>
            <li>I have never had a trimmer remove as much hair as this one does with such little (NO) pain.  </li>
            <li>first i thought that i had weak batteries but putting in new one did not help.</li>
            <li>They do a very good job cutting hair although one must move slowly</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s as good or bad as others I have purchased,&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why it crapped out, it&#x27;s cheap and not worth my time to warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be afraid to put it against your noise \\&quot;walls.\\&quot; The last trimmer I had cut them, but this one is elegant and efficient, never missing a hair.</li>

            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for anything else, I don&#x27;t think in my opinion that it would be a good eyebrow trimmer or moustache trimmer, in fact if you wanted to use it for anything else besides trimming your nose hair,I think it would suck.</li>

            <li> I actually liked it.  </li>

            <li> I will say this is my go to tool to keep my nose tidy.</li>

            <li> No longer cut effectively.</li>
            <li> I liked this one because it is affordable and can be cleaned with water.</li>
            <li> Best one, clips close and clean no pulled hairs and cleans out easy.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive yet effective solution for trimming nose and ear hair.    </li>
            <li> Gets slightly warm as it does its work.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good product but the top popped off, the blade fell out and that was the end of it.  </li>
            <li> Then I found all the good reviews for this baby and decided to try once more.</li>
            <li> oh my, it tickles!!&lt;br /&gt;Its reliable and effective.</li>
            <li> It really works great!</li>

            <li> It seems nice a friend recommended it to me.</li>
            <li> Nice design, reaches into nooks and crannies and does a nice trim job.</li>
            <li> You: I would think it would be good for more than 4 monjths?</li>

            <li> Gift recipient liked it.</li>
            <li> It fits nicely in the palm of your hand and is lightweight.</li>
            <li> They asked me to ship the item at my own cost.</li>
            <li> The ability to wash it out is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> Now, every thing is nice and trim.  </li>
            <li> Bought this so I could stop trying to pluck nose/ear hairs with tweezers because let&#x27;s be honest, that hurts.</li>
            <li> the rinse/clean feature is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Cleaning feature is nice, but as others have written, I hope it doesn&#x27;t lead to the trimmer breaking.</li>
            <li> Nice design.  </li>
            <li> I knew when I bought it, this would be nice with an eyebrow trimmer, etc.  </li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s nice if I wanted to.</li>
            <li> Fits hand nicely and does the job.  </li>
            <li> Dig for the noise, and when you can&#x27;t  find any more noise doing a good 360-degree sweep of the perimeter, you are getting the job done, but</li>
            <li> This is a nice compact device and it works well.</li>
            <li> Neither of us has managed to cut ourselves with it, and we now both have nice hairless</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best ear trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Cuts nice</li>
            <li> Nice.  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my dad and he really liked it.</li>
            <li> Nothing like familiarity to make a product liked.  </li>
            <li> Cuts nasal hairs nicely and doesn&#x27;t hurt to use this product.  </li>
            <li> I really liked this product while using it.</li>
            <li> Drainage port comes in handy for cleaning.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy this, slay your Nostril Symbiote, and stop smelling your own boogers.</li>
            <li> I like his nose and ears perfectly groomed and this worked perfect for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> , i cant ask for better, good stuff.</li>
            <li> and I really liked it when it did work.  </li>
            <li> A gift... assume he liked it...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quiet, easy to clean, great!</li>
            <li> The blades cut nicely and don&#x27;t snag at your nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Nice design and feel too.</li>
            <li> Considering the quality, the price is really nice.</li>
            <li> I will be using this handy tool a lot</li>
            <li> It was nice when it worked, but after 3 months it doesn&#x27;t do anything anymore.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to buy something inexpensive that does what it says it will do and lasts.</li>
            <li> Thank you kindly.</li>
            <li> I really liked the design of this hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Yes, it cuts effectively</li>
            <li> This one you kind of have to keep running it around the inside of your nose to get rid of the hair.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts, easy to clean, perfect product.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in the hand.  </li>
            <li> excellent experience, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> effective.</li>
            <li> It cuts close to the skin which is nice because you don&#x27;t have to use it every day.</li>
            <li> I made this handy chart for reference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair</li>
            <li> Cleaning feature is a nice touch which separates this model from the others.  </li>
            <li> There is no tugging or pulling, and it just does a nice job.</li>

            <li> I had become so accustomed to my trimmer catching and snaging hair that I assumed pain and tears were just apart of getting rid of those hairs.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but make sure the battery is good or it can pull on the hair some times.</li>
            <li> Superb working and machine parts r 100% genuine n highly advanced state of the art design makes comfort to come in ur hands.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and very affordable.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m pleased with this choice.</li>
            <li> Worked 4 or 5 times okay, but now doesn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t count how many times I stabbed myself.</li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> Buy it for sure.</li>
            <li> This one may have too many options than I needed.</li>
            <li> Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I think it does a better job than others in it&#x27;s price range.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe.  </li>
            <li> Thought I was safe with so many reviews.  </li>
            <li> and yet this worked so much better</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> But I like the Norelco better</li>
            <li> This works well, better than the mangroomer one I had before.  </li>
            <li> Finally the perfect trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I jsut want to say that I sure luv this shaver.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure they all do that.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it uses one AA Battery.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer on the market because its the only trimmer that works inside my nostrils without hurting me.</li>
            <li> but this one seems to be of better quality.</li>
            <li> It cuts shorter (more like trimmers used to)so</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> in a lack of a better word ~ satisfying.</li>
            <li> and I love not having to take care of this for him.</li>
            <li> Has a cap you can place on top when you are finished using it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I tried this one twice, but still can&#x27;t give more than 1 star.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Best nose ear and facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I used it one (1) time and now it doesn&#x27;t work and because it has been more than 30 days</li>
            <li> This does a much better job without the irritation.  </li>
            <li> Save your money and buy something with a better design.</li>
            <li> Best of all it runs off of a standard battery</li>
            <li> and I love that I don&#x27;t have to plug this in and charge it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It is definitely more power than the attachment on the multi-function grooming tool.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and looks good too.</li>
            <li> works much better for me than the &amp;#34;toothbrush&amp;#34; style trimmers.</li>
            <li> the blades would not be able to cut and end up pulling.  </li>
            <li> Most definitely one of my best purchases here on Amazon.com!  </li>
            <li> you can find much better ...</li>
            <li> able to get those sprouts</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> Only wish it had a rechargable battery, otherwise works just great!</li>
            <li> Pain free hair removal!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with my purchase especially at the price.  </li>
            <li> and Im used it for more than one year.</li>
            <li> This works well, better than the one</li>
            <li> I used couple of trimmer before but this one feels much better in use.</li>
            <li> Best one I have ever used actually.</li>
            <li> but I think I will invest in more rechargeable batteries from energizer or Duracell, etc...</li>
            <li> Perhaps of its shape and slender form it can get into those more recessed areas.      </li>
            <li> Outstanding value, too.</li>
            <li> Much better than the cheaper versions by Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Works good, easy to clean</li>
            <li> None of which produced more than a trickle of water out the exit port</li>
            <li> tried multipurpose machines, but this does a better job.</li>
            <li> The girlfriend is pleased.</li>
            <li> Gets every angle perfectly and is entirely pain free!</li>
            <li> Does a much more thorough job than scissors.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> And most of the time the trimmers you see, no matter where, are JUNK.</li>
            <li> I would chose it over others based on its better design qualities.</li>
            <li> This one is 100% better.</li>
            <li> Does a much better job.</li>
            <li> I always look at the reports from Consumer Report and they rate this trimmer in the top five for its price.</li>
            <li> We don&#x27;t know that for sure</li>
            <li> husband uses this the most</li>
            <li> The Panisonic Vortex is only slightly better than the no-brand one we were using so we&#x27;ll continue the great search!</li>
            <li> It also gets excellent life out of 1 AA battery (which is also simple to change).</li>
            <li> My husband was pleased and so am I, his wife.  </li>
            <li> More durable.</li>
            <li> ,that would be great  thanks</li>
            <li> They have never been better treated.  </li>
            <li> I think people forget how many others look closely at your face/nose/ears...</li>
            <li> My favorite part?</li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> Tried several of these for the ole nose but this works the best.</li>
            <li> My favorite feature is its ease of cleaning, all you have to do is twist a knob and run water through it while its turned on and whammy</li>
            <li> :)</li>
            <li> and he loves it.  :-)</li>
            <li> more hair sticking out where you don&#x27;t want</li>
            <li> they seldom reqier more then it works as its saposed to.</li>
            <li> I finally feel like I have found the best nose hair trimmer ever.</li>
            <li> You turn the top and put it under the faucet.</li>
            <li> What more could you want?</li>
            <li> but sure misses most for me</li>
            <li> Love this item.</li>
            <li> Although it is for light-duty, the trimmer is perfect for my personal grooming needs.</li>
            <li> To test it I ran it straight through the corner of my eyebrow (lol).</li>
            <li> How is that okay?</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give a satisfying cut feel and noise when you run it through your nose.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t cut that much more hair.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more to it.</li>
            <li> Cant ask more from a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> (I suspect that many of the 1-star reviewers ranting about how their trimmer \\&quot;just stopped working\\&quot; might not be cleaning it after every use, as suggested by the manual, or not cleaning it thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I got the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear because the reviews said it was best for those gross ear and nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Makes a satisfying series of zaps as you move into a hairy area</li>
            <li> Do they need to be emptied after many uses or</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li> This one seems much more sturdy.</li>
            <li> Tried more nose trimmers than I care to admit.</li>
            <li> I am greatly pleased.</li>
            <li> my boyfriends nostrils are Hair Free!</li>
            <li> With that being said, the Panasonic ER-GN30-k is the latest addition to my must have kit.</li>
            <li> Fully satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is light weight...which in a way is good for travel but feels too light in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a perfect option when you are trying to help you out with the facial hair and even with the nose one</li>
            <li> This had the best review on the Japanese website kakaku.com.  </li>
            <li> Nothing more to say - it is a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> and I are pleased.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works fairly well, always have a fresh battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, I feel the &#x27;reciprocating&#x27; trimmers do a better job with fewer missed hairs &amp;</li>
            <li> Who can ask for more .</li>
            <li> Just take apart the top and run it under the tap.</li>
            <li> it needs more power</li>
            <li> Would appreciate more power/motor speed, but it works as advertized.  </li>
            <li> Not yet sure about battery life...appears sufficient for 1x week use.</li>
            <li> Sure you can buy a cheaper one, but why not get one that is going to stick with you for a while.</li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying a Philips model now to see if it&#x27;s more</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband, who says it works way better than the one he had before.</li>
            <li> Light, not noisy, effective.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Fresh battery made it work even better</li>
            <li> I am blessed with hair and nothing is more unattractive than having rappel lines hanging from your nostril.</li>
            <li> Cut every piece of hair :)</li>
            <li> My husband who is a lot more mechanical savvy than I am couldn&#x27;t figure it out either.  </li>
            <li> I should be using it more often.</li>
            <li> Works more efficiently than cheaper models.</li>
            <li> The product is good and useful.</li>
            <li> It takes a AA battery, and although others mention that using a rechargeable battery will produce undesirable results, I had no problems at all using an Eneloop, although I&#x27;ll often rotate many of my rechargeable batteries, so maybe that&#x27;s the trick.</li>
            <li> It&#x60;s safe to use (I admit...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut from the top, but rather the sides of the blade.</li>
            <li> and this works better than all of them put together.  </li>
            <li> It is safe.</li>
            <li> thanks for good and nice product</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> I had another trimmer that was ok, but had just didn&#x27;t seem to have the power this one has.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the way this works.</li>
            <li> What more could you want from a product</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Works well but to be honest seems kinda cheap</li>
            <li> Best personal trimmer I found.</li>
            <li> I was encouraged by the good reviews that this trimmer received and bought it, and I have been generally happy with it although it takes much more time to trim than a similar Remington model that I used to have.</li>
            <li> : I think there are some trimmers that trim more effectively and comfortably</li>
            <li> They love these trimmers.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I would buy it again for sure.  </li>
            <li> Top quality .</li>
            <li> That is for sure.</li>
            <li> Buy this thing and you will love it.</li>
            <li> this is made in china,it&#x27;s ok for me to using every day,thx</li>
            <li> Made like a disposable, the battery&#x27;s of better quality....</li>
            <li> I like it more than I would have</li>
            <li> Even more breath.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, I can not deny it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> but i wish the strength of the trimmer was better</li>
            <li> This works ok.</li>
            <li> works well and the initial battery life has been excellent.</li>
            <li> Moving on to something better...</li>
            <li> As smooth as my wifes legs when she remembers to shave!</li>
            <li> Ok on any superficial hair you can pick up with the tip of this item.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just barely ok.</li>
            <li> Love</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s ok.  </li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t work any more</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> Also for 10 dollars I would not expect anything more.</li>
            <li> One of the products where I pay for what I need and nothing more.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> What more can I say.  </li>
            <li> I love the curvy design.</li>
            <li> I love it-does the job removal of all the hair on your body</li>
            <li> take more than time than I anticipated to get all those pesky hairs (2 minutes), and I cannot speak to the battery longevity  - yet.  </li>
            <li> It also did an ok job on mustache, eyebrows (</li>
            <li> But you would think it would be a bit more rugged.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any more nose hairs.</li>
            <li> It was okay.  </li>
            <li> Works ok, its as advertised.</li>
            <li> changed the batteries, making sure the pieces were on correctly, and nothing.</li>
            <li> and this product makes my life so much better.</li>
            <li> Love it</li>
            <li> Then, I saw many review about it</li>
            <li> it was okay.  </li>
            <li> The blades cut better with no pulling</li>
            <li> It worked okay.  </li>
            <li> Unit feels to be of better quality than most competitors I have handled.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work any more.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the way the trimmer operates...</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, whether it would hurt or if I would be sneezing all day.</li>
            <li> This helps avoid any skin tucks, making it completely safe to use.</li>
            <li> okay.</li>
            <li> and I am glad I did.</li>
            <li> I thought the Norelco would be better, so I made the mistake of tossing the Panasonic unit.  </li>
            <li> So many things are powered by rechargeable lithium batteries now.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> construction , unlike many which are not&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer works better than others that I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s inexpensive too.  </li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li> He also says he can breathe better once I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> Be sure to read the manual before using it.</li>
            <li> And its cheap!</li>
            <li> Solid construction and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Much better than the one I bought from Marshalls.</li>
            <li> For years I have used a manual twist type nose hair clipper that worked well albeit pulled the hair from time which is not an enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> The battery life seems to be good and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Guys, the world is better with one of these things.</li>
            <li> I believe that it is better to make it rechargeable with any battery of more quality.</li>
            <li> It takes 1AA battery and lasts through many uses.</li>
            <li> so I love it too.</li>
            <li> This thing works better than most.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.  </li>
            <li> Make sure you turn the knob to the appropriate setting when using in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Written up as sounding a lot more functional than it is.  </li>
            <li> improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the purchase and would not hesitate to recommend.</li>
            <li> Had I used it more, it would have died within the 30 day return period.</li>
            <li> works great and very inexpensive</li>
            <li> and i just imagined that it would do alot better.</li>
            <li> I wish there was a better alternative.</li>
            <li> Only used it one time but it works perfectly</li>
            <li> I love this thing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li> Is more like a fatter parker pen.</li>
            <li> Another top performer from Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> but I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I got this thing-</li>
            <li> There has to be something better.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it does great job and is gentle.</li>
            <li> the top for drying.  </li>
            <li> I love the way this product trims my nose hair without any irritation.</li>
            <li> This one trims so much better.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> No nose hairs are safe from this trimmer</li>
            <li> did I know that this was going to be his favorite gift.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer for nose/ear that I have tried, and I have tried four different ones.</li>
            <li> I love the water setting.</li>
            <li> It really does work great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying using this.</li>
            <li> I just love this Panasonic trimmer.</li>
            <li> Ok nose clipper.</li>
            <li> the trimmer barrel is so fat you wouldn&#x27;t be able to see anything anyway.</li>
            <li> This trimmed has worked well for me for many months.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Will buy something else more reliable.  </li>
            <li> All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I love this Panasonic item.</li>
            <li> It would be even better if the battery is included.</li>
            <li> I love the way it trims, but after a couple of uses, it started falling apart, showing all the symptoms customers mention in the 1-star rating section.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s worth the money and a good buy.  </li>
            <li> love it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this.  </li>
            <li> Much better to use, with better results than the Wahl model I had before.</li>
            <li> just love it.</li>
            <li> The whole product is great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> okay,</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use it - he uses it a lot more though.  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve torn-up the inside of my nostrils way more times than I care to recall.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s well built, easy to clean, and is a good value.  </li>
            <li> I see I have to write 15 more words.  </li>
            <li> after reading reviews and seeing this as a top seller for an affordable price, I went for it.</li>
            <li> Those looking for what this does better get it while they can.i</li>
            <li> Works for more than nose hair</li>
            <li> For the price I feel I couldn&#x27;t have done any better.  </li>
            <li> Thank God, this was reasonably priced and works great.</li>
            <li> There are better products out there.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;round tip could be tapered to be more affective</li>
            <li> love the results.</li>
            <li> So glad I got this.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Wahl I had before.</li>
            <li> I figured it is better to trash the item rather than dealing with this and buy another trimmer (not panasonic ).</li>
            <li> just OK.  </li>
            <li> Was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Go for better quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many, it seems, Nose Hair Trimmers, over the years</li>
            <li> Works OK.  </li>
            <li> Better than the others I tried.</li>
            <li> Well satisfied.</li>
            <li> Does an okay job on ear and nasal hair.</li>
            <li> Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> Ok item.</li>
            <li> Its ok for nose hair but not for your face save your money and get something eles</li>
            <li> /&gt;Would purchase again, what better compliment is there than that?</li>
            <li> Cuts much better than most nose hair trimmers you find along discount stores and</li>
            <li> drug stores(which cost more).</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> I have used it several times and it works great!</li>
            <li> Have used several models of hair removal tools and this ranks up there with the best..</li>
            <li> Cheap and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for some six months or more.  </li>
            <li> I also love the option to use in the shower.  </li>
            <li> I do rinse it under water to make sure nothing gets clogged.  </li>
            <li> This one works a lot better.</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to buy something else with better reliability.</li>
            <li> Does a great job...  Light weight, easy to clean, I would recommend this product.  </li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> so I thought it was defective but after using it this is just a better build.</li>
            <li> cause it was once the top seller.</li>
            <li> When I read reviews of this product before purchasing, there was one written by a witty lady.  </li>
            <li> he love&#x27;s it...</li>
            <li> feel more confident and make everything look right!&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;i love</li>
            <li> it love it</li>
            <li> This trimmer is just ok.</li>
            <li> Would get more stars but it eats batteries.  </li>
            <li> Love the close shave that it brings to my nose and ear hairs because of the dual blade system https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tmT8qlWThQo</li>
            <li> He says that he likes it OK but still&lt;</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t do that at all, it cuts the hair nice and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think this trimmer would work so well or be comfortable.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works :)</li>
            <li> Really does a great job and cuts the nose hairs without any pulling.</li>
            <li> Love that you can run it under the water.</li>
            <li> This one does an OK job and doesn&#x27;t pinch or grab.</li>
            <li> How about a 1/4 HP motor? :)</li>
            <li> You sneeze more often</li>
            <li> Like many guys who have been lots of years breathing in and out--I&#x27;m &amp;#34;older&amp;#34;--hair is going away where I want it to stay and growing in places that I don&#x27;t want it to be.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> After finding my last nose hair trimmer destroyed when somebody knocked it out of the cabinet I came on Amazon and found one that is just perfect for getting them hairs that bug me.</li>
            <li> As I age my hair seems to grow in my nose more than my head.</li>
            <li> It did work okay, once.  </li>
            <li> I have experienced no hair pull; maybe those who have are moving tool too fast.  </li>
            <li> My favorite.</li>
            <li> I use it just for my nose and that what it seems most designed for.</li>
            <li> made my research and decided to give this one a try, since it had so many</li>
            <li> This product works ok.  </li>
            <li> I thought that it would work better though.  </li>
            <li> We love this.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s way better than anything else we&#x27;ve used on his nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer and all of its features.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You deserve better and this will help you look better.</li>
            <li> Basically, glad I got it.  </li>
            <li> See, Panasonic says to replace the head on their nose-and-ear trimmers (i.e., the top part which houses the blade and can screw off) every 3 years.  </li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> this trimmer MISSES more than it trims.</li>
            <li> I have tried many many nose trimmers over the years but nothing comes close to this one.</li>
            <li> but ok to use nose hair remover..</li>
            <li> A scissors is still doing a better jobs.</li>
            <li> This unit is head and shoulders better than the cheep ones that come in kits.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic works much better and the cost was affordable.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is OK - and not anything more.  </li>
            <li> It trims more closely than the ones I purchased years ago and is painless.</li>
            <li> This is an elegant way to trim nasal and ear hair.  </li>
            <li> Most have pulled the hair, causing pain.  </li>
            <li> so I had to jiggle it many times to get it to work.</li>
            <li> Most nose trimmers are crap(walmart/costco)</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and everything was working great till a month ago, it decided not to switch on.</li>
            <li> When will someone make one that works like it should.&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly pay twice what I did for this for one that works better.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> slightly better that a manual powered one.</li>
            <li> The price for the quality makes this a worthwhile buy.</li>
            <li> The wirecutter rated this their top pick for a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Light and nice shape</li>
            <li> The clipper guards make it safe</li>
            <li> This one of the better nose/ear hair trimmers that I have used.  </li>
            <li> I ignored those reviews because it was a top selling item and had tons of 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> I ordered one for my dad : )</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m glad I have them</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer on a whim, and I love it.</li>
            <li> Ranked as the top...</li>
            <li> it is okay...</li>
            <li> Mostly, I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cut my nose.  </li>
            <li> Of course, more discrete users wouldn&#x27;t have it on their bathroom counters at all.  </li>
            <li> An outstanding product.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it since more than two months now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much more convenient to use it instead of scissors or having to wait for waxing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great way for women on the go to stay well groomed without spending too much time.</li>
            <li> Also love that it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
            <li> It works ok, with no pain.  </li>
            <li> - I love it</li>
            <li> This one works about 35% more efficiently and am happier with this one.</li>
            <li> sure .</li>
            <li> I seem to have more hair in my ears and nose than on my head anymore.  </li>
            <li> I love this thing.  </li>
            <li> It does the job needed and more.  </li>
            <li> It has not broken, this works great.</li>
            <li> All I know is that he&#x27;s now hairless in places he should be. :-)  </li>
            <li> Everything was ok.</li>
            <li> They work better than anything I have found.</li>
            <li> Works as expected, does a great job and cleans out great.</li>
            <li> Love it A++++++++++</li>
            <li> thanks deliver time was great too.</li>
            <li> This is the best one of these I&#x27;ve ever used and only $13!  </li>
            <li> Really top quality, and runs on 2 AA batteries, which you can take out for traveling.</li>
            <li> I now am glad I took the chance.</li>
            <li> I use it for mostly for nose.</li>
            <li> and we are quite pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> It is better than some I have tried</li>
            <li> Great nose trimmer for a very affordable price.</li>
            <li> but it could use more power.  </li>
            <li> This unit is quiet, sleek, well designed and superbly performing.</li>
            <li> ALL THE HAIR ON MY NOSE IS GONE :))))))))))</li>
            <li> It is much better than the one I had before.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Ended up returning it for a better one.</li>
            <li> Worked OK for about a month.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and functional, what more can I say.</li>
            <li> Had another Braun nose mower that worked better.  </li>
            <li> This was in working order and more than satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Works ok.</li>
            <li> This works well, better than the mangroomer one I had before.</li>
            <li> How about you seller&#x27;s out there make sure the damn product works BEFORE you ship it?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many of these damn things.</li>
            <li> love it.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>

            <li> Much better than the cheapo ones at the box stores.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer at a cheap price.</li>
            <li> okay.  </li>
            <li> Although you have to go over some areas more than once, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Looks OK to me</li>
            <li> i bout the Panasonic one more time.</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Ok for the eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> , glad that I got it.</li>
            <li> This one feels better in the hand and works better.  </li>
            <li> What more can I say :)</li>
            <li> Much better them before Panasonic models,&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> Glad we purchased the Panasonic ER-GN30-K hair remover.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Much better then</li>
            <li> he biggest feature is the fact that it is waterproof, and able to be fully submerged in water.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than scissors.  </li>
            <li> I bought this after reading many glowing reviews online.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s WAY better than plucking nose hairs with your girlfriend&#x27;s tweezers.</li>
            <li> It is outstanding...</li>
            <li> and I was always satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews it seemed like this one was better then the one by wahl..</li>
            <li> Thanks to a great seller.</li>
            <li> Works better than most of these trimmers</li>
            <li> It worked, but this Panasonic rotary trimmer works better and is easier and quicker to use.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Battery life seems good and it is easy to clean since it has a waterproof mode</li>
            <li> Others I&#x27;ve tried leave you with a hanger or two that just stick out more because now they&#x27;re being showcased.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great item.</li>
            <li> Thank you &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> and I am pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> I cannot be more satisfied with this.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li> My dogs like it more than tweezers</li>
            <li> Just ordered a Wahl to see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad they improved on the product</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase one.</li>
            <li> Checked through many batteries and it wouldn&#x27;t work, so it wasn&#x27;t the power</li>
            <li> UI would say it&#x27;s OK but probably not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Husband and I both love it.</li>
            <li> Learn how to make the trimmer better in all areas.</li>
            <li> Now I have a better sense of smell?</li>
            <li> Like anything else that cuts things, make sure to not get too over-zealous with it.</li>
            <li> They both worked flawlessly and I wouldn&#x27;t even bother looking for anything different.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s just okay  </li>
            <li> This one is angled and allows a better grip to removing the ear hair.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product, and I am using on a daily basis and there is no any problem in it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this trimmer.</li>
            <li> That would have been a better business practice.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m thrilled with this trimmer, but it works, and it was cheap.  </li>
            <li> My husband love this nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Meh, its okay.</li>
            <li> So, yeah, its okay, it does the job.</li>
            <li> You know, there are just so many bthings</li>
            <li> we have tried many brands and this one tops them all</li>
            <li> This is ok and works</li>
            <li> I have used many nose-hair trimmers over the years, however find that their quality all rapidly deteriorate after weekly usage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the Panasonic brand to be the best trimmers so far...and this one has a much more solid design!</li>
            <li> It also tickles ALOT more than the others I&#x27;ve used - I end up with watery eyes and my nose feels tingly for about 10 minutes after.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend just love it.</li>
            <li> I also gave one to a friend who thinks it is fantastic!</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s performance</li>
            <li> Love this product.  </li>
            <li> So much better than those crappy trimmers you find at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> what more can i say...</li>
            <li> It works okay on eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> What more can I say.</li>
            <li> This really works great.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but could maybe have been more efficient.</li>
            <li> Why want to spend more money.  </li>
            <li> It does a through job of trimming  most of the hairs in the nostrils with a touch up here and there.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Excellent Facial Shaver</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Feels perfectly safe, won&#x27;t even pop a balloon if placed against it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to say how much I love this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for nose hair, but it does that job perfectly.  </li>
            <li> Works OK if you like some of the hair in your nose pulled out instead of cut.</li>
            <li> But the con is tip could be narrower for better nose access</li>
            <li> Does an ok job.</li>
            <li> Just wish that it had more flexibility  in trimming even hairs on the face.  </li>
            <li> I used it for ear nose mustache sideburn hair, no pull no pain as advertised, the waterproof cleaning makes it a better buy even.</li>
            <li> have had many others but none that works as well as this one.</li>
            <li> And the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof just makes it even better.</li>
            <li> After replacing 3 of them I realized the motor of the trimmer is not getting power any more.</li>
            <li> but it does an ok job.</li>
            <li> For this price what more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> Panasonic has always been one of my favorite brands and, as always, went beyond meeting my expectations with this product.</li>
            <li> When he sent out his list, I declared dibs on the nose hair trimmers and boy am I glad I did!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Make sure to read the instructoins before trying it out.</li>
            <li> Love the turbo cleaning function.  </li>
            <li> one of the better nose trimmers i&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li> , so good and satisfying, totally worth the $12.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> Bought one for my brother and one for my nephew both love it and thank me for finding it - had difficulty finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the way it took my hairs out.  </li>
            <li> Will be purchasing more for my family.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> thus came with the cruzer and my son and daughter-in-law are so glad it did he was using it as soon as he opened it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great deal, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do very well.</li>
            <li> It works, and if it lasts for years, even better.</li>
            <li> Given it&#x27;s low price, this handy trimmer is really a great valuable tool to keep around handy .</li>
            <li> One of the better ones I have used.  </li>
            <li> Soon as I age I am sure I will need it for my ears though.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> A feature that I enjoyed was that with water it removes all of the hairs inside machine.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and worth the money.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love?</li>
            <li> It was a much more efficient trimmer than my Sharper Image model that I used, but that lasted for 8 years.</li>
            <li> BEST ON THE MARKET AND LOW PRICE.</li>
            <li> but it sure goes through a lot of batteries.</li>
            <li> Much better than the sharper image nose trimmer I had that cost a bundle.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does an excellent job on any facial hair.</li>
            <li> Since receiving this product I have been able to eliminate hair from every aural cavity.</li>
            <li> As men age, they lose their hair on top and gain it in their ears and nose.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love how it cuts all my nose hair and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the item not being water resistant</li>
            <li> Fantastic!</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> but I mostly got it for the nose</li>
            <li> I wish more experience with these products</li>
            <li> so I could have bought a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> Which costs MORE than the trimmer itself.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Be prepared to buy another in 6 months. :-)</li>
            <li> and I get more functionality out of the multi groomer.</li>
            <li> Glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> I am a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> love this thing.</li>
            <li> about once a week or once every 2 weeks, i take it straight to my nostrils, and it does a great job clearing my nasal pathways</li>
            <li> Another gift I researched and compared it to the Wahl, but I think my husband is totally satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> but at 43, I seem to have more hair growing out of my nose and ears than my head.</li>
            <li> and it was ok.  </li>
            <li> I cant imagine there being a better one except maybe a rechargable version.</li>
            <li> What more can you say?</li>
            <li> Considering the price this is a winner for sure.</li>
            <li> This one being the most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It seems Panasonic gets better at these trimmers every year.  </li>
            <li> Had several in my lifetime and this one is the best ever.</li>
            <li> it is a lovely product.</li>
            <li> A great value and worked really well, for two months.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is okay for it&#x27;s price.</li>
            <li> The price was outstanding and it arrived promptly.  </li>
            <li> Many others have stated the grinding noise this will eventually make.  </li>
            <li> This is my second one, and this is the best.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Safe, never been cut, Works</li>
            <li> The pictures and video make it seem more than it is.</li>
            <li> This is magic and should get 10 stars at twice the price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I pulled the trigger on this one.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a breeze, just remove the top cap and run it under some water while turned on.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> OK.  </li>
            <li> what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> What more can I ask for.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of these trimmers and wanted something better.  </li>
            <li> Would buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> good result of nose hair shaving, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> But besides that, this is a fantastic buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I also find trimming the hairs helps me breath better.  </li>
            <li> Better handle and lighter.</li>
            <li> you can rinse it out with water (ok) or just pop the head off and tap it on a counter (better).</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Way better than many out there...</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> It is better to blow your nose before you use it.</li>
            <li> new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When looking for something better I saw this and thought, &amp;#34;could</li>
            <li> It does a great job and really doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the off-brands.</li>
            <li> It did magic to my nose.</li>
            <li> I thought it was ok, until I got this, never buy a man a tool that uses a AAA battery.</li>
            <li> It works better then</li>
            <li> but it still feels like it needs more power to do a better job.</li>
            <li> II brought it for my beard, and I love it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tons better than the super-duper fancy one I had that sounded like a 747 taking</li>
            <li> This trimmer works longer than others I&#x27;ve tried, and does a much better job.</li>
            <li> I opened the top to see if there was some hair/buildup inside.  </li>
            <li> Love this grooming tool</li>
            <li> I would attribute my difficulty to getting all the hairs to the size of my nostrils compared to most.  </li>
            <li> I would attribute my difficulty to getting all the hairs to the size of my nostrils compared to most.  </li>
            <li> prefer my Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer to the Panasonic now given that I think it&#x27;s more durable and just works.  </li>
            <li> Plus the Groom Mate is tiny and perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> I just got this a couple of days ago, and have tried/used it twice, and I must say I am satisfied.  </li>
            <li> ok</li>
            <li> I have added twenty seconds to my morning routine a couple of times a week and am pleased I did.</li>
            <li> Makes me feel better to know</li>
            <li> Had this baby for almost 2 years, I love it.</li>
            <li> I would like to have a more efficient one.</li>
            <li> Not bad !!!</li>
            <li> This one has the power and better quality feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone in need of a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Glad I choose it.</li>
            <li> As you age, you use your brain more which causes the hair on your head to be pushed out of your ears and nose.  </li>
            <li> This one is way better than the Braun unit I threw out.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Remington model.  </li>
            <li> It works okay.</li>
            <li> I found a better one at Target, but my husband wanted this one..</li>
            <li> This trimmer is about a thousand times better than the one I was using.</li>
            <li> Yup, cuts my nose hair with not too many passes.</li>
            <li> sure you have a AA battery</li>
            <li> It works ok, but it does tend to rip out hair rather than cut it, which hurts.  </li>
            <li> Its just ok.</li>
            <li> It is OK.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, lightweight, good quality</li>
            <li> I have tried many nose hair trimmers before, and pushed this one off since it was so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I cleaned it, which means I took the top off.</li>
            <li> I have been through several of these types of tremors, and I have to say unequivocally that these are the best tremors I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> You will be ok..</li>
            <li> HE IS SATISFIED IT.</li>
            <li> In some youtube videos, you can see people poking around trying to get a better trim, but you can cut yourself.</li>
            <li> It is ok as a nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> I replaced it&#x27;s predecessor which lasted for many years.  </li>
            <li> This one I haven&#x27;t had for more than a week,</li>
            <li> Much better results with this trimmer than any others I&#x27;ve bought.  </li>
            <li> its do the job love it</li>
            <li> I spend more time cleaning the device than I using it.</li>
            <li> It works ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to spend a bit more and buy something more substantial.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my family, love it,gets nose hair, ear hair and even eybrow hair.</li>
            <li> Compared to the zero turn mower this is the next best invention on earth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much better than any</li>
            <li> I mostly use it for its nose hair feature.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous nose trimmers over the years and this was is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> I cleaned it, and repeatedly checked to make sure it wasn&#x27;t on the rinse setting while</li>
            <li> well, Norelco is a much better choice.</li>
            <li> but it does job well, nice and light and cleaning</li>
            <li> It still takes a lot of work to get the errant hairs trimmed, but this design is better than many of the systems out there.</li>
            <li> Yeah sure, nose hair.  </li>
            <li> I brought this to replace one that I have been using for many many years.</li>
            <li> Totally pleased with this product.  </li>
            <li> This one is better because it can be cleaned.  </li>
            <li> 100% satisfied.</li>
            <li> Works OK but the power is wimpy.</li>
            <li> I seem to be growing hair on my ears better than my head anymore</li>
            <li> Once it gets going, it seems to operate okay, but it involves a lot of jiggling and twisting to get it to turned on.  </li>
            <li> As this trimmer has a safe shielded rotary blade, I figured he wouldn&#x27;t be able to accidentally hurt himself.  </li>
            <li> He likes the circle style better than the straight comb style and this one works great.</li>
            <li> I have had product loyalty for many years.</li>
            <li> both use it its great works very well</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal.</li>
            <li> LOVE the ability to wash/clean.</li>
            <li> All in all, somewhat satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li> recommended, perhaps there are better, I haven&#x27;t tried looking.</li>
            <li> and it did a great job; the price was quite reasonable too.</li>
            <li> Way Way better that the Remington nose hair clipper it replaced.  </li>
            <li> I suppose having the hairs be there is better than ingrown ones</li>
            <li> also used this on the mustache God granted me too, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with Nair on that one :)</li>
            <li> My husband really loves this trimmer and the size is great for travel.</li>
            <li> Did its job, Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine how a competitor could offer a better solution.  </li>
            <li> I bought many differnet type adn</li>
            <li> The best Nose and Ear Facial Hair Trimmer ever!</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life : )</li>
            <li> This works and use this to trim hair in my ear and no where else.  :-)</li>
            <li> was bothering me :)</li>
            <li> The top of the device gets clogged up and stops working.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot better than going at it with a pair of scissors</li>
            <li> What more can you ask at $10?</li>
            <li> OK looks like it is burnt out and not working.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I intend to supplement this review when I have more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s ears never looked better and trims his nose like a champ.  </li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this.  </li>
            <li> Just got the trimmer last night, Works GREAT!!</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I like this a lot more than some others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s awesome at the low price point.</li>
            <li> Love this thing.</li>
            <li> Outstanding.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but got to work at it to get all the hairs .</li>
            <li> also i am satisfied with this</li>
            <li> This trimmer works better than any I have owned to date.  </li>
            <li> No hair, no cuts, just smooth!  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> , it functions perfectly and only once have I managed to \\&quot;cut too close\\</li>
            <li> Glad I did</li>
            <li> Better than drug store brands.  </li>
            <li> Favorite nose hair trimmer yet.</li>
            <li> Oh my, it is so much better.  </li>
            <li> ..now i will look eve more sexier if that was possible..lol</li>
            <li> But, unlike the others, this one seems so well made, I am hopeful it will give better service.  </li>
            <li> Doing too many of these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Removes the hair from inside your nose and growing out of your ears.  </li>
            <li> I had an earlier generation of Panasonic before, and it was excellent.</li>
            <li> Was pleased that this replacement was even better.</li>
            <li> It is also the most pain-free, and no burn, either.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t cost me more than I think maybe $10 or $15</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several trimmers and this is the best one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s miles better than the Conair one I&#x27;ve had for years.</li>
            <li> and I can remember looking at my grandfather, more specifically, looking at the hair growing out of his ear and in your youth</li>
            <li> He says he likes it MUCH better than the one he had before.</li>
            <li> and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Nothing chops &#x27;em up better.</li>
            <li> Me paying more than everyone elses&#x27; purchase price to repair a product that never worked?  </li>
            <li> Totally love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I recommend this Panasonic unit over most models.</li>
            <li> My dad love this</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how much better this Panasonic works.</li>
            <li> Love this gadget.</li>
            <li> I love using this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy a better one soon....</li>
            <li> GN30 the most.</li>
            <li> Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> The trimmer seems ok.  </li>
            <li> Not as noisy as most.</li>
            <li> (perhaps more is coming?)</li>
            <li> But, for what it is, I cannot imagine a better product.</li>
            <li> I like that its ok to rinse off and runs on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Wish it cut better.</li>
            <li> Very dependable and does a great &#x27;cleanup&#x27; job.</li>
            <li> This works OK.  </li>
            <li> It fits very well in your hand and it weighs almost nothing which is great if you want to bring it on vacation.</li>
            <li> While this is something that most men think is \\&quot;unmanly\\&quot; to do, just do it and you will feel better.  </li>
            <li> So glad that I did.</li>
            <li> I will really be enjoying the use of this product.</li>
            <li> It also feels like I breathe better through my nose.</li>
            <li> the price it is a great quality of product and performs very well</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Totally satisfied.</li>
            <li> Probably the most \\&quot;useful\\&quot; product I&#x27;ve purchased in a&lt;br /&gt;long time.</li>
            <li> and it works more than 10x.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t been able to use it.</li>
            <li> Hands done one of the best facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfectly safe and harmless.</li>
            <li> This cutter really gets close and works great.</li>
            <li> It is better than the &amp;#34;Philips Norelco NT9130/40 NoseTrimmer 5100&amp;#34; if you plan to use it in your nose.  </li>
            <li> but I think it is one of the better trimmers sold.</li>
            <li> Many others were god for a month</li>
            <li> this model is much better.  </li>
            <li> Great price thanks.  </li>
            <li> Ok</li>
            <li> /&gt;Buy something better.  </li>
            <li> It works great and he absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> This is the best personal groomer I have had owned.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but it is not the most durable pice of machinery.</li>
            <li> Those all seemed to work better and get the hairs cut closer.</li>
            <li> It seems the panasonic misses more hairs, I have to go over the area longer and doesnt get them cut as close meaning</li>
            <li> I have to use it more often.</li>
            <li> Better than the garbage found at the pharmacy stores.</li>
            <li> Recommended :)</li>
            <li> Worked okay until it fell apart.</li>
            <li> and it did a much better in getting the job done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Straight out of the box all I had to do was put in a battery and it began working - way better than my Remington model which I got from walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is better than getting my nose waxed.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Glad I chose this one over others I was looking at.</li>
            <li> because I am not going to say &amp;#34;I Love it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> this is an okay trimmer.</li>
            <li> I like this model more then the ones with the exposed blades.</li>
            <li> Even my eye brows look better.</li>
            <li> It worked well but should be able to sustain a 12 inch drop.</li>
            <li> Just one more &#x27;benefit&#x27; of the aging process - hair in places</li>
            <li> Pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a while, glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> but we have found a much better product since</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t go 5 stars, but 4+ for sure.  </li>
            <li> Buy a better powered version.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> not any better than any others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of these type trimmers and this has been the best one.  </li>
            <li> I have more than a years use on this one...</li>
            <li> I have to change the battery after a couple light uses (eyebrows, nose)  ... works great otherwise and easy to clean</li>
            <li> If you want better performance, make sure the batteries are replaced when needed and after cleaning the blades, pour a drop of mineral oil, it will run like a Porsche.</li>
            <li> The construction quality is excellent and I expect it to last many years.  </li>
            <li> My experience has been that most tend to pull hairs as they cut.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this since it&#x27;s really inexpensive, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> A nose trimmer won&#x27;t do that, but this one more than meets my expectations.</li>
            <li> And best part she said - it&#x27;s very quiet when running.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer and it&#x27;s made my nose feel so much better.</li>
            <li> but I feel like I can breathe better.</li>
            <li> This thing does the trick that is for sure.</li>
            <li> but I am sure it would do those just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job very well and at a great price.  </li>
            <li> what more can I say.  </li>
            <li> love it.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> Seems like an okay product for the price.</li>
            <li> but once you remove the top and try to replace the blade, it becomes noisy and doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> Best ever and very quiet.</li>
            <li> and I was pleased.</li>
            <li> so I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Much much better than my manual one from ZWILLING.</li>
            <li> Better than many</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> more to be said except:&lt;br /&gt;if</li>
            <li> I love This Trimmer, It Does the Job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a nose hair trimmer before and wasn&#x27;t pleased with it, as it seemed like it did more pulling than trimming, so it mostly stayed in the drawer</li>
            <li> OK</li>
            <li> I am quite satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> My husband was pleased.</li>
            <li> Appears it is better</li>
            <li> Best personal hair trimmer I ever owned.  </li>
            <li> LOVE it.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> It works better than others in this price range.</li>
            <li> Love, ordered it for my son to use in nose and in between eyes.  </li>
            <li> seemed OK.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many people reviewed this thing favorably.</li>
            <li> I thought this one would be even better with the Panasonic name and all the glowing reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this device.</li>
            <li> Husband is satisfied and so am</li>
            <li> It works okay, but did pull some hairs</li>
            <li> It just takes more time to do the job.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much more to say about it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t even realize the last one wasn&#x27;t very good until I got this one!!</li>
            <li> For the price I paid, I feel really satisfied.</li>
            <li> It helps me look better and feel better about myself.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Much better than a Wahl version that we had bought at a store.</li>
            <li> Received the item neatly pack, been using it for more than a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> Thing thing is way better than the cheapo one that it replaced.</li>
            <li> All mens need this product and you won&#x27;t regret for sure.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> More rubbish for the trash heap.</li>
            <li> If it ever quits, I&#x27;ll be sure to let you know.</li>
            <li> Whats on the top is that its an amazon item.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, it heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t do a great job.</li>
            <li> This makes a great gift for any man really....</li>
            <li> Once I learned to use it I am pleased.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it will work well.</li>
            <li> I mostly use it for nose hair trimming once a week.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> These are MUCH better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s inexpensive, but they seem to cut cleaner and have more speed.</li>
            <li> Works better than the staright brush style trimmers.</li>
            <li> /&gt;No &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; to the hair any more ...</li>
            <li> Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Smooth operation!</li>
            <li> AS we age hair begins to grow more in the ears and nostrils.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer beacuse</li>
            <li> As the top reviewer here mentioned, quite delectably, aging men needs it to keep the unwanted hair in-check.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better nose hair trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> love the AA batteries instead of a charger.</li>
            <li> I have been using trimmers for many years.  </li>
            <li> There are many like it, but this one is mine.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t able to return it.</li>
            <li> We have gone through so many hair trimmers, but this one seems to be durable.  </li>
            <li> It just works. :)</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s extremely pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I never check luggage, but that may be changing :-)</li>
            <li> My Grand daughter tells me that I no longer have hair growing out of my nose, of course she says none on the top of my head either.</li>
            <li> I have owned several nose hair trimmers over the years and this one is the best nose hair trimmer ever!</li>
            <li> /&gt;^They sell them here as most of you know.</li>
            <li> It was hit and miss with it, mostly miss.  </li>
            <li> I bought it because I have had a Whal mustache trimmer for many years.</li>
            <li> I love that trimmer.</li>
            <li> This thing works much better and does what it says.  </li>
            <li> If you have a hairy nose then buy it, use it, love it.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this trimmer - Works as it was meant to work.</li>
            <li> does a great job getting my nose hears, i really just shove it up my nose and weed whack it around</li>
            <li> Worked great and is very quite</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an OK unit.</li>
            <li> I thought the slant might make it more efficient, with closer shaves to areas, but it does not.</li>
            <li> still going , better than many reviews</li>
            <li> The comfort with it is the best, a day later</li>
            <li> Very happy with item - works as described - glad I finally got around to purchasing it!</li>
            <li> Its ok.</li>
            <li> have tried many and this one beats them all in all categories!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the cleaning system</li>
            <li> Works OK</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had the trimmer for 3 weeks; I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll put it to many more</li>
            <li> I guess OK ; never had/used one before.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> This works well, better than the mangroomer one I had before</li>
            <li> I love that it runs on a AA battery and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged.</li>
            <li> Replace batteries, made sure the contacts were clean---still no go, so had to replace it.</li>
            <li> and I then put the top on after.</li>
            <li> Also packs better in my travel shaving kit.</li>
            <li> I have tried several trimmers, and this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Good quality build, but doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as I&#x27;d hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This one is safe and it never pulled the hair.</li>
            <li> It works ok.</li>
            <li> And I&#x27;m so glad</li>
            <li> Have had some of these prior to this one, but it is the best.</li>
            <li> its ok.  </li>
            <li> but if they could just take one week and work with engineers to design a better nose hair trimmer the world would be a better place.</li>
            <li> Awesome addition to my line of personal hygiene gadgets and bathroom showcase.</li>
            <li> it is ok..</li>
            <li> am satisfied..</li>
            <li> but it does get most of it out.</li>
            <li> Most hairs get pulled into the top part.</li>
            <li> Hope it doesn&#x27;t cost more than the unit itself.  </li>
            <li> Works, better than in store ones</li>
            <li> I LOVE that it&#x27;s washable</li>
            <li> But, I totally love this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better trimmers.</li>
            <li> He seems to love it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the same for many aging men, but I lived with it, using scissors as best</li>
            <li> Cheap!</li>
            <li> It is an outstanding performer.</li>
            <li> It might be the angled off top that causes it to fall, often.  </li>
            <li> What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> you just turn the dial at the top which opens a port where water can be discharged after flowing into the tip, or flow water into the port</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t grow hair on my head any more</li>
            <li> but I can sure grow it in my nose &amp; ears.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say much more than that.</li>
            <li> So just keep the plastic guard on top of the trimmer and don&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li> He says it is like magic.</li>
            <li> Since purchasing it for him I don&#x27;t have to get trimmers out and help him trim nose and ear hairs - he grooms himself without me reminding him to do so :).</li>
            <li> Found as I turned 50 hair started gorwing faster out of my nose and ears than on the top of my head and</li>
            <li> I really love this product.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> I finally found the one that  works great!!!</li>
            <li> Better than advertised.</li>
            <li> I no longer look like 40 going on 60. :-)</li>
            <li> Its Ok</li>
            <li> The reviews are correct for the most part.</li>
            <li> I wonder whether there are more efficient products out there.</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use it and love it.</li>
            <li> The Vortex is definitely an exception and the best I&#x27;ve seen so far.&lt;br</li>
            <li> great product - trims very close to the skin</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be sure to read the instructions for cleaning.</li>
            <li> I do surely recommend it.</li>
            <li> but I gotta believe that there&#x27;s a more efficient motor out there.  </li>
            <li> this thing gets allot more hair than the Remington.</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this grooming device.</li>
            <li> Works better than replacement.</li>
            <li> It cleans up very easily, and is easy to handle.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I Think it&#x27;s great and will buy one for my grandfather(96 yrs young)!!!</li>
            <li> Neither are perfect but please take my advice and get the vacuum one.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful or effective</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted ,does a great job and easy to handle</li>
            <li> Before buying this item I did some research and found others saying how good this one was and boy were they right.</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews were good and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Not the highest quality trimmer, but the price is right, gets the job done well, and lasts a good amount of time, making it a &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; recommendation.</li>
            <li> had written originally how awesome it was, now it&#x27;s rattling so loud</li>
            <li> i liked the original one better.</li>

            <li> So far, so good!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This device trims the hairs perfectly and its pretty safe unless you really dig the device so close to your skin.</li>
            <li> work well (not painful) and love the water cleaning!</li>
            <li> The head design is superior to others, in that it cuts much more consistently at the tip.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to keep my mustache and beard clean and tidy, as well as to trim nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Much safer and more effective than trying to use scissors!</li>

            <li> I had an inexpensive Panasonic trimmer 15 years ago which was excellent and dropped it in the toilet.  </li>
            <li> Yes, I agree with most of the reviews--it&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer for the money.  </li>

            <li> Really good and very reasonable.</li>
            <li> With good AA batteries, it sounds and feels like it&#x27;s moving very fast and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the top-top ones, but for a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> In my experience, these type of products tend to deteriorate quickly, but I must say, so far I&#x27;m very impressed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy I made, but I suppose it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I recommend using it on a dry nose, since it works best with hairs that are up and not stuck on their side on the nose for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very happy with it, quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This works great as it is both fast and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li> to do - design is nice, light, ergonomic and fits easily in the hand</li>
            <li> and then it WILL pull a hair though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to eat up the battery fast, but i&#x27;m happy its an easily replaceable one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hairs were easily banished, &amp; I used it for a chin &amp; upper lip cleanup - perfect!</li>

            <li> It is very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to use</li>
            <li> I got this for a great price and even at normal I&#x27;d recommend it.  </li>
            <li> I normally like Panasonic products but not as happy with this one.</li>

            <li> When I first looked at it I laughed.  </li>
            <li> My husband loved it so much, we bought another for my father in-law!</li>
            <li> pretty good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer for nose hair, doesn&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like</li>

            <li> but he says it&#x27;s good, and he&#x27;s reallllly picky (no pun intended), so you should believe him ;-)</li>
            <li> Works pretty good.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good, does what it is supposed to do!!&lt;br /&gt;cleans</li>
            <li> It works pretty good.  </li>
            <li> BUT does a pretty darn good job.  </li>
            <li> Works pretty good</li>
            <li> well this is a good trimmer for the first couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> It does its job pretty good.</li>
            <li> I trim the long eyebrow hair and it works perfect.  </li>
            <li> First time trying out a nose trimmer, and surprisingly there wasn&#x27;t any slightest level of discomfort.</li>
            <li> Worked good at first.</li>
            <li> much better than the cheap one I got locally, does a great job!</li>
            <li> It is pretty good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sold on Panasonic products for years and this trimmer is another in a long line of excellent products.  </li>
            <li> Good item for the price does exactly what I wanted it for.</li>
            <li> Pretty good for a $12 item.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know, maybe I just got one of the anti-lemons, but the blades seem to tolerate pretty good use</li>
            <li> While it did work it did the job pretty good.</li>
            <li> Battery life is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> At first when I saw this I laughed.</li>
            <li> I loved this so much when I received this as a gift that I bought this for someone else as a gift!  </li>
            <li> This is a fairly good device that&#x27;s made pretty well.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, but best of all is that they do the job so much better (and faster) than previous trimmers I have owned.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, this trimmer actually truly does work and is the perfect handy trimmer I always wanted to have to be able to trim hair quickly and precisely where I wanted to.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer at a great price.</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried that it was going to just rip my nose hairs out, but this awesome little machine cuts the hair like butter, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Worth it!!</li>
            <li> Still using the original battery too!</li>
            <li> my friends, def worth the money!!</li>
            <li> He is so happy with his new trimmer.  </li>
            <li> new Panasonic is great though.</li>
            <li> I had another trimmer for years and never thought I would find one I liked more, but this one wins out.</li>
            <li> It works great, cuts cleanly and, even more importantly, is super easy to clean after use.</li>
            <li> Great value, easy to use and decent battery life.</li>
            <li> Works great ,much better than my old one i got at the 99 cent store.</li>
            <li> Easy cleaning - just turn the top portion, run some water through, and you&#x27;re done</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that a strong rechargeable battery will work, but an alkaline with 1.5 volts is better.</li>
            <li> Works nicely and it was super affordable.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a safe and easy item to use for nose and ear hair, quite safe and easy.</li>
            <li> While it does the job, I find it to be overly bulky and the ergonomic design doesn&#x27;t make it any more easy to use than a &#x27;stick&#x27; model.  </li>
            <li> Kudos to Amazon for very quick delivery :) Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, would recomend to men and woman, easy to use,fits hand very well, is much better than straight head razor.</li>
            <li> I love the easy wash out with water.</li>
            <li> Good price, great performance, simple to clean.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s more easily openable...</li>
            <li> I am totally pleased with how this trimmer works and have been telling all my friends about it and how easy it works.</li>
            <li> But realizing that the blade is removable and can therefore be easily cleaned, I was pleased with this.  </li>
            <li> Love it, easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li> It works best on dry hair.</li>
            <li> Every time I do it, I am sure some of my nerves are being pulled but with this product, it&#x27;s painless and easy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing but the battery drains out too quickly.</li>
            <li> It is easy on the AA battery it requires and the business end can be rinsed under the faucet or, if you are so inclined, the top can be removed, the hairs can be collected and woven into a cloth for a biblical haircloth shirt,</li>
            <li> It can be used in so many ways, and it is an easy addition to any grooming routine.</li>
            <li> The unit is easily \\&quot;wash/rinse\\&quot; able; set it on the counter for an hour</li>
            <li> This is an effective trimmer that is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I should mention that I think its smallish size makes it ideal for travel, and for the hand size of most women, and smaller guys.</li>
            <li> This cutter is nice and quiet, does a great job.</li>
            <li> best on the market,works better than expected.</li>
            <li> It is light quiet and performs its job flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> Effective, easy to use and clean up is a snap.</li>

            <li> Nice device, easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> it is good - cuts fairly close and doesn&#x27;t pull.&lt;br /&gt;For facial hair</li>
            <li> Nice compact unit that is easy to clean out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these over the years and believe this to be the best available for the price.</li>
            <li> It has a nice ergonomic design and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Does require a good cleaning to run properly, but healthwise that&#x27;s a good idea anyway.</li>

            <li> Mostly for nasal hair .. seems to work fine</li>
            <li> Still haven&#x27;t got the hang of the &#x27;water flushing&#x27; system, but seems to work by just blowing it clean!</li>
            <li> I mostly use it for nose and some fine hairs on the sides of my ears...</li>
            <li> Love it, works fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It uses 1 AA battery which is fine and lasts for many sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I first got this trimmer it worked exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li> I am VERY happy with this purchase, it works better than the other 3 I have had over the years and wore out.</li>
            <li> This thing is perfect, and will take only seconds to clean up the nose, ears, and eye brows.</li>
            <li> Better than most others I have tried, but I haven&#x27;t found one yet that cuts nose hair cleanly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Also, I love being able to clean it by running it under the tap.</li>
            <li> Very pleased on this and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very cool.</li>
            <li> Very good, I can finally breathe out of my nose!</li>
            <li> /&gt;IF you are like most people and feel very queasy about sticking a rotating RAZER UP YOUR NOSE, fear not; for this is actually a very comfortable and effective tool.</li>
            <li> but this does make it easier and overall does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and shape of the trimmer makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean it and very easy to use as well</li>

            <li> This product is a HUGE time saver and works so much better than using scissors.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s great so far.</li>
            <li> It works great so far</li>
            <li> got this item as a gift, works great so far.</li>
            <li> As far as functionality goes, it does a great job.  </li>
            <li> I am happy with this so far.</li>
            <li> Congratulations on a fine product -- you could easily charge more for it.</li>
            <li> Has worked great so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one happy 53 year old,</li>
            <li> The cheap Harbour Freight one does much better.</li>
            <li> So far, it does a great job of trimming excess hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but so far the trimmer works great.  </li>
            <li> Although not a permanent solution, it is a lot cheaper and safer than a visit to the dermatologist for laser therapy and safer and more comfortable than electrolysis or plucking.</li>
            <li> The model I got was this one, and so far, it has been great...</li>
            <li> Does a great job at getting nose hairs near the opening of the nose.  </li>
            <li> Happy to say I&#x27;ve had no trouble with this newer</li>
            <li> At first I was worried about butchering the insides of my nose, but after doing it for over a week, It&#x27;s very safe.</li>
            <li> I look much more civilized.</li>
            <li> Once in a while, you will get a pulled hair but it is light and compact and it is just better than any others I have tried.  </li>
            <li> Does a great job and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive nostrils.  </li>
            <li> So far it works great.  </li>
            <li> It is more powerful and does a pretty good job on nose and OK on ears.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer a couple of times so far since my purchase and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Was better priced than in-store models and I received free shipping.</li>
            <li> I love the zapping sound that it makes.  </li>
            <li> This is great to keep you from looking like an old man whose given up on life.</li>
            <li> This Node Hair Trimmer is working great so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The is a great upgrade over my old one.  </li>
            <li> price cheap, work ok for 1 month ,</li>
            <li> Fortunately, Panasonic has found a much better way to get those hairs with no pain.</li>
            <li> is a lot more comfortable for my nostrils.</li>
            <li> far, it&#x27;s great.  </li>
            <li> Another cheap Panasonic product that should be FREE!</li>
            <li> Just tried this and so far works great.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone so far as to use this trimmer to even out the lines on my beard and it works great.</li>
            <li> but overall this does an excellent job and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So far, this trimmer has worked great.</li>
            <li> Great product so far.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, this is an excellent device</li>
            <li> Keeps my nose looking like a teenagers nose, I am a happy old fart...</li>
            <li> uses for a similarly cheap groomer, and it worked infinitely better.</li>
            <li> It is probably the best 18 bucks I have ever spent.  </li>
            <li> Replacement for an old one, this works great.</li>
            <li> It does not cut too close to the skin which works great for me as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> though it&#x27;s an old one, it still works great.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely because of the 1100+ reviews to replace my old trimmer which I never have been happy with.</li>
            <li> This product has been working great so far.</li>
            <li> So far this is a great product that does what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li> I think the motor will loosen up over time and spin more freely and seem stronger.</li>
            <li> This product is great for soft nose hairs, and I assume ear hairs</li>
            <li> so I find it more comfortable.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean but MOST importantly, it works!</li>
            <li> Does a great job, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I had an old one and this is a great replacement.</li>
            <li> the best way to cut hair nose, use only a one baterry AA, easy to wash and clean, and cut pefectly...</li>
            <li> But after a bit they became more comfortable.</li>
            <li> I had an old clipper that worked but not that great.</li>
            <li> Great purchase so far.</li>
            <li> This thing has many confirmed kills.</li>
            <li> Works great so far.</li>
            <li> i got a free Remington one that works way better.</li>
            <li> Best money spent.</li>
            <li> This might be the best $15 I have ever spent in my life.  </li>
            <li> So far a great product.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t have a good reference point but can&#x27;t really see what else they could offer</li>
            <li> Really works good on trimming my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, effective, and pain free.</li>
            <li> Does a good job provided you do not apply too much pressure to the nose.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works gently and fairly well.</li>
            <li> It is definitely useful for that kind of thing</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer,works good for my hubby.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well, and is not fancy, which is good.</li>
            <li> dont even really work that good</li>
            <li> Does a good job for the nose and brows but can&#x27;t really get a close shave for shaping beard.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> not crazy about the cleaning function, as it honestly doesn&#x27;t work too well, and I considered dropping the review to five stars as a result, but for the price I can&#x27;t bring myself to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m feeling good &amp; ready for anything now.</li>
            <li> Just a good item that has proven itself very reliable.</li>
            <li> Good purchase and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wondered about how effective these could be and I am at an age where it is useful.</li>
            <li> The ergonomic curve allows you to really attack hairs at a good angle.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do that good of a job trimming inside the nose, tons of areas get missed.  </li>
            <li> This is washable, doesn&#x27;t tug or pull (good because that&#x27;s what nobody wants) and you&#x27;re done in a flash.</li>
            <li> As good as I could reasonably want a nose hair trimmer to be.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price, good utility.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good thing they are reasonably priced, because they eventually die.</li>
            <li> head is really good and fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ticklish, but the blades do a good job of trimming them hairs fast and pain-free.</li>
            <li> In fact, it feels good in the ear. hahaha</li>
            <li> works well, is of good build quality, and so far is the best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;ve tried two electric and three manual prior to this one).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a very good buy for the money - well made and easy to use - and hope this one is as good as the first one he used for so long.</li>
            <li> It is adequately built, works well, and cleans up very easily.</li>
            <li> The price is right because it gets the job done!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good they&#x27;re not very expensive.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; clean!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean!</li>
            <li> easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is easy to use and clean!</li>

            <li> perfect shape, perfectly powerful, really nicely made, the rest of the small and cute nose trimmers were trashed immediately.</li>
            <li> My husband liked it very much.  </li>
            <li> That being said, this trimmer is very fast and effective.</li>
            <li> Battery life seems pretty good and cleanup is quick and easy.  </li>
            <li> so right now I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>

            <li> Have a drawer full of hair trimmers and this is the best by far at a very reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever bought .. very powerful and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Very pleased I bought one, very inexpensive at about $15-$20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works great and this style works so much better than the flat</li>
            <li> In fact, the first couple of times were amazing.  </li>
            <li> So, ordered this one; easy to use and seems to be working fine.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has worked just fine for a number of years and seems easy on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very durable,easy to operate and is very pleased with the product.  </li>
            <li> Amazingly this nose trimmer just worked the first time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Had an issue with the tickling sensation when trying to use it (not an issue with the trimmer, just with dealing with nose hair in general), and my wife had a great tip: blow out through your nose when using it.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice feature to have.  </li>
            <li> Probably the best civilized way to remove hair in  the nostrils due to aging.  </li>
            <li> however, I found that this trimmer works just FINE with a Eneloop battery and is just as strong as with an Alkaline battery.  </li>
            <li> Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer is a perfect choice for a good function and low price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just make sure you have a rechargeable battery as it looses its effectiveness if its not at full power.</li>
            <li> Nice size, works very well!</li>
            <li> The best of the average trimmers on the market.</li>
            <li> It works, not as good as the other brand I used to use, but it does work better than many others that I have tried!.</li>
            <li> It really worked and has made me much more confident :).</li>
            <li> NIce sharp (protected ) blades - does a great job.</li>
            <li> It was kind of a joke at first</li>
            <li> Always nice when its not expensive as well.</li>
            <li> I still need  a fresh AA battery to get the fill effect, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty nice.</li>
            <li> not bad, better than pulling it out</li>
            <li> The best, hands down, I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> this fixes that problem quickly and easily. :)</li>
            <li> Impressively trims nose and ear hair down to the skin without any pulling whatsoever.</li>
            <li> It is hands down the best trimmer for my ever changing hair growth patterns...</li>
            <li> Anyway, with this, as long as you have good batteries in it, it will un-terraform the landscape easily without pain, to get rid of the extraterrestrial plants here and there, just make sure to clean and change the battery on a regular basis, so that it will work at its best.</li>
            <li> Clean up is very easy and quick.</li>
            <li> It just works perfect,  great for trimming my mustache and all the other facial places a razor doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product, still kinda new, but I like it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as good as new.</li>
            <li> Cuts good, but it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> Seems to be as good as new aver</li>
            <li> Mine is still working fine after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> Then I took off the tip and tried it, and it would spin just fine.</li>
            <li> It seems to work fine once it powers up.</li>
            <li> The interior of my nose is hair-free as a result of using this fine device.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> But then again it works fine</li>
            <li> kind of cheap feeling, but consistent with the price.  </li>

            <li> This is a very good trimmer, better than the previous model the ER421KC</li>
            <li> Cleans easily and does a very good job, but be careful not to strike the cutter guard on anything or it will bend and jam the cutter.</li>

            <li> So far no issues, battery life seems really good, tip comes off easy for cleaning</li>

            <li> The design is the key--the rounded top allows the blades to get really close and to safely and easily navigate ears and nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 4 stars given tge price, it works just fine but feels kinda cheap like it might break soon.  </li>

            <li> , of course) jumped on the computer, and bought this wonderful item on Amazon.com, for less that 13 bucks; no tax and no delivery charge (I have Amazon Prime for an extremely cheap 79 bucks a year, which gives me free two-day shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, I&#x27;m gonna keep it more hidden than my vibrator, but I am just so happy I have it.</li>
            <li> It works fantastic, is easy to use, and is easy to clean.</li>

            <li> I bought this little guy on a whim years ago and it has served me perfectly.</li>
            <li> This little guy worked impressively well - for two weeks.</li>
            <li> After reading the excellent reviews on this little gem</li>
            <li> and I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;It cuts like a hot knife through butter!</li>
            <li> Best little trimmer I ver had.</li>

            <li> Works great on nose and ears, better then my last one and has more power, single one AA battery and easy to clean, good price also.</li>
            <li> A very good product at a reasonable price, it should provide many months of service provided it is properly used.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is comfortable to use, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> All in all, a nice tool for taming a balding Wookie - and much cheaper than a light saber.</li>
            <li> So cheap and I can&#x27;t believe how quiet and great it works.</li>
            <li> Cuts beautifully, accurately with ease.  </li>
            <li> What a great grooming tool, easy to clean, batteries last and last and a great feel.</li>
            <li> For one, the hair has to get in there a ways, so it won&#x27;t get close or accurate.  </li>
            <li> Took a couple of times using it to feel comfortable (was concerned about nipping and snipping) but found it to work smoothly and comfortably.  </li>
            <li> Smooth, easy to clean, and...</li>
            <li> That is a huge plus to me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in the military, so it&#x27;s great for trimming my hair from touching my ears.</li>

            <li> huge improvement in quality</li>
            <li> Its a lot smaller than the picture looks, which is a good thing because the picture makes this thing look huge!  </li>
            <li> much more effective than the old clunker I had...</li>
            <li> its better than expected, great colors</li>
            <li> Pain free and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several hair trimmers, including that manual one that got all the 5-star reviews (but is worthless).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never have I experienced one that works as smoothly and trims as closely as this one.  </li>
            <li> Another huge plus is the fact it runs off of AA batteries.  </li>
            <li> Up my nose, or in my ears, this trimmer trims closed and more thoroughly than I have ever experienced.  </li>
            <li> but I will say that using this before a ride has made a HUGE difference in the nose</li>

            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> I know replacement blades are available, but it doesn&#x27;t seem that replacement tips/hair guards are.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m taking off a star because a flimsy hair guard like this ought to have replacements available.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need anything any more powerful to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> Really easy to clean, too.</li>

            <li> At a relatively inexpensive price, it&#x27;s a great investment.</li>
            <li> It reaches well in the nose and the sound of the nose hair getting trimmed is so...</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is one of some products that are worth more than the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and uses one AA battery.</li>
            <li> But it was cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I like that it is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> comfortable ergonomic handle, cuts what needs to be cut.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.  </li>

            <li> Can&#x27;t someone make a trimmer that works and can be used in a pain free manner?</li>
            <li> have tried a number of trimmers - mostly your garden variety brand from the local drugstore - and these are BY FAR the best I have owned.</li>

            <li> When it died (happy it did), I went back to panasonic with this model.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> there is no battery light</li>
            <li> I actually lightly burnt the inside of my nostril (</li>
            <li> My nose is now the porcelain smooth palace it was meant to be.</li>
            <li> trimmer works great or nose, ear and facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found the product that works great for me.</li>
            <li> But while cleaning it (running water through it), I shook off the water (quite lightly mind you) and the tip happened to touch the ceramic basin bottom.</li>
            <li> As an added benefit, it is extremely easy to clean.</li>

            <li> star for what I would say is light or cheap construction.  </li>
            <li> It had some attachments, a brush and a light, etc.  </li>
            <li> It is fairly quiet and works great.  </li>
            <li> It does feel a bit cheap with regards to plasticy, but I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too.  </li>
            <li> but I wanted to shed light on some of the issues others have had with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Took it apart again and noticed a curved piece of plastic in the chamber that holds the hair that was blocking the blade from moving freely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap, but don&#x27;t let that fool you.</li>
            <li> But replacement blades are not made available by Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Does its job but make sure to use fresh batteries.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean for it has a knob you rotate to wash out with tap water.</li>

            <li> ER-GN30 has a great design for the cap, but it simply doesn&#x27;t cut well.</li>
            <li> The blade was so light it just kept going with the flow of water.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or more fun.</li>

            <li> So far so good, no pulled hairs that bring tears to your eyes.  </li>
            <li> Based on my first usage, pretty good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> does what it says; you do have to be very thorough though as it works much better if head is vertically on top of what you are looking to remove as the sideway cut doesn&#x27;t work as well</li>
            <li> My Instagram page has never been so popular with the amount of likes I am receiving from my popular selfies (especially now that I don’t have fiber optic cables growing out of my nose).</li>

            <li> So far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked the first time I used it, and did a pretty good job.  </li>

            <li> So good so far.</li>
            <li> So far so good, seems to work well.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely the best nose and facial hair trimmer that I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t need it as much as some, but I needed it more than most.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the ear trimmer, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Works good so far..</li>
            <li> Having said that, very easy to use, easy on the battery, quiet and effective.</li>
            <li> super easy to use, and super easy to clean!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I found trimmers that worked amazingly well and was quick and painless.</li>
            <li> First off it doesn&#x27;t cause any pain so no plucking or anything, its very easy to clean and it does what it is intended to do with ease.</li>
            <li> This item is easy to use, light weight, and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Priced right, couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> The designed is outstanding and works great&lt;br /&gt;on nose hair, cuts it just right.</li>
            <li> However, this product is very good due to speed and power of it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to disassemble for cleaning, but as with most of these, doesn&#x27;t really seem to spin very quickly.  </li>
            <li> I received this trimmer just about four months ago and after using it several times a week on both my nose and ear hair I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m still on the original battery I installed the day I got</li>
            <li> and I really wasn&#x27;t impressed with how clean it left the unit.</li>
            <li> works great more than I expected!</li>
            <li> Easy to disassemble for cleaning, but as with most of these, doesn&#x27;t really seem to spin very quickly.</li>
            <li> It gives the same good trim, and  the trimmer head seems strong and does not jam easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great item, I had their original trimmer for over 20 years until it finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> When things are easy to use and easy to take care of they are in an overall sense - good.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any loose hair remaining afterwards and was very impressed after the first use.</li>
            <li> and I never knew how much of a difference they make!!!</li>
            <li> This little $12 piece gives me the best, most consistent results.  </li>
            <li> It is very effective and amazingly quiet.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful.  </li>
            <li> IS VERY USEFUL.</li>
            <li> I know some reviews says it breaks, but mine did not answer it is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading somewhere where plucking your nose hair can cause fatal infection in a very rare cases.</li>
            <li> Well-made, quiet, and very effective.  </li>
            <li> Panasonic trimmer has been a very effective and simple solution.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li> The fact that you can clean it out with water is great and all, however the motor always sounds like it&#x27;s on its last leg.</li>
            <li> Never clogged, easy to clean, cuts clean, does not pinch or pull the hairs.  </li>
            <li> like I do to make sure its spotless, make sure you use a steady hand.</li>
            <li> My husband bought one from Best Buy and has been using it for the past 4 years and it still works fine.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean although you have to dissemble the cutter to clean.</li>
            <li> quick, easy and pain free.  </li>
            <li> its ok my older panasonic trimmer was much better....</li>
            <li> I hear the familiar crackling sound as the blades touch my nose hairs</li>
            <li> It works really well; it&#x27;s not the first trimmer I&#x27;ve gotten, but it&#x27;s the best one so far</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re really high quality and work better (a lot better) than any others I&#x27;ve used.</li>

            <li> Easy to use and super results.</li>
            <li> You probably bent the metal part at the top ever so slightly, and that will make the blade rattle, and you will never be able to align it again, and you will never find replacement blades at a fair price.  </li>
            <li> This one, you just stick up there and it zaps everything quickly and easily.  </li>

            <li> Cutters also act on the end of the unit, yielding faster and more consistent results.  </li>
            <li> im pretty sure i will lose the cleaning brush eventually since its always separated from the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The original one, the motor burnt out.  </li>
            <li> Everybody is excited.</li>
            <li> Be sure to read all the warnings first.  </li>
            <li> likes it as much or better than the first one.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this</li>
            <li> My friend wasn&#x27;t very pleased with his old trimmer.</li>
            <li> Stay fresh bromigos!</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the 5 stars!</li>
            <li> One of the best that I have purchased in the past three years.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great on nose, ear and eyebrow long hairs.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it was planned to do and with a price of 10 dollars you cant expect for more</li>
            <li> but the tip can run a bit hot if you run it for more than a min or two.</li>
            <li> This unit really cuts close, easy to clean, remove top and rinse with water.</li>
            <li> My initial impression is that it&#x27;s an excellent product for what you pay for it, and would gladly recommend it to those who are seeking a similar product.</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW:  </li>
            <li> Worth the money!</li>
            <li> For $ 9.99, it&#x27;s well worth it.!</li>
            <li> it is not the closest shave but definitely worth it!</li>
            <li> wonderful small appliance for man</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim eyebrows, like the Remington could, but I find this a minor inconvenience, considering the great job it does otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: Trimmed hair is contained within the cutter housing, doesn&#x27;t get all over your nostrils</li>
            <li> It does what it is designed to do and it also works great for those ear hairs that seem to grow long as you age.</li>
            <li> It is still running on the original AA battery.</li>
            <li> The first one worked but mostly by yanking the hair out of my nose.  </li>
            <li> I read somewhere that there are a significant amount of lemons and if you get one, it will stop working within a year.</li>
            <li> Great product and not loud.</li>
            <li> I got him this mostly to handle his nose hairs, which he wasn&#x27;t aware</li>
            <li> Not loud and seem to run great.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money as well!  </li>
            <li> AND this one is significantly quieter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best electric small trimmer ever.  </li>
            <li> I have purchased nose, ear &amp; hair trimmers in the past, but this is the best model I have used.</li>
            <li> Have purchased many different types of Nose trimmers over the years and finest be the most satisfying for this purchase</li>
            <li> Used it about 3 times so far and very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Worked ok for first month or so.</li>
            <li> Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> Works, did not take long to use, happy with the results.</li>
            <li> love it, really works!</li>
            <li> Not much more to say, best on the market IMO.</li>
            <li> No more embarrassing nose hairs, this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything because I felt no tugging as I do with most nose hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> Twist the top, place the end in hot water while it is running</li>
            <li> /&gt;I can now smell the fresh scent of life without any obstruction!</li>
            <li> No more nose hair tickles.....works perfectly!</li>
            <li> I have had a Panasonic in the past and it was awesome.</li>
            <li> and the battery lasts a bit longer than the original.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed</li>
            <li> Works as originally described.</li>
            <li> It manages to efficiently trim away those most embarrassing gray bristles that seem to grow out of the nostrils like dandelions in an unkempt yard without vibrating at the decibel level of a weedwacker, and it handles the finer follicles that pop out of the ears pretty well, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SMILE!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many others in the past with not so good results, including pulling and scraping inside the nose (ouch!).  </li>
            <li> The performance is so much better that I was amazed the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Works perfectly and is small and lightweight.</li>
            <li> At first I thought he meant his panda, but I wasn&#x27;t sure he had one anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> original review 5 star:&lt;br /&gt;I have been through about 5 brands and the issues were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have no comment on battery life as of yet, the original batteries I have in it have yet to give sign</li>
            <li> Most people aren&#x27;t interested in checking out flies legs hanging out your nostrils.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> If you need a small trimmer for hair in unwanted places, this would be an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> Love it ... not going to explain exactly why.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad this was my first nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> : About one year out, and I will still uphold my original rating.</li>
            <li> Well worth it!</li>
            <li> The long battery life is also a great plus.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m pretty sure thats just from the hairs.  </li>
            <li> But I think with this kind of product function is the most important issue and the panasonic falls short IMO.</li>
            <li> my wife can&#x27;t believe i&#x27;m excited about a nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> WELL worth the $10 I paid for it!</li>
            <li> You will LOVE it when you first use it...</li>
            <li> This is a kindlier, gentler version, which at first felt like it had no oomph, but now that I am used to it, I kick myself for thinking that the original power mower was better.  </li>
            <li> Small and works great!!!</li>
            <li> Small inconvenience for an otherwise excellent prduct.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to extol its virtues to the skies or pretend that it&#x27;s any more than what it is: an inexpensive gadget that basically does just one thing and does it pretty well.</li>
            <li> seller was respectful and the shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> Satisfactory but not the best trimmer I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> It really should be more powerful and cut more</li>
            <li> The ER-GN30 is the first trimmer that I have been truly pleased with.</li>
            <li> It worked OK for the first couple months</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made in China, but with Panasonic&#x27;s name on it, it has to meet higher engineering and manufacturing standards than most made-in-China junk.</li>
            <li> unit does get warm with some continuous use, but this normal, just in case you were wondering.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much fun to use!</li>
            <li> Works great and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> Good product it just happens to have its own personality and works only when it wants to</li>
            <li> When I use a rechargeable one, even right from the charger, it doesn&#x27;t seem to sound as strong.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to use, easy to set up, and the price was right.</li>
            <li> :Does the job really well, looks elegant, easy to clean, battery lasts very long, doesn&#x27;t hurt you and great price!&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Nice and reliable trimmer, works fine so far.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent, waterproof as described and work good</li>
            <li> He looks better, my whole family feels better and all is right with the world.</li>
            <li> It is not loud, it is very easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> Works well easy to clean, highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean and does exactly what is needed.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, they are pretty cheap and easy to replace.</li>
            <li> This is the first of it&#x27;s type I have purchased, but it works really well, painless, easy to use and clean, and effective.  </li>
            <li> This is a simple trimmer that works very well at a very good price.  </li>
            <li> After seeing all of the other great reviews of this item, I easily decided that this was the trimmer I would purchase for myself.</li>
            <li> After trying so many other brands, I am completely convinced this is the best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful and practical for nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is great: it is sharp, lots of power, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Nice new technology.</li>
            <li> but this new design is must effective to cut.</li>
            <li> Honestly, the shipping would probably warrant just buying a new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the older one still spun happily, blades cost nearly as much as a new one</li>
            <li> The new unit is quieter, curved to fit the hand and more easily cleaned.  </li>
            <li> so you can run it under the water, can trim in the shower or just clean it out&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets kind of hot after prolonged use, but considering that this is my first nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li> to clean on wash mode turn switch on the device.&lt;br /&gt;*Needs</li>
            <li> Still have not figured out how to clean it.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean,easy to use well worth the money if your thinking about buying it.</li>
            <li> to clean, too.  </li>
            <li> Maybe that is my lack of understanding on how to clean it.  </li>
            <li> I also like how you can turn the dial and clean it under the faucet...</li>
            <li> Like the clean feature too.</li>
            <li> It works, it rinses clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, waterproof, powerful, priced-welled.  </li>
            <li> To be honest - I have no idea if there are better competing models, but that&#x27;s only because this one does what I expect it to do - keep my ear and nose hair in check.</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my husband so he can clean his ears.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve got a clean device.</li>
            <li> on dads wiry hair it takes a lot of repeat passes to clean him up.  </li>
            <li> I do like the ability to clean it whilst the motor runs under the tap.</li>
            <li> like the fact you can put it under running water to clean</li>
            <li> and you could see the results since you needed to clean it out versus flushing.</li>
            <li> My nose has been cleanly trimmed ever since it arrived two or three weeks ago.</li>
            <li> This is the third trimmer I have owned and by far the best .</li>
            <li> if you want to clean the blades that becomes complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it to clean up around my eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;other brands and the ability to clean the tip should keep the unit from clogging up over time.  </li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t figure out how you clean this thing out with water.</li>
            <li> Based on my experience with various brands and styles of trimmers, this is the best I&#x27;ve used, so far.</li>
            <li> and you can clean it without taking it apart.</li>
            <li> This is the third type of trimmer I have purchased and by far the best.</li>
            <li> thank you for offer such a good stuff and cheap on this site.</li>
            <li> Never tested the water clean out feature.</li>
            <li> I am been struggling with buying a lot of different nose trimmers but this one is BY FAR THE BEST.  </li>
            <li> I also like that you can wash it under water to quickly clean it</li>
            <li> Likes how you can turn it and clean it out with water.</li>
            <li> Gets all of the nose hairs clean as a whistle with no muss or fuss.</li>
            <li> , so you feel/are clean after using.</li>
            <li> Provides clean cuts flush with the skin.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a knob to twist to clean with water which is the option I use to clean it.  </li>
            <li> I like this trimmer because it cuts clean without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> No pulling or tugging, just clean cuts.  </li>
            <li> It rinses clean.  </li>
            <li> You must keep it clean, else it would stop working.</li>
            <li> The ability to rinse it in flowing water while it is running keeps it really clean.</li>
            <li> It can even be cleaned under the faucet with running water, although I opted to just brush it clean with the included cleaning brush.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to men and women who want to have a clean appearance.</li>
            <li> So I finally just went with the most popular.</li>
            <li> I use this for far more than my nose, and I love it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but so far, vary happy.</li>
            <li> The brush cleans the blades in seconds and an alcohol-soaked Q-Tip fits neatly into the metal guard to sanatize and clean.</li>
            <li> It trims nose hair close and clean, with no pulling.  </li>
            <li> I returned that one and bought another one of these fantastic panasonic trimmers and love it as much as the one I broke.</li>
            <li> Improves breathing and keeps the nose clean</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s built well and trims cleanly.</li>
            <li> i have had several trimmers and this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> with antiseptic instead of trying to take it apart to clean.</li>
            <li> Clean.</li>
            <li> Does not pull the hair, cuts clean</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t pull your hair and they have a setting to clean them under a faucet.</li>
            <li> This one appears to be well made, does a nice job and has actually worked more than once.</li>
            <li> Two hands are needed to use and clean this.  </li>
            <li> Two hands are needed to use and clean this.  </li>
            <li> Two hands are needed to use and clean this.  </li>
            <li> Look clean and presentable again.</li>
            <li> Keep it clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer because of its excellent reviews, but unfortunately, I can&#x27;t recommend it based on my own experiences.  </li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly and never pulls.</li>
            <li> One of the many fun things about getting older, you start to lose hair on top of your head and it start to grow faster out your nose and ears.</li>
            <li> to clean by holding it under a running faucet.  </li>
            <li> Best nose trimmer we&#x27;ve owned so far, and this is the fourth one.</li>
            <li> so you can clean or replace it</li>
            <li> It also has a function where you can let water run through the blades as they are on to clean it</li>
            <li> but I always prefer to disassemble it and clean it that way.</li>
            <li> Helps keep the blades and blade chamber clean when running it under the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Panasonic makes a number of trimmers that do the hair-trimming job nicely, and many of them are about the same price.  </li>
            <li> I will probably try not to use the brush to clean the blades with this</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, better then my last one.</li>
            <li> like the fact that I can rinse it under the water to clean it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it under water or washed it under water but the dry use is great.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can clean this after using it.  </li>
            <li> Twist the cap as instructed when you are done, and everything rinses clean away.</li>
            <li> in the head, blades, etc to clean it</li>
            <li> If you read the instructions in the language of choice you can even igure out how to keep it clean.</li>
            <li> I like the feature where you can clean it while running under a faucet.</li>
            <li> to clean.</li>
            <li> What makes it noteworthy is that it&#x27;s washable so it gets clean.  </li>
            <li> Clean up, no problem.</li>
            <li> It was a great gift for my husband who has more trouble with his nose hair than anyone I&#x27;ve ever known.</li>
            <li> Clean cut</li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly without pulling or irritation.</li>
            <li> motor is reasonably powerful and it is really easy to clean.</li>
            <li> One word of caution: You can use the water rinse method to clean this, but if you take the trimmer section apart</li>
            <li> I clean it with rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps if from getting sticky or clogged.</li>
            <li> The trimmer quickly and precisely removes nose, eyebrow and ear fuzz in a conservative manner</li>
            <li> I can run under water to clean without any problems.</li>
            <li> trims nicley, good battery life, doesnt pull hair, doesnt sound like a weekeater, and keeps the hair short.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t figure out from the instruction on howto remove trimmer to clean.</li>
            <li> It seems like it&#x27;s there to clean it out,</li>
            <li> but it cuts cleanly,</li>
            <li> because I do like to use water to clean and not the brush.</li>
            <li> My husband have bought several Nose and Face trimmers and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and need to have it clean all the time after...</li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly, with no tugging.  </li>
            <li> Not overly thrilled, but it&#x27;s better than the last two I purchased.</li>
            <li> A bit cheaply made but works adequately.</li>
            <li> Just twist the switch and run the device under water to clean.  </li>
            <li> This is a nice product, well made, and i am sure it will last.  </li>
            <li> Until you have to clean it.  </li>
            <li> We are now noses clean per the Queen&#x27;s request.</li>
            <li> but after you remove the head to wash and clean it</li>
            <li> , it started pulling at hairs instead of making clean cuts like it did before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Of course at only $12 I could just get another one, it&#x27;d just be nice to be able to buy replacement blades/etc</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> I wanted a nose trimmer that I could rinse with water to clean, based on the review I purchased this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> but when I got done and looked into my nostrils, they were both quite clean.</li>
            <li> Easier to clean  and</li>
            <li> Snips away at nose hair cleanly, comfortably and quickly.</li>
            <li> its easly to clean and hasnt rusted.</li>
            <li> I like that I can clean it with water after use.</li>
            <li> Never dropped it, always kept it clean.</li>
            <li> no problems... helps clean up all the errant hairs nose, ears etc...</li>
            <li> Leaves be clean and trimmed.  </li>
            <li> won&#x27;t clean it)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Looks like it&#x27;ll be easier to clean as well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, better blade system than older trimmers.</li>
            <li> The blade could be bent if you don&#x27;t take care to gently clean off the clipped hairs.  </li>
            <li> Ran water through to clean it and was shaking it when the tip assembly just came apart from the inertial force of shaking the water out........</li>
            <li> a breeze to clean.</li>
            <li> works great dry.</li>
            <li> to clean out the head.</li>
            <li> better than my last one and a nice price.  </li>
            <li> but I still pull the head off to give it a thorough clean once in a while.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used multiple trimmers and this one is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Also has a water rinse feature where you move a knob to a setting and place it under running water to clean it out.  </li>
            <li> to clean and wash.</li>
            <li> Clean up beard/mustach lines, eyebrowns, nose hair...</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull on hairs and cleanly cuts the hairs.</li>
            <li> Just turn to flush mode and put under running water and its clean.</li>
            <li> and you can clean it with water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It cuts clean and meets my requirements to a tee.</li>
            <li> how the heck do I clean it though?</li>
            <li> The cutter detaches so that you can dump and clean.  </li>
            <li> Do remember to brush/ clean the blades after use.</li>
            <li> It is designed to rinse clean after</li>
            <li> Hacks away at my nose hairs and gives a clean cut.</li>
            <li> This is our third one and the best so far.</li>
            <li> Must clean thoroughly after each use.</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer arrived on time, undamaged and clean.</li>
            <li> I used three different products but this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> It has clean feature</li>
            <li> Takes me 10 seconds to  clip hair - and another 10 secs to clean the device.</li>
            <li> like the water clean out fearure</li>
            <li> I have to hold my breath when I use it and quickly clean out my nose before taking a breath in, or else I get sickened by the smell.</li>
            <li> That works great and is worth shelling out the extra money for.</li>
            <li> You just can&#x27;t use the brush they give to clean it well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> Clean shaving.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer three times, but so far, it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> It works well and is easier to clean.</li>
            <li> Using fresh rechargeable Ni-MH batteries, the motor would spin nice and fast once turned on</li>
            <li> /&gt;It isn&#x27;t very loud which is nice, unlike clippers or beard</li>
            <li> However, with all the new battery technology and companies making products that consumers will have to continuously replace I decided that the best replacement would be this one as you can load your own batteries in it (just make sure to take your battery out of the product when not in use as to prolong the life of the battery and to reduce corrosion so that the product lasts as long as possible.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this based off the many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> I chose it because most reviews were positive, they were correct.</li>
            <li> How can this have so many positive reviews?</li>
            <li> Hey, it always helps to add one more positive voice to the chorus, no?  </li>
            <li> It is far better than any micro-trimmer I have ever used!</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s far better than the mechanical, twisting one that I used to use!</li>
            <li> I find it&#x27;s best to remove the hairs by gently touching the tips and trim each hair gradually rather than trying to remove a hair in one shot, especially the long hairs.</li>
            <li> This baby is extremely well made and works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Cuts the hair right off and easy to clean the device.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this product and  it turned out to be a smart buy,  compact and easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li> I have used it for several months now and work great right out of the box.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good trimmer, a little lite n</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer, smooth, easy no pain.</li>
            <li> While almost all reviews for heavy hair use aren&#x27;t that great for this as it eventually breaks down; this is wonderful for your nose.</li>
            <li> Works great for nose hairs as long as you use it quickly.</li>
            <li> very comfortable and fast</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable and really gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Is very precise and fast.</li>
            <li> We got this very quickly and used it right away.</li>
            <li> The cutter is just the right size and it is easy to use and trim the hair efficiently.</li>
            <li> The price was right and it easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use right away out of the box.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and to keep running right.</li>
            <li> Worth the money, still working fine.</li>
            <li> Does the job very quick and safe, no need to worry about touching your inner skin.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know any other men who own a trimmer like this - the men in my family seem to just consider tufts of wayward hair coming out their head holes to enhance character or something - so I was on my own.</li>
            <li> It works well and rarely misses any hairs, and it&#x27;s super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy with the water flush through feature, and taking it apart to clean is fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> The price makes it worth it, and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Most other electric trimmers do not do as good a job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad someone finally invented a super effective weapon for the war on nasal tendrils.</li>
            <li> The jet rinse feature is nice, good to know all that gunk is being flushed out and not becoming residue inside the blade.</li>
            <li> Quiet, safe, efficient, and very easy to clean using the rinse feature.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean (interesting to have multiple cleaning options), works well, compact, performs as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is always advisable not to pluck hair and scissors is anyways risky specially if you want to cut hair in your nose.</li>
            <li> Nothing special about the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> I have also used this to trim around a beard that I have grown out for a special event.  </li>
            <li> nothing special.</li>
            <li> For the money it does what it should but certainly nothing more.  </li>
            <li> Nothing special.</li>
            <li> Nothing special to say one way or another.  </li>
            <li> Most trimmers just don&#x27;t get close enough, especially right inside the nose on that septum area.  </li>
            <li> Does the job right!</li>
            <li> It arrived right before Xmas!</li>
            <li> There were some hairs that it just wouldn&#x27;t touch (even though they&#x27;re right there!).</li>
            <li> I thought the price was right too!  </li>
            <li> Priced right!</li>
            <li> Reviews have led me to the right product!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very easy to set up, and requires a AA battery (not included), and washable.last but not least, gets rid of hair with no pull or tuck feeling</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer - highly recommended especially for its price.</li>
            <li> The trimmer worked great right out of the box -- it operates quickly, efficiently, and surprisingly silently.  </li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer, for a hard rough,adamant hair in my nose and ears...does the job.</li>
            <li> Trims those hard to get places perfectly.</li>

            <li> Great little trimmer, easy to clean and NO PULLING on hairs.  </li>
            <li> Sleek and a perfect size for home or travel, easy to take apart and clean, and does a THOROUGH job of getting those tough to reach hairs.  </li>
            <li> This machine does a grand job; quick, painless, quiet and very easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s an awesome bang for your buck, does the job VERY VERY well, and last but certainly not least, its a wet/dry trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nothing super special but cuts clean without pulling.</li>
            <li> Features I like, does not cut too close (avoids in grown hair), easy to use, quite, very easy to clean (great feature), long lasting battery, does not take up a lot of room in travel case...</li>
            <li> Lol haven&#x27;t tried it wet ;-?</li>
            <li> works great and is quieter than I was expected</li>
            <li> Seems to do exactly what it is supposed to and is easy use and clean.  </li>
            <li> I will do so like four or five times before I just sigh and give up because it&#x27;s not cutting any more hair after its first pass through.</li>
            <li> easy to clean and does exactly what is promised.  </li>
            <li> but WOW, this is amazing.  </li>
            <li> Does tend to choke pretty easily so you have to clean it out every 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> I love it because there are no more stray hairs coming out of his nose and ears (lol).</li>
            <li> Works great and is pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> I am pretty much done with trying to buy this kind of device.</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer that I have bought that actually works great product</li>
            <li> Used many nose hair trimmers in the past, this is great for the money.</li>
            <li> I have tried many trimmers in the past and have always experienced irritation and discomfort.  </li>
            <li> This product worked great the first time, then wouldn&#x27;t work when I went to use it the second time.</li>
            <li> Its pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to take apart and clean it well.</li>
            <li> It is pretty easy to clean though.</li>
            <li> It was quiet and worked great when I first received the item.</li>
            <li> Yes, it does get a bit warm if it&#x27;s on for more than 2 or 3 minutes, but that&#x27;s an extrememly minor</li>
            <li> Works great as long as the batteries are fresh.</li>
            <li> Works great and as expected.</li>
            <li> This product works great, just be careful how you use it.</li>
            <li> Not painful.</li>
            <li> The overall shape and usage of this product are nice and simple, which is great.</li>
            <li> Not too loud, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It is better than anything else on the market, which isn&#x27;t saying much.</li>
            <li> This is good for trimming nose,ear and facial hair.</li>
            <li> If I have to be at the age where this has become necessary, it&#x27;s nice to have a tool that makes it easy, clean and painless.</li>
            <li> Very simple but good design.</li>
            <li> Overall good though.</li>
            <li> With both of us using this product, I really like being able to rinse it with water.</li>
            <li> The cool thing is convenient and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Even looks better (although I really don&#x27;t care about that, but you might).  </li>
            <li> This makes for much easier and more sanitary cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not give the fifth star only because I would have loved it were rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Save your money, buy something that parts are replaceable at a reasonable cost, and that is more durable.  </li>
            <li> I have had multiple nose/facial hair trimmers and while they all worked fairly well, none of them were anything I would write home to mom about.</li>
            <li> and I am full of regret.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a fantastic job and worth every cent.</li>
            <li> For most people this is really all you should need.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no painful pulling</li>
            <li> Impressed with how powerful and good the cutting mechanism is.</li>
            <li> Being able to rinse it out is really helpful.</li>
            <li> Can I return it for full refund?</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have a good connection and have to remove the batteries to get it to work properly</li>
            <li> Quick and clean.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t spend as much time trimming my nose hairs because it cuts better.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be more efficient that the straight handles - easier grip.  </li>
            <li> Like most warranties, the user is responsible for shipping to get it fixed/replacement.</li>
            <li> Quick clean.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of removing unwanted nasal, ear, and facial hair.  </li>
            <li> good ear and facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Overall good product thought.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad she did it works very well</li>
            <li> It works well and the cap and the ability to rinse it under water are nice features my old trimmer didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> Even with a battery with a full charge, it ripped hair out instead of trimming.</li>
            <li> The instructions are good and simple.</li>
            <li> but it is good on initially clearing of nose hair.</li>
            <li> Many years ago I gently raised one into a nostril where it set about yanking out every nostril hair it could grab.</li>
            <li> I think I should get a full rebate.</li>
            <li> I know that have full on bushes growing out of their nose.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> good quality and simple to use works just like it says it does.</li>
            <li> Really really cuts close but is safe.</li>
            <li> Cheap and useful product.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a clipper I used for years that was a third the size of this Panasonic yet twice as good.</li>
            <li> only thing is it works so good</li>
            <li> It works really well, and the cost was appropriate.</li>
            <li> but this is much quicker and does a way better job.</li>
            <li> but it is so superior to a different one that I threw in the trash.  </li>
            <li> well i&#x27;ve only used it once, but this is working out good.</li>
            <li> This is not a tool that good hygiene principles allow for occasional cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Then again, glad it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> A good buy overall.</li>
            <li> My nostrils haven’t looked this good since before I started growing facial</li>
            <li> This one really works, unlike so many others that look identical, but do nothing.</li>
            <li> the packaging is good enough, instructions, even the motor and assembly are not and issue.</li>
            <li> Overall, though, it works well and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Although it looks cool in the bathroom, that&#x27;s where it should stay.</li>
            <li> It is so good that I bought second one for my dad.</li>
            <li> Not painful</li>
            <li> but overall works good and serves it purpose for nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t write many review</li>
            <li> It is relatively painless which is good.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is a good buy, especially for the price</li>
            <li> /&gt;It felt cheaply made and the cost wasn&#x27;t worth all the effort to try and use utilize its warranty.</li>
            <li> This my second Panasonic trimmer and it does a good job of trimming, but eats batteries.  </li>
            <li> Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the one I bought years ago that finally wore out.</li>
            <li> Well,.. as real men age, unsightly hair can get more so.  </li>
            <li> Second, it didn&#x27;t do a good job trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li> and overall it&#x27;s good.  </li>
            <li> Works really good, doesn&#x27;t cut you and takes the hair out, only need to use it every week or so.</li>
            <li> they are dying after 3 full uses.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.</li>
            <li> it really be any better then</li>
            <li> This is a useful and cheap tool that gets the job done.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cool to see it pump the pieces of cut hair into the pool of water in the bottom of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I like all the features listed in the description, so this should be the last one I have to purchase for a good while</li>
            <li> it cuts the hair cleanly and quickly with no pulling...  </li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say how many trimmers I&#x27;ve bought over the years and discarded because they didn&#x27;t work as they should.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> Much better than using scissors, &amp; reasonably priced.  </li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try it from all the good reviews but after only using maybe 4 times, it has died.  </li>
            <li> In this case, that wasn&#x27;t such a good idea.</li>
            <li> We enjoyed ours so much, we bought one for my dad.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I did not feel that it was worth it to return it as it was cheap to start</li>
            <li> For human use, this is a good product</li>
            <li> it is a cool thing arrived in time</li>
            <li> /&gt;Very solidly built and good feel.</li>
            <li> It does such a good job trimming nose hair that I even use it for edging my mustache.</li>
            <li> I an hoping that this one will last longer &amp; do as good of a job.</li>
            <li> Really good and essential thing for every man.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good on ear hairs and trimming up facial hair, as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a pro-Amazon customer so this is a true review.  </li>
            <li> recommend it more, really.</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm, only good for noise.</li>
            <li> good upgrade from my last one.</li>
            <li> To my surprise, it cuts really well, and I didn&#x27;t feel any hair pulling or irritation even when pressing the top against skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Fast, efficient and safe to use</li>
            <li> There are more options for cheaper that wouldn&#x27;t stop working as fast as this did.</li>
            <li> I like this simple and good work</li>
            <li> Works better than any nose trimmer I&#x27;ve seen before, really like.</li>
            <li> Loving it so far.</li>
            <li> It is good enough at what it does.  </li>
            <li> but I can replace one to have a full power.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s good to go for next time.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of nose hair trimmers that don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Looks cool.</li>
            <li> There are certainly much better ones on the market but they are also much pricier.</li>
            <li> It really works, better than I had hoped for.  </li>
            <li> Cool device, it does what it says.</li>
            <li> This tool is a man&#x27;s nose hair dream come true, for me.  </li>
            <li> and I must combat this with full force.  </li>
            <li> Yes sure did, thanks for paying attention.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s battery life is good 9running on the same one for 3 months now).</li>
            <li> Good grip and very quiet motor.</li>
            <li> Only used once, but did a good job.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is powered by a regular battery; which is SUPERIOR to the units with a &amp;#34;charging base.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> true description.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s quick to clean.  </li>
            <li> I thought that by purchasing a Panasonic device, it would last a fair amount of time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since last 1 month, Its quite good with its price range,</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s a cool feature.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much nicer than many others I had.</li>
            <li> I think that since these cut on the top and side it really improves the performance.  </li>
            <li> Most all of them have a cheap feel to them and tend to be a bit loud (cheap motors).  </li>
            <li> So far ths trimmer works pretty good.</li>
            <li> Not bad for $10.</li>
            <li> Not bad when it works.</li>
            <li> For $8 not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> All in all, not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad for the price either.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product for the price</li>
            <li> I should have known that it was too good to be true, it didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not a bad grooming tool.</li>
            <li> Not a bad product for $13.</li>
            <li> if u have re-chargeble batteries its probably not bad.</li>
            <li> Not a bad trimmer.  </li>
            <li> A not bad as we put in maind the price paid...</li>
            <li> thing works and so far the battery lasts pretty good.</li>
            <li> Not bad.</li>
            <li> Just the joy of that weed wacker like sound chopping down those ear hairs.  </li>
            <li> Works great work or dry!!</li>
            <li> the price was very reasonable and the delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very fast</li>
            <li> I think he&#x27;s actually grooming more often now that he has something that is doing such an easy and great job for him.</li>
            <li> Really nice product, very effective and solid in my hand, will probabl last for a while.</li>
            <li> If you need a trimmer, this is just as good or better than the others I&#x27;ve tried, for less money.</li>
            <li> Overall, the trimmer was easy to set-up and use, and has been effective at cleaning up any unwanted ear/nose hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, effective, very quiet.  </li>
            <li> So easy to use by far way better than scissors.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet when it&#x27;s in operation; and it also disassembles for easy cleaning, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> For just over 10 dollars and free shipping with a $35 purchase, this was just right for me.</li>
            <li> Limited use thus far, but best trimmer of this sort I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is pretty easy.</li>
            <li> - not expensive, can be used with one hand, easily replaceable&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> If you just need a quick trim before the full work up, these are for you.</li>
            <li> this here Panasonic hair trimmer has been a good first step in my comeback: clean, bare, downy earlobes &amp; the nostrils of a George Clooney in a close-up.</li>
            <li> Cleaning the trimmer is pretty easy as well.  </li>
            <li> But its not expensive and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> It is easy to hold and feels pretty sturdy in construction.  </li>
            <li> seems well made and can be cleaned pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I had the previous one for many years and the excellent performance and durability influenced me to buy another when the original finally wore out.  </li>
            <li> Battery (I believe one &amp;#34;AAA&amp;#34;) drains very quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than was expected and the Panasonic hair trimmer is the absolute best I&#x27;ve ever had especially being so cost effective.</li>
            <li> It delivers a clean, fast cut, and is easy and quick to clean.</li>
            <li> After much research I found a superior Nose &amp; Ear trimmer which really works &amp; appears to be a far better</li>
            <li> It tickles a little, but very effective in quickly and easily trimming those hairs.</li>
            <li> Does a great job; had other trimmers that would miss or not get as close.  </li>
            <li> but the thing is still good for minor touch-ups and was worth the purchase given its cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At our age hair grows out of every place you never expected, except on top of your head!</li>
            <li> I have used many of these devices in the past and this is by far the best one i have come across.</li>
            <li> takes a few mins once a month or so, and am good to go!  </li>
            <li> No pulling of hairs that I have experienced from other units.</li>
            <li> I purchased it as an impulse buy due to all the great reviews..</li>
            <li> Does the job wonderfully, easy to clean, small and compact, great product.</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and thought this would be great for trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li> I have a really hairy nose, and this little gizmo does a great job of trimming the werewolfness away!</li>
            <li> With a good battery this little guy keeps me looking in top trim.</li>
            <li> Awesome performance, light weight, does not heat up on tough jobs.</li>
            <li> No one will see this, as there are like a thousand positive reviews... but they are all right!!</li>
            <li> Unlike others that seem to pull more hair than they cut, this one does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this unit for about a year now and the batter is still good; since motors drain batteries quite quickly, and I use this cutter at least once a month, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> The Trimmer while not perfect is still deserving of a very good rating.</li>
            <li> So far It works very good and is better than the Wahl trimmer I had previous.</li>
            <li> The older original model was more powerful but this one does the job.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product and certainly look at Panasonic trimming products through new eyes now.</li>
            <li> worked fine at first, now it keeps shutting off like the battery is dying</li>
            <li> It worked fine the first couple of times.  </li>
            <li> This is not the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned, but it works as expected and it&#x27;s easy enough to maintain.</li>
            <li> convenient, clean and powerful.</li>
            <li> In both cases they worked fine at first, but they soon began making whirring noises which became louder and louder.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for the first 2 months.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Works quickly.</li>
            <li> I have used several different nose hair trimmers but this one works the best for me.  </li>
            <li> The blade/motor spin quickly which reduces hair from being yanked out from your skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple of weeks, but it works very well and was a great price.</li>
            <li> Or one that would leave a hair or two untrimmed, making you spend the better part of an HOUR trying to cut that particular hair?</li>
            <li> Very well built and extremely easy to clean.</li>
            <li> A quick pass through keeps nose hair at bay</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> It works very well and easy to clean it.</li>
            <li> , so I can quickly replace the battery instead of waiting for a charge.</li>
            <li> The item arrived quickly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence as to whether this product is worthy of the Panasonic name.  </li>
            <li> Cheap enough that everyone can own one.</li>
            <li> Priced well, Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet, comfortable, and gets the job done.  </li>
            <li> it cools quickly though.</li>
            <li> This trimmer arrived quickly as was estimated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painless, quick and convenient.</li>
            <li> It works- quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> Works very well &amp; easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> This is better than some but not as good as the Heavy Duty Nose Trimmer</li>
            <li> Have not had time to use it much yet, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> The older you get the more hair in the nose and ears.  </li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and was packaged to protect the product.  </li>
            <li> Does the job and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> It quickly and efficiently cuts off that unwanted hair with no problems.</li>
            <li> Glad I purchased this particular trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, easy to clean  very close shave and NO PAIN</li>
            <li> Its light, but looks well made and is water-washable and has a hole in it that you can open to flush out the hair which is nice.</li>
            <li> So let me tell you a quick story.  </li>
            <li> issue is upgright posture, which tends to make it fall over if the cabinet door is opened quickly</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that the blades inside dulled quickly and/or never repositioned correctly after cleaning and reassembling.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull and does the job quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> Then after the third use, the top broke off and I have not been able to fix it.  </li>
            <li> Breaks absurdly quickly.</li>
            <li> As I have gotten older, I find myself having to trim my nose hair much more often, about once a month.</li>
            <li> No pinching, just a quick removal of hair.  </li>
            <li> For such a low price this thing is great!</li>
            <li> A good powerful burst of air serves the same function.  </li>
            <li> Ergonomic design, easy to clean, and really does the job on nose and ears.</li>
            <li> A decent set of batteries makes it a much better tool.</li>
            <li> quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> Nothing better than my 5-year old ER-409 which I plan to get rid off soon, this one is cheaply made, that matching the cheaper price.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to rinse clean and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the drawer.  </li>
            <li> I anticipated paying more for decent quality but this thing delivers.</li>
            <li> I kind of expected more in this trimmer.</li>
            <li> maybe you will get lucky and get one that lasts.</li>
            <li> Lucky I&#x27;ll have these trimmers</li>
            <li> You are lucky if you get a 1 year warranty on stuff these days.</li>
            <li> make sure you have a decent battery with plenty of juice in</li>
            <li> but it takes a while to adequately trim.  </li>
            <li> ... deteriorates quickly.</li>
            <li> Goes through batteries quickly.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and surpassed all my needs.</li>
            <li> Works great, fairly quiet and does not drain the batteries fast.</li>
            <li> It trims nose hair very well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Serves it purpose, does it well, but goes thru batteries quickly.</li>
            <li> quick shipment.</li>
            <li> worthy choice and investment.</li>
            <li> He likes it - quick, no pain, inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It handles well and does the job quickly...</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to drain the battery too quickly.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old cheap one I had.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, this Panasonic device makes quick work of this evolutionary dead-end.  </li>
            <li> I broke an older model after dropping it to many times.</li>
            <li> Lucky me.  </li>
            <li> Shipped quickly and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it guys, as you get older more hair crops up where it isn&#x27;t wanted.  </li>
            <li> I really like that it has a built in drain so that you can clean it easily.</li>
            <li> It gets every stray hair and I love being able to wash it out for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but nothing extraordinary.  </li>
            <li> TO GET ALL OF THE HAIRS FROM  EARS AND NOSE; BUT, IT IS ADEQUATE</li>
            <li> This trimmer is extremely easy to clean thanks to the water diverting channel that allows water to flow out of it when you are washing it.</li>
            <li> and I replaced it with one I quickly bought at the store.  </li>
            <li> Quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> One of the pains of growing older is hair sprouting out of the most unflattering places.  </li>
            <li> Replacing an older panasonic trimmer that seemed to cut better than this one.</li>
            <li> Works good, not great, but good.  </li>
            <li> It drains a battery quickly, even if it is just sitting in a drawer.</li>
            <li> Im only writing more because it says more words are required for posting</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> This really works well and is quiet, attractive and even washable.</li>
            <li> If you are timid and pull it away from you, it can pull hair and cause pain, but if you are brave and go slow, no pain :)    </li>
            <li> but this one doesn&#x27;t seem worthy of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been lucky to get this one on sale at $12 and it has been working well for me ever since.</li>
            <li> A lot of reviews describe this product as failing fairly quickly.  </li>
            <li> This Trimmer arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also will allow you to quickly touch up your mustache around the lip area.</li>
            <li> Much better than the cheap $1.00 ones you can buy on eBay that are shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The vendor shipped this product quickly too.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done quickly.</li>
            <li> A quick rinse in the sink cleans the tip.  </li>
            <li> It gets the job done quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> Nothing extraordinary...</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve tried three different of these type trimmers in as many years.</li>
            <li> A quick rinse in the sink cleans the tip.</li>
            <li> Cuts super close with no pulling or irritation to the skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different nose hair trimmers and this is definitely the best one for me.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is super.  </li>
            <li> Barbers don&#x27;t do it any more and as I got older</li>
            <li> I remember reading some reviews indicating that the product died relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> delivered quickly</li>
            <li> so I am hoping it doesn&#x27;t break quickly</li>
            <li> does the job quickly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut quickly and  you have to work at it to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair quickly without pinching you.  </li>
            <li> Was blown away at how quickly Amazon delivered this item.  </li>
            <li> I like it better since it is smaller and more compact.</li>
            <li> Now I am starting to doubt great reviews on Amazon, defeats the whole purpose of me shopping here.</li>
            <li> It does a super job and never hurts.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these types of devices over the years, and this one is simply the best.</li>
            <li> Better than an older model I had years ago</li>
            <li> It is amazing how gentle it is and how fast the problem is resolved.  </li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, but the batteries run out quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer and I find it adequate for it&#x27;s intended purpose.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to quickly and painlessly, &#x27;nuff said.</li>
            <li> It makes quick work of nose and ear hair and doesn&#x27;t skip a beat.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job well and quickly.  </li>
            <li> It performs as advertized and is a super value.  </li>
            <li> I tried several brands during the years and found every time that Panasonic is simple the best.</li>
            <li> And most importantly, don&#x27;t expect this device to completely eliminate your nose hairs, because it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It cuts quickly and without tugging out the nostril roots, which can make a burly man tear up something fierce.</li>
            <li> This solves an issue most people have for sure I would grab this low cost product!</li>
            <li> This one works very well for me and it makes it easy to clean after each use.</li>
            <li> does* clip hair quickly and efficiently, if you don&#x27;t mind having the roar of a chainsaw blasting your eardrums.</li>
            <li> It makes stray hair disappear quickly and with no discomfort.  </li>
            <li> ripped the hairs out of my nose, but thankfully, this trimmer takes care of them quickly, without any pain at all.  </li>
            <li> Works and isn&#x27;t painful....very sturdy and cleans quickly.  </li>
            <li> Quick shipping.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic, once upon a time, made outstanding nose hair trimmers (most especially the Panasonic ER112).  </li>
            <li> Quickly sent and everything was well done.</li>
            <li> Does the job quickly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Heats up rather quickly.</li>
            <li> Trims hair quickly.  </li>
            <li> What else can i say ,You have  another loyal customer</li>
            <li> Much better than an older style I had.  </li>
            <li> I will say the item was received quickly and packaging was ample to keep from shipping damage.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m lucky my mom had this</li>
            <li> It came quickly.  </li>
            <li> better than most of the similar products that i had used.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly,  cuts without pulling.  </li>
            <li> Nothing extraordinary.</li>
            <li> The older I get the more hair grew where I didn&#x27;t want it - and fell out of where I did want it.  </li>
            <li> Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> The older I get, the more time I need to groom.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning it is a piece of cake, and you can throw it in a drawer with its cover or just leave it boldly on your sink (</li>
            <li> love this product, had other trimmers but this one is great SO FAR !!  </li>
            <li> Uses only one AA battery vs Two AA&#x27;s, features LED light to see unwanted hairs, very easy to clean unlike the Panasonic version.</li>
            <li> But...when I opened the battery compartment for the first time an incredibly fowl fish odor about knocked me down.</li>
            <li> Tight tolerances, easy to clean, does a good job at getting close to the skin without dragging or pulling.</li>
            <li> This one spins very fast and runs smoothly.  </li>
            <li> Most of the stuff I have is Panasonic and highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> But it is clearly very cheaply made and feels like it will last maybe a few months at best.  </li>
            <li> works very good no more hairy nostrils.</li>
            <li> This one is powerful right out of the box!</li>
            <li> It worked marginally well at best - tended to catch more than my prior trimmer, causing little bits of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very convenient and useful little device, quite happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a great job, and it has small, easy to lose parts.</li>
            <li> If you clean it after each use, it stays pretty clean.</li>
            <li> Frankly, I don&#x27;t know the first thing about how strong nor how effective something like this is supposed to be, but this unit appears to do exactly what it is designed to do - clear the hairs from your nostrils.</li>
            <li> as it&#x27;s pretty cheap and does come with a protective cap.</li>
            <li> Also pretty compact and light.</li>
            <li> This thing is cheap and does exactly what it states, and does it well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to replace the battery a couple times, but nothing more than I would normally expect.</li>
            <li> Great product works better than product from local big box stores.</li>
            <li> Coincidentally I dropped it the very first time I was using it and had to go to wall greens and by one to finish trimming.</li>
            <li> Thankfully it was cheap in the first place.</li>
            <li> Much more effective than some other products on the market.</li>
            <li> Also, the tip gets very hot after just a minute or two of use.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, it simply works great on both my nose-hair and ear hair, which, at my age, are a constant issue.</li>
            <li> After using it for several months I can say that I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It is easy to turn a bezel around the top to open a slot to run water through and clean it.  </li>
            <li> Comparing this trimmer to the other three I&#x27;ve owned I would say this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The very first thing I did when I received this trimmer and installed the battery</li>
            <li> When it works its barely functional and isnt effective.</li>
            <li> I sent my original product back to Panasonic (at my own expense) for a warranty replacement.</li>
            <li> Quiet and easy to clean, love it.</li>
            <li> This works well and is cheap, however the blade assembly is pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Due</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reassemble, enjoy ;)</li>
            <li> First surprise was frustration free packaging.</li>

            <li> the first was a no name cheap one from TJ Max which broke in 4 months.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this trimmer so much that I bought one to gift away to someone else!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, light, made well, and most important works</li>
            <li> He said he had 3 other trimmers and this one, by far, is the best.  </li>
            <li> My husband and I have had other manufacturer models of hair trimmers, and this one by far is the best.</li>
            <li> It was nice to finally find a good trimmer at a low price.</li>
            <li> If it lasts as long as &amp;quot;Old Yeller&amp;quot; then it will really be a good deal.</li>
            <li> Good product, battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer that works really well, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The rinse through feature is fantastic &amp; really works to clean it out after use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Great at trimming down nasal shame.  </li>
            <li> It appears to be decently built and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> A nice clean quiet cutter.  </li>
            <li> Broke down after just 1 month, but worked great while it lasted.</li>
            <li> It worked great at the start, but is showing signs of slowing down.  </li>
            <li> So far, it has a decent motor and does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just isn&#x27;t as good as the older model I have, its about 10 years old or so.</li>
            <li> but otherwise it is a great buy for all other people and it won&#x27;t hurt when you are trimming (in case any one had any doubts)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure most people are familiar with the cheap, $5 or less nose hair trimmers that fall apart and rip the hairs out.  </li>
            <li> It can be washed with water with a special switch right below the blade.</li>
            <li> Love it ,is it really nice , small, easy to use.  </li>

            <li> Highly recommended, practical and easy to use, also is also to clean, this article need to be presentable to us.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m good to go for a long time!</li>
            <li> But for the price I am going to live with it, just wish it had some more strength.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite trimmer.  </li>
            <li> ahead and paid 3-4 dollars to ship it to Panasonic, figured I might as well since a new one of any brand would cost more than that</li>
            <li> I tried a new battery and also 2 more still doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Unit no longer works, regardless of how many new batteries I put in it.  </li>
            <li> Love this new trimmer.  </li>

            <li> The product has a great feel for Quality and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like some of the ones I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> This ergonomic model performed well on nose and ear hair (not so great for eyebrow trimming &amp; sculpting) for the first 5 months - before it jammed.</li>
            <li> I had previously used another Panasonic trimmer that I was happy with but was discontinued.</li>
            <li> works great for nose hairs and ear hairs, doesn&#x27;t pull like previous one I had by another manufacturer</li>
            <li> Typical Panasonic product; works great</li>
            <li> I feel really old having to say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this nose and ear hair trimmer, but it isn&#x27;t my first of this kind of grooming tool</li>

            <li> The 2 I ordered not too long ago only lasted 3 months at best.</li>
            <li> My husband finds it easy to use, and it really clips away all the unwanted hairs without pulling or tugging.  </li>
            <li> Clean, need, fast, good battery life, solid construction.</li>
            <li> It is far superior to my older trimmer - much better cutter that doesn&#x27;t pull, quiet operation, and easy cleaning.  </li>

            <li> I had bought before and did not last long and those one I have for 7 months and works perfect</li>
            <li> Super powerful trimmer.  </li>

            <li> I really like how it can easily be cleaned.</li>

            <li> Very well pleased with the trimmer, it does exactly what I purchased it for.</li>
            <li> it only &amp;#34;yanked&amp;#34; on me once out of maybe 20 times that I&#x27;ve used it (pretty good if you ask me).</li>

            <li> even if it does it&#x27;s very inexpensive and easily replaced.</li>
            <li> Good product - use it regularly - does exactly what it is supposed</li>
            <li> When first using it, I was very scared it would pull the hair or scrape the skin (looking at the top, it seems like it would).  </li>
            <li> I really like the Panasonic ER-GN30 because it is an easy and efficient product.</li>
            <li> A very compact and easy to use product.</li>
            <li> As long as you keep fresh batteries in it your good.  </li>
            <li> this works like a charm and is fast and easy to boot</li>
            <li> This is the first time, after many thousands of dollars of purchases, that I really feel that I got ripped off.  </li>
            <li> The battery last a long time, and the price is perfect.  </li>
            <li> It is very lightweight and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it comes apart for easy cleaning.</li>
            <li> The battery I put in (uses 1 AA battery) has lasted the whole time and it seems like it&#x27;s going strong</li>
            <li> Fast and easy.</li>
            <li> This trimmer runs for a long time on the battery, trims close, is comfortable to use, and has a nice clean-out feature.  </li>
            <li> I am pretty happy the way I am able to get those long hairs that seem to come more and more with age in places hard to manage otherwise.</li>
            <li> And it really does cut and clean out nose and ear hair very fast and easy.</li>
            <li> but more power would be nice chop it down</li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to use, tackles those hard to reach/hard to trim hairs and does the job for a great price.</li>
            <li> unit is very user friendly - cuts cleanly -</li>
            <li> Batteries last forever, easy to clean and super easy to use.</li>
            <li> It has a very fast motor for clean painless trimming.</li>
            <li> Hot damb!  </li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband &amp; he really likes it!!</li>
            <li> I owned 4 to 5 cheap nose hair trimmers in the past, Panasonic ER-GN30-K is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Before that, it sported a weak motor even with an excellent battery.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!!  </li>
            <li> It works exactly as described!</li>
            <li> Whats more remarkable than the very short 6 week life span is that I only used this thing about 4 times.  </li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason in the first place!  </li>
            <li> As described in other reviews ... sturdy build, painless &amp; effective!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bigger unit, sure, but am looking forward to another 15 years of service with this one!</li>
            <li> Jesus, this thing gets hot!</li>
            <li> Pretty straightforward - it does what it needs to do and does it well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended !!!</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I clenched my teeth expecting the familiar feel of yanking nose hairs out, but felt almost nothing.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason in the first place!</li>
            <li> I think the size is great because it is small enough that it would be good to travel with.</li>
            <li> exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Every man should own one of these and for the price I paid everyone has no excuse not to have one.</li>
            <li> This does exactly what it says it does!</li>
            <li> So much easier and safer than using scissors, a razor or tweezers - and NO pain!!</li>
            <li> I want to give it 4.5 but not quite 5 since I find the power a bit weak, perfect for me</li>
            <li> Most guys are not excessive &amp;#34;groomers&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> and then it starts feeling hot!  </li>
            <li> First time i buy a panasonic article and doesn t fill my expectations!</li>
            <li> The washable nature is an excellent idea and keeps it clean as long as you allow it to dry thoroughly.</li>
            <li> Though, I recommend that the batteries be changed out consistently, because if not, it&#x27;ll get ya!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> This REALLY does the trick!!</li>
            <li> its great have had 1 before but quit working in short time even with new battery hope</li>
            <li> My new Panasonic nose and facial hair trimmer works great.  </li>
            <li> Does a nice job and is a sturdier, more durable product than I&#x27;ve previously used.</li>
            <li> I have tried three different trimmers, and this one gets the job done quickly and effectively.  </li>
            <li> I needed something cheap and easy to use to help clear out my nose</li>
            <li> Thus far, it works  fine!</li>
            <li> Its very easy to clean, simply requiring you turn the head to the water setting, and stick it under the faucet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also quiet and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It is very comfortable to handle and so far it does not pull the hairs.</li>
            <li> It seems very easy to clean overall.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really very simple to use, and very easy to clean ...</li>
            <li> Works fine and if you have ever nicked your nostril with a manicure scissors you will appreciate this much safer method.</li>
            <li> But, it works fine, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate, easy to clean, and totally painless.</li>
            <li> This product has been engineered to make it perfect for what it is to be used for, quiet, heavy duty, grip makes it easy to handle</li>

            <li> This trimmer really works, quickly and painlessly!</li>
            <li> Cuts pretty well and is easier to clean than others I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> so you can clean it out with hot water if you unearth burried treasures.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the quick shipping!</li>
            <li> It is better than the most expensive ones I have bought and does not pull which is extremely pleasant.</li>
            <li> Ah, the joys of becoming older, hair starts showing up in places that it never was a problem before, and this solves it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer really works, quickly and painlessly!  </li>
            <li> at a low price, it is reasonable effective in solving problems that aren&#x27;t easy</li>
            <li> This unit works very well, zips away unwanted hair quickly and cleans in a snap!    </li>
            <li> and wow, how much easier and more efficient this is!  </li>
            <li> My barber made some light hearted cracks about how men when reaching a certain age just start sprouting the uglies.</li>
            <li> Great design, ease of use and ability to keep clean and extremely quiet without the hair pulls or snags I&#x27;ve experienced with other similar products.</li>
            <li> Worked great right out of the box but with way less than a year&#x27;s use it doesn&#x27;t cut.</li>

            <li> This little trimmer works great</li>
            <li> Great little clippers.</li>
            <li> Great device, but after only about 20 uses, the top came loose and rattles when I use the thing, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to trim as well anymore.</li>
            <li> but ours is working fine since last so many</li>
            <li> You can also clean it under running water and I find that great for washing out small hairs.</li>
            <li> Unit is very quiet, nicely angled, amply powered, easy to maneuver, easy to clean, and runs on one standard AA battery.</li>
            <li> I got each new - they were very effective, never pinching, relatively quiet, functioning quite well.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I love this nose trim, its very easy to use and a great price you cant go wrong, i highly recommend</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li> If it takes you more than a minute of continuous use you&#x27;ll notice the tip gets a little warm in your nose.</li>
            <li> First time buyer of this type of trimmer and got it on special 9$.  </li>
            <li> It is firm in the hand; very good build quality and just a very well thought out product.</li>
            <li> Finally, the Norelco got to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and happily replaced it with this nice little unit from Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice little feature is the wash feature which allows you to clean easily.</li>
            <li> This works great so far however wish it had a little more power.  </li>
            <li> Nice sharp blades easily cut hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve dropped it on the tile a few times and it still works great.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times now and it works great.</li>
            <li> It cuts fast, doesn&#x27;t injure the user and is lightweight without being cheap.  </li>
            <li> Its much quieter then my cheap junk conair trimmer.</li>
            <li> The low price is amazing.</li>
            <li> it worked great at beginning but went off after a few times of using.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain too much as it was cheap.</li>
            <li> It is compact, light weight, and very well-built.  </li>
            <li> Great product, assuming it doesn&#x27;t break in a few months.</li>
            <li> Very affordable: At the time I bought it I paid $12.5 (with free prime shipping)and</li>
            <li> You feel great, and well  groomed, in just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I tried a cheaper Panasonic nose hair trimmer, the one with the light on it, and it worked very well but died after 2 months.</li>
            <li> THIS ONE SEEMS VERY SUBSTANTIAL AND NOT LIKE CHEAP PLASTIC.</li>
            <li> Fits my hand well, is relatively quiet and is amazingly efficient at what it is suppsoed to do .. cut hair in places you don&#x27;t want to be weilding scissors.</li>
            <li> It is cheap and I was very disapointed.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is by far the best one I have purchased, and I have been through a few.</li>
            <li> comfortable to use, easy to clean- too soon to tell relaibility, but seems made well enough</li>
            <li> I primarily use this for my nose and it has worked really well.</li>
            <li> This really was a fantastic buy.  </li>
            <li> Simplicity in design with few moving parts make this a great product.</li>
            <li> Unless you enjoy a trimmer that tugs and pulls instead of gently clipping out your gnarly nose, eyebrow, and ear hair, I would stay away.  </li>
            <li> Very efficient and light.....</li>
            <li> Its cheap and works very well and is well built</li>
            <li> But took out 1 star because it doesn&#x27;t perform its primary function of trimming very well.</li>
            <li> Great for fighting back any signs of old age.</li>
            <li> Nice personal groomer to have</li>
            <li> I tried two fresh batteries, nothing.</li>
            <li> Also, it would be nice if they had different settings for the razor, but there is just the one on/off switch.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old one I had.  </li>
            <li> Was not a battery problem as I tried fresh batteries.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extraordinarily quiet and cuts effectively.  </li>
            <li> Worth the $$.</li>
            <li> well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll have to make the call yourself if the pain is worth it.</li>
            <li> East to use and powerful.</li>
            <li> it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Thank You Golden Bird</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and effectively does its job.  </li>
            <li> Today it is making a humming noise, but not cutting any hairs.</li>
            <li> Just pop in a freshly charged NiMH rechargeable and I&#x27;m off and trimming again.</li>
            <li> More money in their pockets if you have to replace it frequently.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few trimmers and this is the best so far.  </li>
            <li> No snagging and a close cut make it worth buying.</li>
            <li> From various rotary or micro trimmers this blade design seems to catch every hair without catching any skin.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.</li>
            <li> The dual-edge blade really is better than the old blades.</li>
            <li> The cleaning drain is pretty cool.  </li>
            <li> I would keep looking, this one does not seem to be worth it unless you want a lot of frustration.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and worth the money.</li>
            <li> Really useful tool.</li>
            <li> This unit has a nice amount of power and is great for trimming off nose hairs that might be difficult to reach and remove.     </li>
            <li> Way better than my old method of using the Swiss army knife&#x27;s scissor to trim my nose hair.</li>
            <li> I decided to try a different kind Philips Norelco NT9110 Nose and Ear Trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is an awesome trimmer, and I really can&#x27;t find any negative things to say about it.  </li>
            <li> And for the price it was worth it.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t mind a good cry or sneeze or two, I needed something modern, something hygienic, and something that would keep me from plucking my nose hairs in public.</li>
            <li> So if you think $15 bucks is worth 2 years, then go for it</li>
            <li> Boy, getting old sure does suck...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so useful</li>
            <li> Works so well that I bought this latest one for my 13yr old son.</li>
            <li> I replaced it with this one and it is a nose of fresh air.</li>
            <li> After having owned a few of these, I can say that this is by far the best trimmer I have used.  </li>
            <li> My old one was in use more then 3 years without any problem until I accidentally dropped it.</li>
            <li> The trimming is quite good, and I really like the ease of disassembly for simple cleaning.</li>
            <li> All in all, it&#x27;s well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/03/2013:</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a considerable amount of time, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I want to reduce one star even though it is useful.</li>
            <li> I use this tool more often to complete my shave than I use it to trim nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> this product is worth about .50 cents.   </li>
            <li> It was worth ever penny and in case you didn&#x27;t notice it has a 2 year guarantee.</li>
            <li> I have used several brands before and they have ever not been too effective or just quit running.</li>
            <li> Just worth the price.</li>
            <li> This groomer is way under-powered, even with fresh batteries.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money</li>
            <li> but this is far better quality and does a far better job.</li>
            <li> So far OK.</li>
            <li> It was pulling and pulling the hair and not cutting it.  </li>
            <li> Not any better tnen the old one I replaced.</li>
            <li> It works better than my old one</li>
            <li> With a fresh battery, it worked well.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of electronic and old school scissor methods to trim hair and more sensitve skin areas.  </li>
            <li> Those areas are more sensitive and take it from someone that takes blood thinners, you do not want to cut yourself there.  </li>
            <li> he said this is what he needs and really useful to him.</li>
            <li> and it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of gross to think about, but my ears and nose have never been cleaner.</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, I threw out my old one.  </li>
            <li> wish there was a powerful model.</li>
            <li> but this one does do a far better job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d own such a product.  </li>
            <li> But, alas, when I looked into my nostril, nicely trimmed nose hairs!!!  </li>
            <li> My old one had seen better days.</li>
            <li> - So, all in all, a success.  </li>
            <li> When this has happened, i have coaxed more life out of them by (carefully) striking against my palm (or harder surface, damn it) with the unit ON, which seems to shake away the glitch for awhile, months even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not enough power to be totally effective.</li>
            <li> 100% satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> excellent, all as expected, no complaints, overall satisfaction</li>
            <li> powerful and doesnt pull the hair.</li>
            <li> Powerful and does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> Clean cutting, easy to use, easy to clean; great unit.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> This one is a lot better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Overall the tool is nice.</li>
            <li> Will probably purchase another though now that I know its useful life expectancy and cost per use is about $0.50 per month.</li>
            <li> This is a great nose hair trimmer (I have only used it for that so far).  </li>
            <li> This one is so nice that I would not go back to the cheaper model.</li>
            <li> Still, we liked it enough to buy another.</li>
            <li> This groomer is a powerful accessory to any mans trimming options.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> and it went downhill from there to the point that I rarely used it anymore.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot more than my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is also insanely easy to clean and is about as loud as a whisper.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.</li>
            <li> WORTH EVERY PENNY</li>
            <li> It does as good as I expected it to.  </li>
            <li> it is worth for this prize</li>
            <li> Not to mention it is fun to play around with friends who exit my bathroom asking me &amp;#</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it to see the puzzled expression in their eyes.</li>
            <li> simple but effective design: All you need is an AA battery , no cords, no adapters are needed...</li>
            <li> It is powerful and well made.</li>
            <li> The blades are close enough to the foil to get the hairs nice and short without catching the skin inside your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> SO far I am satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> No problems so far after many months of use.</li>
            <li> As much as I liked how that one simplified mustache gardening, it left my nose tender, inflamed, and unacceptably hairy.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> It is powerful, and does not tug the hair.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the risk, but that&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li> That alone is makes it worth twice the price.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington trimmer before and this one by far is the better of the two.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic warranty claim isn&#x27;t the best since they expect the broken unit to be mailed at our cost to them for them to honor their warranty.</li>
            <li> Clips a lot more hair than my old unit.</li>
            <li> Well worth it.</li>
            <li> No pulling hair and is nice and quiet.</li>
            <li> Nice nose, ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer.</li>
            <li> of this was when I got the trimmer fresh out of the box too.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected</li>
            <li> It looks like it doesn&#x27;t turn on anymore, and there is no motor noise even with a fresh battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and that is well built, durable, and not the kind of junk they sell at dollar stores, marshalls, or tjmaxxs for the same price.</li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Powerful motor, and</li>
            <li> Well worth the $$$ to keep the nasal jungle under control.</li>
            <li> The power would not stay on, even with a fresh alkaline battery, as if the battery wasn&#x27;t connecting with the unit.</li>
            <li> , it is light height and works better than the last Panasonic I had.</li>
            <li> At this cost worth the buy</li>
            <li> This trimmer is worth every cent.</li>
            <li> My old &amp;#34;Harbor-Freight&amp;#34; nose hair razor worked better than this one...</li>
            <li> Not that powerful</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I had wanted</li>
            <li> but what people don&#x27;t realize that with years China manufacturing got a lot better and today you can find same product in low quality and good quality.</li>
            <li> Not really fast, you need to pass a lot of time at the same place for have the best cut...</li>
            <li> End cap protects the trimming components, which is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;- Solid build.  </li>
            <li> This works as expected, good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Cleans up nicely and simple to disassemble.  </li>
            <li> You could say this product wins by a nose.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipment.</li>
            <li> These are handy for properly cleaning and maintaining the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has 2 speed settings and effectively manages hair in the nose, ears but can also be used on facial hair and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I give it my highest recommendation as it&#x27;s been worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Safety alone makes it worth the purchase.  </li>
            <li> Does a lot better than my old one.</li>
            <li> Worth it.</li>
            <li> You grow old and hairs pop out more often and in stranger places.</li>
            <li> I had this one for over 6 months and so far I&#x27;m pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> It is powerful and cuts close to the skin without ever nicking.</li>
            <li> Even with all the good things to say, I don&#x27;t think I would take it in the shower and use the wet setting.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s useful life.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> Mine worked great for about six months, and then it got really loud and stopped functioning properly.</li>
            <li> this just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> Currently, I am sporting the popular Spring 2015</li>
            <li> The round cutter on the end of the tip is much more effective than the design that uses a linear set of cutters along the side of the tip.</li>
            <li> I put fresh batteries in it and it still sometimes doesn&#x27;t want to work.</li>
            <li> Yes, and I did put a fresh battery in it, hoping that would do the trick&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful and versatile.</li>
            <li> Cuts my nose hairs nicely, and it only takes one battery and it lasts a while!</li>
            <li> If it lasts a year, it will be worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> my husband has gone through dozens of trimmers and this is by far his favorite</li>
            <li> Runs off batteries, which rarely need changing.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I THOUGHT THE BATTERY MIGHT BE OLD, PURCHASED MORE</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Thanks for such good service/</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean. - gets in all those nooks and crannies a must for those with hair in unwanted places (the mature)</li>
            <li> Yes, kind of a personal item, but needed.  </li>
            <li> Very simple and effective.</li>
            <li> Silent and effective.</li>
            <li> So far I love it.</li>
            <li> I changed to fresh batteries, but nothing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t eat through batteries like my old trimmers.</li>
            <li> Keep a fresh battery on hand.</li>
            <li> Useful and works as specified.  </li>
            <li> Far superior to the old school trimmer that it replaced.</li>
            <li> Not even worth the hassle and money to check the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> It is powerful, it does what it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> Very quiet and works quite nicely.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than my old name brand trimmer, no comparison.</li>
            <li> A rare instance where you don&#x27;t get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> but well worth it.</li>
            <li> My old one landed in the trash can after I realized how much better this one was.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re quiet and cut nicely.  </li>
            <li> Worth the money.  </li>
            <li> only drawback is that my husband refuses to trim his own hairs, so I have to do it, and he squirms and hates it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely some kind of defect in my device.  </li>
            <li> Powerful...</li>
            <li> Having used various nose &amp; ear trimers over the years with marginal success, it&#x27;s nice to see that the ER-GN30-K trimmer hit the bulls eye in performance and value.</li>
            <li> My shorter friends tell me that they appreciate my freshly maintained nostrils.</li>
            <li> Quiet, effective, does not pull.</li>
            <li> Good and ergonomic, Gives close cut and can be operated wet and also washed with water.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective.  </li>
            <li> It works great and is much quieter than I expected.  </li>
            <li> and I like this on far better.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s well worth the cost.  </li>
            <li> It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old one I had.</li>
            <li> totally worth 12.50$.</li>
            <li> it is nice trimmer and let&#x27;s me remove hairs from my ears without any bleeding like when i do it with my gilettes back blade on the cartridge.</li>
            <li> * Burns through batteries: After 2 uses, a fresh battery had no juice left.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also a nice touch that you can open up a port to help water flow through and rinse this out.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my boyfriend and one for his father for Christmas and not only is it well worth the money, it&#x27;s very well made and good quality.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace an old Wahl unit and this one does a lot better of a job.</li>
            <li> internal seems to emit some kind of foul smell (smells like something rotten to be</li>
            <li> Remarkably effective as well as very quiet product.  </li>
            <li> It literally made me laugh when I did my nose</li>
            <li> it is the best option, till it falls and breaks because it&#x27;s made of thin plastic and once it&#x27;s broke.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> it is advertised with multiple uses but lets be honest and call that a bit of a stretch.</li>
            <li> Works OK but is too loud when in operation.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s powerful.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.  </li>
            <li> so you really have to move it around from different angles in order to do a good job.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely useful product.</li>
            <li> Breathing freshly and no longer showing my nose friends.</li>
            <li> My husband reports that he &amp;#34;loves it!&amp;#34; and says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;so much better than his old one&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Its powerful and trims without snagging a hair.</li>
            <li> Works but not as powerful as I would like.</li>
            <li> For the price, this was totally worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t have any expectation that the two year warranty is worth anything.</li>
            <li> Easily worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> The rinse feature is nice but it takes reading the directions to understand how to use it properly.</li>
            <li> A thousand times better than the junky ones at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;For old folks who are growing hair everywhere</li>
            <li> worth the $$$</li>
            <li> I especially like how it stands tall on its own.  </li>
            <li> Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Useful, inexpensive, should have bought one sooner.</li>
            <li> Not that useful</li>
            <li> Fun to play with it on hubbys ears and nose hairs.</li>
            <li> A simple yet effective tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I expect that if it goes 1.5 to 2 years, I&#x27;ll have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> This razor works well for what it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a replacement and find this works better than the old trimmer.</li>
            <li> I decided to finally get a trimmer when an ear hair spouted out and made me contemplate my own mortality.  </li>
            <li> but so far its okay</li>
            <li> This trimmer works much better than my old one</li>
            <li> Lasted me 9 months but now won&#x27;t turn on, even with a fresh battery.</li>
            <li> its not painful at all no pulling very portable!</li>
            <li> I have used it for a couple of times and I&#x27;m complete satisfied with its performance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and clips nicely.</li>
            <li> Works as described, worth the price.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The device for only $10ish is a good investment to get rid of nose hairs, however this does get fairly hot in the first  90 seconds</li>
            <li> A lot more acoustically pleasing -- not so loud..</li>
            <li> no complains so far :)</li>
            <li> Clipper is much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clipper is much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Clipper is much better than my old one.</li>
            <li> I bought this nose hair trimmer because I wanted a well made product that will last and this seems to be very sturdy and does a good job at trimming.</li>
            <li> Works much better than my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> This handy device takes care of a very personal matter.  </li>
            <li> Better than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Have fun..</li>
            <li> Worth the buy.</li>
            <li> My husband says it works better then his old one.</li>
            <li> For such a cheap items shipping would be more than it is worth.</li>
            <li> And once one starts, I SWEAR that others join in the fun.  </li>
            <li> ...curiosity finally got the best of me after a particularly long day of riding (and itching), so I went to all kinds of sites to read up on resolving this....and the Panasonic consistently was the recommendation.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic is far better.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic has a very high velocity of blade spin making a pulled hair very rare.</li>
            <li> So far, so good - LOVING it compared to my previous one!</li>
            <li> It is simple to use, easy to clean and it works!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is light weight, small, and accurate which is what i wanted, plus it&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to take apart.</li>
            <li> The unit, itself is extremely quiet and really easy to clean!  </li>
            <li> As others have stated, its quiet, easy to use and to clean, &amp; doesn&#x27;t pinch!</li>
            <li> Could be a little more compact, but other than that, functions perfectly.</li>
            <li> A strong brand name (Panasonic) with a high reputation of quality items.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This style works much better than some of the new trimmers I have tried in the past, the Panasonic is still working great</li>
            <li> Very handy little device.</li>
            <li> Would have been better if it has a light like other similar products but overall it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Fourth, it runs smooth, cleans easily, and looks tres cool.  </li>
            <li> It is efficient and affective and easy to use and feels more stout in the hand than most trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> very powerful but gentle...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful and the battery is holding up very well</li>
            <li> It is very powerful and seems to work very well.  </li>
            <li> I bought it purely based on reviews and was not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Hard to get excited about a nose hair teimmer but works great.</li>
            <li> The instructions were easy to follow, although it&#x27;s use is pretty straight forward.  </li>
            <li> Product works very well; Quick and easy with no pulling or tearing; Lightweight and easy to clean; Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> came with batteries, very easy to use, does the job and is little and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Trims nose hairs just right, is easy to clean (as long as you do it with each use) and is easy to charge and use.</li>
            <li> Works great for nose hair and very slight beard trimming.</li>
            <li> Its a great simple product, and simple to clean too.</li>
            <li> does a great job its fast and sharp</li>
            <li> Other brands may or may not be better, but these can cost a lot more $$$.</li>
            <li> I only clean it every two weeks, and it&#x27;s relatively easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> Ok, more like a sharp pain and a realization to throw the battery</li>
            <li> Seems to burn through the battery pretty quickly though.</li>
            <li> GETS HOT QUICKLY.</li>
            <li> thing about cleaning is the way they want you to clean it using running water really isn&#x27;t the best and leaves alot of hair behind inside the chamber.</li>
            <li> Gets hot a bit too quick imo.</li>
            <li> I got the item quickly and it was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> but I get used to it pretty quick</li>
            <li> My son stole my first one, so I quickly ordered another one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty lightweight, so I&#x27;m not expecting it to outlive me, but the battery seems to hold a charge, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do quickly</li>
            <li> First, it consumed power too quickly.</li>
            <li> Trimming nose hair is pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but gets hot quickly.</li>
            <li> heats up pretty quickly</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> This one chews through a batter pretty quick.</li>
            <li> have been using for a few weeks now and it is very nice and virtually painless.</li>
            <li> Worked good at first, but then the tip made a noise, and now just makes a loud grinding sound and gets hot/doesn&#x27;t actually trim.</li>
            <li> I still use it since it works and don&#x27;t care enough to buy a new one, but to be honest I would pay more for a better product in the future.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is able to get deep up in my schnoz and clean the edges well.</li>
            <li> The cutters are to far off the surface of the skin to allow a clean smooth cut.</li>
            <li> used it the next day also, to clean up a lil bit more he had missed.</li>
            <li> The head comes off easily for cleaning and is easy to put back together.</li>
            <li> When you are able to discern from the manual how to remove the outer blade (which contains the inner blade) use the supplied cleaning brush to clean both off;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fact you can run it under the faucet to clean without taking it completely apart is a huge plus.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it seems like a decent trimmer at a good price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed the trimmer as stated by instructions and was pleasantly mortified by all the hair that washed down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> A really fine product, high quality, cuts well, but mine will not start unless I take off the end cover ant twist the battery.....</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean and dry.</li>
            <li> Works other wise.</li>
            <li> (it didn&#x27;t trim very well, and tended to \\&quot;pull out\\&quot; hairs; why Panasonic ever decided to discontinue the original trimmer is beyond me).</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try any other trimmers just because i find these ones good.</li>
            <li> This prodcut is not as good for me as the reviews indicate it is for other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do much other than look good on your counter.</li>
            <li> And very helpful and useful!</li>
            <li> So far it has been pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li> He had bought 2 other brands and neither did a good job of trimming.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is more sturdy and higher quality than my old Andis trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful.</li>
            <li> BTW, the batteries were still good as I put them in other devices.  </li>
            <li> the other features of this trimmer make it a good buy.</li>
            <li> , it makes it seem as though trimming other hairs would be good.  </li>
            <li> After 6 months of use, they&#x27;re doing a good job, and he hasn&#x27;t had any issues with them, other than to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> I have used other brands with good results but if i were to buy a nose trimmer again for any reason, i would buy this.</li>
            <li> price was fair , combo with other product for lower ship cost .</li>
            <li> I found out that this one works as good as the other one.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t come with some of the attachments other trimmers do, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good trimmer for unattractive hair in the nose</li>
            <li> Cuts clean with no pulling and no skin abrasion  and rinses clean with a little warm water after each use.</li>
            <li> Been having chest pains and ma right arms hurts.  </li>
            <li> and I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> It couldn&#x27;t have been from over-use because right after I purchases it, I bought a ladies one for myself to use.</li>
            <li> Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave right to the skin but for the hairs you are trimming you don&#x27;t notice at all.  </li>
            <li> BUT, with the GN30, Panasonic got it right.  </li>
            <li> You just have to get the right angle for each application.</li>
            <li> I was right on all three counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does the job right...</li>
            <li> right and arrived in two days.</li>
            <li> Put the battery in (battery not included), and this one fired right up.  </li>
            <li> and I took a chance on this one after reading the reviews and when the price was right ($14.99).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for awhile now; it works well and the price was right.  </li>
            <li> Works well ,priced right.</li>
            <li> Panasonic got this one right</li>
            <li> I guess that they were just waiting for the right time to pop out and greet the world.  </li>
            <li> When I got the trimmer I tried out right away.</li>
            <li> It was a snap right out of the box, and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> but it was hurting me and not working that right.  </li>
            <li> When it arrived we took it right out and set it up</li>
            <li> Price is right.  </li>
            <li> This product is right on target, has the twist head wash out.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Panasonic and it came right away.  </li>
            <li> Heard right.  </li>
            <li> Took a chance and ordered two because the price was right.  </li>
            <li> The hair has to be RIGHT on in order for it to be cut.</li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> After receiving the Panasonic, I used it right away.  </li>
            <li> Who in their right mind is reviewing nose hair trimmers these days anyway</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, the price is in the right range and</li>
            <li> The unit was inoperable right out of the packaging.</li>
            <li> and it goes right through them.</li>
            <li> The price was good, it runs on a single double A battery, and appears to be easy to clean.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great for ear, nose and that spot right between your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shakespeare was right.</li>
            <li> The price is right so there</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> The unicorn hair that grows right between my husband&#x27;s brows?  </li>
            <li> Have to hold it exactly right</li>
            <li> right.  </li>
            <li> Tapping it at the right angle and adjusting the battery seemed to help for a while</li>
            <li> and this is no hair in my nose right now.</li>
            <li> , i tryed it right away</li>
            <li> It kicks my nose right in the butt, eliminating nostril-vines like a machete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The price is right too.</li>
            <li> Right away, it chopped off hair in my nose and ears that had escaped my Conair for years.  </li>
            <li> The price is right and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> * right here gets all my nose hairs and it works on eye brows too</li>
            <li> Pros: it cuts well, and that&#x27;s what you want right?    </li>
            <li> and it was priced just right.</li>
            <li> I remember right</li>
            <li> Would give 5 stars, but after a year they seem to just break- which is right out of the warranty time zone.</li>
            <li> Received the item on time but did not work right out of the box.</li>
            <li> The price was right.  </li>
            <li> Just about right for the price</li>
            <li> Price is right for what it does.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex is just the right one to consider.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a GREAT trimmer (quiet, fast, accurate, sharp and cleans up easily) - until it SLIPS from your hand onto tile bathroom floor while you&#x27;re taking off the protective cap.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a shame because it performed great the first few times, but</li>
            <li> Worked great for first few months and then stopped running.</li>
            <li> am very happy so far with it, it takes no more than 2 minutes to remove every unwanted hair from my nose or ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first few times.  </li>
            <li> Had two in the past, but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Decently well-built for the cheap cost to me.</li>
            <li> Much easier to clean.</li>
            <li> The product do the job, I like the fact that you can clean it with water, very portable and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I had one like it many years ago and could not find one exactly like my old one until I found on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It will not remove your hair clean, but it trims very well.</li>
            <li> I had another shaver that did ok, but when I first used this on my nose hairs, I realizied what a piece of junk my old one was.  </li>
            <li> My older one had a led light but that is a feature I didn&#x27;t need or use.  </li>
            <li> It would have been nice to have an LED light on the end to see progress in the dark places.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and pain free if you go nice and slow.  </li>
            <li> It cleaned VERY well with the &#x27;turbo&#x27; clean feature.</li>
            <li> FAST BLADE CUTS CLEANLY AND THOROUGHLY.</li>
            <li> really convenient and make my hair clean.</li>
            <li> Or installing a bigger foam cone filter on a restrictive factory air intake on an e36 BMW M3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean fresh,  feeling of being able to feet a few more cubic feet of air per minute through the nose is worth more than the price of admission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> anything that can cut you that easy, can&#x27;t get more than 1 star, although it does work very well when it&#x27;s not slicing me open.</li>
            <li> It easy to handle, it rinses and cleans easily, and you can get it as wet as you want when you use or clean it.  </li>
            <li> On first use it&#x27;s really nice, quiet and it works.</li>
            <li> After reading a number of reviews about this trimmer, I was expecting a cheap, but decent product</li>
            <li> guess if you want something cheap and works decently for your nose hairs, this does the job.  </li>
            <li> Pretty quiet and effective.  </li>
            <li> When you do clean it, the running water make it very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Most</li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this is the first nose hair trimmer that has actually worked well.</li>
            <li> Very nice...durable...easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried to clean it yet, but works very well.</li>
            <li> This bugger is fast, cuts clean with no pulling.  </li>
            <li> Would be nice if there was an easy demarcation letting you know how far to place the blade back in.  </li>
            <li> This thing doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, it cuts fast and clean.</li>
            <li> Has a nice solid feel and it trims very well!  </li>
            <li> Far more superior than my previous one, would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great little product!</li>
            <li> For the price I think this is a great little trimmer!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a great little trimmer!</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer for the price!</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer!</li>
            <li> Great little gizmo for problems we don&#x27;t like to tallk about!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is much gentler on the inside of my nose than my last one and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and runs on only one AA battery.</li>
            <li> I think it is enough for you using is very easy and also cleaning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also very easy to keep which is a big plus</li>
            <li> This Panasonic trimmer cuts very easily and very short.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is very easy to use, but does include an instruction manual if you prefer specific details.  </li>
            <li> I finally broke down and decided to get this Panasonic and it works great!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light weight but made of high quality product.</li>
            <li> The design looks good and quality feels better compared  to previous trimmers, yet it still made in China and has feature that allows rinsing with soap and water which is neat as I don&#x27;t have to disassemble and clean occasionally</li>
            <li> It does its job quick easy to handle not heavy first time having one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s painless, trims nose hair closely &amp; completely and is a dream to clean!  </li>
            <li> Good for fine / tiny hair, I suppose, but that ain&#x27;t what you&#x27;re gonna find in the tender nostrils of the Northern Outdoors Male.</li>
            <li> This new unit is for wet use also, a great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Nick</li>
            <li> Excellent little groomer ... powerful and quiet.</li>
            <li> just would have liked the item to include a battery and charged a little more instead of buying a whole package of them.</li>
            <li> Works great at getting at those odd places where hair wants to grow, but you don&#x27;t want it to be there.</li>
            <li> smooth operation, no nicking, fairly quiet, easy to wash&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer is fairly quiet, easy to handle, and pain free.</li>
            <li> Its OK Ive found better in the stores for less money</li>
            <li> Works excellent wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Washing it is easy as well as well and taking it apart to wash the blade is even easier (you can really see how much hair it picks up when the blade is exposed).</li>
            <li> Removes hair fairly well after a few quick passes.</li>
            <li> If the tip hits a hard surface, it can bend the tip and that ultimately destroys the perfect fit of the rotary blades inside.</li>
            <li> You do have be careful when taking tool apart to clean it because the blades will bend very easily.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast, easy, painless, and does such a great job on my nose hairs, that I don&#x27;t have to worry about them for a long time between trimmings.  </li>
            <li> I like that it is very easy to keep clean and hasn&#x27;t had any damage from getting wet.</li>
            <li> I find it very easy to use and clean because it can get wet.</li>
            <li> I checked the (new) batery life and was fine.</li>
            <li> It has no broken, which is surprising since every single one out there has.</li>
            <li> And they say you rarely have to change the batteries - which makes sense since most people don&#x27;t use it for more than a few seconds every couple weeks or so</li>
            <li> It trims pretty well, and it was well worth the money paid for it.</li>
            <li> Does have some \\&quot;metallicky\\&quot; smell at first, but worth it to have one that works.</li>
            <li> I have bought several nose and ear hair trimmers and this is definitely the best one so far.  </li>
            <li> It does not make much noise and trims close and true.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t feel that I have full control and worry that i might trim off to much.  </li>
            <li> although it isn&#x27;t as slim and slick as some of the others, it definitely is a great buy.  </li>
            <li> Apparently none of these are meant to lSt more than 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have bought several different nose hair trimmers over the years, and will have to say this is the best one I have ever owned by far.</li>
            <li> but I got my money&#x27;s worth out of the first one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through several different types and brands of trimmers, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> In general, I have been pleased with the price/performance balance of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Pretty fast, pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li> Using this daily makes me a whole lot more comfortable and I look neater as well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is fast, quiet, powerful and effective.</li>
            <li> Big improvement over my old Norelco, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be much better</li>
            <li> I felt no pinching or pulling of my hair in any section of my face probably because it runs on one AA battery, either way completely pleased with no regrets of this purchase recommended for all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean if you read the instruction book - you just take apart the top few pieces.  </li>
            <li> MUCH NOT BAD</li>
            <li> this is not a cheap made idem, works very good, easy to clean, can get new blades, i can not say enough.</li>
            <li> It is a pretty powerful little tool and I have been pleasantly suprised at how well it takes care of nose hair and eyebrow hair</li>
            <li> Also very light but powerful enough to do the job.  </li>
            <li> Get your old self cleaned up right now!!</li>
            <li> To be fair, this cutter works but not nearly as well as my older one.  </li>
            <li> We both break it down and give it a good cleaning after each use.  </li>
            <li> Cleans easily and is pretty quiet if that is important to you.</li>
            <li> It feels a little cheap, but it was so kind of what I was expecting.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s excellent for nose hair, or those tiny little hairs you always manage to miss with the razor.</li>
            <li> If I sky-dived I would be more streamlined, and I can tell you that while I was not quite at the point of my nose and ear hair interfering with my meals, I do eat a little better knowing I am not threatened by hair growing willy-nilly all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Panasonic, on the other hand, works exceptionally well.  </li>
            <li> It does, however, get pretty hot, pretty quickly.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little too guarded, so it doesn&#x27;t cut as easily as our old one, but it definitely does the job at a good price!</li>
            <li> It does occasionally pull on some long hairs but is pain free for the most part and is much better than using tweezers.</li>
            <li> considering what it&#x27;s used for, and have a very heavy goatee that I shape with this, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It simple to use and knives inside very good, they cut hairs carefully.  </li>
            <li> Quite a pleasant experience using it, really, and it certainly feels firm and comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t think there is what I would call the cream of the crop in nose hair trimmers so maybe this one is better to people with more experience using other brands.  </li>
            <li> It has a very clean and strong motor in it and it is largely water/rustproof as long as you maintain it well.</li>
            <li> The unit is very easy to clean and still quite sharp.</li>
            <li> This new one is a huge improvement.  </li>
            <li> but I have to lightly bang it to get it to start even with a new battery.</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I replaced an older Panasonic that lasted for many years with this new one.  </li>
            <li> So chalking that up to my own fault, and promising myself to be more careful, I went ahead and ordered another new one.</li>
            <li> Recent purchase so haven&#x27;t tested it&#x27;s durability over time, but it has demonstrated itself as having the most power to cut my strong Italian nose hairs compared to cheap ones I&#x27;ve bought over the years.  </li>
            <li> I read so many bad reviews, but the price was great!  </li>
            <li> I have had a few of these before, but this one you can clean with water, and it&#x27;s been great so far.</li>
            <li> I really like how you can take it in the shower with you if you need to quickly trim those unsightly hairs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way more powerful than the last one I had.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and I like the larger barrel size for hand comfort and ease of use.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic trimmer is far superior for the same price.</li>
            <li> Every ear/ nose trimmer I have ever owned has just felt cheap (but how much technology do you need to trim the hairs out of your nose and ears, really?)</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s working strong, but I&#x27;ll update if that changes.</li>
            <li> I only gave it four stars comparing it to my mental image of what an ideal trimmer would be.</li>
            <li> Trims closely, easy to clean, quiet, no pulling.</li>
            <li> Very close, comfortable and fast trim.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as their previous models.</li>
            <li> I have had a few different brands, this is the best one.  </li>
            <li> It came super fast and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Overall its a great product that I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This worked great until it simply died after about 3 mos of occasional use.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, uses a AA battery which seems to last forever.  </li>
            <li> Gets rid of nose and ear hair in seconds, it&#x27;s fairly quiet, and it&#x27;s easy to clean...</li>
            <li> Is quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> After trying a few different brands and models, this is the best one around.</li>
            <li> So far so good, just as described and looks the same.</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the one I had previous to this, but serves it&#x27;s function</li>
            <li> It was great for a short while though, quiet with no hair pulling.</li>
            <li> We really like these and have ordered a second one so everyone has their own trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It seems more powerful than the earlier ones.</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate and simple to clean.</li>
            <li> Works great, although i have only tested it for a short period.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Shipping was insanely fast and got the product quickly.</li>
            <li> It actually gets all the hair in my ears and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through 4 of these, after a few months they stop working, I finally switched to another brand and have been very happy.</li>
            <li> Very silent and effective and also very confortable to use.</li>
            <li> it was quick and now all those fine hairs all over my face are gone with no rough stubble (like when using a razor, which I will never do</li>
            <li> Seems built well enough to get more than my moneys worth on a periodically used item.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for those of us that now have unwanted hair now growing out of many wrong places.</li>
            <li> Totally painless and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Simple to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m at 32 year old guy with straight hair.  </li>
            <li> Not too loud, easy on the batteries.</li>
            <li> It did a such a great job that I may only need to use it as often as I trim my hair.&lt;br /&gt;GUYS</li>
            <li> My husband uses it quite regularly for all of its functions (ears, nose, eyebrows, etc), and it is still working great and only now in 2014 did we have to change the battery.</li>
            <li> This works very well and quickly.  </li>
            <li> I just wish more companies could make a solid product like this that lasts and is economical.</li>
            <li> Much to my dismay, \\&quot;Brand X\\&quot; just never seemed to do an adequate job.....</li>
            <li> Have only used it a handful of times but have nothing to report in regards to cons about it, and it is extremely easy to clean with whatever method you choose.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old one, inexpensive and works really well.</li>
            <li> Delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li> Just a great all around product for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I never used it for more than 20-30 seconds, always cleaned it with a brush, kept it clean and dry.  </li>
            <li> Not as good as I had hoped from the previous reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this with the idea of having a quick and fast way of trimming my nose</li>
            <li> Easy enough to clean in spite of the rather verbose instruction sheet.</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for quick delivery.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, and simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I did not find it easy to determine how far to insert it for trimming nose hair, so caution is recommended.</li>
            <li> It works very well for nose and ear grooming, not so effective for facial hairs.</li>
            <li> I found it quiet, efficient and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Motor spins fast, does quick and efficient job.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is far superior to the tiny fingernail scissors I used to use to trim nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is relatively easy, the seal around the battery compartment has held so far, and the unit does its job.</li>
            <li> my husband liked this product so much he started using it not only for his nose hairs but for his eye brows.  </li>
            <li> easy to clean, one battery can last 6 months.  </li>
            <li> As the old joke goes, &amp;#34;I have as much hair as ever, but more of it is in my nose and ears.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean and ample instructions on different cleaning procedures.</li>
            <li> batteries go in the bottom and the hatch for them is fairly strong with no breakage problems so far.  </li>
            <li> Even with a rechargeable AA battery...it spins up super fast.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Noste, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer does as described and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So far the panasonic trimmer has been a painless and easy to use/maintain.</li>
            <li> It runs on 2 AA batteries, which are still going strong after nearly 6 months of periodic use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean, simple</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s very quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to open and clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use with clear instructions.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, effective, and gentle on even the nose hairs.</li>
            <li> It works so much better than our old one (which died), and the price was reasonable, too.  </li>
            <li> Very quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean, neat and quiet operation.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good for average size nostrils.</li>
            <li> It does the job, not a lot of noticeable difference between it and a cheaper trimmer, except the build seems solid and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> good stuff as I expected, thanks to seller</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well and has a nice solid feel to it.</li>
            <li> great little machine, sure  beats scissors, should&#x27;ve bought it long ago</li>
            <li> The speed is high, cutting ability is excellent, and comfort is top notch.</li>
            <li> It does get quite warm during use and I turn it off to cool down if I am not finished yet.</li>
            <li> I have had this one several months and the original battery is still fine.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my first use, then I went to tap it on the sink to get the loose hairs out, and the top fell apart and the blade went down</li>
            <li> It was great for the first 3 months (only used it occasionally during that time).  </li>
            <li> Liked it so much, I got my significant other one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty quiet and easy to clean too.  </li>
            <li> first initial reaction when I had unboxed this, was this thing was light and felt cheap.  </li>
            <li> So I went back in, closer to the sides of the nostril this time, and cleaned out as many more hairs as I could bare.</li>
            <li> It works good, but its not durable I dropped and broke my first one with less than a 1ft drop.  </li>
            <li> It can run hot quickly at the stainless steel tip if you have it in the water mode and aren&#x27;t contacting water.</li>
            <li> Big beefy men with large hands may find this trimmer a bit light and small, but it works beautifully!</li>
            <li> Moreover, the price is very reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Trims very fast.</li>
            <li> I thought the price was very reasonable, too.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t consume battery very much.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this product very much.  </li>
            <li> Got it very fast.</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast and the product does work as advertised, I would purchase again...</li>
            <li> The price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I very much like this nose/ear hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much and I recommend this appliance.</li>
            <li> I do recommend it very much.</li>
            <li> you very much</li>
            <li> This device goes downhill very fast.</li>
            <li> I like it very much.</li>
            <li> still on the process of getting used to it and becoming more comfortable of the idea.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll probably won&#x27;t use it as often as a shaver, so the battery juice last a long time</li>
            <li> Does the job at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> After being such a skeptic, I decided to give this one a try simply for the low price and the many great reviews others have posted.</li>
            <li> The mechanism runs very smooth and quiet.  </li>
            <li> it does not spin very fast, but the blades are well made, they cut efficiently.</li>
            <li> Price was very reasonable too.</li>
            <li> These are actually very reasonable priced</li>
            <li> something like the Panasonic ER421, and it just didn&#x27;t want to spin up very fast...</li>
            <li> Very smooth and quiet.  </li>
            <li> But it doesn&#x27;t seem to turn very fast.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> So far it works as expected and is a very handy item.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and quiet operation.</li>
            <li> I have developed more nose hairs after 40 years old than I really felt comfortable</li>
            <li> Nice little trimmer, works well and gives a clean close nostril shave.</li>
            <li> Okay, so &#x27;take&#x27; off the protective shell blade covering and note that the insertable dimensions are VERY large for a regular nose...</li>
            <li> Plus, when it trims the hair, it makes a really satisfying &amp;#34;snap.&amp;#34; I like to think that this sound is putting all of the other stray hairs on notice.</li>
            <li> This thing is way better than other cheap ones.</li>
            <li> Had an old Panasonic nose trimmer which after years of fine service - gave out.</li>
            <li> Have tried multiple trimmers before but the reach and ability to get stubborn hairs that dont get caught by other trimmers is incredible.</li>
            <li> Working fine for 6 months, and so far no complaints.</li>
            <li> Product working fine so far.</li>
            <li> Much better than other cheap trimmers I have bought.  </li>
            <li> So far, this item is working just fine.</li>
            <li> The whole combination has made me really self-conscious about my face in general, especially because the hairs would show more when I smiled.</li>
            <li> then this is a fine way to clear them away.</li>
            <li> Works fine so far.</li>
            <li> trimmers are light weight plastic on the outside, I had originally thought from the image that the silver part may be made out of metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really a good product much better than my previous facial hair trimmer!</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is just because my old hair trimmer was crummy, but this one is SUPER!  </li>
            <li> I wish it were a little more powerful, but otherwise it is fine.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how this item got so many great reviews, there is nothing great about it, it takes time to remove the hair, after many attempts it still leaves hair behind, had to use scissors to trim my nose after using it because it did such a poor job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little surprising at first-then you get used to the vibrations.  </li>
            <li> It works very well-the first trimmer I&#x27;ve seen that does!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s efficient and gentle and gets the job done;) get it today!</li>
            <li> It takes a little bit of effort but does a fair job.  </li>
            <li> My husband laughed at me when I gave him this little trimmer</li>
            <li> Works well , good little trimmer for ear and nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I tried them I noticed that they seemed to warm up quickly, perhaps from being previously used by my husband.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and quick, I use it several times a week after shaving.</li>
            <li> Since the trimmer is my own, no sharing, I clean it with a few swipes of my blow dryer and a cotton swab with alcohol.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy, quiet and quick.</li>
            <li> I have had it for approximately one year, and it is still working very good.</li>
            <li> Much more effective than ear and nose trimmers I have tried in the past, including older Panasonic models.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m not good at cleaning things, so I was happy that I didn&#x27;t have to clean it very often.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K trims those hard to get to ear and nose hairs great.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but this is so much more effective than my older Conair.</li>
            <li> great product gets those hard to get areas</li>
            <li> For the price, this little hair trimmer does a pretty good job.  </li>
            <li> Works great in hard to get to places in your nose.  </li>
            <li> Quick and safe, has never pulled a single hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Well this little guy is light, quite, and fairly easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Not fun to clean, but it is really easy!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is super quiet and works great to trim nose, ear and other hairs that you just don&#x27;t want.  </li>
            <li> before i had to use scissors and it was hard to reach all the hairs.this trimmer is magic and easy to clean with water rinse</li>
            <li> Several of the more popular (read advertised) nose and facial hair trimmers did not receive the high marks this one did.</li>
            <li> my new panasonic cuts hairs cleanly, without \\&quot;grabbing.\\</li>
            <li> the real test is how well it&#x27;s performing in a couple of years!  </li>
            <li> Here&#x27;s hoping it holds out better than the last Remington I bought at Target!!</li>
            <li> This Panasonic trimmer is much better than a Panasonic trimmer we ordered from Amazon last year  (Model #ER430).  </li>
            <li> Who knows what I did with the first one, but I digress).  </li>
            <li> We have tried several trimmers mostly for, eh, his nose hair.  </li>
            <li> Works well, long battery life, and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It eats batteries, the blades seem &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; even on first time use, etc.</li>
            <li> Exactly works as advertised</li>
            <li> The nose trim took 2 minutes and was absolutely painless!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t seem to find a logical reason why it turns on if you wiggle the battery around.</li>
            <li> Cons: Gets hot after about 20 seconds of operation.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t bring myself to rate it higher because I resent its necessity.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t comment on longevity, but quite pleased with overall quality.</li>
            <li> It is not expensive and serves the purpose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used scissors from time to time, but this makes life so much easier!</li>
            <li> Thanks panasonic!</li>
            <li> Works exactly how described.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, Recommend!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what he needed.  </li>
            <li> Really efficient product!</li>
            <li> I have used this for a year now and it still works like a charm and does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  </li>
            <li> My first nose hair trimmer had scarred me for life, because every time I tried to use it, I felt like I was being tortured.</li>
            <li> The first one stopped working after about a year.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this and the first time I went to use it</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer does exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> I use to have a different brand one, I believe it was Braun and this one is significantly better.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> For nose hairs,change the batteries at even the slightest hint of loss of power (a lower pitched &amp;#34;hum&amp;#34;) because if you don&#x27;t, the blade will pull, instead of cut, the hair.</li>
            <li> First class unit.</li>
            <li> Does EXACTLY what is needed.  </li>
            <li> made to last for many years of service.  </li>
            <li> This thing works okay, but for some reason it just feels and sounds fragile.</li>
            <li> This one is more solid.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Decently quiet, no snagging (important!).</li>
            <li> Like most men, I have used several nose-hair trimmers over the years.</li>
            <li> Much better than the last generation.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have an electric trimmer</li>
            <li> The difference is visible from the first time I used it upon its arrival.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience owning an electric Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many nose hair trimmers and this one definitely is the sturdiest.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer trims safely from various angles, even head on.</li>
            <li> Instead of trying to tap or scrape out the hairs, you just open up the top and rinse everything out.  </li>
            <li> Bot were cheaply made and both broke near the blade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> if no for the performance is because if I turn it off but leave the battery on it gets hot I&#x27;dk</li>
            <li> This is a must have for any guy who wants to keep their ear, nose, and brows in check!</li>
            <li> I tried multiple batteries and was able to play with the switch and got it running again for another 10 -15 seconds</li>
            <li> Stopped working after the first time I washed it.</li>
            <li> This is the most quiet trimmer I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> I would give this trimmer more then 5 stars if it were possible to do so.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t complain don&#x27;t rush using it the first time you can get razor burn in your nose.</li>
            <li> It runs hot if used longer than a minute.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that it would pull the hair more then trim, but that&#x27;s definitely not the case.  </li>
            <li> Blades wear out, start to get hot and make a lot of noise..</li>
            <li> Had to reorder this because the first package was lost.</li>
            <li> exactly do I review this\\&quot; type of item.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> First time buyer.</li>
            <li> Eventual started to pull more than it would cut &amp; finally stopped working all together.</li>
            <li> Purchased a multi-tool Panasonic trimmer from Costco for 4x the price of this just to get the same functionality, thinking it&#x27;ll be better.</li>
            <li> This one gives equal or better performance without any struggle.</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my Audiologist.  </li>
            <li> It is about okay product compared to my last Panasonic product, which has more details (larger trench on the head tip)</li>
            <li> Glad I finally took the step.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anytime I come across an item that I absolutely love, I buy an extra one and stick in a box at home.</li>
            <li> Quiet, light, and thorough!  </li>
            <li> get a bit hot.</li>
            <li> Makes my wife happy that I am at least somewhat groomed.</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I have finally been able to get my nose hair under control.</li>
            <li> Second one worked much better.</li>
            <li> pretty well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to stop wasting my money on those super-cheap nose hair trimmers that fall apart.</li>
            <li> This thing is sturdy, reliable and offers fantastic battery life.</li>
            <li> He said the action of the blades was smooth, the cut close, and the clean-up</li>
            <li> Works like most ten dollars trimmers</li>
            <li> Makes you sneeze the first couple of times.</li>
            <li> It doesnt pull your hair or anything and doesnt get hot.</li>
            <li> So I bought three more for the next decade.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three of these since first time.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty self explanatory.</li>
            <li> it does exactly what the product description says it will do.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but perfect for nose</li>
            <li> It runs off batteries so be aware of when you need to change them.</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift to a friend and at first they were offended, but then they got over it,</li>
            <li> Just used this for first time on nose.&lt;br /&gt;No pinching.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  </li>
            <li> (My first one was dropped on the floor tip first and broke it)&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> Completely pain free.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and the product is a lot better at removing nose hair than the final touch hair remover.</li>
            <li> He has had several, but this is the first one that compares to the first one he had which was his favorite.</li>
            <li> My last trimmer was manual and it was okay, but I dropped it once</li>
            <li> My only worry was that a trimmer would yank/pull hairs out of my nose, but I am glad to say that there is no pulling, and there is no yanking of hairs.  </li>
            <li> Inexpensive, and does exactly what you need it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for five months now (maybe used it 6-7 times) and am just about to change the batteries for the first time.  </li>
            <li> I am really satisfied with the product quality as well as overall operation.</li>
            <li> exactly what i needed for.</li>
            <li> I have a very hairy nose!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to.</li>
            <li> It gets hot some reason.</li>
            <li> It functioned correctly during the first use, but will no longer operate.</li>
            <li> It gets all ear and nose hair the first time and painlessly.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a trimmer</li>
            <li> I read the directions and configured properly, but I wasn&#x27;t able to get the product to work.  </li>
            <li> My first nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Pretty format.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave any hairs in your nose or ears, and it cleans up very well!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has now been exactly 2 months since I submitted my contact information to Panasonic for warranty service.  </li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more romantic than when your partner looks longingly at you and says, &amp;#34;can I pull that nose hair?&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer</li>
            <li> Stopped working after the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at first.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> Does the job really well!</li>
            <li> Learn how to remove the blades or replace them, I accidentally dropped this on the first day and</li>
            <li> Exactly what the marketing promised.</li>
            <li> The thing that makes this trimmer better that the rest is that it actually cuts on the end and not just on the sides.</li>
            <li> First time I use one of these and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> feel like it&#x27;s lost a bit of power / sharpness since I first bought it</li>
            <li> It trims the hairs in my nose, ears &amp; eyebrows very well!</li>
            <li> This is my first experience owning an electric nose hair trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will update that score if more use results in different information.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want it to do and trims the nose hairs well.  </li>
            <li> No pain and really works!</li>
            <li> Overall, it seems to be more efficient.  </li>
            <li> i bought two of them, and dropped one on the floor the first week.</li>
            <li> It works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars instead of 1 only because there seems to be nothing else on the market that works any better.</li>
            <li> I rate it better than the Sharper Image product for several reasons:  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, the battery seems to last forever, and it does a nice job of trimming all those sensitive facial areas.</li>
            <li> First Unit -</li>
            <li> Also, has a feature to use while wet, which is pretty handy for grooming and cleaning.</li>
            <li> That first one lasted me almost a year before stopping.</li>
            <li> and it performs very well!  </li>
            <li> This works much better than any similar trimmer I have tried.</li>
            <li> If somehow it dies I will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> It might be solved by higher rim or sharper blades.</li>
            <li> You should know more about what you are doing than to ask questions of persons who simply purchase goods.</li>
            <li> Matches the picture/description exactly.</li>
            <li> It makes me feel like it is really getting the job done!</li>
            <li> one side, I&#x27;m no fool) because the damn metal gets way too hot.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not that interested in going through that $%^# again.</li>
            <li> Be sure to pick up an extra just in case</li>
            <li> When I remove the top cover and the blade, it spins well and vigorously, but as soon as I put the pieces back in place it gets stuck when I try to use it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to keep it because it ultimately gets the job done and none of the others get better reviews, but it&#x27;s not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thank you people that create the so advanced algorithms that create search results for \\&quot;gifts for 50 year old women\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD BE THE SECOND!!!!!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> I am glad they were still making the same one.</li>
            <li> On top of that Panasonic &#x27;guaranteed&#x27; mea &#x27;similar&#x27; item as replacement or a &#x27;refurbished&#x27; one.</li>
            <li> and this is the first one to consistently work well.</li>
            <li> first one, I made the mistake of knocking over, from the basin edge into the basin where it landed on the silver tip.</li>
            <li> if he&#x27;s willing to use it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still on the first battery.  </li>
            <li> device seems to clean easily and lasts a long time before needing to change batteries.</li>
            <li> Yep, that&#x27;s exactly what this product is.</li>
            <li> Will rip out hairs and gets too hot for my liking.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> The first was a Panasonic as well, but a cheaper model.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> The batteries need to be changed very often, but it&#x27;s still going!</li>
            <li> Need to work more with it to see how does it last!</li>
            <li> first nose trimmer</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if there is better but its better than using a blade</li>
            <li> newer one by Norelco with a different design works much better.</li>
            <li> Probably should rinse this before using it otherwise it smells like oil/lubrication during first use.</li>
            <li> (&amp;#34;Follicles&amp;#34; is surely one of the ickier words in the English language!)</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> I have tried several units and most just don&#x27;t perform that well.  </li>
            <li> Over the years I have gone through a lot of trimmers, they typically don&#x27;t last too many years.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I just twist open the top and rinse out the blades that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Stopped working the first time I used it - changed battery - still didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well.  </li>
            <li> The device itself calls for a specialized AA battery, but I was able to get it to work with a regular Duracell.  </li>
            <li> but it should last more than 5 months.</li>
            <li> but it is pretty painless.</li>
            <li> For years men have been willing to show off their Nose Hair Anemones.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer helps pull men one more step up the evolutionary ladder by painlessly chopping up our unruly sniffer</li>
            <li> /&gt;And for those who think that manscaping the facial caverns might squelch your BroPowers, ask yourselves what could be more manly than sticking a power-tool up your nose?  </li>
            <li> My first one just wore out after 7 years.  </li>
            <li> Tried many types but finally got the one that does the job</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve had that did not.</li>
            <li> This trimmer seems ok, after several weeks of use.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> It gets pretty hot after about a minute.  </li>
            <li> Works well and does exactly what it is intended to do.  </li>
            <li> The first one broke with 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> It started making a loud buzzing sound and it wouldn&#x27;t cut anymore.</li>
            <li> panasonic website lists the replacement blades at a higher cost than the amazon price for the trimmer.</li>
            <li> We never realized how much hair we had until it was gone!</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Replaced the battery and the same problem occurred after about eight more uses.  </li>
            <li> my Panasonic ER-GN30 and hair starts wishing it never grew in the first place.</li>
            <li> Works very well indeed!</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it should do and leave my nose hairless</li>
            <li> The first thing I said to this thing when I took it out of the box was &amp;</li>
            <li> It Really Does Work, and close too!  </li>
            <li> This is the first to truly work without using a razor with the cutter on it</li>
            <li> It broke first use.</li>
            <li> However, the first one that I bought did not work out of the box.</li>
            <li> is really what you would want the trimmer to do!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve Used it to trim nose and ear hairs for the first time.</li>
            <li> but it worked really well!</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer</li>
            <li> As with first, it worked for about 1 month and then stopped.  </li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> This works exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> the blade outside the device, turn the device on and make sure it makes noise/</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> First trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li> Pretty quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li> The first unit I ordered worked for a month or two, and then started draining batteries.</li>
            <li> It was really more of a joke, but he actually likes it and it works really well!</li>
            <li> works exactly as described,  </li>
            <li> Not like oven hot, or surface of the sun hot, or even pop-tart filling hot.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Simply put, it works well for exactly what it says it will do.  </li>
            <li> I also like that it comes complete with a cleaning brush and detailed information on washing the blades when needed.  </li>
            <li> I had a different brand that had much more power.</li>
            <li> I did drop the first one I bought in the sink after about a year, oops</li>
            <li> I just rinse in hot water after each use.</li>
            <li> The first one lasted years and didn&#x27;t cause any problems.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Nose, Ear and Facial hair trimmer performed greater than my expectations.  </li>
            <li> so I guess it will last more time.</li>
            <li> Should have bought it the first time.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!</li>
            <li> I will be buying another one when i wear the blades out on this one in several more years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many and none of them belong in the same category as this product.  </li>
            <li> This is my first nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li> After I received it, I realized that I had an exact duplicate which I thought didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric trimmer I bought and</li>
            <li> I will replace it with a different make, see if that does any better.</li>
            <li> the motor doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power (even with fresh batteries), so it can take a while to get the job done, but</li>
            <li> i used it once, when i first got it, then my nose hair got stuck in the cutters, i panic,</li>
            <li> You may know be well aware of this</li>
            <li> So last week i bought 2 more.</li>
            <li> So when you buy similar products, make sure you buy from known brand from quality perspective like Panasonic in this case.</li>
            <li> but I picked up a different brand at Target that worked much better</li>
            <li> I love how this is cleaned out by water and uses a regular battery (I use a rechargeable).</li>
            <li> Works way better than the interchangeable attachments I&#x27;ve used on various beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> To my surprise it was just an example of just how far the technology had advanced.</li>
            <li> your experience with the Panasonic ER-GN30 nose hair trimmer is as stellar as mine.</li>
            <li> This does the job, but my first one died after about 18 months.</li>
            <li> Tickles a bit when I first used it</li>
            <li> This is the first one I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> At first I thought replacing the battery...</li>
            <li> This thing does exactly what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Make sure you either have a double a battery or can get one before you plan on using</li>
            <li> I have used several Panasonic trimmers before, and no one works better than this one.</li>
            <li> You better believe I&#x27;ll ask for my money back as well.</li>
            <li> Probably more often than anyone would possibly need to have their nose hair removed.</li>
            <li> Fast and efficient!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive&lt;br</li>
            <li> OK, even talking about nose and ear hair is gross, but I have both and don&#x27;t like to be seen with it sprouting out everywhere.</li>
            <li> Completely satisfied and would totally recommend!</li>
            <li> my first ever of these.</li>
            <li> need to replaced the first Panasonic trimmer</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I hoped it would be.</li>
            <li> He actually said, &amp;#34;I love this.  </li>
            <li> My boyfriend has a beard, as most guys these days do and needed a facial hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and he was enjoying using it every week with the various attachments it came with.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have given a higher rating if it had lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Cuts smoothly without any problems so far.</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer of this type.  </li>
            <li> The battery life is much better than similar models.</li>
            <li> Well designed and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do with no pain.</li>
            <li> First one I bought</li>
            <li> results, after using on nose and ears, are exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit larger than others, which I had hoped would translate to better quality and durability...</li>
            <li> trimmer does exactly that.</li>
            <li> I really like this gaget!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I need it to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had philips bodygroomers in the past and this one is no different, meaning it works PERFECT, no irritation,</li>
            <li> Otherwise it trims pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> 2 stars because at first, it kicked ass</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Works fast and does not hurt!.</li>
            <li> Thanks, Panasonic!</li>
            <li> , if I miss anything shaving, it gets that really close to the skin too!  </li>
            <li> ;-)  </li>
            <li> Does exactly what you want.</li>
            <li> Completely pain free.  </li>
            <li> purchased for my husband, he said this is the first trimmer that didnt yank out the nose hair</li>
            <li> Works slightly better than earlier models.</li>
            <li> Funny</li>
            <li> Works pretty well as a nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li> The latest one, the ER-GN30, was bought only four months ago.</li>
            <li> I am going to be spending a bit more on a different product.</li>
            <li> Does have a bit of a funny chemical smell, maybe the lubricant in the motor?</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a nose hair trimmer and was worried that it would hurt by pulling/pinching hairs.</li>
            <li> When the top was put back on it would not spin.  </li>
            <li> I didn’t see any spring in the first trimmer I owned</li>
            <li> Seem to work really well too!</li>
            <li> When I washed it for the first time, the spinning blade part fell out into the sink.</li>
            <li> its the first time i have bought something like this.  </li>
            <li> ill stay optimistic and say its the best trimmer</li>
            <li> First time I used it, it worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I was only able to use it twice before it quit working.</li>
            <li> I have used  a different brand that worked better.</li>
            <li> Much better than a Conair brand I had a while back.  </li>
            <li> First I thought it was the battery, but it&#x27;s the design.</li>
            <li> At first I thought replacing the battery...</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it too long, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> Only downside is he has to do it more often.</li>
            <li> This works very well!..</li>
            <li> but it seems to be made pretty well</li>
            <li> Does exactly as it says.</li>
            <li> First of all, I am not one of those Vine writers.</li>
            <li> This thing rips through my nasal hairs like a black-robed villain&#x27;s light saber through a young Jedi&#x27;s forearm.</li>
            <li> He absolutely loves it!</li>
            <li> The first time he used it he said it actually helped him breathe better.</li>
            <li> it should last 2-4 years or more.</li>
            <li> I have switched out the battery more time than i think is necessary</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this device does exactly what you want.  </li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> My first nose hair trimmer was one of these:</li>
            <li> And on top of that is runs fairly quietly!  </li>
            <li> This item wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had in mind; it turns out I think I might need something stronger.</li>
            <li> Worked well, at first.</li>
            <li> A $10 confidence boost is pretty sweet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also very simple and safe to use.  </li>
            <li> Bought one for myself not to long ago, liked it so much bought this one for my son.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> THe most recent time i picked it up</li>
            <li> Glad I finally bought one.</li>
            <li> ;) its just me.</li>
            <li> It might like the slightly higher voltage of an alkaline battery, but I&#x27;ll never buy one of those again.</li>
            <li> The first was rotary and it worked but not all that efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> Several people thought I was snorting the magic dust.</li>
            <li> He really likes it!  </li>
            <li> Its well made and it does exactly what you want it to do.  </li>
            <li> Not really too effective for getting those stubborn ear hairs.  </li>
            <li> This Panasonic GN30 nose hair trimmer was gifted to me ~7 months ago, and since then I&#x27;ve had no problems with it whatsoever; it&#x27;s built simply yet sturdily</li>
            <li> It works great and the battery last a long time.</li>
            <li> but this thing works pretty well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for those interested.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see how long the battery lasts, but this is a well built product that is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> They all seem to give out pretty soon.  </li>
            <li> This is what you need for doing exactly what you think.</li>
            <li> I put the battery in for the first use and the on/off switch does not work.</li>
            <li> Does the job fast and without pulling any hairs!</li>
            <li> For the price you absolutely cannot beat this trimmer!</li>
            <li> My old one would cut my skin and this is a fantastic product.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is wash the blade and the top guard before you use it, with water</li>
            <li> This is the first one to work consistently.</li>
            <li> The product is exactly I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several of these devices over the years and mostly by Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> They all worked okay, but I found I had to go over and over the same areas to get all the hair</li>
            <li> first time using this model</li>
            <li> Fast, powerful, and no pulling.  </li>
            <li> After about 5 minutes of different directions and patterns, i was able to get 95% of my nose hairs</li>
            <li> the  Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer does an okay job but not as thorough as I would like.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this type of item, so take this review with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing you have to be aware of is that you have to make sure</li>
            <li> Obviously the blade had trimmed more than just the hairs in there.</li>
            <li> So hot</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll update as soon as I find a better durable unit which actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Third, my cheapo one does better even though it sometimes pulls and sounds noisy.  </li>
            <li> I love this one compared to another I had purchased at a local store.  </li>
            <li> In the future, I would spend more money for something similar, but better construction quality.</li>
            <li> him about it! ;-)</li>
            <li> This is the first electric nose trimmer I had ever tried.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it quite well.  </li>
            <li> First time I ever buy\use one of these gadgets</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really likes it!</li>
            <li> Had many different models over the years.  </li>
            <li> This is the first time I have used something like thisl</li>
            <li> I was finally able to saw it open with a hacksaw.</li>
            <li> This product works really well!</li>
            <li> So work fast!</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly what it says.  </li>
            <li> This one is quiet, smooth, and not painful.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - gets rid of unwanted nose</li>
            <li> This is my first nose trimmer</li>
            <li> /&gt;After my first use.</li>
            <li> Died after first battery change...</li>
            <li> Overall does the job though, and much better than the no-name brand one that came with my travel kit.</li>
            <li> I found this trimmer to be just short of okay.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Conair purchased at our local pharmacy.</li>
            <li> So, overall, I am satisfied</li>
            <li> Did exactly what its supposed to.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works much better than the last one I had....</li>
            <li> Feels a bit funny when using it the first time</li>
            <li> Works very well, no pinching!  </li>
            <li> Love this Panasonic Nose and Facial Trimmer!</li>
            <li> It doesnt get hot.</li>
            <li> This is the same looking model that I seen in so many advertisements and reviews.</li>
            <li> This was my first nose trimmer I purchased and</li>
            <li> My son took the first one.</li>
            <li> The only part that is ok is that I guess I can afford the loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So perhaps if I just use them for touch ups they won&#x27;t get as hot.  </li>
            <li> It does exactly what it claims to do.  </li>
            <li> , i gifted it to my father in India so could not even send it back</li>
            <li> Works pretty well over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When it does work for the first 10 seconds, it pulls rather than cuts hair.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and was expecting from the reviews.  </li>
            <li> I recently purchased a $10.00 Wahl micro trimmer from the grocery store to replace this Panasonic trimmer and the Wahl trimmer is 10 times better.</li>
            <li> Your first trimming session will probably be longer than it needs to be, until you see how efficient this weed whacker is.  </li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thankfully it is most definitely a keeper!  </li>
            <li> Have nothing to compare this with as this is the first trimmer that I have ever bought</li>
            <li> Yes, I followed the instructions exactly:</li>
            <li> when i first got it didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Sure, scissors can do the same</li>
            <li> sure can only be rivaled to childbirth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Yes, I totally recommend it :)</li>
            <li> It does its job very well!</li>
            <li> The first time I ordered it, the rest of my order came in but this product didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> You cannot find a better trimmer that is as efficient, quiet &amp;amp; gets the job done than this one!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> only wish I could find one that cuts even better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Service was fast too!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a trimmer</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I have pretty bodacious nose hair, but that&#x27;s why I need this tool in the first</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed.</li>
            <li> Over all it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> Sometimes after I smack it against my hand several times it will start or if I take the top off it will start</li>
            <li> Goods as described, fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Silent, smooth, and does not hurt!  </li>
            <li> Still on first battery.  </li>
            <li> most likely purchase one for all my family members for Xmas.</li>
            <li> My first nose hair trimmer, works great.&lt;br /&gt;Does</li>
            <li> 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned MUST be something better out there</li>
            <li> I just received this product and tried it for the first time.</li>
            <li> And the trimmer went through it all like a hot knife through butter.  </li>
            <li> crisp trimming of nostril hair.</li>
            <li> It was exactly as described.  </li>
            <li> The first machine I received was defective.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Following is the experience I had with the first machine I ordered.  </li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.  </li>
            <li> In fact in over a month of use I can only think of one time a hair got yanked out by this trimmer, an outstanding track record.  </li>
            <li> That said, it is clear that even if this trimmer does lose it&#x27;s edge, it will still have lasted longer by far than it&#x27;s cheaper brethren and in the meantime I would have had a far superior trimming experience.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> seems built fairly cheap but has held up well so far.</li>
            <li> I first time they swelled, the glands were so tender, I didn&#x27;t want to touch my neck.</li>
            <li> It was also unclear from the directions, exactly how one is supposed to hold it, in order to trim nose hair.  </li>
            <li> and this one has worked pretty well since we got it.</li>
            <li> Good batteries don&#x27;t go dead after 5 minutes of usage.</li>
            <li> So far so good - hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> It does a good job, but still has trouble with those \\&quot;tricky\\&quot; hairs.</li>
            <li> Some have cost me more, but no other is as effective and pain less.</li>
            <li> It has a strong little motor that puts out more rpms.  </li>
            <li> got it last year just after Black Friday for a very good price...</li>
            <li> Though I love the trimmer, it is certainly not meant to replace a true beard and mustache trimmer.</li>
            <li> and they all gave super high praise for this.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works effectively, easy to clean, small and lightweight.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, small to store.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic vacuum trimmer is 10x better.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t too loud and is very powerful.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise it worked great and in half the time as my old trimmers.  </li>
            <li> this is even less than many cheap plastic toys.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just design psychology, but the slightly bent body seems to fit my hand better and make trimming accuracy easier.</li>
            <li> I think using it as a facial hair trimmer as it is advertised would be less than ideal.</li>
            <li> So far it works really well and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, requires common batteries, and is effective.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is comfortable, quiet, and does an adequate job.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have a 10 year old previous model which has worked great.  </li>
            <li> You might have to go over an area a few times to get everything, but this thing is super nice for the price.</li>
            <li> Quiet, painless, and more effective than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works great and no more fuzz!</li>
            <li> I have used several other trimmers - this one is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;I might even start carving some cool new hairdos in my nostrils.</li>
            <li> other day I noticed all the fine hair on the sides of my face (if I were a man I would probably have a full beard!).</li>
            <li> a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a single battery, the humbly ubiquitous AA, and I must say that it&#x27;s a great value!</li>
            <li> But because there are so many positive reviews, took my chances and ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> With so many positive reviews, I hoped this would actually work reliably.</li>
            <li> A great buy and the cutting technology cuts quickly and easily.</li>
            <li> As most have stated on all these type of trimmers, a AA battery powered device will be kind of weak, but they do get the job done.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is way better made and better functioning than the cheap eBay nose trimmer I was using, which only cut well in the first few uses.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s held up pretty well on the original battery.  </li>
            <li> Its so easy, quick and fast to trim it actually doesnt feel like a chore anymore!  </li>
            <li> The trimmer feels gentle, its easy to hold, and its super quiet.</li>
            <li> It is just not sharp or powerful enough to cut through those kind of hairs.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, for my husband who has had a stroke, and has the use of only his right hand.</li>
            <li> wanted something cheap to put in my suitcase to take on trips that I wouldn&#x27;t care as much if tsa stole.&lt;br /&gt;Works great just don&#x27;t forget to put in new battery before leaving for trip if last trip it was starting to get weak, but that&#x27;s what Siri is for :P</li>
            <li> Panny cuts clean and clear on first attempt.</li>
            <li> It has been working fine a few months since purchased, and I was satisfied.</li>
            <li> Do not jam it in you nose looking for positive results or you will get your first scorpion bite followed by some tears.</li>
            <li> Its been a great little trimmer so far.  </li>
            <li> in all, it&#x27;s a comfortable and quality trim that I wish was a little more reliable.</li>
            <li> First nose trimmer I have purchased works as expected, easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> The first time you take the cap and blade apart, it will never be as quiet again, the blade does make some fair amount of noise, but not enough to bother/affect your hearing, imo.  </li>
            <li> a nose trimmer this thing works a lot better than the flat bladed ones.  </li>
            <li> OK, it sort of looks like a sleek dildo at first, but it is really a quite practical and necessary grooming aide!.</li>
            <li> Does not pull hair out, its nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> The rinse out feature seems to work and is a nice addition over other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> we t on Amazon to see what other people liked.</li>
            <li> Sooo much better than the flat blade style trimmers.  </li>
            <li> This little guy does the job nicely if you take your time and have a fresh battery.  </li>
            <li> This little shaver gits all the hairs real dang good</li>
            <li> packaging was super straightforward to open.</li>
            <li> Great for those hard to reach nose hairs, it really does the trick</li>
            <li> I would find it hard to believe spending more would yield anything better.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply just excellent for trimming nose, ear and hard to reach hairs.  </li>
            <li> Contrary to other devices of this kind, it has a powerful, smooth running and quiet motor.</li>
            <li> The girls especially enjoy using my new trimmer to initial their name into my back hair!</li>
            <li> But seriously it works great</li>
            <li> Keep the blade clean and clear, rinse often.  </li>
            <li> Great wet rinse that cleans all hair left from the brush.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Worked great, here&#x27;s a serious word of caution though...</li>
            <li> I have generally been very pleased with Panasonic personal care products.  </li>
            <li> Confidence the trimmer is clean when the flow-through runs clear.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean works as expected</li>
            <li> Cuts hairs cleanly without pulling, so far.</li>
            <li> This one is compact and by far the easiest to keep clean.  </li>
            <li> My old unit that it replaced you had to take it apart to clean.</li>
            <li> I would clean out the old Panasonic unit with a moistened Q-tip</li>
            <li> Nothing to dislike about it, comes apart easily to clean and has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> I appreciate both the ease of use, and the clean, professional look it gives my</li>
            <li> /no pain, I did give it 4/stars because you can not disassemble/remove spinning blade part to really clean it like my old Wahl nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This thing is really unbalanced (top heavy) and easy to knockover.</li>
            <li> Apparently, Panasonic is fine with the fact that the manufacturer in China would ship this product without even testing whether it would power on.</li>
            <li> The item is sleek, sturdy, portable, easy to use, and looks good in the bathroom as it stands on it&#x27;s own base like handle.  </li>
            <li> Cuts quick, clean and short.</li>
            <li> Lets face it, nose hair is really one of the most unattractive things that grows on the human body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super simple to clean.</li>
            <li> This also has a nice cleaning feature that allows to to open a channel in the shaver to run water completely through.  </li>
            <li> I have used several of these kinds of trimmers but none of them were actually any good at what you bought them for.  </li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t open it until July when his old one broke, and he&#x27;s been kicking himself for not opening it sooner because it really is a nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really know how the razor people can improve on these products but this one seems to be better than my last one.  </li>
            <li> It does eat batteries and has an occasional tug, but overall is a good product.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ER-GN30-K is the best nose trimmer I have ever used, and I have used at least 4 different models.  </li>
            <li> dropped my first one and dented the blade guard, which is pretty much the end.  </li>
            <li> Easily worth the few bucks it costs to keep yourself neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last February and it did a good job of trimming both nose hairs and facial hair</li>
            <li> This is a great nose hair trimmer, as long as it works, which isn&#x27;t long.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be better, and I hope it lasts as long as the first one.</li>
            <li> Really... that&#x27;s a big one.  :-)</li>
            <li> Wow Really Far better than the TV nose clipper I had been using.</li>
            <li> The price is fair and I like the cleaning option of washing the cutting head with warm water.</li>
            <li> It really needs a better blade than the tiny one it comes with.</li>
            <li> My old one was better, but I bought this one thinking it would out perform the old one.</li>
            <li> Liked design of old unit and found tis to be the only one with this dexign.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is small, light, quiet, very nicely engineered and made.</li>
            <li> The first time I unscrewed the top portion to clean it out, a tiiiiny little spring that holds the blade up fell out.</li>
            <li> Wow, it Works Great for a limited time period then stops completely working.</li>
            <li> And the wet cleaning is VERY easy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light, no sharp edges, and works.</li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic for developing this trimmer at a very reasonable cost.  </li>
            <li> and NO HAIR was left inside, spotless clean!</li>
            <li> This trimmer was not expensive but does a decent job!</li>
            <li> Its light to handle, &amp; the construction is just right - simple; cap fits well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nose</li>
            <li> Once you put the battery in, it feels more natural and it does a decent job of trimming those unsightly nose hairs (and I&#x27;m sure other hairs as well,</li>
            <li> It costs a little more but it really works compared to the cheap ones you get at the drug store.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is easy, the only thing to be aware of is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a battery and the tip that cuts the hair</li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to use and is pretty quiet to boot.  </li>
            <li> After removing the screw-on top to clean the blades under running sink water only, I put the top back on and the tiny blades never worked again.</li>
            <li> Getting the ladies has never been so easy and I am consistently having coitus on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> Pretty easy to use and works well enough.</li>
            <li> In any event, in my pursuit to find something of quality, I was convinced by the positive reviews and decided to purchase it.</li>
            <li> Bought it after reading the positive reviews on amazon.  </li>
            <li> the positive reviews were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sounds like there are lots of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the positive reviews</li>
            <li> Got this based on all the positive reviews here, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it should work better, but maybe having a wicked fast super sharp blade in your nose/ears/</li>
            <li> This works without pulling or tugging, very simple, very effective, not very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.i&#x27;ve been staying away from the &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; trimmers and more toward single purpose trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is made of cheap plastic and breaks down easily.</li>
            <li> got this trimmer a few weeks ago and it has been working fine!!</li>
            <li> For $10 it works well, is easy to clean and has a fairly sharp blade.</li>
            <li> This is the first one that really does what it says.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll see how long the battery lasts</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several expensive / cheap versions and this one is the best in my book.</li>
            <li> This product cannot help with the latter issue, but it is great at trimming hair from ears, noses, and other unwanted places.  </li>
            <li> Pretty much won&#x27;t run now.  </li>
            <li> Often it wouldn&#x27;t get those long hairs were sticking out the most.</li>
            <li> but I clearly experienced the same issues as all the other 1 star posters...</li>
            <li> Compact, smooth, quiet, reasonable durable, easy to clean, battery lasts long.</li>
            <li> He loves it, easy clean up and is extremely quite.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see, how long it lasts :)</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a device like this that really works and this device really works!</li>
            <li> First set of nose and hair trimmers I have ever owned, so I don&#x27;t have anything to really compare them against.</li>
            <li> It is very tickly when you use it for the first time</li>
            <li> I prefer units that do not have built in batteries because they always lose their charge over time and then it&#x27;s pretty much chuck in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First time using a real nose trimmer</li>
            <li> After purchasing it I read a lot of other great reviews about this same product.</li>
            <li> Blades are still extremely sharp, never pulls a hair, so easy to clean and a battery lasts forever.</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Pretty much.  </li>
            <li> This was the first nose/ear trimmer I have owned, so I really had no basis for comparison.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all you really need and reasonable in price!</li>
            <li> I was scared at first to shove any object up my nose that has razors spinning fast.</li>
            <li> This baby deforests very well ;-)</li>
            <li> My last trimmer was one of those cheap Avon/Sharper Image ones and this one works much better and costs the same amount.</li>
            <li> Battery (name brand starts with a &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; :-)) lasts a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few different brands and styles of trimmers and this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Despite the first impression, or maybe because of it, I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> First, it tickles too much.  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted a while and like the others have said, it works very well.</li>
            <li> Works great and not flimsy like other similar products</li>
            <li> : Works very well, tickled at first but then didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this trimmer was the solution I was looking for, but it&#x27;s ready for the junk pile after 4 months of use.</li>
            <li> The trimming shroud does get very warm,not hot.</li>
            <li> Its a few bucks more but well worth it!</li>
            <li> It works well and does pretty much what you expect and want it to.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and reaches places other trimmers did not.</li>
            <li> Also, the trimmer pretty much wants to YANK OUT your hair rather than cut.  </li>
            <li> As an older person, I&#x27;ve been spoiled by the good, old-fashioned products that were previous made in the USA, so my expectations are much lower these days.  </li>
            <li> trimmer has almost no vibration (a good sign in small electric motors) and does not pull at all.  </li>
            <li> Super easy to clean by turning the knob to the little &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; icon, and running it under the faucet!</li>
            <li> Super easy to clean by turning the knob to the little &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; icon, and running it under the faucet!</li>
            <li> Men interested in looking upwardly mobile and competent should seriously consider this well-designed, effective trimmer to keep natural hair in check.</li>
            <li> Works well, tickles my nose, I need to study how to clean it, a bargain, five more redundant words required.</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s never let her handicap get her down, but it truly is nice to get hold of a product that can be used with one hand, in case there&#x27;s a need.  </li>
            <li> More quiet and easier to handle than an older Panasonic model I owned.</li>
            <li> good trimmer for men and women - easy to use, small enough to carry with you or pack for a trip.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the best I have tried to tame the hairs in your nose simply and completely.  </li>
            <li> Gets a little warm after a couple of minutes but not uncomfortably so.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> You really cant go wrong with this purchase, for me personally, the rotary style trimmer works the best, i also have the philips norelco \\&quot;tube\\&quot; style trimmer, I never got comfortable using it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, smooth and cuts very very well.</li>
            <li> I can imagine a different outcome for someone with wiry hair but for me it was very fast and smooth.</li>
            <li> but I wish I could take it apart just a little more to clean it really well.</li>
            <li> It makes it feel more clean versus just wiping down like my older models.</li>
            <li> This one seems like the motor is very strong in it and does not every lose power like the other one did.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy that I purchased this item over the trash on TV infomercials and other significantly more expensive products.  </li>
            <li> While others may have been a bit more powerful, they also vibrated too much and pulled the nose hair, which was extremely</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; that as we get older, some of us lose hair in certain areas and it begins sprouting like crab grass in others!  </li>
            <li> Great little helper!!!</li>
            <li> It fixed a problem and did it quickly and neatly.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy way to trim nose hair.</li>
            <li> Runs quietly and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> In addition to quitting after a short time, they also go through batteries very quickly.  </li>
            <li> However, this product is very solid and easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to take a part and put back together.</li>
            <li> So far it was strong enough to do the job and quick without pulling my hairs.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thought might be to go to a local shaver shop first and find out the choices available.  </li>
            <li> It is painless, fairly quiet, easy to use, and works well.</li>
            <li> It cuts short, doesn&#x27;t pull on any hair, and is easy to move around.</li>
            <li> When the battery begins to lose charge the trimmer is less effective.</li>
            <li> Luckily I&#x27;m don&#x27;t have old man ear hair yet, but if I did, this would be my go to.</li>
            <li> Works really well but heats up pretty fast when using.</li>
            <li> It cuts easily and quietly.  </li>
            <li> You can turn the head portion of the devise and open this release hole so that the water will run through the trimmer and exit the hole for easy cleaning.  </li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do pretty well (actually better than I expected).  </li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> A lot of hair removing can become such a process, but with this product, it&#x27;s so easy.</li>
            <li> The only problem I have is that it&#x27;s not that easy to navigate through the nose.</li>
            <li> Be careful when taking off the top for cleaning  - the blade looks pretty flimsy, although I did not appear to cause any damage, take it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use; very simple.</li>
            <li> The first one looked like cheap plastic junk from the second I saw it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Seems to be quiet and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> An effective way to trim nose hair, but the trimmer broke in less than a year.  </li>
            <li> Could put instructions easily on one short page-</li>
            <li> Fairly quiet machine, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Removal the top cap, tissue dry the pieces, reassemble.</li>
            <li> It runs on a battery and you can easily tell when the battery gets low.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to change the battery, and only uses one AA</li>
            <li> This thing does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and cleanup is easy and simple.</li>
            <li> Easy enough to use</li>
            <li> I like that this one takes standard AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a quality unit, and is easy to take apart and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> My only concern is it feels  pretty lightweight and cheap</li>
            <li> I thought when I bought it in a portable, easy to use, low cost and durable and that&#x27;s what I got.</li>
            <li> Very quiet and cleans easy by running water thru the cleaning port.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The product works well, cuts even short hairs easily and does not pull or snag.  </li>
            <li> It is reasonably quiet, and easily cuts those pesky nasal or ear hairs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely painless and quick and removes all visible hair.  </li>
            <li> It made facial trimming exceptionally easy, with this you can do basically anytype of \\&quot;clean-up grooming\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer is so easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Everything disassembled easily and was assembled back together just as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Cleans easy, simple to store.</li>
            <li> This makes it easy to take care of the hair in the areas where it shouldn&#x27;t be growing, yet it doesn&#x27;t do anything to bring back the hair that is falling out where it should be growing.</li>
            <li> Simple operation and easy maintenance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying the old style trimmer for years and they always quick working.  </li>
            <li> - still need to unscrew the top, remove the blade shake off the excess water and allow it to dry on some paper</li>
            <li> easy, convenient and quiet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, quick, not messy, and the rotating blade doesn&#x27;t catch skin.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This actually cuts the nose hair close and it is easy and non-irritating.</li>
            <li> veey easy to use and he batteries last for loooooooong!!!</li>
            <li> Strongly built, quiet.</li>
            <li> This is still going strong --- my husband uses it regularly and it has been over 2 years with no problems.</li>
            <li> And after 4-5 months it is still going strong on the same battery.  </li>
            <li> The batteries are still strong after two months, but I only use it weekly.</li>
            <li> so should last good , long time.</li>
            <li> Good product at very low cost,really does the job and runs a long time on the battery. .</li>
            <li> Strong enough to do the job well.</li>
            <li> I would concur with others that using a strong double A battery as opposed to rechargeable or cheaper batteries is a must.</li>
            <li> It sounds powerful and keeps running at full steam the entire time.  </li>
            <li> No idea how long it will last, but it&#x27;s good in the meantime.</li>
            <li> Works well, but it doesn&#x27;t feel strong or like it is going to last.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but does not live up to the reviews I read before purchasing.  </li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure how this little trimmer consumed the energy in a AA battery so quickly.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different nose trimmers from other manufacturers and this is absolutely the best one I have ever used.  </li>
            <li> it trims down to the skin - does not pull hair and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Easy to break down and clean.</li>
            <li> , I know this comparison as like comparing apples to oranges as the multi-tool was wireless and could do much more, but my need was limited to what this trimmer can do</li>
            <li> /&gt;It runs off a single AAA battery, and one of my favorite features is the ease of cleaning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for years, this is a replacement and certainly does the job.</li>
            <li> : I just had to return and make certain that I didn&#x27;t give this but one star.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ll certainly appreciate it.</li>
            <li> The angled head is smart.</li>
            <li> I have fairly large nostrils.</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t say for certain how this would hold up against an amazon jungle level of nose hairs or a Frida Kahlo-esque unibrow</li>
            <li> It leaves quite a large amount of stubble which still must be dealt with using another kid of blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you&#x27;re like me and hit a certain age when hair starts growing where you&#x27;d prefer it didn&#x27;t, here&#x27;s your solution.</li>
            <li> I would certainly reccommend this item.</li>
            <li> Consequently, as men age, they must groom certain areas to avoid looking like a bald Wookie.  </li>
            <li> Plucking is certainly one solution.</li>
            <li> I would certainly buy another one.</li>
            <li> and this certainly works for that.</li>
            <li> But they are for women and too large for the eyebrow area.)  </li>
            <li> Well guys, you get to a certain age and the hair starts sprouting.  </li>
            <li> I would certainly consider purchasing one as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> My nose hair runs in pure fear when I pull these from the drawer.  </li>
            <li> I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMEND</li>
            <li> Certainly must have.</li>
            <li> Tried changing battery...didn&#x27;t seem to work until, by pure luck, it started running when I pinched the battery in a certain position with the cover off.</li>
            <li> If you have a mustache watch out around the lips, can nick certain areas.</li>
            <li> It works but it certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like a well made trimmer.  </li>
            <li> but it certainly does not do the job I thought it would</li>
            <li> Buy two if you&#x27;re smart.</li>
            <li> The new model is basically similar to the old and yet has excellent improvements to the previous design.  </li>
            <li> Undoing and doing those small parts is not so easy for everyone.!!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why everyone else makes their product so darn weak, but I&#x27;m happy with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had others that were similar in shape, but being able to run this under a stream of water with a little soap, gives me a better sense that it is really being cleaned!</li>
            <li> My husband liked this trimmer enough to order it a second time when the first one broke.</li>
            <li> This new one is a bit different with a more contoured body and some sort of wash lock</li>
            <li> It seems like it would be a battery problem however,  I did put a new battery in initially and have replaced them twice more.  </li>
            <li> It is very quiet and does an excellent job of  trimming nose hair and hard to get at ear hair!</li>
            <li> It can be used wet or dry and makes a great gift for any occasion.  </li>
            <li> You see, I discovered the joy that is the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great that you can use it dry or wet</li>
            <li> It works well and is indeed waterproof and easy to clean unlike a previous model I had years ago.  </li>
            <li> Second one I popped off the top and the blade fell off the the top and went down the sink- replacement &#x3D; 22</li>
            <li> I recommend this unit for anyone needing an easy to use, trouble free product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works good as a nose trimmer and all around face trimmer, I&#x27;ve only used it on a dry face though.</li>
            <li> but cleaning it isn&#x27;t very user-friendly since they suggest taking the top portion apart to dry.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these trimmers, and when they worked they were great -- but both failed extremely quickly.</li>
            <li> Use a fresh alkaline battery for best results as cheaper ones slow it down.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment has a nice tight seal with a rubber o-ring to prevent water from getting inside.  </li>
            <li> Easy as a simple razor to clean, just open the &#x27;valve&#x27; and pour some hot water through it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is a well built, high quality trimmer at a very reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> The circular blade system works much better than my single straight arm trimmer did.</li>
            <li> It works well, is easy to clean, and is cheap enough that if I only get a year&#x27;s worth (or less) out of it, I&#x27;ll have no regrets about buying a couple more to cope with the onslaught of unwanted hirsute characteristics where I don&#x27;t want them.</li>
            <li> This one is comfortable, right-sized, cleans easily with water, takes standard batteries, is quiet, and is virtually pain-free.</li>
            <li> It worked fine the last time I used it a month or so ago.</li>
            <li> Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer arrived on time and works fine.</li>
            <li> Much more quiet and does a better job of trimming with less nose tickle.</li>
            <li> It handles the big stuff fine</li>
            <li> It really does do a great job, wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> I had my doubts at first, Had other type/brands that were ok</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s larger and ergonomically shaped for better handling than my previous trimmer and the fact that it&#x27;s a wet/dry makes it even better.</li>
            <li> ......bent the guard back into position and has been working fine since.</li>
            <li> Works fine, low price, no problem of discomfort.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version which was fine, and am baffled by all the glowing reviews on this one?  </li>
            <li> It is simple to use and seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it worked OK, and I used it on my eyebrows and other places with embarrassing hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Decent for the price and does the job on nose hairs!</li>
            <li> I got it for my boyfriend whose gotten older and his nose hairs longer!</li>
            <li> pretty decent tool for trimming unwanted hairs</li>
            <li> Usually have to change the battery once a year (unless you are exceptionally hairy).</li>
            <li> Very high quality, works without problems.</li>
            <li> He would recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get real excited about battery powered items like this, because I&#x27;d prefer more raw, longer lasting power, but</li>
            <li> You can press it very hard against the skin and hear a view more hairs getting zapped but even when applying way more strength then you ever should with this</li>
            <li> I feel like the blades get a little warm</li>
            <li> At just over $10, this is an unbelievably effective and versatile little tool.</li>
            <li> My barber would often trim the hairs with scissors, now I can keep up with the little buggers, not boogers, on my own.</li>
            <li> The tip gets a little warm but nothing uncomforable</li>
            <li> is worth the money for a good trimmer and it stays sharp for a long time.</li>
            <li> Nice little trimmer, battery powered.  </li>
            <li> It gets a little warm after using it for a while</li>
            <li> The end part does get a little warm if it&#x27;s been running for a minute or two but doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s something that will hurt you.</li>
            <li> Say us men admit to using such an item once a week, then the single AA battery will last about 2 months or more, effectively.  </li>
            <li> I think the blades are better suited to fine hair, and sometimes cannot quite zip through a thick hair.  </li>
            <li> Works great wet or dry!  </li>
            <li> It works so much better than the older model he had for a long time.  </li>
            <li> This nose trimmer is sharp, small, handy and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AS IT REMOVES EXCESS HAIRS IN AREAS WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO GET</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer - noise level is very low</li>
            <li> So overall, this Panasonic unit is working fine for me, but I&#x27;m just much more careful now when I use it.</li>
            <li> It gets a little warm at the tip and tickles my nose to the point of making me cry a bit, but it does the job haha.</li>
            <li> The best feature is the little drain built in so that the blade can be rinsed and dried.</li>
            <li> It is also easy to clean and maintain since all you have to do it twist the head off to get the little hairs out.</li>
            <li> This little thing is great and it gets the job done, especially with nose hair.</li>
            <li> costs just a little bit more, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> you pretty much have to take it apart to clean the hair out properly.</li>
            <li> Oh it has a flat bottom that makes it easy to stand up.</li>
            <li> A good nose trimmer is hard to find.</li>
            <li> I had worked so hard to get my intestinal flora in good shape</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to make sure hairs only hit the cutter from certain angles like the old trimmer</li>
            <li> It claims yu can trim your beard with it, I do not have one, and am not sure it would survive long doing that, but for nose, ears and eyebrows, its very good indeed.</li>
            <li> I tried my best to straighten it back out, and it works now, but it sounds a little gritty.</li>
            <li> Wish it worked a little better - it doesnt seem to last more than a year.  </li>
            <li> Shop around for a better one and spend a little more on your personal grooming.</li>
            <li> Overall a great little unit a a reasonable price...</li>
            <li> Works great, first one I have ever owned and wish I would have purchased on long ago instead of using little scissors...</li>
            <li> I would spend a little more the next time and get something better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried $10 and $20 versions of these trimmers, the generic kind you get at Wal-mart, they are always cheap, they always cut a little hair.  </li>
            <li> works awesome just a little scary putting something in you nose but makes me look so much better.</li>
            <li> Economical, easy to use, and works extremely well.</li>
            <li> first one that actually worked right and is durable!</li>
            <li> I like to leave the removable pieces in a glass of 91% alcohoI before I give them a scrub with an old toothbrush to keep them looking new and clean.</li>
            <li> It is very portable and has a low humming sound.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is quiet, comfortable and very efficient.</li>
            <li> I use it every few days and the battery life seems to be amazing.</li>
            <li> Accurate, neat and quiet.</li>
            <li> but this one trims great, only had a few months</li>
            <li> If you have a huge nose with big nostrils</li>
            <li> this sucker up your nose and watch the magic pour from nostril heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair free.</li>
            <li> One pen light battery isn&#x27;t enough to really make this work to</li>
            <li> The replacement works great, although I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days.  </li>
            <li> I really like that</li>
            <li> very good,easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have no idea, but I accomplished it.</li>
            <li> My husband is very virile and his hair amount and consistency are congruent.  </li>
            <li> The pros about this is that it is very sleek in design and does it job 98% of the time.</li>
            <li> This works really well.</li>
            <li> Worked well for about a month, but it no longer cuts very well.</li>
            <li> hitting the button too easily&amp;#34;, &amp; it&#x27;s very comfy for the hand.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you don&#x27;t like tweezers and can&#x27;t stand even a smallest amount of pain!</li>
            <li> this is a very neat trimmer.  </li>
            <li> so I cannot discuss its durability, but it performs really well taking care of my husband&#x27;s nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> I would recomend this product as it fulfilled my needs at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> very well functioning trimmer.</li>
            <li> works very well and is very thorough</li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> it is not painless at all and works fast.</li>
            <li> too so the whole world doesn&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see how it can be a &amp;#34;Facial&amp;#34; hair trimer.</li>
            <li> Nothing much to complain about.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Works very well,  </li>
            <li> Panasonic has always gone above and beyond in my book but this device seems cheaply put together.  </li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t have much luck with electric trimmers before.  </li>
            <li> But it does work really well.</li>
            <li> Does not cut very well.</li>
            <li> I really like this clipper.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> But I can tell you that, much like my battery powered toothbrush, I can audibly hear, and feel, the motor losing power...</li>
            <li> This works very well for nose and ear hair.  </li>
            <li> Worked really well out of the package .</li>
            <li> After 2 months of use it gets really noisy, but it gets the work done.</li>
            <li> This trimmer really works, unlike others I&#x27;ve purchased.  </li>
            <li> I find customer reviews very persuasive.</li>
            <li> This works very well for both me and my husband.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out, which hurts, but it really cuts and works well.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this nose-hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> husband looks much neater now.  </li>
            <li> Does best job of cutting ear hair.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li> Each seemed to work well in the begenning but went downhill fast.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works much better than I expected.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t mind too much.</li>
            <li> &quot; but if you&#x27;re looking for a primary clipper ... I&#x27;d suggest further investigation.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts hairs fast and without pulling.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> This task is easily accomplished.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what battery life will be like, but the trimmer works very well for</li>
            <li> This works really well.  </li>
            <li> These worked very well and will hopefully continue to do so.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t leave as much of a stubble problem.</li>
            <li> This unit is designed to do one thing real well</li>
            <li> The manufacturer also claims that its water-resistant, making it capable of use in the shower, though I haven&#x27;t tried this myself.</li>
            <li> Much quieter.</li>
            <li> For that QC - modern look in a man, this it the product for you.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.</li>
            <li> Really like this shaver.</li>
            <li> Worked better than I expected.</li>
            <li> Really you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Nose and ear hair... who wants to discuss that?  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say it works very well</li>
            <li> There is no pulling and they are very versatile, whether trimming nose, ears, eyebrows etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> highly recommend this trimmer if you are considering them!</li>
            <li> It is also a capable eyebrow trimmer as well, but I don&#x27;t have any ear hair to test it on.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well until I dropped it.</li>
            <li> To remove these, nothing really works except a nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This one really works.</li>
            <li> , I immediately ordered another one (though ironic that it&#x27;s cheaper to re-buy than get a replacement blade...).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have much in the way of ear hair</li>
            <li> In fact it works very well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he&#x27;s much taller than me</li>
            <li> I have a fast rate growing of hair</li>
            <li> This Panasonic hair trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li> The unit is constructed very well.  </li>
            <li> Nothing really to complain about.  </li>
            <li> Works very well for battery operated.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> and this doesn&#x27;t do very well.</li>
            <li> do a really thorough job &amp; still have to use scissors to get the ones waaaaaaay up in there.</li>
            <li> and they work really well.  </li>
            <li> Like, it didn&#x27;t look like it does when someone has a scar through their eyebrow or if you were to run a clipper through your eyebrow (or straight razor).</li>
            <li> My husband wants me to buy another one</li>
            <li> only downside I have to it, is that it feels cheaply made.</li>
            <li> very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> works better than expected, would recommend to everyone...</li>
            <li> Very compact and it works.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li> For the price it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> so I can get in really close, but I didn&#x27;t have to do that with this one.  </li>
            <li> A very neat &amp; efficient way of brushing up an aging face.</li>
            <li> That way if it ever breaks, I have another one ready to go.</li>
            <li> Its an absolute must have item in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Who wants to do a lot of reading anyway about a nasal hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hand it for about two months and this trimmer really mows the grass.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> amazon thanks.</li>
            <li> It holds a charge well and seems to clip really well.</li>
            <li> Pulls a bit too much</li>
            <li> Works well and is more comfortable when cutting than most.</li>
            <li> These really do the job in trimming the hair unlike those made in China.  </li>
            <li> and it really hurts when you have to pluck it out.</li>
            <li> Or a rechargable built in for the price of this unit it really should.</li>
            <li> works very well.</li>
            <li> He really likes that you can use it even in the water.</li>
            <li> I would have paid twice as much for this trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is very well built for a inexpensive unit.  </li>
            <li> I really like the fact that all you have to do is rinse it out with water.</li>
            <li> Well built, cheap, quiet, cleans with running water</li>
            <li> /&gt;He appreciated that they included a Cleaning-brush with the Trimmer and a Cap to keep the blade-housing covered when not in use.</li>
            <li> It worked very well while it lasted.</li>
            <li> It buzzed and vibrated, and was much fussier to use.</li>
            <li> Cuts very close with no pinching or pulling of the hairs.</li>
            <li> The trimmer gently trims the hair, without hurting your nose.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;vortex&#x27; nonsense is just a bit of over-engineering; really Panasonic, it&#x27;s a nose hair trimmer, not a lawnmower.  </li>
            <li> It is fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> Works very well on nasal hair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Even if it had not broken, I would have purchased something else.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon a lot.</li>
            <li> After my last two cheap nose/ear hair trimmers died I decided to give this fancier one a shot.</li>
            <li> It also holds ats battery life very well.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I do not have much nose hair, so I would use tweezers instaed.  </li>
            <li> Too soon to tell if merits 5 starts: if  the blades hold their sharpness for a reasonable period of time, I might boost my rating.</li>
            <li> Does a reasonable job, no complaints.  </li>
            <li> So far for the price though, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Thanks to it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I never realized how much nose hair I had since purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> Worth the money and recommend by hairy old men.</li>
            <li> and he really did not want another.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> It is very thorough with the trimming.  </li>
            <li> but it a does a much quicker/better&lt;br /&gt;job.  </li>
            <li> the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.  </li>
            <li> but I may be asking too much because AA&#x27;s are so standardized.</li>
            <li> Unit worked very well for one year, then started making a grinding noise and promptly died.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping</li>
            <li> This model is very aggressive and gets the job done fast.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t use this thing as much as I thought I would.  </li>
            <li> Really works.</li>
            <li> I really like the angle of the handle.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for making a product that works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Stores wanted too much for this product.</li>
            <li> this  is a god as you can get very close and dose not cut you</li>
            <li> Skip the high price tag and go with this one!</li>
            <li> It just does not trim the nose hair very well.</li>
            <li> So much for it being waterproof.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> 2 year warranty doesnt really help.  </li>
            <li> Very practical item, well known brand name Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The difference might be related to the design of the end of the blade guard, as the Wahl is wide open, where the Panasonic blade guard kind of wraps around the top or tip of the blade.     </li>
            <li> The design makes the rotating cutters much too ineffective.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak much for it being used as a trimmer for the ear, but for the nose it&#x27;s working really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much faster, too.</li>
            <li> it uses batteries FAST.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> very durable.</li>
            <li> This is a very convenient to trim nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Trimmer does what is supposed to and a whole lot safer than scissors.</li>
            <li> It did its job very well.</li>
            <li> If you have nose hairs in need of trimming, this Panasonic is capable of the task.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t really do anything except buzz when you turn it on.  </li>
            <li> I really wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased it.</li>
            <li> My last nose hair trimmer was a piece of cheap junk.</li>
            <li> He says they work very well</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It also cuts nose hairs very close and gently</li>
            <li> Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have fast growing nose hairs for some reason...</li>
            <li> Jessica: Should you have any questions in the future, please feel free to chat with us again.</li>
            <li> I get groomed so fast now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very cautious as to not knick the inside of my nose</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much you can say about a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant to stick something electric with blades up my nose</li>
            <li> Trims really well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nose trimmer and it does its intended job very well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it much</li>
            <li> All @ a reasonable price point ...</li>
            <li> Very please with performance.</li>
            <li> I really just needed a product that I could turn on and use.  </li>
            <li> I really did not need a wet/dry trimmer any way.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.  </li>
            <li> This product does a fantastic job of trimming unwanted hair from various areas.</li>
            <li> I really like the Panasoni machine.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> The clipper makes a humming sound and the tip warms but it only clips a minimum amount of hair.</li>
            <li> My wife wants me to buy another one...</li>
            <li> Very seldom if ever does it YANK a hair.</li>
            <li> It works really well for that too.</li>
            <li> That outcome doesn&#x27;t happen too often with modern products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks for getting my noise/ears/whatever else that needs trimming.  </li>
            <li> Very neat gadget to have.  </li>
            <li> This item works very well for trimming nasal hairs.  </li>
            <li> but when I do, it works very well.</li>
            <li> perhaps a really judgmental cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought this because over the years my nose hair has really started to grow longer for some reason.  </li>
            <li> Never thought I would like a nose trimmer so much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well built and durable.</li>
            <li> Very painful.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I guess you can&#x27;t expect much for $10.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> works as promised  which is very well</li>
            <li> and it goes through batteries much faster.</li>
            <li> Very efficient trimmer that provides trouble-free efficiency.</li>
            <li> Well-designed and performs better than expected.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Working very well.  </li>
            <li> Like it so much.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make much noise at all.  </li>
            <li> The grip/handle is comfortable and feels solid.</li>
            <li> but doesn&#x27;t really work well in practice.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Though for $12 what do you really get anymore?  </li>
            <li> The whole unit seems to be waterproof, although I&#x27;ve never submerged it.</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> very like it</li>
            <li> highly recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> I have found this device also works very well for trimming stray hairs (like the 2 or three that grow between my eyebrows).</li>
            <li> This device works really well.</li>
            <li> Works very well and meets all my needs</li>
            <li> oh, say on their head - to where they don&#x27;t really want it - say tufting out of their nose and ears.</li>
            <li> fast delivery</li>
            <li> He really likes it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The product worked very well and on the note I would recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE</li>
            <li> Does not pull hair, trims very close</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t really suggest giving this a try.</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I like this type over the straight blade type.  </li>
            <li> This is smooth, quiet, and cuts the hair like it is intended to.</li>
            <li> Most of these nose hair trimmers are cheaply made and only work minimally.</li>
            <li> Well made and the travel cover is very helpful.  </li>
            <li> Straight clippers work in some areas but not inside my nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> For a much lower price</li>
            <li> not so much a &amp;#34;facial</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and it really works well.</li>
            <li> My husband was really looking forward to this device.</li>
            <li> A real power-combo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use this for my crazy nose hair and it works perfectly.  </li>
            <li> /simpler straight design.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Seriously, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I contacted customer service, and I was offered a replacement part at a cost that was more than what I spent on the trimmer itself.  </li>
            <li> - he really likes this one.</li>
            <li> but it recovers fast.</li>
            <li> It trims very well both my nose hair and my ear hairs.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> The noise level is low and it cuts neatly and smoothly without any tugs.</li>
            <li> Really like this item.  </li>
            <li> I LOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVE it so much.</li>
            <li> It worked very well and it continues to work.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This things really works.</li>
            <li> It trims his nose and ear hairs  very well with no problems.  </li>
            <li> With this one, my face looks spit-shined and ready for anything.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for women AND men!</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t think it trimmed hairs very well anyway.  </li>
            <li> When I called up the manufacturers&#x27; parts department to order another head, they wanted as much for the replacement head as I paid for the unit.  </li>
            <li> I found out, fortunately for me, that the Wahl beard trimmer that I had ordered actually came with a nose/ear hair trimmer accessory.  </li>
            <li> Wish I&#x27;d been more careful.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use and does the job.  </li>
            <li> used it straight away</li>
            <li> He says it works really well</li>
            <li> fast result</li>
            <li> Just purchased this, but I really like it.</li>
            <li> but they use up the battery too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy them again because I do not use them very often.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work....unless you have so much nose hair that it is hanging two inches out of your nose.</li>
            <li> hahahaha</li>
            <li> I did get some gentle pulling at times, but no yanking.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t have to use it that much, so</li>
            <li> Very quiet and comfortable to hold when using..</li>
            <li> It is very convenient for you to carry when you go out.</li>
            <li> It does one thing very well.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping...</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for my intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Really cleans hairs</li>
            <li> Works really well for my nose as well as my ears.</li>
            <li> On a $13 trimmer, that doesn&#x27;t much sense.</li>
            <li> We really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This works really well and is very portable.</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this thing was going to work very well.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this trimmer!</li>
            <li> My husband really like this.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> I ran this thing over my whole face ...</li>
            <li> : If needed for trimming eyebrow hairs, it doesn&#x27;t really get the close &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; or close &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; or tweezed look.  </li>
            <li> When I did get it working and tried it out, it cut most hairs, but the blades would get jammed and pull my nosehairs out.  </li>
            <li> Somehow I expected more flash or power to the operation.  </li>
            <li> This panasonic nose trimmer is very well made.</li>
            <li> absolutely a keeper</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> Simple to use, cheap.</li>
            <li> It leaves stubble, very itchy.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really realize how visible my nose hair was until I got this and used it.</li>
            <li> Yea we needed to finally replace our cheap nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> This one is very well built</li>
            <li> and it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> nothing else really needs to be said.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic.</li>
            <li> But it took me about 30 minutes to shave my whole face with it.</li>
            <li> but works really well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight.</li>
            <li> It works really well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!  </li>
            <li> I only wish it came with a free battery</li>
            <li> Even if you decide to use Alkaline, it won&#x27;t be as wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is much easier than cleaning an electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The amount of hair coming out of it isn&#x27;t that much, I sometimes skip it.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Works, but it drains the batteries really fast.</li>
            <li> This works very well and efficiently.  </li>
            <li> Does the job VERY well.  </li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t really even need to use a mirror.</li>
            <li> proof.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to post pictures , but I don&#x27;t think you really want to see them .</li>
            <li> those more remote places.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> Opened the bottom, shoved in a cheap AA battery and starting rooting around places</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m ready for all the ladies.</li>
            <li> The best for cutting unwanted nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Use hearing aids so trimming close is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Price is reasonable.  </li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> So I bought this, put a battery in it, turned it on, and gently inserted it into my nostrils.  </li>
            <li> really  works too.  </li>
            <li> Even when it was working it really didn&#x27;t do much for trimming hair.  </li>
            <li> It feels compact yet solidly built, and fits comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li> Only time will be the judge on the durability issue, but overall I think this is well worth the couple of dollars more that this trimmer cost me.</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;run through the faucet\\&quot; way of cleaning it works very well.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t really see how you would cut yourself with this tool.</li>
            <li> This one is the real deal.</li>
            <li> It works VERY well.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this.</li>
            <li> Bit more &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; than expected.</li>
            <li> I expected more from a Panasonic product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer work very well</li>
            <li> this one based on Amazon reviewer ratings (Thanks reviewers).  </li>
            <li> I really thought this would be a \\&quot;you</li>
            <li> this really works,  I do use it.</li>
            <li> Pulls nose hairs, get ready for some some tearful eyes.  </li>
            <li> This is very efficient, and gets everything in one or two passes.</li>
            <li> Quiet and pain free.</li>
            <li> I like it so much</li>
            <li> it seems to work really really well, without any discomfort, just does what I thought it would do.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This made the task very simple and smooth..</li>
            <li> Trims very close.  </li>
            <li> Runs quiet and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The blade trims facial hair close and comfortably.</li>
            <li> This trimmer left the inside of my nose feeling as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  </li>
            <li> I had 1 or 2 of these years ago and they didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic wants me to pay to ship it for repair.</li>
            <li> would also be still very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very reliable.  </li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery.  </li>
            <li> I think it rotates faster and cuts the hair much easier, with no pulling.  </li>
            <li> It cuts the nose hairs very well.  </li>
            <li> Way too much fun early in the morning.</li>
            <li> FAST</li>
            <li> I think the trick is how fast the motor runs and the fact that it can be rinsed under running water.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m really reviewing this, which means anyone reading this knows that I use an electronic device to remove nose hairs and stray body hairs.</li>
            <li> trims close and fast in meh nose.</li>
            <li> really wanted this to work....</li>
            <li> It shaves really close without pulling the hair(s).</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Got on my browser, went to the site, and with much trepidation, I cautiously typed in \\&quot;Panasonic trimmer\\&quot;....</li>
            <li> $12 bucks can you really complain?</li>
            <li> this works very well.</li>
            <li> Very well designed and engineered.</li>
            <li> This works as described and was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just really takes care of the nose and ears.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product much since it arrived.  </li>
            <li> Works really well.  </li>
            <li> I never imagined buying one of these things because real men don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> Really?  </li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like it much anyway.</li>
            <li> Very dissapointed in Panasonic for this product.</li>
            <li> I prefer the rotary one to straight edge clippers that i&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t really work well</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t as fast as I&#x27;d like but satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Trims very well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> durable smooth and quiet</li>
            <li> It really gets rid of unwanted hair on nose ear etc.</li>
            <li> He would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> he wants to buy for his father too.</li>
            <li> VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re ready to go.</li>
            <li> Flip the on/off switch and a low buzzing sound is heard.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> This item cuts the hairs very well without pulling as some others do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s rotating strength on the inner blades is rather strong and it is so easy to do quick trimming in a few minutes and continue on with my day.</li>
            <li> Scissors, knifes, had to use the whole shebang.</li>
            <li> However, it really gets those whiskers.  </li>
            <li> B006Z2SP72 MANGROOMER Stainless Steel Detail Groomer]].</li>

            <li> This works very well on nostril and ear hair.</li>
            <li> but it does is job very well.</li>

            <li> trims my nose hair very well.</li>
            <li> I decided to give it another go since it is so reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Neither worked very well, and both pulled my hair out at times.</li>
            <li> The clipper cuts really well.  </li>
            <li> Price and quality were both highly appreciated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, light and you can wash it under the faucet.</li>
            <li> Not this one, it really cuts well,</li>
            <li> It is quiet, light weight, and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried to wet wash it yet, but I am sure it won&#x27;t be any problem.</li>
            <li> no cuts, feels as smooth as if you shaved with a regular razor.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this device!</li>
            <li> it seems very well-constructed.  </li>
            <li> REALLY interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I threw it out since returning it would have cost as much as I paid off this.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t really connect with battery</li>
            <li> It really can&#x27;t be any simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer works very well if you are gentle with it.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> thanks came fast and have been using it ever since...</li>
            <li> Very durable.</li>
            <li> Really like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Try this one I think you will really like it.</li>
            <li> Works very well</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well for nose or much else.</li>
            <li> Used to trim nose hair and trim around my beard, no problems, very convenient.</li>
            <li> It is very practical for that</li>
            <li> Really gets a close shave for my nose hairs,</li>
            <li> Very comfy grip.</li>
            <li> It trims your nose hair without much pain.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t burn up the battery too fast, it doesn&#x27;t pull and snag.</li>
            <li> For those like me who have never bought something like this before let me reassure  you: it will not pull your hair out, it&#x27;s gentle, and it works.  </li>
            <li> The hair on my ears was just getting to be too much</li>
            <li> Especailly with ears and nose because you can&#x27;t really \\&quot;see\\&quot; as you cut.</li>
            <li> but you really have to work it to get at everything</li>
            <li> There nothing fancy or unusual about this product.</li>
            <li> But really, they save him from saying a lot of &amp;#34;Ow&amp;#34;s while plucking.</li>
            <li> Works very well...</li>
            <li> This was a a fantastic item until it stopped working totally.  </li>
            <li> Very functional.</li>
            <li> of them are a shadow of what they once were, thanks to lawyers.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t fit back in.</li>
            <li> I am hearing unusual noises after I did this</li>
            <li> I much prefer this style of trimmer to some of the others on the market.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe there is so much out there that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t heatup too much either.  </li>
            <li> This is my third one I purchased and by far this one is the one I am most comfortable with because of its simple ergonomics.</li>
            <li> While using it to clean my nose hairs, it initially felt as if to not be strong enough</li>
            <li> Hopefully this will not only keep it sanitary but also keep it running smoothly.</li>
            <li> Also, the strength of the buzzer is great and doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind.</li>
            <li> I expected more for the price.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull hair and can trim hair very closely</li>
            <li> careful Im sure u will hurt your fingers</li>
            <li> I was very uneasy about this product.</li>
            <li> did not cut the hairs very well</li>
            <li> It has worked really well and hasn&#x27;t pulled any of the hairs out making my eyes water....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now purchased four of these - they work great in the beginning but all have broken within 6-12 months.  </li>
            <li> Got this for my husband&#x27;s nose hair and he really likes it.  </li>
            <li> They really work.</li>
            <li> The one thing that I really did like about this trimmer is that it does not pull your hair at all.</li>
            <li> I really like the cleaning features.</li>
            <li> very effeciant and works as described</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> I still use it so I would recommend it to someone who wants one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really amazed that this got rated so well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim very well.</li>
            <li> Cheap Chinese product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much much quieter than the unit it replaces.  </li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say really.</li>
            <li> and i feel like it doesnt spin as fast as it once did.</li>
            <li> It does the job very well without tugging on my nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> Once I&#x27;ve finished gently brushing out the hairs, I proceed to use my Norelco shaver lubricant to aid in the cleaning and lubrication of the cutter blade.  </li>
            <li> I bought a cheap trimmer a while back</li>
            <li> This really works my husband loves it</li>
            <li> Hair...who wants it sticking out from your nose.</li>
            <li> Very dependable.  </li>
            <li> Cheaply manufactured, buy a different model or brand.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic cuts very well, &amp; is very well made.</li>
            <li> works well really gets in their    </li>
            <li> Not so much for ears.</li>
            <li> so you have to really work it for a while to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know how much I needed one until I bought this.  </li>
            <li> It has a very quality look and feel.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> We both highly recommend!</li>
            <li> The product worked very well for 6 weeks, and then promptly broke.</li>
            <li> haha...</li>
            <li> Not used very often</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A must have for everyone (male or female) that wants to be nicely groomed in the nose area or ears.  </li>
            <li> Very well designed.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with the fact that it can be used in a wet environment.</li>
            <li> and it got here fast</li>
            <li> i found online, makes shopping so much easier for me</li>
            <li> It works very well</li>
            <li> But for nose and ears it works very well.  </li>
            <li> (Tip: be gentle in the nose.</li>
            <li> it works really well.  </li>
            <li> have not had any issues and its prices very well...</li>
            <li> but it really works really well</li>
            <li> and it really does what it claims,</li>
            <li> reasonably fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This one does the job very well.  </li>
            <li> HAHAHA</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that you can rinse it while running</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I did way to much research before buying this one, but it works very well indeed.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer head is a thinner metal, so the hairs get trimmed much shorter.</li>
            <li> It also doesn&#x27;t have the problem of corrosion buildup on the battery contacts, so I always get fast speeds.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use it every now and again, Can&#x27;t say much about it.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and it&#x27;s convenient and non-intrusive.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  </li>
            <li> I need to really use it throughly.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27; very grateful for it</li>
            <li> Only con is it feels cheap</li>
            <li> it is gentle at removing hair and does not hurt.</li>
            <li> This works very well and does not tug or cause any discomfort.  </li>
            <li> I like how it doesn&#x27;t make much noise.  </li>
            <li> Fast and quite.</li>
            <li> This is a very trustworthy shops.</li>
            <li> This thing runs very quietly and smoothly that i was not at all worried about jamming this into my nose.  </li>
            <li> I just felt so much cleaner</li>
            <li> light and works qith only one battery</li>
            <li> Gentle.  </li>
            <li> This thing worked fast and painless.</li>
            <li> but on my head, and this trimmer is a real harvester.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;First time in, I was rooting around inside my nose hoping that when I pulled the device out, all the hair would be gone (a reasonable expectation, I thought).</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do a superb job cutting nose hairs or ear hairs.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull at all, and you can get the nose hairs very close to the skin.  </li>
            <li> Very quiet and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic worked very well for me with no pinching or pulling.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much based on the price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Thanks for this.</li>
            <li> This is really efficient in trimming hair</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband for Christmas along with a 10x lighted mirror to really encourage him to trim.</li>
            <li> I got this for my hubby and he says it really does the job.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t quite seem to give a  real close shave.</li>
            <li> It really worked out real well.  </li>
            <li> I think this nose hair trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much for a trimmer, so I took the chance on buying this one.</li>
            <li> It does everything as it is supposed to, and for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t really need it.  </li>
            <li> I was very leery with nose cutters.</li>
            <li> really tickles!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Additionally, head became very noisy after 10 uses...</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> After years of using models from gift sets and the drug store end caps this unit really impresses.  </li>
            <li> Makes a grooming job much easier.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This works like an electric shaver, in that the hair is cut very close to the skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I primarily use this trimmer for my nose hair, not for facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s because they were coming straight from my nose...</li>
            <li> but they really do the job</li>
            <li> /&gt;Trimmed Ears: Works very well on ears as well</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Gently trims the hairs with no pulling or irritation at all.  </li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> so i can&#x27;t really comment on that part.  </li>
            <li> Worked better than expected.</li>
            <li> I debated and compared a whole slew of products before ordering anything.  </li>
            <li> This one really works, for nose hair anyway.</li>
            <li> Product works very well, would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> Trims hair really well</li>
            <li> bottom line is that it&#x27;s reasonably priced and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well in clipping the nose hairs.</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t really rave about anything</li>
            <li> It works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hit the age when those nose hairs start getting really straggly.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> Works very well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as much as I would like.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t see them very well anymore.</li>
            <li> The panasonic trimmer really does the job well.</li>
            <li> So, really like this product.</li>
            <li> But not so much now.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and it works very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really got to jab it around in my nose to get the hair out</li>
            <li> Nothing really to complain about.</li>
            <li> Also very finicky about cleaning.</li>
            <li> This thing works really well.</li>
            <li> Whatever its cheap and solid.</li>
            <li> I was a plucker before, and this is soooo much nicer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a whole heck of a lot involved in men&#x27;s grooming.</li>
            <li> Really like the way it cleans under running water.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> The blades do have too be cleaned very often.</li>
            <li> very well built and the stock battery that comes with it</li>
            <li> Works really well and have had no issues at all.</li>
            <li> For the money it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> thanks to Amazon and Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Thanks guys.</li>
            <li> Was gentle when removing hair.  </li>
            <li> Ergonomically very well designed.</li>
            <li> For home use or road warriors, this is a very dependable companion.</li>
            <li> my whole life.</li>
            <li> very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really?</li>
            <li> But with this one he came  up to me and thanked me to buy it for him and said that it works really well</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for anyone that wants to groom their ear and nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Ugh, who wants to even think about this grooming issue.</li>
            <li> I expected better from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product for his nose and ears.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well 4 or 5 times, then broke, and I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on, as if it had no power source.  </li>
            <li> It cleans very well, but requires patience if you do it once a week.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stop them from growing, but now have a reasonable way to remove.  </li>
            <li> Returned it and Amazon issued a refund (hassle-free, thanks amazon).  </li>
            <li> This  &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; is the real McCoy....cuts through hair w/o pulls or tears.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t really see how this works</li>
            <li> Arrived fast and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s so much quieter—which is really helpful when trimming the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works very well for an inexpensive item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, but only in price.</li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> Functional, reasonable priced.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work as well as described.</li>
            <li> It really is water proof.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> But it does stay on very well when using it.</li>
            <li> Compared to cheap Chinese one I had:&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
            <li> Pulled nose hairs too much</li>
            <li> Nothing I can really complain about.</li>
            <li> Works even better than expected.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  </li>
            <li> Said it works very well and that it doesn&#x27;t tug or pinch when he&#x27;s using</li>
            <li> but perhaps that puts too much of a chance to suffer a skin abrasion.  </li>
            <li> None really did the job as these do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it does it fast.</li>
            <li> Work really well.</li>
            <li> he really likes it would recommend d</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon for taking care of this</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad Christmas 2011, and he really likes it.</li>
            <li> It works really well, but for some reason it stopped working after not being used for a while, it lasted about 2 years.</li>
            <li> Very efficient</li>
            <li> They just never seemed to work very well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few similar nose/ear trimmers, but this is definitely the best ever.</li>
            <li> my dad really enjoys this shaver.</li>
            <li> Received a very damaged product.</li>
            <li> Thanks for the defective product.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> But, this continued for a whole month.</li>
            <li> My doctor gave my an antibiotic, but fornutately said not to use unless I really needed it.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic model cuts very close</li>
            <li> I really liked it and have been using for a few months without any issues.</li>
            <li> Just okay but not great as many stated.</li>
            <li> which is far better than the last trimmer</li>
            <li> Mine has lasted awhile so far, but I have this feeling that with more regular use it may not hold up</li>
            <li> This is worth paying a few dollars more for.  </li>
            <li> I got tired of trying to trim them the best I could with my regular electric shaver.</li>
            <li> I really liked it until it stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> I have owned several nose hair trimmers and this is my favorite so far.  </li>
            <li> I initially really liked this product, but after a few uses it was as if the razor became blunted</li>
            <li> We liked it enough to buy a second one for grandpa!</li>
            <li> The only thing it doesn&#x27;t do better than the old one is get stray neck hairs as well.  </li>
            <li> I got this to use for upper lip hair and it does a good job, not great but good enough.</li>
            <li> Fits nicely in either hand, not at all heavy.</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a short time, but so far so good.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact it takes regular old batteries too.</li>
            <li> although more frequent, is similar.  </li>
            <li> I could just imagine this getting wound up, grabbing and HOLDING a few nose hairs, and getting lodged for some hilarious pain bringing fun, but this trimmer conquers the job without even a wince.  </li>
            <li> Nice and small, has a cap for the top and it is not loud.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different trimmers and they all have been complete junk.  </li>
            <li> The best I have ever had next to an underfed goat and does not leave behind reminders littering your yard that you must bag up for disposal.</li>
            <li> no.&lt;br /&gt;I would just have to say it is no worse than others and not a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my order and look forward in the near future to do business with this company again.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I would definitely recommend this if you just want a simple no nonsense</li>
            <li> Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a basic and effective trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is my third trimmer like this and by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> Overall better than the 15 year old unit it replaced.  </li>
            <li> it seems pretty safe as long as you don&#x27;t jam it up your nose way too far</li>
            <li> It also gets quite warm after using it for just a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Solid product that works as expected for a good price.</li>
            <li> At around $15 it won&#x27;t break the bank but at the same time is is made with far more attention to quality and utility.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update the review if it breaks down, but as of today, I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li> In fact, I busted my dad sniffing around this little guy at our house, so he received his very own for Christmas this last year &amp; loves it.</li>
            <li> Same as other reviewers- thing worked great initially, but after the first few uses I went to clean it, took the top apart to clean it and put it back together</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is a bit odd the first time using it - personally I was skittish</li>
            <li> While the flat blades have worked fine, the nose hair trimmer was worthless.&lt;br /&gt;Bought</li>
            <li> I bought this new model Panasonic about a month ago and found it to be as good as the Panasonics of the past.  </li>
            <li> Very quiet  works very well !!!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, efficient and just plain works.</li>
            <li> Rarely works, have to take out battery and twist the bottom back on just right for it to start.</li>
            <li> Well this little piece of magic is like a vibrator for your nose yet removes the thick bush you have growing up there very easily and pain free</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not tough at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a tough reviewed</li>
            <li> Mostly all with less than stellar results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other trimmers and this one has been BY FAR the best.</li>
            <li> while it worked properly, it did a good job with trimming those pesky nose hairs very closely without pulling or pinching (as some other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned have done).</li>
            <li> okay as well, but prefer a straight edge to do those areas as it&#x27;s hard to create a clean line with this.  </li>
            <li> Very handy, solid and heavy.</li>
            <li> Gets all the hair and is super easy to clean being a wet dry.</li>
            <li> , I decided to buy a new one hoping the first was just&lt;br /&gt;a &amp;#34;dud.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It does the job without getting hot or needing a new blade every year</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just the battery, however even with a new battery it pulls the hair out...</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was like using a new lawn mower on a lawn that hadn&#x27;t been mown in months.</li>
            <li> Should have returned right away because within about 3 months it just stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very expensive, so I say \\&quot;grab</li>
            <li> I really like how fast it is and the multiple ways to clean the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
            <li> the clip is always closed when you trim and open it when you clean the inside but always make sure to close it before you start</li>
            <li> It cuts quick and easy without pulling, even on the coarse facial beard hair.  </li>
            <li> Other facial hair, well not so good.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had other trimmers before but this one is much quieter and more efficient than others.</li>
            <li> Clean up is super each as the parts are removable and the blade continues to stay sharp.</li>
            <li> Instead of just buying another Panasonic, I tried 2 other brands that just weren&#x27;t as good and now have come back to Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> The original Panasonics provided a close trim but then there was a generation or two that left to much stubble.</li>
            <li> After a good rinsing it also seems to work well for trimming other stray facial hairs.</li>
            <li> but I still use a rechargeable because I already have it and keep them ready for many other things I have.</li>
            <li> The convenience of being able to use this in the shower really separates this from other brands.</li>
            <li> It does not, however, completely replace scissors for hairs that lie flat (and tickle the most).  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well, and much better than my Phillips (linear) trimmer, or any other trimmer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> It worked okay, though not amazing, each use to significant</li>
            <li> The real problem is that it eats through batteries fast, draining a new AA battery after a just a handful of uses!  </li>
            <li> This is very nice, works just as we needed it to with unnecessary hairs.  </li>
            <li> thing that would be great for a future model would be a small white LED light in the tip to make it easier to see the lighter colored hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is pretty quiet, does a good trim on nose hair, the errant eyebrow hairs, inside my deep chin dimple and the occasional trim around the edge of my ears.</li>
            <li> The new trimmer is easy to hold and operates quietly.  </li>
            <li> New batteries didn&#x27;t help; they were simply drained of energy very quickly.</li>
            <li> So far has been working flawlessly for several months, same batteries and trims much closer than a previous trimmer I had.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: although iPhones can be used in many social situations unobtrusively, I would discourage anyone from using nostril hair trimmer while dining, at a social function, or flying.</li>
            <li> I Guess I&#x27;m not a sasquatch like some of the reviewers, and need it for really the occasional trim, clean up, and stragglers.</li>
            <li> Okay, what the heck is up with getting older and having hair growing out of your nose and ears at an alarming rate?  </li>
            <li> Works better than any other one that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Just bought this one because my other is better for travel.  </li>
            <li> Works better than any other nose clippers I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be better than than any other trimmer I have tried.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but I&#x27;ve picked up cheaper ones that work a little better.</li>
            <li> This little device was exactly the inexpensive solution i needed for a growing problem &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> I have not had to replace the batteries; still original that came with the unit several months ago.  </li>
            <li> Love this, doesn&#x27;t pull hair like the other one do.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other nose trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased for my husband.  </li>
            <li> Works so much better than other brands that I have used.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull, at least yet, and is pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This unit is much better than my other one from Brookstone.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to have appropriate power and sharp blades.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other ones you are also able to wash it and use it in the shower.  </li>
            <li> a little warm around the metal tip, which is normal, but</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s more well made than most and will last longer than these trimmers usually do.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Trims closer and has more power than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> The corrosion was easy enough to clean up, but the contacts needed to be stretched afterwards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> After 5 mins the hairs in nose and ears are non-existent after being wookie-like for years!&lt;br /&gt;Blades are sharp and safe.</li>
            <li> My unit is not a lone, I have heard this from many other people who have owned this device....  </li>
            <li> It does the work much better than any other trimmers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> The product feels sturdier and better made than the other&#x27;s</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this since other reviews said it quit working soon after they got it.  </li>
            <li> This thing works better than any other nose hair trimmer I have ever used</li>
            <li> This works much better than any other product or method I have used.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried three other trimmers before this, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> do I know if any of the other products listed on Amazon in this category are better.</li>
            <li> knew there was a better way for him to stay &amp;#34;manscaped&amp;#34; and leave sharp twinges of pain out of it.</li>
            <li> Quiet, painless, long battery life, easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> Works much much better than the other two brands I bought from Amazon</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s other, cheaper version is better.</li>
            <li> It is better built than other nose hair removers that I have tried.</li>
            <li> but I already like it more than the other two piece-of-crap trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This works better than any other electric trimmer have tried.</li>
            <li> So much better to use than other products i have owned.</li>
            <li> Works better for ear/nose hair than any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
            <li> Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Opting for automatic, I got this one, as there isn&#x27;t many other options out there.</li>
            <li> This product was much better than other Panasonic ones I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Works better than other ones I have bought.</li>
            <li> Better than any other I have used.</li>
            <li> As described it works much better than the other type of nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried most of the other nose hair removal tools around, but they all hurt him.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, quiet and runs a long time on one battery.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s not very techie nor handy, and this is simple to use I didn&#x27;t notice him struggling with it for the first time or anything...</li>
            <li> This product trims nosehair better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> It cuts better than the 4 other brands I tried.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I left it with original pack for couple of weeks, then I started using it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> And after all that, I had to go back and use it again right away because it left huge conspicuous hairs untouched after the first use.  </li>
            <li> The best nose trimmer that I have ever used and highly recommend it because it has two cutting blades..</li>
            <li> Ideal for cleaning up the long hairs that are hard to get to otherwise.</li>
            <li> Really works deep and right!</li>
            <li> It just tickles my nose hairs without pulling on them and is very easy to clean with the little water spout in the back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer it to have a little more power than the single AA battery is able to provide but the trimmer performs as advertised a with no problems.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheaper to buy a whole new one than buy parts for one!  </li>
            <li> Works great... not quite as robust as I expected, or as powerful, but generally meets or exceeds my expectations in all other areas.</li>
            <li> This is very light, much lighter than my previous trimmer, so I was concerned if it would perform as well.  </li>
            <li> Simple to clean.  </li>
            <li> He finds it simple to use and keep clean.  </li>
            <li> Should I open it up and clean it out?  </li>
            <li> use this probably once a week to just buzz areas, I&#x27;d recommend it to any guy who&#x27;s looking for a clean look, especially in the nose</li>
            <li> quiet operation, zero pulling, zero pinching, just clean to the skin &#x27;cut&#x27; of nasal hair or ear hair.</li>
            <li> It is tiny compared to most trimmers, it barely fits in my hand.  </li>
            <li> For ten bucks it&#x27;s everything I wanted to clean nose hairs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Great unit, priced a bit higher then others but worth the extra $.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it has such great reviews.</li>
            <li> Has plenty of power and is simple to clean.  </li>
            <li> It will seem to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; with a low battery, but it really isn&#x27;t working at full speed.</li>
            <li> It is small, it works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product but doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave.</li>
            <li> After you are all done just open some cover and run this thing through some water and it will rinse itself clean.</li>
            <li> only suggestion is to take it apart and clean it out.  </li>
            <li> I ran into the same scenario; it stopped working after I went to clean it one time.</li>
            <li> I opened up the blades to clean with the included brush and put it back.</li>
            <li> simple to take apart and clean, and then reassemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Clean and simple.</li>
            <li> Used it for a long time and it works fine.</li>
            <li> only took me about a minute to clean my nose up</li>
            <li> This is much faster and has the added benefit of not cutting the inside of my nose if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> Solid feeling and comes apart easily to clean.  </li>
            <li> but I can not get it open in order to clean it as per instructions.  </li>
            <li> the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Almost looks like oil mixed in with the water used to clean it.</li>
            <li> , I would suggest this to anyone need a Great Trimmer, I have tried other brands including Whal, Remington, And one or two other</li>
            <li> I can clean up my facial hair and nose hair for the price its a no brainer.</li>
            <li> When you remove to clean the device, it does not function properly.</li>
            <li> Works well simple to use and clean</li>
            <li> I especially like the way you just run it under the faucet to clean.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that I&#x27;d have to remove the head and blade to clean, but it will probably make it last longer.</li>
            <li> Generally the item seems a bit inefficient and collectively more time consuming that manual options such as scissors etc.</li>
            <li> But this thing is powerful and actually pretty quiet.</li>
            <li> I bought it to replace an older, wall plugged nose trimmer and this one works very well.</li>
            <li> I especially like the rinse to clean feature</li>
            <li> Disappointed, after so many great reviews.</li>
            <li> Small, effective, and really well designed.</li>
            <li> First, this groomer is powerful enough to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Quiet and clean</li>
            <li> it does a much better job on the first go round.</li>
            <li> Sometimes words just can&#x27;t explain the way a tool can use a surprising amount of power to slice unwanted pieces of your body off so that you don&#x27;t look ridiculous when viewed from below by a shorter person, or</li>
            <li> Not cost effective if that&#x27;s how long they last.</li>
            <li> Also the clean aspect by flushing it with water design isn&#x27;t really applicable and is overall kind of pointless as it doesn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> The product is not bad but for real it is a waste of money, I do not use it any more.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and only needs a single AAA battery.  </li>
            <li> I have used other products in the past and I have to say this one is the best so far.</li>
            <li> It is smooth and easy to trim and reach hard areas.</li>
            <li> When you don&#x27;t have time to clean up eyebrows, or bleach your top lip, this does the job in a very small amount of time.</li>
            <li> As I get older the more my hair grows from places other than my head.</li>
            <li> but if that&#x27;s the case I have other, older &amp; cheaper tools that do a much better job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick and easy to get ride of those pesky nose hairs in less than a minute, I can see myself buying a few more as christmas gifts for the clueless uncles and friends</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well-made, solid in the hand and very smooth and quiet.</li>
            <li> very practical&lt;br /&gt;light, invisible in a pocket or brush my teeth, it is well done and thought I highly recommend</li>
            <li> Never a distraught day has gone by without the pain of me personally plucking out each individual nose hair that dared to grow outside of its limits with my own fingers.</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised at the quality given the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for the results and the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I think it will eventually fall down to the original price of $12-13 whenever it becomes available directly through amazon.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to buy this for my husband as a joke, and he was the most excited for this gift over any other gift!</li>
            <li> Running the trimmer head under the faucet may not be enough for maintenance; consider keeping a can of Cool Care (B000LNB8HK) on hand to clean, lubricate and disinfect your clippers; it comes in a big 15.5 oz.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; batteries so much as it just won&#x27;t work, period, with brand new</li>
            <li> The trim is so incredibly close and with such little effort, no pulling, and such ease.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say really, its a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> it works but isn&#x27;t as easy and convenient as I anticipated; maybe I expected too much.</li>
            <li> Old unit was easy on the battery, I had one alkaline last for years and the one that&#x27;s in it</li>
            <li> Does a good job, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and gets the hair off your ears, in your ears where ever that old age hair starts to grow next.</li>
            <li> lasting good time now almost one year and a half.</li>
            <li> They cut good and he likes the wet &amp; dry option as well.</li>
            <li> Works wet just as good as it does dry.</li>
            <li> is a ok item still too much money as a bundle deal,should be less as a bundle deal wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and get razor bumps easily, I use it to trim my nose and facial hair.</li>
            <li> Debated spending a tiny bit less with other models, but this one is awesome.  </li>
            <li> Product has lasted less than a year with very light use.</li>
            <li> little device is well worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly and without any problems!</li>
            <li> The clean up is NOT easy and I do not notice a significant change after use.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but so far it works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, performs as expected, and low price.</li>
            <li> if it breaks in a couple of months its cheap as dirt, I don&#x27;t care as long as I keep getting results like I</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean, simple to operate, gets the job done with minimal hair pulling.  </li>
            <li> Quiet and more powerful than I expected.  </li>
            <li> The instructions are pretty clear there is an on/off switch and a dial indicating operational or cleaning mode.</li>
            <li> Actually, I can&#x27;t really imagine more expensive products doing a better job than this one.</li>
            <li> I recommend putting it near the area you want to trim first and then turn it on...</li>
            <li> Ive tried several different trimmers and most don&#x27;t trim very well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice, small, and eash to use.</li>
            <li> Small, inexpensive, lightweight, compact and effective.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet...  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only thing keeping me from giving it a full five stars.  </li>
            <li> The following is true</li>
            <li> Way cool facial hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve been seeing ads for rotary nose hair trimmers all my life and when I was young</li>
            <li> My husband is pretty young.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s small, and you have to purchase your own AA batteries</li>
            <li> Well what better way to really look truly your best by trimming that disgusting nose hair sticking out of your nose!</li>
            <li> Both models not only remove hair similarly, but battery life is the same, despite the claimed superior specs of the ER GN30K model.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for both the occasional prune and, when necessary, massive deforestation.  </li>
            <li> Still catches nose hairs pretty frequently</li>
            <li> Small and effective.</li>
            <li> Tip is too small to effectively cover areas. .  </li>
            <li> : I bought this in early August, received it the first week of August and used it twice since its purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not worth the time and money to bother, I know for sure</li>
            <li> Later, I ordered Andis Cool Care Plus for Clipper Blades and that did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I argue that if you go after a full beard with just an electric razor, it will probably offer similar hair plucking.  </li>
            <li> First thing I did was use my old nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Breaks after return period is up and warranty replacement and shipping is more than buying another, but who wants another that will only last 32 days?</li>
            <li> The key for a good personal trimmer seems to be enough power.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s full potential.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unique to the Vortex is a spinning cutter and cone shape, which both contribute towards its better than average job.</li>
            <li> tweeze my nose hair sometimes, and while it&#x27;s not really painful it does put my sinuses on overdrive which makes my nose run and my eyes tear up briefly.</li>
            <li> Have used a few trimmers in my day and this particular trimmer stands out so far as being designed to be the most useful of the bunch.</li>
            <li> Cuts most of my hair in my nose, gets all the little hairs on my chin and cheeks, but when I tried it on my eyebrows it made my eyebrow bright red, so not really useful if you want to use it for that use.</li>
            <li> Like with anything, as long as you maintain this and regularly clean it, it works very well.</li>
            <li> I am glad my Conair broke down.  </li>
            <li> My hair has slowed down growing on top and is now sprouting from my nose and ears.  </li>
            <li> Better design allowing for quiet operation, quick cutting and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My husband says this trimmer works better than any other he has ever owned and has lasted longer as well!</li>
            <li> Way better than all the other cheapo imposters!  </li>
            <li> MUCH better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
            <li> So be sure to read the user&#x27;s manual carefully before using !!</li>
            <li> As everyone who follows this thread knows, a few years ago Panasonic had a very fine product, the er 411.</li>
            <li> Good little personal grooming device.  </li>
            <li> This little item keeps unwanted hair out of many places, and travels really well.</li>
            <li> He is the only one that uses it, so I believe just rinses the little tip off &amp; it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
            <li> With so little motor RPM that is likely a good guess.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t encountered any problem so far, definitely much better than my previous unbranded one which I bought very cheap.</li>
            <li> Yes ( even with new batteries!)</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband  who needed a new trimmer and he loves this one!</li>
            <li> Lesson learned, use a new battery when you start!  </li>
            <li> You will see it in the photo along side my new Panasonic Trimmer!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bog down like most and has a clever water port for rinsing.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, quiet, and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have used several similar products in the past and my Panasonic is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> Thirty dollar stainless still sharp scissors from two decades ago aren&#x27;t this easy.</li>
            <li> Actually works great, with no pain, cuts hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a bit tricky and hard to get used to, but the locking mechanism confirms a secure fit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean, gets every hard to reach hair.</li>
            <li> Seems much more powerful than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used with the same battery.  </li>
            <li> though this product isn&#x27;t really for me, the combination of the warranty, the ability of using it with water / getting it wet, performance, and for the price, I would say this is a good buy for anyone who needs to trim some hair in their nose or ear without sticking sharp objects in it.  </li>

            <li> Far superior to other brands of a similar item.</li>
            <li> Even with a new alkaline battery, the chopping power falls off fast.  </li>
            <li> New to trimming nose hair, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this to.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Panasonic for my new friends.</li>
            <li> It was time to replace the blade anyway, and it&#x27;s easier and cheaper to just buy a whole new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That makes it cheaper to buy a whole new unit every 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I really needed one, had been putting off getting a new one.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s barely trimming any of my nose hair right now.</li>
            <li> I use it mainly for my ears, so that it is easier for me to insert ear plugs at night to sleep (We live in a really noisy neighbourhood.).</li>
            <li> The blade is the most expensive part of the trimmer according to panasonics website, its just better to purchase a whole new one on amazon.</li>
            <li> Really good for precise sculpting without risk of cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> but this was a better buy and less susceptible to injury and a trip to the hospital.</li>
            <li> Less is more with this.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the previous model.</li>
            <li> It does a much better job than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li> It works a lot better that the &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; model I had previously.</li>
            <li> The rounded cap on top has a blade on the inside, the blade is placed slightly lower than the tip of the cap.</li>
            <li> better than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> So glad I got one of these, takes less time and it works so well....</li>
            <li> It does a much better job than the previous models.  </li>
            <li> Seems to be much better made than my previous con-air.  </li>
            <li> Is holding up better than the previous one (don&#x27;t recall the brand), but it eats batteries.</li>
            <li> Then, after owning it for less than 6 months and using it maybe a dozen times at most, it never turned on at all.</li>
            <li> Previous competitive models have done a better job of trimming.</li>
            <li> Easy clean-up using the wet feature for cleaning out the hair using tap water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also used the Norelco NT9110, which I thought worked well compared to others, but I think the Panasonic Vortex is more thorough with less effort.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and is better than the previous device I owned.  </li>
            <li> Way better than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> The product is also made with a slight curve as to better maneuver inside your nostrils, and believe me it does make a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a four because it works much better than the previous two I purchased (Wahl and Conaire).</li>
            <li> The cleanup is also super simple, with a twist water is allowed to flow freely through the appliance and dry as well.</li>
            <li> previously I had a trimmer that had vertical blades, the spinning blades on this work much better.</li>
            <li> Works well and seem to clip better than the ones I have had previously.</li>
            <li> Works well and seem to clip better than the ones I have had previously.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s not very noisy.</li>
            <li> This is a problem I&#x27;ve noticed in most nose-hair trimmers which I find odd, but it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much better made than my previous one.</li>
            <li> Seems like after 50 you get less hair where you want it and a lot more where you don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Works better trimming than previous versions.  </li>
            <li> Love that it has a slight curve making it easier to operate.  </li>
            <li> Previously had a Remington trimmer, and this is much better.</li>
            <li> Now, my life is like a beer commercial with my super shiny sniffer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product.</li>
            <li> It cleans easier than the older versions but doesn&#x27;t cut hair as well</li>
            <li> I HAD AN OLDER VERSION OF THIS THAT LASTED 10 YEARS</li>
            <li> Its quiet, quick, and efficient.</li>
            <li> As I got older nose hair become another grooming issue that I was not used to having to deal with.</li>
            <li> First off, this is my first and only nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li> My only issue, and I need to figure this out, is that it seems to have more energy when I use a regular battery.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what I plan to do when my older Panasonic \\&quot;dies\\&quot;  ... \\&quot;perish the thought.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Worked well initially but quickly faded.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been looking for a decent trimmer for a couple of years now.  </li>
            <li> Tried many different batteries and it simply won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It not only cuts better, but is quieter at the same time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure you could find a more expensive one</li>
            <li> But, as I get older, I seem to be growing hair in all the areas that I would prefer not to.  </li>
            <li> as we get older we find we have hair growing out of spots that we could never imagine.  </li>
            <li> I particularly like the cleaning ability for this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I compared it to a older design (that I still have) of a Panasonic nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this product as a way of getting a close trip on my mustache around the nose area.</li>
            <li> after buying the first one I bought a second just in case it is not longer sold when the first one wears out..</li>
            <li> This is a classic example of</li>
            <li> does a decent job</li>
            <li> Seems to do a decent job.  </li>
            <li> It has been working great and battery seems to last at least a couple of months.  </li>
            <li> Particularly on and in my ears and nose hair.  </li>
            <li> This item replaces an older Panasonic nose and ear hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Work great so far, not sure if it will last long, but anyway it was cheap</li>
            <li> Decent product.</li>
            <li> No amount of care you take with this product can keep it alive when it is just made to be as cheap as possible.</li>
            <li> Granted, it&#x27;s only been used once, but it did the job quickly, efficiently and I wasn&#x27;t bleeding when I was done</li>
            <li> I expect this product to last for years, but even if it only makes it to the two year warranty, I&#x27;d be satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This replaced an older model that lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li> I even gave it one of those classic accidental drops upon opening and it was unscathed.</li>
            <li> hairs men get on their ears when they get older</li>
            <li> Takes a few passes and different angles but get the job done, good value.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a older panasonic for over 10 years</li>
            <li> There is no pain involved with trimming nose hair only a tickling that luckily hasn&#x27;t caused me to sneeze... yet.</li>
            <li> It trims the places that us older guys want to trim, ears, nose, eyebrows..</li>
            <li> He wanted it mainly for nose hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older and hairy</li>
            <li> Decent.  </li>
            <li> but I mainly use it for nose hairs.</li>
            <li> (I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid ear hair so far, so I can’t speak to that.</li>
            <li> He said he likes them better than the last one I bought that lasted for several years.  </li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic a few years back that I loved.  </li>
            <li> Decent on nose hair but doesn&#x27;t get everything.</li>
            <li> However, motors do not last more than about a year with occasional use.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and have a decent battery life.</li>
            <li> No pulling, quick, quiet.</li>
            <li> I once had one of these panasonic nose and facial hair trimmer and it was just ok, (earlier model).  </li>
            <li> (why is it as I grow older, I get less hair on my head and more in those places?)  </li>
            <li> Replaced an older style Panasonic trimer with this one and what a difference.</li>
            <li> Your getting older when you need one of these lol&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I have nose hairs that stick out and are always tickling me and this thing does a decent job of getting rid of them.</li>
            <li> Build quality is decent for something in this price range.</li>
            <li> Battery life is decent.</li>
            <li> I had an older panasonic.</li>
            <li> This frankly doesn&#x27;t do that great a job, especially since I have some thick hair.</li>
            <li> This is done cleanly, quietly and quickly with no pain at all.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of this particular model, but in my experience, even with the &#x27;cheapest&#x27; models, longevity has never been the issue.  </li>
            <li> I have tried one or two other clippers and they didn&#x27;t work at all, so I am pleased so far!</li>
            <li> but it works decently.  </li>
            <li> I replaced on older Panasonic hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The small size makes it sweet to fit into my cosmetic drawer.</li>
            <li> It seems as I get older hair is migrating from where I want it - to where I do not want it.</li>
            <li> As i stated in my review for my ER430K, I bought this item in order to use its blade as a replacement part for my much older</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> Decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> Way better then traditional scissors which has risk of damaging nose inner skins.</li>
            <li> It does seem to use a battery up sort of quick, but that is the only downside.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the battery life isn&#x27;t great.  </li>
            <li> Though, it&#x27;s still a decent buy for the price, I guess.</li>
            <li> have read where people have mixed reviews when it came to them touching up their facial hair and eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> you will have to go back and touch up with a regular scissors every now and again, but mostly this will be all you need.</li>
            <li> After using several products totally in love with this one, especially for its performance, looks and ability to do what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> As I get older, I have less hair on my head, and more everywhere else.  </li>
            <li> As I have gotten older</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price.</li>
            <li> Decent value for price.</li>
            <li> You can also do a quick, simple mustache touch up with it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift &amp; it&#x27;s much more solid than the current 1</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m older and as I age</li>
            <li> The older one still worked, but I knew I&#x27;d never use it  again.</li>
            <li> , it was pretty quiet when I first got it, try not to drop yours.</li>
            <li> I have owned several of these in different brands, and this one is distinctly better than any of the others.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Panasonic unit which needed to have the blades replaced.  </li>
            <li> As guys get older eyebrows, ears and nose hair grows.</li>
            <li> Trims hair quickly and painlessly and then stores away in a bathroom drawer until the next time you need some grooming.</li>
            <li> It seems the older</li>
            <li> Definitely a worthwhile purchase, especially if the barber is starting to trim nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and the feedback is that it does a decent job on nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> My how things change when you get older.</li>
            <li> I thought that this would be great as I usually have long nose hairs</li>
            <li> It does the job - I use it mainly for nose hair.</li>
            <li> Works well and was decent value for the price.</li>
            <li> These tend to last me about 3-4 years but would probably last more if I didn&#x27;t drop it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked way better than one I had for several years prior.</li>
            <li> So simple to use, quick and painless.</li>
            <li> Had an older Panasonic  and</li>
            <li> I would use the Panasonic to target a particular area, but afterwards it did not do its job.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve been getting older, hairs have begun sprouting out of areas</li>
            <li> Buy in a pinch decent price...</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;m getting older, these frikkin nose hairs have been just driving me nuts.  </li>
            <li> first I thought they might hurt my nose, but the exact opposite  happened.</li>
            <li> My son recommended it and its working better than I thought it would having had several over the years that simply did not do the job.</li>
            <li> decent product for a decent price</li>
            <li> Motor sounded powerful, but did not actually trim very well.  </li>
            <li> I use it mainly to maintain the hair in nostrils, over the ears a couple of times a month</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a series of cheapos (older wahl, etc.)</li>
            <li> This is a decent product.</li>
            <li> i would recommend it particularly for guys like me who have a wife with a nose hair problem and will not admit it..</li>
            <li> A quick twist and then blow out the clippings - simple.</li>
            <li> I am getting older now</li>
            <li> Does not do even a decent job.  </li>
            <li> I was using a less sophisticated nose trimmer, which was decent, but required turning and angling to get at the nasal hairs.</li>
            <li> its decent for the price.</li>
            <li> Decent for the price.  </li>
            <li> we get older</li>
            <li> Otherwise a decent value</li>
            <li> Save yourself the time and aggravation and just get a decent nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Top screen above the speaker was dented, and after pairing with my phone, there was simply no audio, even after turning the volume up.</li>
            <li> This is a decent nose trimmer for the cost.</li>
            <li> My older one&#x27;s blade got screwed up</li>
            <li> If it does, I doubt there&#x27;s a similar product in the same price range that&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> This unit was purchased to replace an older  unit.  </li>
            <li> All of the reviews were strong, so I expected this to work well.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use full batteries.pulls a little with low batteries.</li>
            <li> Much more powerful than other cheap trimmers I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> , then it started making very loud noises, still seemed to work, but the noise was too much.  </li>
            <li> It took many passes whereas my previous trimmer cut the hair on the very first swipe with no extra pressure required.</li>
            <li> Ergonomically comfortable, it uses a single AA battery.  </li>
            <li> If you still have trouble breathing, get an air filter and a good vacuum for your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It has worked very well so far, even in the shower!</li>
            <li> Very please so far with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This seemingly oversized trimmer really does work, without the pain of rusty old scissors!  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last long when they get wet as the blade rusts, but for the price they are great</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance for Christmas because he really needed one and he has no complaints so far!</li>
            <li> Does the job very well, I like it so far!</li>
            <li> But, thanks to my Cro-Magnon buddies for me being alive!</li>
            <li> It works very well, pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> Worked better than expected, easy to use, not much clean up.</li>
            <li> , cant say how long it will last but for the price if it last a year or 2 that will be good</li>
            <li> After a while, though, it stopped working because of too many hairs getting trapped inside, and my cleaning it out would not get it back to full operation.</li>
            <li> Said it was kind of loud especially in his ears but as long as it works</li>
            <li> Fair warning, if you are trimming your nose and the blade gets stuck on a particularly thick nose hair, you are in for a bit of pain!</li>
            <li> Also, when you clean the blade and put it back in place, if you push down too far the machine becomes a lot more noisy.  </li>
            <li> Great for quickly and painlessly trimming those pesky little hairs that grow in delicate areas.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected, and the product got to my house quickly.</li>
            <li> Old unit wasn&#x27;t waterproof, new one not only is, but is much easier to clean with its flow through cutter head feature.  </li>
            <li> The blades come fairly sharp already and more or less cut the hair easily.</li>
            <li> Will highly recommend.</li>

            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> in all, this one comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> So, if you want that clean look with no wild hair in your eye brows, ear and nose, this is the trimer for you.</li>
            <li> It can be rinsed when needed ( always clean with soap and water after using it in your nose) and has long battery life.</li>
            <li> my ears and nose have not been so clean of hair in a long time.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to use and that it is much safer than I expected.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to clean WELL with the wet dry design.  </li>
            <li> As long as you keep it clean</li>
            <li> I like to stay clean, and this product does it for my long nose hairs.</li>
            <li> By far its better than the other trimmers I have bought.</li>
            <li> It leaves my nose trimmed as expected and has held up just fine.</li>
            <li> It seems to be well-made and I particularly like that it is warranteed and the battery life of one AA battery, with normal use, is about two years.  </li>
            <li> This meant that I&#x27;d always have to keep a super fresh battery in it, and was constantly dealing with low motor speeds and pulled hairs.</li>
            <li> Wow this nose trimmer blows my other one out of the water , love it</li>
            <li> Over all I think this light duty tool will be able to tame my nose hairs for a long time.</li>
            <li> A bit bulkier than expected, when compared to another Panasonic hair remover I had owned before, but works fine</li>
            <li> use it mostly for my ears(dry mode not in the shower),last thing you want in your 50&#x27;s-60&#x27;s is a buzz of high decibels taking out what little hearing you have left.&lt;br /&gt;easy</li>
            <li> U certainly have to be awake when using this even in the early morning</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, compact, and very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very cheaply made, and the battery does not last that long.</li>
            <li> But over the years it got older and older and I needed to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> No complaints so far!!</li>
            <li> I love this little device--I&#x27;ve had it about 2 or 3 weeks</li>
            <li> Avoid and get something a little more durable.</li>
            <li> Wish it felt a little better made</li>
            <li> Tickles a little bit, but not horrible.  </li>
            <li> (Dropped one too many times on its little trimmer head).  </li>
            <li> after two or three of those little beasts, I just happened to remember my favorite site.....</li>
            <li> Received this today and it works a lot better then those little scissors.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand why they have the rotating top that opens and closes a little port on the side.  </li>
            <li> Love this little trimmer.</li>
            <li> They definitely say go gentle!!</li>
            <li> A little more money</li>
            <li> I love this little thing.</li>
            <li> Could use a little more oomph.</li>
            <li> , I tried this little gadget and am quite satisfied.  </li>
            <li> I must say I am a little embarrassed, but if one person can avoid my experience that&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> Well worth a few bucks to clean the excess.</li>
            <li> New one seems to be harder on the battery, take more juice to work, so I&#x27;ll be surprised if a brand new battery lasts 6 months.  </li>
            <li> The unit appears well built and has performed well for removing nose and other undesirable hair easily and painlessly.</li>
            <li> Sharp and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Sharp an easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use and does not pull hair like other models.</li>
            <li> The sound is a little funny</li>
            <li> Makes what used to be a most unpleasant chore into a quick and easy task which takes no time at all.</li>
            <li> People who sell this kind of stuff should have a hard time sleeping at night.</li>
            <li> The motor is strong and the blades are sharp.</li>
            <li> I was baffled by the price of this trimmer, as it almost seems hard to believe they can make something this nice for this cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use and much better than his previous Shaper Image trimmer, which was more expensive.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I need something a little more powerful, so if you are an especially hairy person, you might want to try something else.  </li>
            <li> that is pretty standard for a decent trimmer, but what sets this unit apart is that it washable!  </li>
            <li> After many years of use, the first one became dull.  </li>
            <li> I was super aprehensive about the first time of using this, but this thing seems to just trim the hairs instead of ripping them out like some other products.</li>
            <li> The price is very reasonable and my Dad likes it better than the more expensive one he had last.</li>
            <li> Had an older name brand trimmer that was worn out and a new brand name trimmer that I just opened.  </li>
            <li> I bought this one for less than half the price, and the new blade lacked the \\&quot;tug and yank\\&quot; feature that I had been accustomed to...for the price this is a great unit.</li>
            <li> Too bad because it would be perfect if it lasted.</li>
            <li> Excellent product in a minefield of bad versions of this type of thing.</li>
            <li> Nothing to complicated and great results.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I expected lol</li>
            <li> Since Panasonic doesn&#x27;t sell a cheap replacement top, the whole trimmer is useless.</li>
            <li> I found a great way if not perfect way to cut the hairs in my nostrils.</li>
            <li> The trimmer makes a grinding sound even after thorough cleanings and careful re-assembly.</li>
            <li> Cheap and works as expected</li>
            <li> He says it works really well and has had no issues with it so far.</li>
            <li> Does very well on ears and nose for this hirsute old man.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had not wasted so much time with the Remington.</li>
            <li> Be sure to clean it after every use, or  the cutting blade is going to get funky quickly.</li>
            <li> Great item for the price can not go wrong , I will recommend this item to any one who needs it</li>
            <li> This is as described and works very well so far.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve surprised myself with how much I use this.</li>
            <li> There is a stainless thimble-shaped-safety-cover which fits over the rotating blades that permit nostril hairs to be trimmed but avoiding direct contact of the blades to the skin.</li>
            <li> My wife and I believe in keeping a neat and professional appearance and now that I am 35 I have to keep up with the areas that use to not require so much attention.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised to find it is gentle but efficient.  </li>
            <li> but I had expected that from a detailed trimmer.</li>
            <li> I dutifully clean it after every use and dry as recommended.  </li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the deal: I was embarrassed to buy a trimmer like this because I find the whole nose hair thing--the fact that I am so old that I have to contend with it--humiliating.  </li>
            <li> After a very noisy experience with my old, shameful trimmer that died,  I ordered this one based on the overwheming reviews.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome trimmer and my husband was shocked at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> Works very well and haven&#x27;t had a problem in nearly 6 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be surprised if the handle even stays attached for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I have to say that this one works very well so far.</li>
            <li> Much better than another one I had picked up a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> Seems powerful enough.</li>
            <li> Trimmed hair in my ear and instant success.</li>
            <li> As this is my first nose and facial hair trimmer, I don&#x27;t have much to compare with.</li>
            <li> Only had it a few weeks, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> It truly is worth the extra money.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it worked just ok for a few weeks then just quit.</li>
            <li> The motor is powerful and does not choke like similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Spend few more dollars or wait till price is $10 for this one.</li>
            <li> I think I&#x27;ll use more than once every few months.</li>
            <li> Come to think of it, though ... for the price, if it only lasts six months it would still be worth it.</li>
            <li> Ladies, Gents, pay a few dollars more for the Brookstone.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this gift - if only I had known sooner what pleasure small things can make in one&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews it seemed like a nice buy, although I did notice 5-10% of the negative reviews indicated that it quit working soon after arrival.  </li>
            <li> ;, but given the proximity to the olfactory senses while in use, I suppose any oddities like that would be pretty apparent.</li>
            <li> It is not overly powerful as it only requires one AA battery.</li>
            <li> Powerful but quiet.</li>
            <li> You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I got this item 2 years ago and it has been getting progressively weaker (as if a battery was getting weaker, even though I placed fresh batteries inside constantly).</li>
            <li> also like that it uses normal AA batteries.</li>
            <li> so will see how long it will last. :)</li>
            <li> It is powerful enough that it doesn&#x27;t pull any hairs.</li>
            <li> Wasnt&#x27; worth to send back</li>
            <li> sure didnt last long</li>
            <li> but I think it is not relevant to the product. :)</li>
            <li> I have a couple different brands of the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; style personal trimmer (not rotary a blade, but the kind that vibrate back and forth like a barber&#x27;s clippers).</li>
            <li> I usually trust Panasonic to make good quality electronics, but this item fell apart after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> have about ten nose trimmers now, none worth 5 cents.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t openly weep when my nose hairs get pulled out, but honestly, it isn&#x27;t fun.  </li>
            <li> I feel like I barely used it so pretty bummed out that I have to pay for another one so soon.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than sticking a pair of scissors up your nose; however, on occasion takes a few pass-throughs to achieve the job.</li>
            <li> I cannot comment on longevity because I have not had it for more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a powerful enough trimmer for me.</li>
            <li> 34;WHAT is that strange thing in your bathroom?!&amp;#34; I tell them it is neither an instrument of pleasure nor torture, only a most practical item to get me out of hairy situations.</li>
            <li> The next brand just didn&#x27;t trim worth a darn.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of these over the years, but this is my favorite.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few over the years, and this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> for $12 it isn&#x27;t worth sending back or complaining.</li>
            <li> sure beats the alternative (not living long enough to experience hairy nostrils)</li>
            <li> Battery doesn&#x27;t last long even though it sits in a drawer most of the time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After using it the first time, I even feel like my noise has a different airflow, didn&#x27;t know how much difference it would make.</li>
            <li> I normally use for nose hair.</li>
            <li> These trimmers are all pretty much the same.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used numerous nose hair trimmers with varying degrees of success.</li>
            <li> First one lasted barely one year.</li>
            <li> Well worth the (low) price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two different trimmers in the past, and neither was as good as this one.</li>
            <li> For such a low price I didn&#x27;t expect such a nice product.</li>
            <li> it really is quiet like all of reviewers mention and seems to be worth what I paid.  </li>
            <li> He ruined the first one and now wants to order a second one.</li>
            <li> I use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say than that it works effectively without a whole lot of fluff.</li>
            <li> Powerful, efficient, and simple to use.</li>
            <li> Works as intended, long battery life, fairly quiet, great for male or female.  </li>
            <li> So much so that I&#x27;m willing to publicly admit I use it.  </li>
            <li> Powerful, yet quiet.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t fully satisfied with the nose hairs that were still in my nose after whirling this thing around a few times.  </li>
            <li> Should survive accidental drops and normal wear and tear.  </li>
            <li> But after reading the reviews and seeing the low price I decided that it was worth giving a shot.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is quiet and powerful.</li>
            <li> I tried without success to pry it open.</li>
            <li> Works ok nothing to write home about...eats batteries  died after 2 months waste of money</li>
            <li> I used it many times without any trouble.</li>
            <li> On off switch big and useful.</li>
            <li> There is nothing cool about walking around with daddy long legs hanging out.</li>
            <li> Its worth keeping for the low price.</li>
            <li> Given the better quality of this model, I expect we&#x27;ll be using it for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what more to say: this works very well.  </li>
            <li> Worked better for few months but now replacing.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s mentioned it a few times saying I love the nose trimmer you got.</li>
            <li> I usually go all over as much as I can and it gets most hair out.</li>
            <li> it is good but not great...</li>
            <li> Works good not great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not a good design with poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Still doesnt live up to my, apparently high, standards though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the cheap Remington ones, or the ones from Walmart before, and they always seem to break down or not cut very well.  </li>
            <li> It would be great to have a vacuum system to catch the hairs and for literally a few extra dollars, panasonic has a model that does just that</li>
            <li> I used it for about 9 months and it just died completely, under very normal use.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The speed of the trimmer blades is very much dependent on the batteries, so make sure to use new or charged batteries before using.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works well for both dry and wet conditions and trims without causing pain.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s small and easy to use...enough said!</li>
            <li> This is the first nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased that has lasted more than six months and works well wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> This works every bit as well or better and costs much less!</li>
            <li> This one does the job just fine like the other one did.</li>
            <li> This shaver worked fine for a while until the other day...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting on in years and hair is growing in new places, this is the thing to have to keep myself well-groomed and looking like a responsible adult.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to let it air dry before putting it back together after cleaning it.</li>
            <li> Nice that it&#x27;s wet dry</li>
            <li> Wet dry is nice feature.  </li>
            <li> I only used it about 8-10 times at most (always dry).</li>
            <li> So far it seems to work well, better than a previous model...</li>
            <li> But easy either way.&lt;br /&gt;Little on the big side, smaller would be easier to control.</li>
            <li> it then can kind of pull your hair rather then burning it off quickly which results in an uncomfortable pinching of your nose hair</li>
            <li> I keep it hidden because it&#x27;s not the most classy rasor to have.</li>
            <li> If I hadn&#x27;t been trimming on a regular basis I would have enough ear hair now to easily braid them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So quiet, in fact, that you wonder if it is strong enough.  </li>
            <li> Nothing amazing, I mean, it&#x27;s a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> So far my husband is happy with this trimmer he has had a few other brands over the years</li>
            <li> Was delighted that this is stronger, faster, mad more versatile since I can even trim the beard  growing out of the deep dimple in my chin.  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had several other types but this one really prefer the most.</li>
            <li> They finally got it right.</li>
            <li> Right away, I ordered a trimmer for him, which he uses regularly and frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It is possible that the one I have is just not quite right.</li>
            <li> The price was right and it came in a very short time.</li>
            <li> If I remember right I payed $20 for the last pare of scissors and this thing is a lot safer to use.</li>
            <li> so I am in the market for a different brand right now.  </li>
            <li> , I might go for the next model up, which vacuums the trimmings right out of your proboscis.</li>
            <li> I have had a full beard for a very long time</li>
            <li> It is definitely cheap and not long lasting.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Remington trimmer that was becoming a nuisance due to frequent jamming.</li>
            <li> This is much quieter than the old one and gives you a wet option to clean.</li>
            <li> I bought it to clean up the edges of my very mild beard, and instead of cutting cleanly, it pulls and cuts the hair.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is great for those embarrassing little hairs that ladies sometimes get on their face, ears, nose, etc.  </li>
            <li> instructrons not clear, battery used up too quickly.  </li>
            <li> The price is unbeatable, particularly considering I paid almost this much for a manual device that didn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;Now, instead of looking like an old hobbit, I look like an old elf.</li>
            <li> first few times got a little cuts but when you use to it it works good.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the trimmers over the last few year, This one is by far the best of the lot.  </li>
            <li> it is MUCH quieter, it has less vibration and which leads to less tickling, it is smaller in overall size and more portable, and it has better \\&quot;first</li>
            <li> Evidently my blades on my old one had gotten dull, as this did a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sure, you could replace it with an entire new set for the price of a takeout meal, but it feels like such a huge waste.</li>
            <li> Even on a single AA battery, it works at full speed.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re not going to shave a beard off with it or anything, but it works fine for touching up spots after shaving or in around difficult areas like the nose and ears and whatnot.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of power, bogs down too easily, and battery life is so-so with this</li>
            <li> It cuts the nose hairs down easily.</li>
            <li> I bought this by mistake to remove fine female facial hair.</li>
            <li> Switch does not seem cheap like some other models.</li>
            <li> With replacement blades and nose assembly no longer available, I was due, overdue, for an update.  </li>
            <li> For the price (I ordered some other items, making shipping free)</li>
            <li> This is easy to clean, relatively quiet and small to store.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to use it at first because my skin is so sensitive anyway, but it works great.  </li>
            <li> I do ears, eyebrows, nose, and other precise areas of thinner</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and it provides a comfortable trim.  </li>
            <li> Kept it germ free and sharp for 3 yrs.</li>
            <li> It stopped working due to cheaply made battery compartment.</li>
            <li> I can rub my nose freely without fear of a sharp unforgiving pain, one that I’m</li>
            <li> its works ok on nose, little loud for ears</li>
            <li> I expected it to have a more powerful motor or sharper blades or something for all the rave reviews, but it&#x27;s entirely average.</li>
            <li> This handy little trimmer trimmed it back with no irritation.</li>
            <li> sometimes gets a little warm, but I use it once a week or so now so it doesn&#x27;t have to be on very long and thus that isn&#x27;t much of an issue for me.  </li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this Panasonic trimmer is that it looks and feels like a high quality precision instrument, and it performs the same way.</li>
            <li> If it is a somewhat less full battery it is only is able to give some power then when it trims your facial hair (I use it for my nose)...</li>
            <li> My husband wanted a new nose hair trimmer for awhile.  </li>
            <li> I replaced it with a new AA battery</li>
            <li> Needed a new one and this one &amp;#34;fits the bill&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Have tried a number of new batteries to no avail.</li>
            <li> had to buy a new one from the pharmacy on a urgent basis.</li>
            <li> Bring in the new.</li>
            <li> The new one runs quieter.</li>
            <li> I have tried putting new batteries and whatnot but still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> After a year or so, it wasn&#x27;t working as well as it did when it was new.  </li>
            <li> None of them were dropped or hit on anything; they just no longer turned on one day and new batteries made no difference.</li>
            <li> Mine needs a new battery every time to use.</li>
            <li> would not buy another of this type, and will try something else out when I decide to get a new one.</li>
            <li> every time i used it i feel like new</li>
            <li> I was shopping for a new nose hair trimmer after my trimmer from The Sharper Image stopped working.  </li>
            <li> This new unit is about 2.5 times the height, but all is well.</li>
            <li> and I just wanted a new one.  </li>
            <li> He has tried to replace the batteries thinking it was the lack of battery power but even with new batteries it is no longer turning on or working.</li>
            <li> After using one for 6 years that conked out my husband needed a new one and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> new batteries revealed that the unit was grasping for life.</li>
            <li> Inserted a new, fully charged Eneloop AA battery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stopped working despite a new battery.</li>
            <li> how new a batter I put in it</li>
            <li> I shopped for a new one quite a bit.</li>
            <li> The battery is brand new.  </li>
            <li> I just know with new batteries, it still didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> My husband  live it .</li>
            <li> so I am in the market for a new one</li>
            <li> although i cant speak of its durability since it is new.</li>
            <li> Yes I did try new batteries to no avail.</li>
            <li> Today it stopped working despite a new battery.  </li>
            <li> and I am a new man</li>
            <li> The battery compartment for this brand new one also smells like fish</li>
            <li> I put in a brand new battery and still nothing.  </li>
            <li> I tied to put a new battery in it</li>
            <li> All it needed was a new battery.  </li>
            <li> (I checked by replacing the battery with a brand new battery).  </li>
            <li> Compared to new scissors, Panasonic was competitive in price.</li>
            <li> it had been updated with a new design.  </li>
            <li> I put a brand new battery in my brand new trimmer.  </li>
            <li> , I figured it was easier and cheaper not to try and find the part, but just order a new trimmer.  </li>
            <li> And always requires a new blade.</li>
            <li> This was a new product for me</li>
            <li> Panasonic says mail it in, but shipping costs almost what a new one does.  </li>
            <li> We live in a disposable world.</li>
            <li> A new battery did nothing.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t look like the hairy creature from Star-wars, I do find that as I age hair sprouts from ever new places.  </li>
            <li> The shocker came at 6 months when, despite new batteries, the unit started to pull.  </li>
            <li> So I went to buy a new blade.  </li>
            <li> The new trimmer itself sold for $12.50, a replacement blade cost $17 even on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Even with a brand new battery, the trimmer lacks power and behaves as if it is about to run out of juice.</li>
            <li> Tried new batteries, still nothing.</li>
            <li> I buy a new one every 1.5 years.</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to buy him new scissors to trim his nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> Not even a brand new battery could save it, and yes I triple checked that I inserted the battery correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried new batteries, but it hasn&#x27;t helped.  </li>
            <li> So I decided to buy a new one, and got the Panasonic ER-GN30-K instead.</li>
            <li> The new one has a way of cleaning the blades without removing the head.  </li>
            <li> and I needed a new one just like it.</li>
            <li> In the market for a new gizmo that would eradicate my Andy Rooney-like eyebrows, I chose these.  </li>
            <li> I bought a couple of $10 trimmers before and the all stop and snag nose hair even when the batteries are new...</li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s a moment when you say: I need my nose to stop looking like a New Year&#x27;s Eve party favor.</li>
            <li> New out of the box.</li>
            <li> even with a brand new battery in.</li>
            <li> I bought it abt 9 months ago and never cared to post a review, just ordered a new hair clipper and saw this was the #1 in the clipepr/trimmer categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But again, for the price, i can live with this.</li>
            <li> yes I put in a new AA alkaline battery</li>
            <li> New Batteries didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> New batteries did not solve the problem.</li>
            <li> Or just buy new for 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> i needed a new nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> Byproduct of a new item.</li>
            <li> but for now I can live with it.</li>
            <li> I am not looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> Bought a new one, and the motor switch was faulty... and Amazon would not ACCEPT a RETURN of the faulty item.</li>
            <li> so I will live with it until it dies again, then throw it out.</li>
            <li> seems very high quality for such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> was a birthday gift and works better than any other previously tried thank you for making it affordable and the quick shipping</li>
            <li> I picked up a cheapo battery powered trimmer from a local drugstore when I got a little older, and hair began migrating from my head to less preferred areas, and while it kind of did the job, I knew there had to be one out there that didn&#x27;t sound like a woodworking tool, didn&#x27;t grab and pull, and just basically did what it was supposed to do...</li>
            <li> I have wasted too much money on other trimming products to finally find this great product.</li>
            <li> What I mean by that, is that it seems to only give you the full power it can give if you have a battery that has most of it&#x27;s life in it.</li>
            <li> Clean up is a breeze with the wet wash option at a turn of a dial.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful when you clean it.</li>
            <li> easy to grip, I like the slight angle.  </li>
            <li> (It&#x27;s an older guy&#x27;s tool, clearly).  </li>
            <li> My husband loves it so far, he mainly uses it for his nose.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make much noise, much quieter than a traditional shaver.  </li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it at this price and considering how important it is to personal grooming.</li>
            <li> This has a different design which allows the hairs to fall in the center and provides a much more efficient cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, he didn&#x27;t have to \\&quot;baby\\&quot; the trimmer or the trimming process - i.e. not much care is necessary to make sure you don&#x27;t nick yourself with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Able to trim nose and ear hair very close with no hint of nicking the delicate skin inside.</li>
            <li> Especially for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small and light and pretty quite.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is big enough to hold comfortably.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; - Cleaning without full head disassembly isn&#x27;t easy (twisting to open the small side hole to run water through</li>
            <li> I have these cheap batteries and they only last for one clipping.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer does only a marginal job with that chore and takes many repeated tries to accomplish the task at that.</li>
            <li> Works well, light weight big improvement over older 10+ year old Panasonic trimmer I had prior.  </li>
            <li> so much so that I cannot stand to use it near my ear.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> A quality devise that any person wanting proper daily grooming would enjoy and benefit from its purchase.</li>
            <li> I had a few others, and was pleasantly surprised how much better this one works.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my light blonde hairs on upper lip.......</li>
            <li> It does not pull my nose hairs, but the machine is not super strong</li>
            <li> I had a very old hair trimmer that worked not so well, so decided to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> This nose and ear trimmer is a much better alternative to digging in his nose with little scissors!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little intimidating at first, but it works quickly with no pulling and no pain.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use and I have not found anything negative about it.</li>
            <li> No sharp edges visible yet cuts the hair really well.</li>
            <li> It worked well for 3 weeks and than it started making very loud noise.</li>
            <li> The blades and the nozzle has unwanted friction bcos of which it makes very loud noise.</li>
            <li> Very gentle and quiet,</li>
            <li> Very loud and nothing like the reviews I read.</li>
            <li> If you use this sort of item very frequently the battery usage is a consideration.</li>
            <li> Very sensitive instrument.</li>
            <li> I had a very old model from Panasonic, and it worked</li>
            <li> My husband loves it even thought it&#x27;s very loud</li>
            <li> and now it makes a very loud noise.</li>
            <li> The little slot for running water through does a decent job if you&#x27;re in a hurry, but it&#x27;s better to open it up and use the brush to clean it, then rinse it, then leave the parts out to dry</li>
            <li> This is totally normal for any new electrical &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; where the contact surfaces are completely polished.</li>
            <li> Works well but not very powerful (PRO) but after using it a few times, being battery operated is a good deal.  </li>
            <li> The manufacturer claims 90 minutes of battery life, a claim I take with a grain of salt, but the battery life is still strong after several uses, so clearly not something I&#x27;m going to have to change every trim or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to get into tight places.</li>
            <li> It got a little warm after a couple minutes but not a major problem.</li>
            <li> , pretty much right down to the surface leaving no discernible hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it seems to meet my expectations, and, after having done some prior research I am comfortable with my buying decision, which in the end, was swayed by the positive feedback of other purchasers and reviewers.</li>
            <li> Took a random shot at this trimmer and it&#x27;s been amazing!</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve bought because I dropped the first one and the metal things at the tip bent.</li>
            <li> tend to buy Panasonic products TOO much, I think, as they&#x27;re generally middle-of-the-road in quality and price.</li>
            <li> This is my first nose/facial hair trimmer and it&#x27;s quite simple to use.</li>
            <li> It works better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used, and everything about it is simple:</li>
            <li> The cleanup is pretty simple too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> At first, I did not think that it could possibly trim the finer and shorter hairs.</li>
            <li> First of all, I gave 1 star to this product since it stopped working after I used it ONLY ONCE.</li>
            <li> So far still in one piece!</li>
            <li> I bought a second one after using the first one for over 6 months.</li>
            <li> First time using any electric accessory for nose and facial hair trimming and must say, this product is pretty solid.</li>
            <li> It is a better quality than the ones he&#x27;s had in the past.  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> First of all it is higher quality than any other nose hair trimmer I have ever owned including wahl.</li>
            <li> I received the Panasonic ER-GN30-k as a gift, among many other bathroom items, as I recently had an airline lose my luggage</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m buying another one of these Panasonics, and hope it will last longer than the first one.</li>
            <li> As said in most of the other reviews, this thing actually works.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple in design and purpose.</li>
            <li> The first one was DOA the 2nd one sent worked for about 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Seems a tad more sturdy than ones we have had in the past.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than the crappy discount store models I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> No complaints at all, much better than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> They are 22 years old!</li>
            <li> I tried mine for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> It work the first two times, but then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, and when it finally did, it did not trim.</li>
            <li> There is a small opening in the top cap that can be exposed by rotating the head of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty basic man-scaping tool, and for the price, you cant beat it.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning</li>
            <li> I would suggest a product that &#x27;protrudes&#x27; and has &#x27;an edge&#x27; with which you can carefully trim hair far more deeply recessed or in ear crevasses.</li>
            <li> but my goodness this is SOO much better than the small trimmer I have been using...</li>
            <li> This trimmer works much better than others I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other one star reviews, I had the same problem.</li>
            <li> It does get some of the stuff, just not enough for me to rate it any higher.</li>
            <li> First nose trimmer I have owned that actually worked...</li>
            <li> The old on was worn out and it was time to replace it!  </li>
            <li> I have yet to find a trimmer that actually works as advertised, and although this one has received stellar reviews, in my opinion it&#x27;s a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I have had better trimmers in the past that were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I have used scissors and my regular clippers for trimming my nose hair for years - and first time I used these - I was cringing.  </li>
            <li> I have had many of these in the past from Panasonic, Sharper Image, etc..</li>
            <li> If you view this purchase as a short term throw away then rate it higher.  </li>
            <li> Keeps me from looking like a disheveled old man with a bush of nose hair coming out!</li>
            <li> Overall I am very happy I made this purchase and if you are looking for such a device to trim those difficult areas I would suggest this one.</li>
            <li> too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the opening lines from her review, &amp;#34;Nature has a funny way of tormenting the male species as they age.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap that the cost of shipping was not worth the return.</li>
            <li> It works well enough, but the first one broke within 4 months (</li>
            <li> this was the first such device I have used.  </li>
            <li> The first one had a side-opening and the second one had notched edges around the tip.</li>
            <li> Worked at first, but didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> I have bought many trimmers in my past.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> I first bought this trimmer in 2000 and have been using it 15 years later.</li>
            <li> In fact, the first time you use it you will question whether it did anything at all until you actually check.</li>
            <li> My first trimmer finally died to I switched to this Panasonic model.</li>
            <li> just ok, no more comment</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says for ear and facial hair and cleaning is a breeze.</li>
            <li> No more dangling hairs or concerns that the scissors are going to cut more than they should...  </li>
            <li> It might be cheap, but really not worth the money.</li>
            <li> Overall exactly what I was looking for though.</li>
            <li> This is my second one since I broke my first nose trimmer by accident.  </li>
            <li> Likely better than the more expensive model.</li>
            <li> Works better than a couple of other trimmers (different technology/method)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been given things like this in the past - most worked so so&lt;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better luck with Panasonic devices in the past - perhaps I just had a dud.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked well when I first got it, but stopped working after only a dozen uses.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> He says it seems to have weight and is more solid than the other one he purchased.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well especially if you do not like to get your nose hairs pulled like some cheaper models tend to do.</li>
            <li> I dropped my first one and it broke, ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> Much better than what I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It quite sharp and most time he does only one pass</li>
            <li> many other brands I tried, the blade gets stacked and won&#x27;t start even with daily cleaning.</li>
            <li> but had to send the first one ordered back because it wouldn&#x27;t run.</li>
            <li> This trimmer also works famously for getting stray hairs around your eyebrow line, or around your nose that you may have missed with your razor that morning because your a lazy schmuck when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li> This is my first and only purchase of a product like this</li>
            <li> higher for their personal care</li>
            <li> Nose hairs are pretty coarse yet this trimmer cuts through them like the</li>
            <li> Pretty simple: It trims hair.</li>
            <li> I just received this today and ordered it because my  nose hairs were getting wild and out of control!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Admittedly, this is my first time with a nosehair trimmer, and the spiky results left me twitching and sneezing for days after!</li>
            <li> and I gave up on most areas and got out a small razor and some tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Been trying to get my hubby to buy me a nose hair trimmer since we got married three years ago - apparently it&#x27;s not romantic?</li>
            <li> Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what more can be said about the product than that.</li>
            <li> Thought this model looked pretty well designed and it was very low in cost.  </li>
            <li> Usually Panasonic products are better than this.</li>
            <li> The build quality is substantially higher than the generic trimmer that I a  </li>
            <li> The first one lasted about two months (maybe about 8 uses), while the second one lasted about 3 weeks (2 uses).</li>
            <li> This is the second one, the first one was ruined by moisture</li>
            <li> If I wanted to yank out my eyebrow hairs one-by-one, I would enlist the services of Connie, the friendly Korean lady who does my my wife&#x27;s nail, as well as some other &amp;#34;grooming.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> So yea, it does see what I would consider normal, frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> it, your significant other will thank you.</li>
            <li> I have bought other removal nose, ear and facial hair items and this one seems more sturdy and reliable.</li>
            <li> For the first day after, I felt like I was taking massive breaths through my nostrils.</li>
            <li> I bought these on the basis of other Amazon recommendations and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Apparently the &#x27;guard&#x27; used over the blade will bend if you so much as breathe on it.  </li>
            <li> I had to buy a second one because I dropped the first one on its tip</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Finally trimmed my nose hair for the first time.</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> I read reviews for many different trimmers, and I chose this model due to those I read.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a Christmas present and the first time he used it, he was amazed at what a close trim this thing gives him.  </li>
            <li> They actually tickled my nose at first.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried such a trimmer for my nose.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the product did not work out of the box the first several times I turned it on.</li>
            <li> I am told there are other trimmers in the same price range that will do much better job.</li>
            <li> first impression was it seemed well constructed and simple to use.</li>
            <li> No complaint so far after 2 months of usage.</li>
            <li> but it actually works pretty well</li>
            <li> Not that you want to hear about my prior hairy nose and ears but this item works better than any other I have used - A+</li>
            <li> better than any other that I purchased as it ACTUALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> There are better products out there that I had in the past, like Remmel?</li>
            <li> As long as it holds up it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Although i had recently purchased it, Panasonic said they would fix it only if i paid the shipping to Texas, which would have cost a significant percent of just buying one from another manufacturer.  </li>
            <li> Just shaking it out with the top part off usually gets all of it out</li>
            <li> Let me first say that I used to wax my entire body once a month to include my nose</li>
            <li> No complains so far!</li>
            <li> I use it so my wife isnt trying to pluck one of those wild hairs out of my nose!</li>
            <li> WOW, what a difference!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if this is recommended, but I feel it does a better job keeping it</li>
            <li> Good product but only last for a few months and then stop working.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s dropped, may not survive and the head comes off a little too easy.</li>
            <li> It easily snips out those pesky little hairs in the ear and nostrils without pulling or pinching.  </li>
            <li> It easily snips out those pesky little hairs in the ear and nostrils without pulling or pinching.</li>
            <li> Bcoz contain a little thing inside that comes out and can be easily lost.</li>
            <li> This little gadget makes it easy to take grooming to the inside edges.  </li>
            <li> This little guy gets them all, nose and ears, very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This little device is easy to maintain and takes care my unwanted nose hair (yuck).</li>
            <li> Also, it is easy cleanup with a little soap and water rinse.  </li>
            <li> this little thing rocks...had one for like 3yrs and still going strong...</li>
            <li> Simple to use, simple to clean, etc.</li>
            <li> seems more complicated than it should to clean.</li>
            <li> If you open it to clean inside, you will see how fragile it is.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> clean enough, quiet, won&#x27;t hurt me, and inexpensive.</li>
            <li> It is simple to use and simple to clean.  </li>
            <li> The ear hair gets chopped and I can open it up to clean it out without worry if it will ever get back together again.</li>
            <li> Does not pull at all , is simple to clean, and is rather quiet for something you jam up your nose.</li>
            <li> for a cheap nose ear hairtrimmer this has not let me down.  </li>
            <li> The cleaning feature keeps it clean and oderless too unlike other brands and models.</li>
            <li> It does not pull the hairs as other manual turn around trimmers that are cumbersome to clean and do not work.  </li>
            <li> read a lot of Reviews here at Amazon before buying one of these things; and it seemed to me the biggest fault was in pulling the hair instead of providing a clean, sharp cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only own this trimmer for a couple days, so I&#x27;m interested in seeing how it stands up to repeated uses, consider the poor reviews regarding longevity from other confirmed owners.</li>
            <li> They are quiet, easily washable, powered by a single AA battery which is not included, no tugging or pulling sensation when using them.</li>
            <li> Because the product is new, the inner &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; cuts perfectly, but I doubt will due so in the future once the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; starts to dull.</li>
            <li> The plastic body feels like it&#x27;s made of cheap china plastic that would break or crack on your first accidental drop on a hard floor.  </li>
            <li> I cannot comment on the durability of this product as I have used it only for a month, but my experience so far has been better than with any other trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It is extremely bizzare to stick this up your nose in order to cut nose hairs, and can hurt a tiny bit when ripping out some hairs, but overall, it keeps those nose hairs nice and trim, no complaints.</li>
            <li> So far, this clipper looks like it will live up to it&#x27;s battery life estimate.  </li>
            <li> The day my five year old charge told me I have fuzz in my ears was the day I decided I needed a new tool for my collection.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me a bit long in the tooth, and your body hair has run amuck, check out this dude right here.</li>
            <li> This little device might pass as a cheap version of other similar devices with a greater price tag, but it works just wonders.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> to my joy, I&#x27;ve found that this bad boy really gets the job done!  </li>
            <li> wondering why you&#x27;re shoving what looks and sounds like a vibe up your nose - but honestly, it&#x27;s just as cheap as a pair of decent blunt nose scissors and it quells the masochist desire in me to painfully pluck those distracting hairs.</li>
            <li> The slightly bent body is ergonomically designed to perfectly fit in the hand.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is fantastic compared to my previous Wahl.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable enough to hold, although I can&#x27;t imagine needing to hold this for a really long time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had previously bought one of those $10 cheap trimmers you see on TV which lasted like a month.</li>
            <li> I get a few snags that are very quick.</li>
            <li> trimmer’s curved design and rubberized grip make it easy to use, and the narrow, rounded head reaches into nostrils with minimum irritation.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are various optional instructions on how to clean it, but I just plan on rinsing it with water like I did with my old one, and if I need to buy another one in a year or so, no big deal.  </li>
            <li> Easy to pack for travel and isn&#x27;t heavy.</li>
            <li> Anyway this trimmer always trims without pulling or snagging my nose hair or any hair for that matter, it fits in the hand nice &amp; the head is small enough to get anywhere</li>
            <li> This worked at a 4-star level at first, but far too briefly.  </li>
            <li> Once in a while, it would grab a hair instead of cutting, which hurts pretty good.  </li>
            <li> I even use it to touch up my eyebrows and it does a pretty good job getting close to the skin without cutting me.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done quickly and with minimal pulling.  </li>
            <li> For one, it only effective on small amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cause cutting on the face and its pretty good.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer but be careful not to drop the small blade parts into the drain while cleaning it.</li>
            <li> Not to big, not too small - it fits the orifice quite nicely and doesn&#x27;t tug and pull at the sides.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, could have a cleaner cutting head.</li>
            <li> Its low tech and does exactly what its supposed to to without having to stick scissors near or inside body cavities where they don&#x27;t belong.  </li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was how quiet this shaver is,nice when you use it near your ears.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience with these things, but it seems pretty solid so far.</li>
            <li> Better than your average low quality trimmer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an avid Amazon buyer and am surprised they would sell such a POS.</li>
            <li> At first, it worked ok but not great.  </li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic trimmer I have purchased - the first one I dropped five feet onto a tile floor directly on the head.</li>
            <li> Be cool if there were different heads to use but no big deal.</li>
            <li> Evidently, I was not as careful as I should have been and remove to much or to close or both.</li>
            <li> Its been a few years and this trimmer is still going strong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going strong after a few months of ownership.</li>
            <li> As for my first week of review, without an included triple A battery, I had to use an older one I had with limited power.  </li>
            <li> It replaces a very old Windmere unit that until now I didn&#x27;t truly realize just how ineffective the old one was.</li>
            <li> This thing really bogs down when I try to trim my nose hairs, even with a fresh battery.</li>
            <li> Just twist off the top, pull out the blade, brush it down with the included brush, wash if you desire, then put back together.</li>
            <li> Though it worked fine, it was noisy and did pull a little.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but some tendency to trim nasal hair a little too close, leading to ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> If you have a little hair, it should work fine for you though.</li>
            <li> Fits my hand perfectly, trims well, and is much less noisy than other trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I wish it trimmed a little bit closer on the nose hair, but all in all, its fine.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for years, and while the original version (gosh, 20 years ago!) was extremely powerful and ultra sharp, I do recall being a little sore.  </li>
            <li> I was using an attachment to my Remington (not an actual nose trimmer attachment) and it was ok but only got the long hairs.  </li>
            <li> There is another model with a light, but not sure that feature is worth the extra cost.  </li>
            <li> I had something similar in the past, but definitely did not work as good as this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, leaves hair sometimes but pretty good all the same.</li>
            <li> Not painful like a couple of other ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I had tried several from our local Walmart that were worse than this one, but I liked my old, old Panasonic version better (but it finally wore out, heh).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cheap product and works well, but understand that it may not last very long.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very powerful which means less nose hair getting caught</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is comfortable to use (minimal tugging and vibrating) and makes quick work of maintenance.</li>
            <li> i would highly recommend this nose groomer to anyone looking to buy a groomer, go with this one and you will have no regrets!</li>
            <li> In fact with the wet dry feature, more than I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> After struggling with it for a while trying to push it out of the chamber and back into it&#x27;s slot on the side (where it looked like it should have gone), I tried installing the blade this time without putting it fully into the chamber, but resting the black plastic legs of the blade on top of this curved plastic piece, and reinstalling the cap.</li>
            <li> It is much more quiet than the previous one I had.</li>
            <li> OK, maybe it&#x27;s just me who&#x27;s anal enough to notice something as odd as that.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> My big sharper image trimmer finally died, so I did some quick review searching.</li>
            <li> I had another one that got rotted smelling quickly because it wasn&#x27;t designed to be cleaned in any simple manner), and it cleans hairs out if you give it the time to do so and swish it around enough.</li>
            <li> With this version we once again have a trimmer that cuts the whole hair right down to the skin level.</li>
            <li> feels very cheaply made and it cuts slowly.  </li>
            <li> This new version is a little more stylistic, but it has the same quality as my old one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still using the original batteries with no signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other trimmers, even more expensive ones by this same brand, and this model is by far the most effective for me.</li>
            <li> did notice that when i clean the head with water there is sometimes a dark liquid which washes into</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and still working fine</li>
            <li> Actually works, and since it is easily and completely cleanable, it doesn&#x27;t stop working after 10 uses because it is jammed with snot and hair.</li>
            <li> wet dry feature is nice since it sits on my counter next to my sink.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty small and easy to carry around, and cleanup is relatively easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It worked fine a few times, then stopped.</li>
            <li> It was fine for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Once your nose is hair free you will be able to breathe easier and have less boogers caught in the thick bush.  </li>
            <li> Its build quailty is good though and the wet dry function worked as expected.</li>
            <li> In the few weeks I have used it, it works fine.  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s not for heavy grooming like a beard but nose or ear hair would be fine.  </li>
            <li> Works good, could use an extra battery (seems a bit weak on power)</li>
            <li> you should only cut a bit away at first, ,dont try to cut to remove every single hair the first time.  </li>
            <li> but you get to a certain age and suddenly you&#x27;re sprouting hairs in places</li>
            <li> It heats up pretty quickly when you start using it, takes quite a while to actually trim all the hair, and so far has proven fairly difficult to clean very well.  </li>
            <li> I have a problem with certain hairs that grow in places that is too gross to mention.</li>
            <li> I HAVE OWN TWO OTHER BRANDS AND HANDS DOWN</li>
            <li> Perhaps a little light oil on the blade would lessen the resistance...</li>
            <li> It is smooth and does not hurt when it pulls out the little hairs inside of you.</li>
            <li> Although this little battery operated nose trimmer seems cheap, it works.</li>
            <li> Whatever the case, I find this little baby indispensable.</li>
            <li> A little cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;We</li>
            <li> Feels a little cheap in the hand, but for the price, what do you expect?</li>
            <li> With a little practice, jamming the device can be avoided and the device will operate smoothly.</li>
            <li> In defense of that cheap little trimmer, I did keep it running for two or three years.  </li>
            <li> Seems a little cheaply made.</li>
            <li> product works well but feels a little cheap.</li>
            <li> but for now, if you are getting older or if your nose hairs grow extremely long and fast, this is for you, don&#x27;t wait</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent trimmer for a long time at a reasonable price</li>
            <li> This is a significant improvement over previous nose trimmers.  </li>
            <li> This one is a little more solid.  </li>
            <li> For the same amount of money, I picked up a full-on grooming kit with addons that works much, much better than this little thing.</li>
            <li> Sure beats using those little scissors you get in dopp kits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: definite upgrade!</li>
            <li> On thing I would like tonsee like my old one is a little light thatnshines in area</li>
            <li> This one is a little more solid.</li>
            <li> This little guy does exactly what it is supposed to do - quickly, gently and efficiently!  </li>
            <li> I had another brand version that I had lost and was not super excited about this one.  </li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this wet/dry personal shaver, but wish it cut hairs a little closer than it does.</li>
            <li> However, after my first use the trimmer will suddenly die and stop working (snagging on skin and on hairs) and doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up small fine hairs.</li>
            <li> OKAY, CANT HARDLY HEAR IT RUN</li>
            <li> I am hard to please when it comes to this type of stuff, and I can say for sure, this seems to be number one.</li>
            <li> and it will be hard to find better...</li>
            <li> Works well for those hard to pick places. :-)</li>
            <li> It cuts hard to reach hair in ears and nose much better than scissors.</li>
            <li> This one, on the other hand, does the job quickly and painlessly.  </li>
            <li> I understand that lithium based batteries have higher power density, but the rechargeables wear out quickly and are expensive (if not impossible) to replace.</li>
            <li> Very good cutting and very quiet.  </li>
            <li> It is quite effective it less time compared to trimmers and other models.  </li>
            <li> Hard to complain too much about something that is so cheap, though.</li>
            <li> When dull it will start pulling hair more frequently.  </li>
            <li> As I said the flat close trimer that everybody sells probly works better but they don&#x27;t last very long.</li>
            <li> I found this Panasonic model with very good reviews but was skeptical because my Sharper Image model was 3 times more expensive when I purchased it 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> falls apart easily and not very effective.</li>
            <li> cutting my nose hair perfectly lol</li>
            <li> Instructions aren&#x27;t great and opening the package was a dangerous ordeal if you don&#x27;t have bolt cutters.    </li>
            <li> Great for cutting nostril and ear opening hair.</li>
            <li> Great cutting angle and performance.</li>
            <li> Great close cutting</li>
            <li> Directions are clear on care and maintenance.</li>
            <li> I clean it every time I use it (followed directions with it) and let it dry out for an hour or two before putting it back together.</li>
            <li> It did not leave a clear streak through it.</li>
            <li> I would steer clear of this item.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t bother to look at the directions clearly.</li>
            <li> Just turn the outer plastic ring that opens the drain and run some water through it while it is running, it&#x27;s clean in less than 10 seconds.</li>
            <li> (To be clear, even when the blade head is removed, the shaft will not spin.)</li>
            <li> I am a woman, not a hairy nosed man, but this product is great for nasal hair and facial hair too difficult to tweeze.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easier to clean than my previous model as well.</li>
            <li> Opened and read clear instructions.  </li>
            <li> In less than one minute I can clean out my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> The instruction manuel gives clear instructions.</li>
            <li> As for me, I am still too young to be one of those old guys with epic nose hair.  </li>
            <li> It still worked great, but unfortunately, I dropped it on the floor, and one of the internal parts fell out, so it no longer cuts.</li>
            <li> While hair doesn&#x27;t readily grow on my head, it grows wild in unwanted areas such as ears and nose.  </li>
            <li> Unit goes in the drawer when I don&#x27;t need it and keeps the counter clear.</li>
            <li> I bought several to give as gifts because some people in my family really needed it and did not find them in stores they frequent.</li>
            <li> You can clearly hear when it encounters hairs.</li>
            <li> Those clear hairs under your eyebrows</li>
            <li> but this one is easy to clean does not feel that uncomfortable as others</li>
            <li> :B00E4PMQAO Professional Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose Trimmer with LED light.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;The machine comes on fast for about 5 seconds and in the next 2 seconds it nearly stops.  </li>
            <li> Just move it around and it will clear the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have replaced the batter in my old clipper by this time.</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t pulled or pinched anything.</li>
            <li> No issues with it so far.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> I hope my nose hair grows fast enough, can&#x27;t stop of using it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not sure on the long term how durable this is, however for the price I don&#x27;t expect it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I´ve been using this product for several months and have no complains about it; it trims very well and does not hurt the inside of your nose tissues while doing it.</li>
            <li> I dropped my 10 year old Conair trimmer and was in need of a replacement.  </li>
            <li> so far keeps my nose hair in check.</li>
            <li> but it is overpriced as far as I am concerned;</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and power of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked really well, but did not last a year.</li>
            <li> have so much hair in my body, especially nose, so I have to trim it every one week.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, after 3 or 4 uses, the trimmer completely stopped turning on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It quit working completely after a month.</li>
            <li> He was pleasantly surprised at the performance of the Panasonic trimmer and continues rave about it.</li>
            <li> Just what the old nose needed</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, it&#x27;s quiet,</li>
            <li> Why look like a cave man when you can look like the modern man that anyone would want to be next to.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised so far.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how well this worked.</li>
            <li> He loves this &amp; surprised how well it does what it says it can do.</li>
            <li> The batteries in this product also lasted a pretty long time.  </li>
            <li> This is a quality grooming tool as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  </li>
            <li> then it quit completely.  </li>
            <li> He has had several and really likes this one.</li>
            <li> What a glorious time to be alive.</li>
            <li> It performs very well in trimmming nose hair, which is its only purpose for me.</li>
            <li> Very pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> Was surprised how well this works.  </li>
            <li> after just a short time of using this product I am ready to get rid of it.</li>
            <li> He was reaching that point in old man years where his nose hair was longer than his head hair.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make me hesitant at all to put it near sensitive places.</li>
            <li> If the battery gets old or you try and use a weaker battery</li>
            <li> My old unit was so loud that it hurt my ears when grooming them.</li>
            <li> so I like it so far.</li>
            <li> I had an old Panasonic that I lost in a move.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t get a close enough shave with this thing to warrant using it on your face really..</li>
            <li> I am 50+ years old and have hair growing places now that I never had problems with before.  </li>
            <li> I think so far it has done this maybe 3 or 4 times with me.</li>
            <li> He loves this Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer and says it does not pull his nose hairs and works very well.</li>
            <li> Finally, a hair trimmer that really works.  </li>
            <li> This puts my old Remington to shame.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this one.</li>
            <li> Purchased 3 so far as gifts.</li>
            <li> and so far I&#x27;ve had no issues with it...</li>
            <li> This one will buzzz that hair away fast and short.</li>
            <li> I was actually surprised to see a brand name trimmer being sold at this price</li>
            <li> this to me is the best-so far anyway.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is simple to operate, and trims very well.  </li>
            <li> This unit is also very lightweight and quiet.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco trimmer never worked as well as the old Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> This thing kinda sucks, in the age of the rechargeable battery why get a AA operated  when there are better products out there.</li>
            <li> After washing and re-assembling the thing I was astounded at how loud the thing was.</li>
            <li> I attack it with this contraption on a regular basis and it really clears out all the foliage.</li>
            <li> works very well only used it once since I bought</li>
            <li> With the old blade style of electric trimmer I would always dread it because because I had to stick the blades all the way up to the offending hairs in my nose.</li>
            <li> And I had to remove these hairs the old fashioned way, using my fingernails.</li>
            <li> Being that this product cost me $20, I was happily surprised.</li>
            <li> works by softly removing the hair, it doesn&#x27;t pull them as others, it doesn&#x27;t get stuck, and there&#x27;s no chance of getting blood anywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Used about 5 times so far.</li>
            <li> And not too loud, like some others.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy, not too light .So</li>
            <li> Of course this was a stocking stuffer I purchased early and the return period had expired before we ever opened it, so I am SOL</li>
            <li> and so far has not given me any problems.</li>
            <li> I got maybe one hour of use out of it before it started making a loud noise.  </li>
            <li> So loud it hurt my ears when trimming ear hair.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is used only on my ears and performs very well in that capacity.  </li>
            <li> I wanted trimmer for nose and ear hair which is a problem for us old guys.</li>
            <li> So far I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the one with the LED light...</li>
            <li> This one is completely painless and works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my 89 year old dad to use.  </li>
            <li> After maybe 4 months it just stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Is not too loud.</li>
            <li> I have had no issues so far and have been using it for around a year now</li>
            <li> I was surprised at how sturdy it was considering the cost.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this trimmer to be (by far) the easiest to use with the closest cut.</li>
            <li> The internal motor mechanism is really glitchy, and will sometimes just stop working.</li>
            <li> using it for 2 months now, no issue so far.</li>
            <li> For the price, I am surprised at the quality of the build and the fact you can buy replacement parts.</li>
            <li> I saw this trimmer on sale and decided that maybe it was time to retire my old one.</li>
            <li> SO far, I am four for four on getting lemons.</li>
            <li> It gently and quietly went to work civilizing and youth-ifying my nose and ears.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be a keeper, others we have tried were too loud and pulled hair.</li>
            <li> My old one was 15 years old</li>
            <li> It replaces an old one that has done its time.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> This trimmer is inexpensive and does one thing only, but it does it VERY well.  </li>
            <li> and that was loud</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well</li>
            <li> The battery compartment seems to frequently lose connectivity with the inserted battery resulting in the trimmer failing to turn on.  </li>
            <li> Also, the angled design of the trimmer caused it to frequently fall over on my medicine cabinet shelf.</li>
            <li> One problem fixed at a time, I suppose.</li>
            <li> completely stopped working, when I managed to jiggle it, to get it to run - it just made a loud noise and did not cut at all.</li>
            <li> He has a sensitive nose that reacts with a lot of sneezing to a lot of stuff, but this did not prompt a sinus attack as I feared..</li>
            <li> But after several months of use, I am very dissatisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Quiet and gentle.  </li>
            <li> As a man getting old sux, items like this become a necessity.</li>
            <li> so they are doing their job so far.</li>
            <li> But, watching a mature man tear up with every nose hair extracted is a pitiful site.</li>
            <li> Quiet and very efficient</li>
            <li> It does still work somewhat but it heats up and is loud as hell.</li>
            <li> so far hope it is reliable.</li>
            <li> Ordered in May of 2014 and used very sparingly and now just over a year later the product will not turn on.  </li>
            <li> The old one would do the job in a 5-10 seconds.</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the recipient said &amp;#34;so far so good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 25 year old son and he loves it.</li>
            <li> But so far, at the price point I paid, no problems and would buy again.  </li>
            <li> Wow, what a difference.  </li>
            <li> This device works very well and is very solidly built.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want hairs coming out of my nose looking like an old man.  </li>
            <li> one get old, hair does one of two things . . .</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really trim eyebrow or facial hair like they say, but who cares?</li>
            <li> After contacting Panasonic support to see about getting it fixed, I was told the replacement blade would cost 13 dollars.....</li>
            <li> Balanced too for a longer device than my old one.  </li>
            <li> Tried it today on ears and nose and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> This works very well especially for the price.  </li>
            <li> must have to maintain professional appearance.</li>
            <li> Though it did not cost much to begin with, it only worked a few months - using it only once or twice a month at most.  </li>
            <li> It took 5 minutes to completely trim all the hair in my nose so that it was no longer noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Considering you&#x27;re using it on sensitive areas, makes me nervous.  </li>
            <li> I found this will diminish hair but not get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li> When the trimmer is used, the edges of the blades brush against the cover and make the loud buzzing sound.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As far as nose trimmers go, you can&#x27;t lose.</li>
            <li> had one from a beard trimming kit before this that just didn&#x27;t work...was pleasantly surprised with this one</li>
            <li> This item was completely inoperable, not even the tiniest buzz.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> Old guys.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as well as my old one.  </li>
            <li> You can wash this by running water directly from faucet.</li>
            <li> : none so far</li>
            <li> After an extensive review, I decided for this product and it really worked as promised.</li>
            <li> As a man(?) who doesn&#x27;t grow much facial hair, I don&#x27;t have to shave very often.</li>
            <li> Has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> The first was dropped on the bathroom floor, and it started making a strange noise, so I needed</li>
            <li> We have tried others which have caused nicks in the skin, but so far these have not.</li>
            <li> This thing is gentle and quiet.  </li>
            <li> My old trimmer gave up the ghost - should have been sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do a complete job for both nose and ear.</li>
            <li> So far this has worked like a peach.</li>
            <li> The battery compartment of my old panasonic had a fishy smell.</li>
            <li> your ears the old fashioned way</li>
            <li> This product stopped working completely after about three months.  </li>
            <li> Ready for the next grooming!</li>
            <li> He uses it weekly - so it gets used frequently.  </li>
            <li> this might be a problem for those people who have extremely sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Had an old Remington PG350 beard trimmer with 4 attachment.  </li>
            <li> You know your getting old when you have to buy one of these.  </li>
            <li> No issues so far.</li>
            <li> Now this hospital was an old goat herder&#x27;s hut who used shears</li>
            <li> Love that its battery operated so it can used on the go if running late.</li>
            <li> and then it stopped working completely.  </li>
            <li> Working well so far.  </li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> old and has arthritis in his hands.</li>
            <li> It works well so far (one month).  </li>
            <li> My Braun Shaver requires blade replacement about as frequently.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m quite surprised it hasn&#x27;t required replacement sooner than</li>
            <li> Even at two years I&#x27;m still surprised</li>
            <li> just moves it around, wish I didn&#x27;t throw away my old one</li>
            <li> Nothing says &amp;#34;ungroomed,&amp;#34; like a white untrimmed nose hair in a very tan senior nose.</li>
            <li> Cons: none so far.</li>
            <li> So far works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It is completely painless.</li>
            <li> So far I like the product.</li>
            <li> While I wouldn&#x27;t take it into the shower you can rinse it with water and its ready to go the next time.  </li>
            <li> I looked for a product that would work for my 78 year old father.</li>
            <li> Picture makes it look a lot bigger than it really is.  </li>
            <li> For once I found a trimmer that actually worked and at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Kinda loud</li>
            <li> Seems to work well for nose hair thus far.</li>
            <li> So far I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from him, so I&#x27;m giving it five stars.</li>
            <li> When your nose hairs still sticking out of your nose and tickling your nose when you breath that means you&#x27;re getting old.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably just get the multi groomer since I don&#x27;t really need multiple nose hair trimmers</li>
            <li> Works well and is not so loud that you feel like your damaging your ears</li>
            <li> All my old trimmers would nick and cut the inside of my nose.  </li>
            <li> no problems so far.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t get an exchange from Amazon as it&#x27;s one week outside of their return policy, Panasonic wants me to ship it to them at my cost for repair or replacement.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper than my last trimmer</li>
            <li> have used 3 times so far.</li>
            <li> So far no problems, i like it a lot.</li>
            <li> so far.</li>
            <li> So far though, it has not done that.</li>
            <li> so I assume I will not have to change the batteries frequently.  </li>
            <li> and so far seems sturdy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s modestly priced (under $15); and 2)</li>
            <li> Bought it in the middle of the night from my phone when my nose was bothering me too much.</li>
            <li> I replaced my 10 yr old Panasonic unit with this one.  </li>
            <li> it AT LEAST CUTS THE HAIRS, which is more than the others will do.</li>
            <li> Yesterday it started making a loud buzzing noise, which it had not made previously.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pinch the inside of my nose like my old trimmers.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a cheap $5-6 off-brand version of one of these trimmers a few years ago.</li>
            <li> I am admitting that I&#x27;m getting old.</li>
            <li> my old one</li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB INTENDED, NO PROBLEMS SO FAR.</li>
            <li> But it obviously shows how much he likes the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> but so far haven&#x27;t had an issue.</li>
            <li> It does the job on nose and ears completely painlessly.</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t have hair coming out of my nose like an old dude.</li>
            <li> After cleaning and reassembly (in accordance with the user guide), the product clattered loudly and just never worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far</li>
            <li> No problem using one AA alkaline battery so far.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer definitely works really well..</li>
            <li> Seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li> Fast, efficient, quiet.</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for another trimmer that was too old.  </li>
            <li> /&gt; - Pull your hair often since it doesn&#x27;t spin fast enough</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to use then the type that goes back and forth.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an old guy and was getting hairy ears.  </li>
            <li> (hear a tip on how I cleaned my old Wahl trimmer and it should work for this trimmer also)</li>
            <li> it works and seems to be made well, battery life is reasonable and in line with similar products.</li>
            <li> I had an old sharper image one that was about 14 years old.</li>
            <li> Seems to pull on a hair every now and again, but really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> The rinse head cleaning is also handier than the disassemble-clean-reassemble routine on the old model.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull or tug sensitive hairs.</li>
            <li> It does work well when needed, however it does seem to be quite sensitive to batteries.</li>
            <li> &#x27;s completely bitten the dust.</li>
            <li> Cuts cleanly so far.</li>
            <li> so far...</li>
            <li> but both get too old or something</li>
            <li> and then the motor starts sounding loud and will not perform as well.  </li>
            <li> Yeah, so I got old and invested in a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised with this unit&#x27;s clipping ability.  </li>
            <li> The battery also lasts pretty long.  </li>
            <li> Mine got to be over 4 years old.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves how it works, it cleans his facial hair very well.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement/upgrade from my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> Plunge it into the old nostrils and root around a bit.  </li>
            <li> These are the kinds of things a man in his early 30&#x27;s has to deal with.  </li>
            <li> so i was really surprised it did not come with one..</li>
            <li> It is very quiet and cuts really close without any discomfort.[[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110/60 Nose and Ear Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> So far it gets the job done without any problems.</li>
            <li> However, if you have deep nostrils (Who really knows this about themselves?)</li>
            <li> but so far the Panasonic ER-GN30-K does NOT.</li>
            <li> like it because it can be washed directly by water.&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, but it seems to work very well.</li>
            <li> Does not trim well at all...do not waste your money on this model.  </li>
            <li> It works alright, but it heats up really fast and you could possibly burn your nose or face with it.</li>
            <li> Old man, hair growing everywhere</li>
            <li> Used very infrequently at 2nd home....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I can use it inside my ears and is not to loud.</li>
            <li> Still works, but motor is completely whiny and trimmer just stops when I try to trim anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to buy one of these for a couple old men</li>
            <li> at 29 i bit the bullet and accepted that im old</li>
            <li> It trims facial hair very well.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because my old trimmer wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t like using the exposed ones in sensitive areas like my nose..</li>
            <li> Dropped my old one and it broke.</li>
            <li> Quieter and heavier than the old Panasonic unit.</li>
            <li> No problems noticed so far.</li>
            <li> So far no pulling on the hairs</li>
            <li> Now they are white and very noticeable.</li>
            <li> And then completely died.</li>
            <li> I just use once so far.</li>
            <li> It fell all of 10\\&quot; to the sink, and now is extremely loud and doesn&#x27;t cut as well.  </li>
            <li> You know, trimming nose hairs being the sign that I&#x27;m getting old and all that jazz.</li>
            <li> It wants to spin initially after reseating the blades, but then it gets caught up on the blade guard and stops.  </li>
            <li> this trimmer can be used to trim nose hair, no one is surprised at this.</li>
            <li> I have an old Sears electric trimmer from the sixties that has worked on three generations.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t notice much hair left after being cut either, I think the machine captures it.</li>
            <li> There is no pulling and no pain even in the sensitive nostril</li>
            <li> Worked until early Feb., then just died.  </li>
            <li> I had an old Panasonic trimmer...</li>
            <li> Do not waste your money.</li>
            <li> Being 28 years old, I never had to use a nose hair trimmer, and for the majority of my life I never thought I&#x27;d have to.</li>
            <li> For something you&#x27;re meant to hold up close to your ears, the trimmer is painfully loud.</li>
            <li> Hair is contained by the device as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> My wife reminds me that I&#x27;m getting old.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer works very well.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this trimmer worked.  </li>
            <li> When you buy one of these, you know you&#x27;re getting old.</li>
            <li> This is an early review and may change in time should reliability turn out to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It beats my old trimmer by a mile.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, thanks for this nose, ear and facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer exceeded my expectations by far.</li>
            <li> Haha sounds gross I know.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice and it cuts very close and runs very quiet.  </li>
            <li> It has lasted amazingly long on its first battery.</li>
            <li> way improved over my 10 yr old one</li>
            <li> And it trims all the hair in your nose completely.</li>
            <li> Although the build is sturdy, I wouldn&#x27;t trust it in soft checked luggage.</li>
            <li> But the only thing that matters really is how well it cuts the hair</li>
            <li> No problems so far.</li>
            <li> then it got really loud.</li>
            <li> This far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This is a simple tool that works well and doesn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> I decided to torture myself by reading the reviews; I for one don’t play the odds, I see 95 five star ratings and pay more attention to the one negative.  </li>
            <li> Unless you jam it directly into your ear (and why you&#x27;ll want to that, I don&#x27;t know)</li>
            <li> all you&#x27;ll hear is a soft hum.</li>
            <li> no complaints thus far.</li>
            <li> As we age, we sprout hair in the least sexy places.  </li>
            <li> my 66 year old body was experiencing.  </li>
            <li> must change the angle of the trimmer frequently but that has been the case with all trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Its simple and ready to use.</li>
            <li> Who really wants to acknowledge a nose hair trimmer as an essential grooming tool?</li>
            <li> i.e men&#x27;s nose hair.so far, it has been durable.</li>
            <li> wont be surprised when it gives up the ghost.</li>
            <li> I like the rotary action but wish a device could have a combination of rotary and &#x27;scissor shave&#x27; action.</li>
            <li> I have used mine about 6 times so far and I still like.</li>
            <li> tip  feels so soft</li>
            <li> and you really have to rotate it around to get all of the hair which is why I only give it 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not messy.</li>
            <li> Rating of the Panasonic vs my old Remington Wet/Dry  Panasonic 10  Remington 0    </li>
            <li> Wow.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it tickles (really tickles) when used for nose hair.  </li>
            <li> My old one did not.  </li>
            <li> and I like it so far</li>
            <li> So Far</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m about twenty years too young to be using one of these, but I&#x27;m still wondering how the hell I ever lived without it.</li>
            <li> It makes a loud grinding nose as the blade hits the guard and doesn&#x27;t cut well after that.</li>
            <li> One batter has lasted me a month so far.</li>
            <li> Often people can go through several of these types of trimmers in a year and not think much about it.  </li>
            <li> Only use it on nose, works very well.</li>
            <li> My old man groomer broke and I was looking for a replacement.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer (man groomer) used to pluck hairs</li>
            <li> No complaints whatsoever thus far.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by how close this rotary trimmer cuts hair.</li>
            <li> ONLY real downside has been that it&#x27;ll go throw a AA battery in about two trims.  </li>
            <li> and then it stopped working completely within six weeks.  </li>
            <li> have always used an old Remington nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li> I use it mostly on my nose but have used it a few times to get those out of place facial hairs.</li>
            <li> I have had a few of the so called universal trimmers that have the nose hair attachments, and they are mostly uselss...</li>
            <li> Not very sturdy or powerful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d like to add that this one now buzzes when fully battery charged really fast when I hold it at one angle and really slow and grinding with a sound like a rusty electric</li>
            <li> Rarely used, never under wet conditions, and cleaned after each use.  </li>
            <li> Only trouble was getting the most elusive nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that a bunch of 10 second maintenance jobs is better than hacking away at a forrest every few weeks.</li>
            <li> It does get warm after using it for a couple minutes, but not warm enough to cause discomfort.</li>
            <li> Of Caution: be careful where you use; it is powerful like I stated already, so you may create some unintended damage.</li>
            <li> I tried it with 4 different sets of fresh batteries, and it simply refuses to turn on.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and worth the price</li>
            <li> It is worth the money spent if you are looking for an in-expensive trimmer.</li>
            <li> It appears to be much better than the last trimmer I had, but have not used it but a few times.&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a weird shape like some erotic Batman toy, but it does the job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t think Panasonic trimmers weren&#x27;t good, but I bought multi-purpose trimmers that were just mediocre nose-hair trimmers.  </li>
            <li> But I was kind of annoyed that it isn&#x27;t even a year old</li>
            <li> Maybe I am using it wrong, but doesn&#x27;t see to do a good job.</li>
            <li> I think ill put it to good use</li>
            <li> Just buy a good, expensive one, and save yourself the hustle.</li>
            <li> I think my hair grows more slowly after I started using this because it realized the futility.</li>
            <li> It is difficult  and time consuming to to do a good job.</li>
            <li> However, the manufacturer claims it&#x27;s good for edging beards and mustaches, but when I tried it out, it failed abysmally.</li>
            <li> Ok I hate the fact that to own this</li>
            <li> Go slow and it works better.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it only lasted 1 months Had high hopes for the product but the durability is poor.i also had new battery could save it, and</li>
            <li> I tried several new batteries of high quality and no results.</li>
            <li> Works OK, but it made pretty cheap and sounds noisy in a way that its unlikely to last very long.</li>
            <li> It handles both coarse and fine hair extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Using it to trim facial hair from side burns, eyebrows, and other surface areas is fine.</li>
            <li> All of these trimmer will require you to go back to clean up loose ends...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very expensive anyway, so replacing is not a big deal.</li>
            <li> Just wish they had one that was a little less sexy and more utilitarian at a slightly lower price.</li>
            <li> The tip does get a little warm during use but other that that I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> Easy use, easy to clean &amp; it must be efficient as the battery hasn&#x27;t been changed &amp; it&#x27;s been buzzing along cutting down the geezer hairs.</li>
            <li> I am a long time panasonic user (shavers, clippers and other various things) and normally I am always satisfied with their build quality and how well they work.</li>
            <li> i do very little maintenance on it, and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> Previously, I would actually be able to grab that lone long hair with tweezers and pull it.</li>
            <li> The first time you use this, is slightly unnerving putting a spinning blade into your nose even knowing it can&#x27;t really hurt you.</li>
            <li> Really that machine helps me less embarrassing about my nostril hair ;).</li>
            <li> The angle is really very helpful and the blades do a better job than my previous trimmer, getting down to 1/64&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> this product is priced at the right level, however, its functionality could be better: not fast and sharp enough, and requires a fair amount of &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34; inside the nostrils to cut what needs cutting.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a lot more solid than any other similar product I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple ways and finally red so many of the other reviewers on here, I agree with them DO NOT BUY THIS product.</li>
            <li> Most folks know what I mean...</li>
            <li> I mean, what more can you say about an ear and nose hair trimmer?</li>
            <li> Much better than the two others we&#x27;ve had in the past!</li>
            <li> The device works decently when it first arrived, however after it&#x27;s second or third use it&#x27;s barely working.</li>
            <li> Even with new batteries, barely works.</li>
            <li> It is, to be sure, somewhat anxiety-inducing to use at first, as the idea of putting a little twirling razor in one&#x27;s nose sounds alarming and potentially treacherous, but it works like a dream in actuality.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, care for, pretty quiet, and not painful if you press a little too hard.</li>
            <li> Small, compact and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is small and compact, and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It is small and could be easy to lose, so you have to keep up with it.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t lose any of the small parts in the head, it is easy to do so.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s bizarre - other than the two times I briefly used it, the product has sat dormant in a bathroom drawer.</li>
            <li> small and easy to carry around for travel</li>
            <li> The unit is easily cleaned and includes a small brush for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s small and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> The small size and curved body makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> But the cutting end is so friendly and safe</li>
            <li> The product is small and easy to take with you when traveling.</li>
            <li> I remove it, run it under hot water, and blow it dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for the past 6 months and still runs strong.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I got a lemon or, just have unusually strong nose hair.  </li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend it to any male specie out there under the same torment of having unwanted hair in really, really, blunt areas.</li>
            <li> Comes with a little brush to clean it with.</li>
            <li> little note on how to clean</li>
            <li> This works really well, trims nose hairs with very little discomfort, is comfortable to hold, not too noisy, with a low price also.</li>
            <li> It rinses well, and the ergonomics at the handle actually make this easy to use at odd angles.</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate, inexpensive, hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled or stuck, can be used either wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t clean with antibacterial soap it dulls tiny rotating blades.</li>
            <li> I get some dark hair on the outside edges of my ears and it takes care of that just fine.</li>
            <li> The cleaning instructions and methodology are less than clear, and certainly more complex than most of us expected.</li>
            <li> It worked, it didn&#x27;t hurt, and now all I have is a cute Jewish nose, not a huge Jewish nose filled with black hair.</li>
            <li> Works way better than some other ones that really pull and pinch, and it cuts down super close to the skin, you can actually press pretty hard on the skin</li>
            <li> I believe it was a defective unit since it broke down so quickly.</li>
            <li> Powerful, sharp blades, easy to use and does work well when wet or dry.</li>
            <li> This does serve the purpose but the razor edge is not sharp enough to cut through  my husband&#x27;s very tpugh beard.</li>
            <li> He is only in his 30&#x27;s but in last year or so   developed nose and ear hair much to his dismay!</li>
            <li> Had it for a few months with the original battery</li>
            <li> There is no mess, no fuss, no pain.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seize up like other models and has a powerful motor for its size.</li>
            <li> Then I tried scissors, a sharp knife, and wire cutters without success.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a professional trimmer, it was high priced but basically the same as the crappy unit I already owned</li>
            <li> you feel the first time you drive it into your nose and all hell breaks loose</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but no big deal... no better than the older similar Panasonic device that is already 7 years old</li>
            <li> comfortable shave action, very little pulling</li>
            <li> Looks identical but when compared to the original, the sound quality is very poor.</li>
            <li> Not phenomenal, but it seems to work just fine.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit heavy and cumbersome to clean but otherwise has worked quite well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pain to clean though, and after a few uses it stopped working as well.</li>
            <li> It takes a few seconds to clean everything up</li>
            <li> I just turned on my faucet and stuck it underneath until I saw water coming out of the side port for a few seconds to clean it</li>
            <li> Cleanup is really easy, drop some liquid hand soap in on the closed setting, run for a short time then on the open setting rinse it out.  </li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m back here shopping for a decent one after throwing this one in the trash.</li>
            <li> Helps me stay groomed and the battery seems to last a decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> I was worried that it would be too large (as the photo appears), but it is actually small (the right size).</li>
            <li> Otherwise this is a solid trimmer at a decent price.</li>
            <li> This has the exact same head mechanism as the prior model.</li>
            <li> This is the third brand I&#x27;ve tried but the first one that actually worked.</li>
            <li> I have not yet had it pull on any hairs which my older one was constantly doing.</li>
            <li> So simple to use mainly for use for Men.</li>
            <li> but I have to be careful to not go full bore into my nostrils with it, or I have to pull it apart and rinse it out before it will run back up to speed.</li>
            <li> I have an older Panasonic clipper that still works well after several years use.</li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic unit that had occasional issues with the battery connection.</li>
            <li> Better at getting hair outside the nose than inside, I&#x27;m not sure why.</li>
            <li> i have bought many trimmers in the past and finally got something for the job.</li>
            <li> Worked decently when it would actually turn on.</li>
            <li> If the blade is not spinning fast enough it can snag your skin if your not careful.</li>
            <li> I had an older model Panasonic hair trimmer similar to this one.</li>
            <li> However, that generation left everyone bidding for the older versions on Ebay.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked very well for the first few weeks, then it began to stop intermittently and eat batteries.</li>
            <li> Really decent, my last trimmer was a Panasonic I bought in 1987.</li>
            <li> Gets a bit warm while in-use which can be awkward at first</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t reallize it at first, and when I finally did a couple of days later, I couldn&#x27;t find the part.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this review out by saying that I mainly use this as a nose hair trimmer and with ocassional facial hair and eyebrow trimming as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Not loud, not low quality, not dirty, well packaged...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different trimmers, including an older model Panasonic, and none came close to this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it to trim my nose hairs mostly, but I&#x27;ve also trimmed some small hairs that were starting to grow out of my ear canal.</li>
            <li> I replace an older Panasonic that I had for years, this replacement is the epitome of Chinese junk.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all unwanted hair and is small enough to store most places.</li>
            <li> My problem is that I can&#x27;t wrap my mind around the fact that I&#x27;ve growing older and nostril hairs are starting to hang lower than they used to.  </li>
            <li> ok, i was skeptical at first..</li>
            <li> I had a difficult time to get the battery to take, but once the metal connections within the battery compartment was stretched, I&#x27;ve had no problems and it is great for the price.</li>
            <li> I had an older model Panasonic for about five years that finally burned out on the nose and</li>
            <li> Panasonic you Finally came out with a decent product.</li>
            <li> This is my third nose hair trimmer, but actually the first one that works ...</li>
            <li> As I get older I&#x27;m starting to get the unwanted hair in my ears ans nose.</li>
            <li> I recently contacted Panasonic for a warranty replacement, which they were able to offer but we&#x27;re not able to send a call tag.</li>
            <li> Hair is trimmed fairly close when using tool vertically and a little closer when down flat.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t come with any sort of protective case, instead it just comes with a little cap that can easily pop off.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily, battery changes are very simple and rechargeable batts can be used to power this little beast.  </li>
            <li> He says that it cuts well and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs out; that the sensation is a little ticklish, but not painful at all.</li>
            <li> No need to hand clean the gross nose hairs by hand like the other brands.</li>
            <li> right out of the box &#x27;sharp&#x27;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these due to dropping one and having it land right on the trimmer tip.</li>
            <li> It does not pull the nose hair like earlier model did; I would highly recommend this nose hair trimmer to anyone</li>
            <li> Broke when I dropped it from 2 feet (not really the manufacturer&#x27;s fault that I dropped it, but I still don&#x27;t like the product very much).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as high RPM as my prior Panasonic (purchased in Japan) trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Not because it works poorly or broke fast, but mostly because I have to admit that I&#x27;m old enough to need a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> My only complaint thus  far is that when in the nose if left own for longer than 30 seconds the metal tip with the blade in it begins to heat up and gives me a bit of a scared reaction.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Simply because it feels like a high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit</li>
            <li> I do like the washable feature where it lets water out of the vent in the back - highly recommend to users looking for a nose</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the high quality build given the low price.  </li>
            <li> The guard is so high up on the razor that it doesn&#x27;t actually allow it to cut.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend these for anyone needing to trim facial hair.</li>
            <li> Male member of the family appreciates this item, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp &amp; according to instructions extra blades are available for purchase.</li>
            <li> Oh, and the knives are very sharp and precise - nose and ear trimming are not marathon events - short sprint</li>
            <li> /&gt;Reminds me of my beard trimmers: each time I need new one, the latest models are worse than the one before.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic device is a big step ahead in allowing you to purchase replacement a cutter blade and housing without buying a complete new unit.</li>
            <li> Finally replaced my old one for this new one.  </li>
            <li> am giving 4 stars right now because I want to see how long the unit and batteries last.  </li>
            <li> I guess I am a little old school and expected more.  </li>
            <li> , it was a Braun, and because it was a piece of junk and just stopped working, I decided to look at something a little more expensive, and with better reviews.  </li>
            <li> While rather inexpensive, didn&#x27;t expect it would last less than 2 years under light use.  </li>
            <li> I prefer the other unit because it has a built in vacuum to clean up as it does its job.</li>
            <li> I had the previous model - which lasted years - but this one is taller, and angled to allow for a better grip and positioning on harder to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Luckily I don&#x27;t have to use it very often but it has lasted for at least 2 years from when I purchased it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and is sharp to remove hair from most difficult to remove places.</li>
            <li> The round end is superior to the flat end trimmer I previously owned.</li>
            <li> Never jams or catches hair, actually enjoyable to use, as it makes very rapid, gentle clicking noise (low and not loud) when it&#x27;s cutting, giving you audio feedback that it&#x27;s in the right spot.</li>
            <li> Works very well, a little in the large side</li>
            <li> The circular cutting head on this trimmer is amazing!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, compact, and curved to fit the hand</li>
            <li> Strange, really.  </li>
            <li> Got this to do some minor trimming ,and it really does the trick.</li>
            <li> It is relatively small and light weight.  </li>
            <li> Small and light</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not exactly sure i enjoy using it.  </li>
            <li> well, worked as it shd, comfortable using it as comparable to those that i used/owned in the past.</li>
            <li> really lasts LONG</li>
            <li> Does not get everything the first time and tickles but that is expected.</li>
            <li> On the other hand Amazon gave me an instant full credit and sent me a label to print out so the</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected.</li>
            <li> The flat small trimer works better</li>
            <li> On my first use, I popped a AA battery into the unit, went into the bathroom, turned it on, stuck it up my nose and expected nothing.  </li>
            <li> When he first showed this to me, I was worried he had bought something from sharper image or a store of that sort and spent $$.  </li>
            <li> It was working as I expected at first.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected, nothing much else to say!</li>
            <li> The first one lasted for about three years, functions as expected, no complaints.</li>
            <li> But do you look and feel normal walking around in public?  </li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty much as expected.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have described, it worked quietly at first, and would have earned 4 stars, but after some months it became too loud to use in my ears.</li>
            <li> This i exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is about Panasonic&#x27;s packaging - I don&#x27;t know why they, or just anyone, use that kind of plastic package, which is awfully hard to open and can easily hurt your fingers.</li>
            <li> Only down side is that it burns through batteries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews were so right as far as &amp;#34;no pulls&amp;#34;, cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
            <li> Hardest part was figuring out how to open it to put the battery in (NOT hard at all)  </li>
            <li> super little trimmer.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get super close, you can still feel a little fuzz.  </li>
            <li> Still working fine after a few years of admittedly occasional use.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite a powerful as the small older model, but it does work.</li>
            <li> I expected something a little better than this.</li>
            <li> After that the only thing that came on was the little light.  </li>
            <li> it is a tiny little thing, lightly built.</li>
            <li> My only complaint, it does get hot quickly.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it goes thru batteries pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> Has plenty of power and is easy to maneuver in hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> , eyebrows take a little more careful use.  </li>
            <li> Those little hand held manual ones always did a good job too, but they are so clumsy.  </li>
            <li> Most of these last a year or so,  so I&#x27;m curious how long this will last.</li>
            <li> I made sure not to press hard on my face or nose to avoid potential bleeding.  </li>
            <li> It works well, fast and lasts for a long time between trims!</li>
            <li> After years using small scissors which was not satisfactory due to small nips/cuts, I found the Panasonic ear and nose trimmer to be the ideal tool.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap little device and worked well enough and suited my purposes just fine, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t last for a full year.  </li>
            <li> New one is significantly larger, but that also makes it easier to grasp, so sort of a trade</li>
            <li> I last one died after 3 years, so replaced with this new model.  </li>
            <li> The blade replacement was the same price as a new product, so I decided to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> I changed the batteries several times with new ones.</li>
            <li> Anyways, adding an item to this kit is basically the biggest compliment I can give an item as I only do it with items that I cant live without.</li>
            <li> but ive tried numerous new batterys</li>
            <li> - If you purchase a replacement tip (set), the cost is about the same as just buying a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was bought new, I put the battery in, used it for about six minutes total.</li>
            <li> I am going to have to purchase a new one from a different company now.</li>
            <li> When new it instantly shaved the hair so you never feel it.  </li>
            <li> Summery: They do the job as advertised, and last for a couple of years or so, and then you&#x27;re shopping for a new one.</li>
            <li> Perhaps they would prefer to make a larger profit by sell entirely new units instead of replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I inserted a new battery and double checked the polarity, but couldn&#x27;t get it to power up.  </li>
            <li> I think we can live with that, even though we might not admit the use of such an item.</li>
            <li> I had my last one 10 years before buying a new one.</li>
            <li> It does a remarkable job in the trimming of all your facial hair including those little hard to get to places.</li>
            <li> I dropped mine on the hard floor and now it makes a little more noise than at first</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this one, it&#x27;s for your nose not general use?</li>
            <li> I have not had it for very long, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> As I expected, not so excellent nor not too bad.</li>
            <li> and it does a great job of trimming the area immediately beneath the nose which is impossible to reach with my electric shaver/trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several of these all with disappointment, I have used this for a while now and it works great.</li>
            <li> Can clean it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> Bought to replace an older model (I lost) that looks similar but is no longer made,  Was skeptical give the negative reviews, but have used it several times and works great - closer cut and much quieter than my older unit for nose and ear trimming.</li>
            <li> It works really well and is sturdy, the last 2 I bought broke (a different model and company something like a micro touch and then the micro touch 2?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few weeks, now and it is better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I am not a person that cares much about physical appearance, but I have to admit that sometimes things go out of control and growing facial hair</li>
            <li> I had difficulty making it travel a straight line along my upper lip, and accidentally cut a notch over my philtrum, which will have to grow back out.</li>
            <li> Facial hair is gently removed and heavier hair such as around hair line is not problem either.</li>
            <li> I was using what I thought was a cheap ($9.99) one from Ross a few years back.</li>
            <li> Got it on a gold box sale for a lot less than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
            <li> Now if only Panasonic would come up with a unit with both systems and actually sell a reasonably priced blade...</li>
            <li> After trying several similar products, this is the one that really works.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to any gentleman.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li> so it will last a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> At least he has not grumbled about it as yet and he sure does enough of it when he does not like something.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had excessive nose hair as long as I can remember and it just gets better with age - not.  </li>
            <li> At the end of the day, it wasn&#x27;t too big a hit at only $15 or so, but for it to die out that quickly really irked me.  </li>
            <li> instructions for cleaning the trimmer are more confusing than they need to be (a Panasonic trademark) and the actual cleaning is tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> so I think it should at least last a year, maybe more.</li>
            <li> Why does hair - at least more hair than is need for basic filtration - grow in your nose anyway.</li>
            <li> were so cheaply made they broke after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Re re-inserting the inner blade into the outer blade-just push it in gently, but there is no way to &#x27;lock&#x27; it in AFAIK, so no real proper orientation or grooves to slide into-don&#x27;t worry about it;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money for the trimmer that cost less than $20</li>
            <li> No pulling, trims very close without having to go back several times to get the job done.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but we&#x27;ll check back later to see how it endures.</li>
            <li> The only beef I&#x27;ve got is that you should definitely keep some rechargeable batteries on hand as it is very draining on them.</li>
            <li> This is my second trimmer, after the first bit the dust after long use.  </li>
            <li> After reading reviews, I spent a few bucks more on this one.</li>
            <li> I feel all these small home electronics are designed pretty well and do work fine for a while, but tend to break down somehow over time.</li>
            <li> I use it a lot on my nose, neck, and ears and it will take them right down to the skin.</li>
            <li> This product does a very nice job and isn&#x27;t very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I can get it to work on occasion if I unscrew the bottom cap and play with the positioning of the battery, but even then the RPMs rev up and down, the blade makes a grinding sound and the unit puts off a strange odor.  </li>
            <li> This hair trimmer works reasonably well for an inexpensive single AA battery powered device.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well on a single AA battery.  </li>
            <li> I generally redistribute the AA battery in about 2-3 months!</li>
            <li> Small, easy to clean but no battery included, always a negative to me.</li>
            <li> It looks the same as many of the others Panasonic put out in the in the past, but it actually works and works well - bravo!  </li>
            <li> After having tried and given up on many other brands, I am extremely grateful to have discovered one that actually works the way I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected of it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankful for all the reviews on this item that lead me to trust this purchase!</li>
            <li> Finally; a nose hair trimmer that actually lasts more than a few uses!  </li>
            <li> and my nose is BARE!  </li>
            <li> If you have those stiffies way back in the nostril that have been bothering you, this isn&#x27;t meant to be stuffed deep and has a pretty short barrel tip which causes your nose opening to distort and move the hairs if you do try to reach them.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but better than most others that have been tried in the past.</li>
            <li> If manufacturers would concentrate on mechanical quality over extra useless marketing settings, I&#x27;d be willing to pay much more $.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t compare this to other makes and models because this is the first one I ever used.</li>
            <li> so I just reverted back to the old tweezer method-ouch!</li>
            <li> It cuts pretty short so for the first day or two afterwards, if you squeeze your nose it hurts a little because of the short prickly hairs.</li>
            <li> A little flimsy, just as many other&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It sucks getting old, but at least I can keep my nose and ear hair trimmed nicely!  </li>
            <li> By &amp;#34;stopped working&amp;#34; I mean that the rotary blade simply refused to spin any more.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it was designed and performs extremely well.  </li>
            <li> The first one just stopped working after about 2 months of infrequent use (1 – 2 min every other week).  </li>
            <li> It has started to vary a bit on the RPM, and it is not due to the battery.</li>
            <li> There no other way to go.</li>
            <li> Some other trimmers can make you feel like Arnold in that scene from the original Total Recall, in which he extracts a homing device from somewhere in his upper nostril.  </li>
            <li> No other problems.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t have a major nose hair issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it does exactly like other consumers have indicated.</li>
            <li> I wish that some manufacturer would simply build one that stayed sharp, where they offered reasonably priced replacement parts, and one that will last more than a few months.  </li>
            <li> First battery did not seem to last very long though.</li>
            <li> Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black also tends to get a little warm after a minute or two.</li>
            <li> As the hair grows back, if you scratch your nose (or lets be honest, go digging for gold), you&#x27;ve got these odd little prickly hairs in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works and didn&#x27;t break in half the first time it was turned on like my old one.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to pack in your shaving kit and easily washed.</li>
            <li> This product is easy to clean and hasn&#x27;t broken down yet.</li>
            <li> Does the job, hasn&#x27;t cut me, hasn&#x27;t broken (had it a year) and is pretty mild on the batteries.  </li>
            <li> This model does have a decent battery life but other than that not much else is worth noting.</li>
            <li> Not only is this the best trimmer in the world, but it&#x27;s nearly the least expensive.</li>
            <li> This trimmer eliminates those pesky little hairs cleanly and quietly with no drama.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is, that, while a battery seems to run the thing for a long time,&lt;br /&gt;it really only runs it at an impressive, optimal speed for a dozen or so uses, so, somewhat hard on batteries.</li>
            <li> The real issue I have with it is that it&#x27;s tough and time consuming to clean.</li>
            <li> It comes with a small brush to clean the head--a plus.</li>
            <li> My previous such tool ran off a AAA battery and really didn&#x27;t have much power.  </li>
            <li> Blade is sharp so there is no pulling, and the motor seems powerful enough.</li>
            <li> I replaced a much older off-brand one and this out performs it by a long shot.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other electric trimmers that pulled and grabbed and obviously weren&#x27;t fun to use.  </li>
            <li> : I use a bathroom tissue or a q-tip to clean the hair stuck near the blade, also blow air to remove any hard one&#x27;s and has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> /&gt;This really doesn&#x27;t do much for any other spots like your ears or eyebrows, unless you are planning on spending a long time feeding hairs in one by one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i got ever all my other ones where cheap did not last long</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit, I was a little nervous shoving this thing around in my nose (a cut inside the nose would not be fun...)</li>
            <li> I own a few other panasonic units from long ago.  </li>
            <li> This drain hole is important so that water can drain when running water over the cutting head to clean it.  </li>
            <li> For the coup de grace, he trimmed the monobrow connector at the top of his nose (something I have to keep reminding him to do), and it worked almost as well as tweezers, in much less time, with much less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy</li>
            <li> I like the slight curve design it  has, much better than my previous one</li>
            <li> It worked fine, and still does as long as I change the battery every few uses.</li>
            <li> You are supposed to clean it with every use, but this only takes a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> You might have to go over the same area a few times, but in 1-2 minutes, your nose and ears are clean.</li>
            <li> When it worked, it was fine, but didn&#x27;t last past 2 uses</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate, but not easy to cut long hairs.</li>
            <li> Especially for those of us older males who consider hairs sprouting from one&#x27;s nostrils or ears sort of gross.</li>
            <li> I have read reports that it dies rather quick, less than or around 1 year of solid use before it goes belly up.  </li>
            <li> I thought I should have to pay more for a decent trimmer, but I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> It is quick, easy and painless!&lt;br /&gt;Better than cutting the nose hairs with scissors</li>
            <li> I eventually determined that to ship it back for warranty repair would cost more than the original price, so I gave up and tossed it in the garbage, which appears to be the proper storage container for this disappointing product from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This one never does, I would highly recommend it for anyone with an odd shaped nose or if you haven&#x27;t had luck with older model Panasonics.</li>
            <li> This seems to work okay, haven&#x27;t used in wet applications yet, however seems to work about the same as another brand bought at the drug store - just a little fancier design.  </li>
            <li> In my experience many trimmers don&#x27;t have very powerful motors, or they fail in some other way after a short time.  </li>
            <li> IF you ever have trouble breathing, are short of breathe, exercise, and just plain want more energy, use these!</li>
            <li> Although the design looks about the same as the other models there must be a slight change in the design to make it work better.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is quiet and cuts better (less hair pulled out by the roots) than other trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several trimmers and while the blades eventually become dull and render the trimmer useless, Panasonic makes the best trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I had struggled with bad trimmers for years, but this Panasonic trimmer is great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad, it would otherwise have been a great product.</li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s too bad because they work great - until they don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> works amazing, you can use it in your nose and it does not feel weird or like it&#x27;s going to cut you.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and has metal cutting blades not those plastic ones that never last.</li>
            <li> At least they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li> I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier at how well these perform and how easy it is to use.  </li>
            <li> The build quality etc seem to be alright, but generally it seems to be underpowered.</li>
            <li> it really doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should.</li>
            <li> I really like this thing and since it is from Panasonic,I know it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Looks like other cheap nose hair trimmers that I have had, but this thing is really sharp.  </li>
            <li> Its light, it&#x27;s quiet, it&#x27;s small and compact.</li>
            <li> It is very well made and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I wondered about the performance of such a light small device.  </li>
            <li> I used to go to important events with a small number of 3 inch hairs protruding from chin and upper lip.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to fit in my backpack</li>
            <li> This may very well be the last in a long line of trimmers for me.</li>
            <li> I am very curios to see how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the instruction book is as clear as it could be (for cleaning purposes) and that&#x27;s the only downfall to the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Small enough to fit in a convenient place at home or on the road.</li>
            <li> Not a fun item to have to purchase in life, however, when that sad day comes, this is a great item to buy.</li>
            <li> By design,tip does not go in far enough to hit eardrum,also too blount.</li>
            <li> During my recent move I lost my old one</li>
            <li> This model is barely acceptable.</li>
            <li> Apparently you can replace the blade after a suggested three years, but for the price of the unit (I paid $10)</li>
            <li> Panasonic quality is apparent.</li>
            <li> product works very well and as expected</li>
            <li> I found they didn&#x27;t last, they nicked too much, didn&#x27;t cut close enough, etc, and always went back to scissors.&lt;br</li>
            <li> not where it burns you, but enough that you cant use it near skin.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t allow you to go to far and irritate the hair back in your nose.  </li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer cause my old trimmer finally gave out on me.</li>
            <li> Trimming nose and facial hair is now a 100% completely painless endeavor.</li>
            <li> This one you barely notice.</li>
            <li> Big improvement over my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I tried to use it on my 5 year old&#x27;s overly extensive eyebrows but it ended up pulling out a eyebrow hair which hurt her</li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> I purchased this mid-July 2013 and it barely made it to the end of November 2013.</li>
            <li> Apparently nothing broke</li>
            <li> I thought all these trimmers were the same so when my old Panasonic died I bought this one.  </li>
            <li> I bought the trimmer with no regrets.</li>
            <li> Just rotate the collar to the well marked faucet simple on the trimmer and run it under water with the power on.  </li>
            <li> I had been using an inexpensive old noisy thing , and this is a vast improvement.  </li>
            <li> Thankfully, my husband is still young enough not to have ear hair, but his nose hair is another story.</li>
            <li> Apparently my body hates me.  </li>
            <li> Never dropped, never wet.</li>
            <li> I tend to have longer nose hairs and have frequently picked at them for my entire life.  </li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t be surprised if it wears out sooner than later.</li>
            <li> This thing works, but you need to be careful not to be too liberal with it because it can really be aggressive on its taking hair out.</li>
            <li> Apparently my body hates me.</li>
            <li> Not wanting to put a razor to such sensitive skin, I looked for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> That said, I only put it in my ear to see how loud it would be and hopefully won&#x27;t need it for that functionality for some time.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s near whisper quiet, and doesn&#x27;t seem to use my charge at all.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I barely have need to use these once every 3 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t attest to how it operates next to the ear drum, but as far as cleaning out nose hair</li>
            <li> He actually used it though and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> This worked very well although I have never used it in the shower or in the wet</li>
            <li> ONLY cut the longer hairs near the front of your nose.  </li>
            <li> Battery life, so far, has been several months.  </li>
            <li> The Panasonic people apparently designed this device with ergonomic principles in mind.</li>
            <li> It painlessly removes hair from sensitive areas such as the ears and nose.</li>
            <li> Back to trimming hair the old fashioned way, I guess.</li>
            <li> Barely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Never would go back to old method.</li>
            <li> Apparently quality control was skipped for the trimmer I received.</li>
            <li> Have only used mine 3 times so far</li>
            <li> Well made, quiet, does not pull or tug on hairs in sensitive areas - does the job it was intended to do.  </li>
            <li> Now it barely turns on, and i need to tweak the metal connector to make it work.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how it works without any possible pain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far</li>
            <li> This modestly priced grooming tool is my weapon of choice in the escalating war against facial hair that I am now prepared to face.  </li>
            <li> No regrets.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old unit of a different brand which had lasted for years.  </li>
            <li> To start, I am a 25 year old mostly-Italian male.</li>
            <li> and it recently just stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far</li>
            <li> Only used it about 4 times so far.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would be old enough to write a review about a nose hair trimmer,  sigh.</li>
            <li> last week the blade makes loud mechanical noise.</li>
            <li> was picturing chainsaw action when I read &amp;#34;nose hair clipper&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s actually painless, no pulling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It barely cut nose hairs and quit working after 6 or 7 uses over 4 month period.  </li>
            <li> having owned several of these devices, i&#x27;ve still not seen anything comparable to the old heavy-duty sharper image \\&quot;turbo groomer 2.0\\</li>
            <li> So far the only brand I have found that works is Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> after 5 months this stopped working, my husband barely used it at all.</li>
            <li> and when I put it back together it started making a loud buzzing noise when I turned it on and when I tried using it</li>
            <li> Have only just used it once so far on nose &amp; ears.</li>
            <li> I got this about a week ago and have used it several times so far.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use this item because we apparently threw out the &#x27;blades&#x27; that come with it?  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my old reliable Panasonic trimmer that finally gave out.</li>
            <li> It cuts very close and with minimal pulling.</li>
            <li> It was never dropped or mishandled, just lived its short existence in my medicine cabinet before failing completely.</li>
            <li> Something about the idea of a nose hair trimmer made me feel old even though I am only 25.</li>
            <li> Growing old is definitely not for sissies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> old Panasonic trimmer finally wore out after three days of plowing through the nose beard.</li>
            <li> Once you have nicked the interior of your nasal passage by trying to maneuver another trimmer, you will so appreciate the double blade action and smoothness of this item.</li>
            <li> I had a old panisonic like this one that has seen it&#x27;s final days</li>
            <li> this barely works.</li>
            <li> Only used it twice so far - for nose hair removal.</li>
            <li> and i could barely tell that it was on.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not prone to dropping things, but I was surprised when it smashed the entire metal &amp;#34;head&amp;#34;, making it useless.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Barely worked ...</li>
            <li> Cuts very close and works just as I expected it would.</li>
            <li> my only problem was that it would not work with the battery seated correctly, it would work with the battery almost completely out of it&#x27;s bracket ( don&#x27;t remember how discovered that ), then you couldn&#x27;t put on the bottom battery cover.</li>
            <li> I have only used a couple of times so far.</li>
            <li> Not much to say really.</li>
            <li> At that time, it stopped working, but after around a week, I tried it again, and it worked, albeit, barely.  </li>
            <li> Thanks  everything expected.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness he is now back in action.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband when his old one finally died after 15 years.  </li>
            <li> Quiet and soft to both ears and nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought as a belated Christmas present for my 28 year old son.  </li>
            <li> put the old one back in and it worked.  </li>
            <li> I had an old style Panasonic that lasted for years and expect this one to last too.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost next to impossible to get a good steady stream of water to flush it out as it is depicted.  </li>
            <li> After a few uses, it will start buzzing loudly and the tip will get really hot and it won&#x27;t cut anything.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought it for a few weeks, and by far it works pretty well:</li>
            <li> My husband really liked this this trimmer for his random nose and ear hairs.  </li>
            <li> Kind of expensive, but in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer does a good job of cutting close.</li>
            <li> Not quite as effective as I was hoping for, but then again it wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these things before and good lord sometimes instead of cutting the hair it just pulls it.  </li>
            <li> The blade does a good job of cutting through hairs without snagging.</li>
            <li> Decreased sexual stamina.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why some have found this to crap out in a short period of time, as I&#x27;ve been using mine regularly for almost three years, and it still works great!</li>
            <li> The guys with none on top seem to have it worse.  </li>
            <li> and I figured cutting them out would be a good idea.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but not great.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly, no pulling the hair, so no discomfort of any kind.</li>
            <li> They stand behind the products more than anyone else on the internet.</li>
            <li> It does a good job of cutting the hair close without hurting or pulling.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t do a good job cutting the hairs.</li>
            <li> It does a good job at cutting hair though.</li>
            <li> It does a good job cutting hairs and not pulling them out.</li>
            <li> I’ll have to go back to maintaining my mustache with a razor and the little scissors, which is a pain in the kiester, but at least works right, consistently, the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Superior to the less expensive Panasonic model I used previously; although both use a single AA battery, this model has better speed and perhaps sharper blades</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d bought a WAHL brand nose trimmer in the past and it hardly did a thing, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this nose trimmer only once, but it got any hairs, for sure and right away.</li>
            <li> This little guy gets the job done easily and with minimal pain.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it arrived damaged or not, but the inner blade rubs on the outer blade quite a bit thus slowing it down and making kind of a racket.</li>
            <li> I would give it a 5 stars &#x27;cause it is very comfortable and safer than other used in the past.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my other half and it does the trick easily and painlessly.  </li>
            <li> Reminder to myself (and anyone else):  to avoid pain, replace the battery at the first sign it&#x27;s slowing down.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was not very expensive by itself but given its lifespan, I spent $3 a trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another attribute of the Vortex that is different, yet at the same time brilliant, is a small ring near the cone tip that when twisted, opens a small hole where you can run water through to clean it.  </li>
            <li> cool for few weeks but easy to be broken</li>
            <li> Nice, no pulling, my only complaint is that the single battery design means that as soon as voltage drops a tad, it doesn&#x27;t have enough torque to start.</li>
            <li> I have always swore by this trimmer and only had to buy a new one because I left it at a hotel while traveling.</li>
            <li> 4 different, new, different brand batteries tried and still nothing.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works really well and the battery last a very long time (of course you don&#x27;t need to use it too often).</li>
            <li> This one is far better than other similar products that I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> easy to store, cheap; there&#x27;s nothing bad to say about it</li>
            <li> I was able to get done is less than few mins.</li>
            <li> This ear &amp; nose trimmer is much smaller &amp; less powerful than I thought.</li>
            <li> I have a Norelco all-in-one that is twice as loud and not nearly as effective with quick trims</li>
            <li> After a few months it would studder and stop a need a quick take apart and put back together to keep going.</li>
            <li> but you can easily injure yourself in a incredibly annoying but mostly harmless way if you get overzealous.</li>
            <li> I felt mild stinging in my nose for the next few days while it healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In my case (probably due to so much hair) the trimmer did indeed get warm but it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable or anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> No, it doesn&#x27;t trim right down to the skin level, but that&#x27;s not necessary, and not even desirable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It seems to not go too long before new batteries are needed</li>
            <li> Did take a few uses to get the procedure right</li>
            <li> you&#x27;d be surprised to know that this little gadget is used on the space shuttle to gyrate a powerful telescope, and circulate the oxygen in ratios similar to those present here on earth.</li>
            <li> Works well for keeping those ugly nose hairs from making unsightly public appearances; love the ability to run water through the head to clean it without having to take it apart</li>
            <li> First one I&#x27;ve used, purchased based on previous reviews.</li>
            <li> Better than other units I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay... but doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs as well as other units i have owned, including some past panasonic units.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works well, and lasts longer due to its larger battery and being a higher quality item.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure it works better than any other.  </li>
            <li> Head and shoulders better than any of the other Nose/Ear trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> A review a product is essential for other s who are interested is buying it.</li>
            <li> They work better than other clippers I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> My one, minor criticism is that unlike other trimmers, it doesn&#x27;t have a optional &#x27;hedge-trimmer&#x27; attachment, which would be so useful to keep sideburns and eyebrows tamed.</li>
            <li> It is a small appliance and tucks away quickly.</li>
            <li> The small, but sleek design, fits in a drawer and out of the way when not in use, or sits on the counter as a bold statement that you care.</li>
            <li> quick, painless, slick-</li>
            <li> Hard to get too excited about a nose hair trimmer</li>
            <li> Fast, easy and quick way to get rid of annoying nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Every so often I would notice hairs both long and short poking out around the edges, which I would hedge back with scissors, fingertips (did I say that I have large nostrils?) and  tweezers.</li>
            <li> The first powered trimmer that I used was a generic, shipped directly from China and cost a little under $3.</li>
            <li> Finally needed to replace my old Wahl ear and nose trimmer, was surprised how mediocre reviews are for most models these days.</li>
            <li> My only  complaint is battery operated and when the battery is low the spinning is slow and catches the hair at times,  Pther than that is great</li>
            <li> Good power and not the hard to hold onto tiny things usually associated with this style of grooming.</li>
            <li> Maybe that&#x27;s to be expected with a less expensive item like this, but I&#x27;d gladly pay extra for something more reliable.</li>
            <li> Bought to replace a previous Panasonic trimmer (which was becoming less sharp/effective).</li>
            <li> The cutting action is far superior to cheaper models, with hair being caught and ripped out far less often.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not very heavy, but it feels solid and durable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little obsessed when it comes to this type of grooming &amp; I&#x27;m happy I got this.  </li>
            <li> Works great for those silly little husband nose whiskers.</li>
            <li> It is small enough to easily fit into a nostril or ear and actually cuts the hair, rather than ripping them out like another brand he tried.  </li>
            <li> The blades are really sharp &amp; fast, so no hairs get pulled.</li>
            <li> They cut the hairs in the nose and ear very well, and seem to work well in other areas also.</li>
            <li> It removes the hairs that are hard to remove and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li> tried other trimmers so I can&#x27;t really compare</li>
            <li> but NOTHING... maybe a little ticklish, but WOW it worked really well...</li>
            <li> /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time, but at its extremely affordable price, I won&#x27;t mind too much if it konks out in 18 months or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> hard to clean.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have too much experience with this type of product, I did buy one other nose and ear groomer about 5 years ago.  </li>
            <li> This battery powered unit works very well, but it is a bit louder than the other Wahl unit I had with the crappy rechargable battery.</li>
            <li> This item was very well priced and worked extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I have no complaints other than the fact that i think mine might be a bit defective because it seems like the AA battery in it drains extremely fast.</li>
            <li> I have used other models, and they just did not cut the hairs very well, so it took forever to use, and they were really hard to clean</li>
            <li> Works really well without pulling the hair or causing pain, like some of the other products out there.</li>
            <li> With hundreds of other reviews, I don&#x27;t have much to add.  </li>
            <li> I find that it work very well and no pulling of hairs or any other discomfort.</li>
            <li> So much easier than any other method that I&#x27;ve tried of managing nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Blade is sharp and trims very close and doesn&#x27;t pull or cut skin.</li>
            <li> Took me awhile (a few times) to get used to sticking a buzzing device up my nose, but I love this little guy.</li>
            <li> I recommend it if you don&#x27;t need something a little more heavy duty.</li>
            <li> No girl wants to see a rogue curly-que coming out of your nostrils on a first date or a 500th date for that matter so cut those bad boys back with this easy to use man-scaping tool.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy following the instructions as they make it more complex than it really is.</li>
            <li> For the low price I can&#x27;t complain but it certainly did not live up to the numerous 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> The nose trimmer I previously owned is no longer on the market and although it worked well, the Panasonic outperforms it in the areas of pinch due to hair pull, design, size and sound.</li>
            <li> the inner blade is very small and easily lost.</li>
            <li> Definitely more \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; than the 2 or 3 other similar products I&#x27;ve tried in the same price range.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the positive reviews, but after I used it several times I am not sure why this product is rated so high.</li>
            <li> As a warning, make sure you have new batteries, using old ones can tug on the nose hairs rather than cutting them.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was simply over taken by the extreme amount of positive reviews on Amazon for this Nose &amp; Ear Trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried at least twelve different models over the years (including that huge trimmer from Sharper Image)</li>
            <li> So far so good on this bad boy.</li>
            <li> And I really did like this up until it completely stopped working a few months into its life.  </li>
            <li> Cutting is quick and clean, no pulling or tearing.  </li>
            <li> trimmers that all started out great but then failed within a few months.</li>
            <li> Gives me illusions of adequacy in close social situations.</li>
            <li> Thing does NOT spin fat enough (a problem the old one exhibited but after several years of use)</li>
            <li> The blades seem set back just a bit too far for short hair, but it gets the job done well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very picky about electronics and gadgets that I buy and spent hours looking at reviews for nose and facial hair</li>
            <li> I have spent so much time &amp; money trying different trimmers &amp; none</li>
            <li> So, I am old enough to need to actually replace one of these.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this for a frail old man, please do him a big favor and open it for him.</li>
            <li> My only advice is to get as far away from this product as possible.</li>
            <li> Seemed to work pretty slick so far.</li>
            <li> This one does a much quicker, better cutting job</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll purchase next time something from a brand that will stand behind their product, even if it costs more.</li>
            <li> unit is worth the few extra dollars</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t a game changer of nose hair trimming or anything, So far battery life is sound.</li>
            <li> Felt only 2 small tugs (not painful)...</li>
            <li> I see Panasonic sells a model similar to that still...but can&#x27;t say if it works better or worse than this</li>
            <li> Not as good at cutting as my last trimmer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer had the most positive stars and least negative stars.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, works flawlessly, no pain at all!!  </li>
            <li> The blades could very easily get bent and render this useless.</li>
            <li> However, if you place it about half way down, it will rotate just fine.</li>
            <li> I love it, no more plucking my nose hair and tears dripping down my cheeks.</li>
            <li> Does tickle the nose a little at first, but one gets used to that.</li>
            <li> This little unit does exactly what it say&#x27;s it will do and does not pinch or hurt.  </li>
            <li> This little thing works wonders but first timers should use caution not to over cut your nose hair.</li>
            <li> Woks better than other similar devices I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> He said it felt a little funny to use, but worked well.</li>
            <li> At first he was a little worried that it might cut him but after giving it a try he loves it.</li>
            <li> The quiet motor and the little drain hole make this one a little better than the others that I have used.  </li>
            <li> Feels a little flimsy at first but does the job without problem.</li>
            <li> Does the job better than any other similar trimmer I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> the ones that lay flat against the bottom inside part of your nostril, that you can only see with a small mirror and light.</li>
            <li> and I actually own several differnet panasonic models over the last 10+ years, this one is up there with being the best, these will last you a couple of years(2)  depending on use, after that be prepared to buy a new one, they dull out and start pulling which can be extremely painful, but 15 bucks every other year is a small price to pay to not have to creep out folks and digust them with nose or ear hair dangling!</li>
            <li> I had a brand new one not just go dead, but apparently the motor burned out or something in transit, because even with a new battery, it wouldn&#x27;t work again.</li>
            <li> I see that Panasonic offers several models, even one with a vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li> it has little pieces you can easily drop down the sink.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old trimmer which had gotten dull and did not have much power left in it even with new batteries.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and shaped just right for holding it without it being awkward.  </li>
            <li> It always takes me a few minutes to get it back on just the right way in order to continue to trim.</li>
            <li> Even thought they are a little more expensive, they are worth it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am missing the little back blade that fits at the top.</li>
            <li> The tip does get a little warm, but that&#x27;s the only negative I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> It does not get that dirty in the first place, but it cleans easily too.</li>
            <li> It does the job but am not sure how well it will hold on over a year, Electric / powered grooming products typically are made and feel more robust and sturdier than this unit.</li>
            <li> This product is better than all previous brands I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty quiet and makes way less noise than my beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several trimmers in the past that died quickly or pulled rather than trimmed</li>
            <li> Much smaller units but quiet powerful motors that last very long on a a single set of batteries.  </li>
            <li> However, even though the trimmer is under warranty, I&#x27;m not willing to spent the cost of shipping (which is more than half of the cost of the trimmer itself) to find out whether my hunch is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other sites sell replacement heads, but they generally cost more than even the fancy ER430 vacuum-model (which, thankfully, uses the same head as this one, so at least I can cannabilize this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Generally speaking, the panasonic trimmer simply does its job, and</li>
            <li> but it certainly is strange that we can&#x27;t find anything that works like the old one, which was also a Panasonic, but</li>
            <li> Apparently I have spider legs that like to hang out of my big nose.</li>
            <li> This is totally waterproof and has never jammed or pulled hair.</li>
            <li> I can no long use this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> was just barely peeking at the world (only a wife would notice).</li>
            <li> Barely has enough power to trim any hair</li>
            <li> The next time I used it, it barely did anything.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other models of electric trimmers bought at local big box stores, but while they did OK starting out, they tended to fall apart after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much</li>
            <li> -- I misplaced the first one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different brands for nose trimmer, but they don&#x27;t last literally 6 months; they are flimsy, easily broken, and not working well.</li>
            <li> well worth the small price, no chance to stab yourself</li>
            <li> At first I just thought it was dead batt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s round, so you don&#x27;t have to doing any funny maneuvers.</li>
            <li> The first I had for a few weeks</li>
            <li> After a few seconds of use it gets too hot for my nostrils.</li>
            <li> That is likely something that is unavoidable with devices such as this, but I cant help feeling kind of weird using this.</li>
            <li> My old one was more expensive and used a rechargeable internal battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first round of batteries.</li>
            <li> After a few uses(about 8 or so) I heard this horrendous grinding noise and the tip got really hot and even quit working...</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was a bit worried, at first, after a few sitcoms spoofed this type of product.  </li>
            <li> My first one died after a few months of not-that-heavy use, hopefully it was just a fluke.</li>
            <li> If you purchase, I think you&#x27;ll agree that this product is worth the small cost.</li>
            <li> only thing is if the product came with a  small cloth, it would have been easy to dry it off immediately, instead keeping it outside for 10 mins or so.</li>
            <li> My allergies make a little nose hair feel like a log in my nasal passage; how many hours did I waste with a little clipper trying to precisely cut one little hair.</li>
            <li> , this product cut it down very close to the skin&lt;br</li>
            <li> this one is the real deal: Trims me down to my baby-soft nostril lining in no time, and doesn&#x27;t slime over in the process.</li>
            <li> i have gone through soo many batteries on this thing, and i dont even hardly use it!!</li>
            <li> $14.99 very well spent!!</li>
            <li> This is a huge disappointment since it was a gift and had such positive reviews!</li>
            <li> You cannot go wrong with this purchase and the seller I had got it to me very quickly!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic had a model number previous to this one, which was otherwise the exact same (on the outside).</li>
            <li> maybe the internal is not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> The first day or so it felt like little prickers after the initial cut.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to use and at first I think he was a little miffed at me (because I was obviously telling him that he needed one).  </li>
            <li> This one&#x27;s nice because the trimmed hairs are not sharp and do not poke after cutting.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is just what the well groomed older dude needs to look sharp.</li>
            <li> The old model needed to clean taking off the metal blade and with the time it is affected and the motion axel also (finally after 5 years it failed), this new model do not need to disassemble the system</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few different nose and facial trimmers, spend far too much money over the years trying to find something that works well on these stubborn nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a normal 3rd generation Irish Californian American with probably less hair than my New York counterparts.</li>
            <li> Tends to wear down battery fairly quickly - and cutting is just &#x27;OK&#x27;</li>
            <li> The blade seems to be very sharp, too, because it cuts hair very close.</li>
            <li> I saw at a local store other trimmers at a similar price but these all had a much thicker metal end.</li>
            <li> Cutting action does not seem to be superior to other brands.</li>
            <li> Tried a new battery and found a bit of rust in the battery compartment, which was completely closed.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it several times and not a single nick or pull.  </li>
            <li> blades are super sharp and trimmed all down to the root.  </li>
            <li> Received high rating on other sites.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned this item very long,  but so far it has met all  required needs.  </li>
            <li> Due to the concern over long-term durability, I give this four stars, but still recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> It was far easier and you can get the trimmer much cleaner by disassembling it and cleaning it with the small brush</li>
            <li> I am really disappointed that such a low-use product that does not require a great amount of components could just stop working.  </li>
            <li> There also a slight curve to the unit, why settle for a straight one?&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li> (the whole black area is the head and can be unscrewed by hand, counter clockwise.</li>
            <li> Battery life is much longer that my previous trimmer, and this one trims faster.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m really a lot less concerned about a stray hair popping out.</li>
            <li> Trims hair that my previous trimmers could not get to.&lt;br /&gt;The washable head makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li> All the ones I have previously bought cost about $20 and the batteries wore out fast.</li>
            <li> day when I was visiting my 96 year old Dad, I caught him trimming his nose hairs with a small very pointy pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> My own personal nasal hedge trimmer that actually works, I guess the double blade cutting action is the thing to look for in these devices.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t reach far enough into your nostril to clip the really long hairs before they start growing out of your nose again by 5 o&#x27;clock.</li>
            <li> So after each use it is simple and quick enough to just twist open the cleaning port, shoot some clean cold tap water through it, give a shake, and put it away.  </li>
            <li> but it seems there is a poor connection inside the unit that has happened pretty much from day one.</li>
            <li> My first month worked with one pill of battery but next, it wasted 5 per shave.</li>
            <li> Bought it the last day of January and now the first day of June it is dead.</li>
            <li> Performs the same as my first Panasonic noise/ear remover purchased  in 2000.........still sold and a few dollars cheaper</li>
            <li> Worked well for the first few months, but now it only sporadically turns on.</li>
            <li> Without warning, a few months after owning my first one it suddenly stopped working.</li>
            <li> This is basically the same design, but it seems like it has just a little less power than the old model - Still adequate</li>
            <li> Once I got past that rude awakening, I saw the product as the great little device it is.</li>
            <li> Much better than the Wahl I had before which seemed to slow down quite a bit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not rechargeable, but runs on a single AA battery which you won&#x27;t have to change too frequently.</li>
            <li> It turns out that the one I had was dull and for sure this one will not yank half of my nostril into the blades.</li>
            <li> So I stick with light pressure and numerous repetition, and still end up with some dark stubble and a few stubborn hairs that won&#x27;t stand up where they can be cut.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how normal that would be or any other to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a few weeks into my first battery with regular use and there&#x27;s no sign of low juice yet.</li>
            <li> To quote another reviewer because the same thing happened to me after several uses:  &amp;#34;After a few uses(about 8 or so) I heard this horrendous grinding noise and the tip got really hot and even quit working...</li>
            <li> Seeing as how I live in the deep woods and am writing this from an e-ternet cafe in unknown location of London</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this over other similar products.</li>
            <li> This really works well for nose-hair trimming and when it comes to cleaning the cutting chamber it is almost too easy.</li>
            <li> I have not used a whole lot just yet,  but big improvement over my previous device.  </li>
            <li> The ability to wash it with water with the vortex action is convenient but I believe it is still necessary to remove the head after washing to allow it to dry fully.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer, which broke, had a straight blade with a comb-like blade guard, which left exposed nose hair stubble and irritated tender skin inside my nostrils.</li>
            <li> i even take this thing to my eyebrows (because im a real man) and it keeps things tight up</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is bits of hair it can leave in your nostril - I think their is a model with a vacuum on it, but it will cost you more for that feature.</li>
            <li> Works really well, doesn&#x27;t pull sensitive hairs as it is cutting and has lasted pretty well for battery life so far.</li>
            <li> It has a very comfortable handle, and is not too complicated to figure out.</li>
            <li> I had two purchased and the other is still working, and offers a fine comfortable cut of hair that my nose seems more anxious to grow hair than on the top of my head, but given the other one failed with such little use, I was disappointed given I normally have always been a Panasonic brand fan.</li>
            <li> No problems so far except the double A battery doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> Industrial strength because one of the hairs was long and gnarly and very resistant to other methods.</li>
            <li> This is a well-made bathroom utensil, and is likely to last much longer than previous one I have bought.</li>
            <li> Only negative is that it does go through batteries quickly, about every month or so with regular use.</li>
            <li> This ear and nose hair trimmer barely runs--almost from the start, it slowed down and sounds as though the battery is low, but the battery is new.</li>
            <li> I dropped my 15 year old Panasonic &#x27;personal groomer&#x27; and the tip must have bent slightly because noise level increased and the cutting was not as good as before the fall.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway..this little thing works very well.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I think I would like the trim to be a little closer.  </li>
            <li> Construction feels a little sacrificed on this unit, it doesn&#x27;t have a very robust feel to it, nor does it carry heft.  </li>
            <li> How can one purchase do so much for so little money.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer really works well for trimming those pesky nose and ear hairs.  </li>
            <li> Not a game changer, but it works with a little patience.</li>
            <li> This little jewel really does the job.  </li>
            <li> The single AA battery gets tired fast and isn&#x27;t really powerful enough to demolish ear and nose hair.  </li>
            <li> After the first use I took the cutting head off to clean it and everything came apart.</li>
            <li> but I really like the potential of this little product.</li>
            <li> I have never had a trimmer remove as much hair as this one does with such little (NO) pain.  </li>
            <li> first i thought that i had weak batteries but putting in new one did not help.</li>
            <li> They do a very good job cutting hair although one must move slowly</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s as good or bad as others I have purchased,&lt;br /&gt;Must</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why it crapped out, it&#x27;s cheap and not worth my time to warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be afraid to put it against your noise \\&quot;walls.\\&quot; The last trimmer I had cut them, but this one is elegant and efficient, never missing a hair.</li>
            <li> and so it does not remove the hair completely, but it cuts it down until it is barely visible.</li>
            <li> This is just a minor issue, which apparently Panasonic designed the &#x27;Panasonic ER430K&#x27; with a vacuum system to address it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will</li>
            <li> depending how much you use it, how aggressive you use it, if you use it wet or dry will impact how long the foil  lasts.  </li>
            <li> I do wish I had gotten the nose trimmer with the vacuum though, because those hairs just end up in the back of my nose and throat and make me get congested.</li>
            <li> I bought this actually to replace the vacuum panasonic nose trimmer I had before</li>
            <li> This is one of product with positive high reviews, but poor product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried known fresh batteries right out of the package but it still sounds like it&#x27;s having problems cutting hair.</li>
            <li> The sharp blades are nice and close to the edge of the opening, so I don&#x27;t have to guess how far in to push it before it starts to cut hairs, i can actually see it cut the hairs, as well as hear the cutting.</li>
            <li> It runs much slower than expected, which means it is not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Evidently, it just needed to dry out as within a few days, it was working again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not high powered, so it takes a while and gets a little hot in the process.</li>
            <li> Cleans easily and makes cutting the hard spots around nose and ears easy.</li>
            <li> I agree with some of the other reviewers that this trimmer starts out great, but then the blades fail after just a few (8 or so) uses.</li>
            <li> As of right now, I can not find anything negative to say.</li>
            <li> How is this so far ahead of all the other similar products in terms of reviews ?</li>
            <li> Other than that a solid product thus far.</li>
            <li> This is the second unit I&#x27;ve purchased and the second that has just died for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> but it seems to have a bit of a vacuum on it that retains the hair</li>
            <li> I bought it due to the crazy number of good reviews on it</li>
            <li> I dont think it does any better or worse than any other nose hair trimmer that I have used.</li>
            <li> The previous unit seemed to never have enough power and batteries seemed to go dead quickly.  </li>
            <li> Keeps nose hairs high and tight</li>
            <li> pretty cheaply made, but then again its not that expensive.. works for a little bit</li>
            <li> After years of tweezing, plucking and scissoring, I broke down and bought one of these new fangled nose hair</li>
            <li> In reviewing this product, I am a new user (I.e. have used it less than ten times).</li>
            <li> Men, as you get older you&#x27;ve got to do a little landscaping and this is just to tool to do it.</li>
            <li> Unlike a decent flashlight, there is little pressure on the battery contacts nor any way to improve it.  </li>
            <li> Decent little ear and nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer deserves less than one star for less than a month&#x27;s worth of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond disgusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought three of these; the first stopped working after 3 months of use; the second stopped after a month of use; and after less then a month of use, I can hear the third starting to break down.  </li>
            <li> I was also glad that it isn&#x27;t a rechargeable trimmer, it becomes annoying having to frequently charge a trimmer for long periods of time just to have them run down quickly.</li>
            <li> than other methods for us old guys.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out what the problem was other than it was just a complete piece of junk to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it cuts well and isn&#x27;t too loud.  </li>
            <li> Bought due to online reviews and thankful I did; blows away old unit.</li>
            <li> I have only used a couple in the last decade and this one is no better and no worse than those.</li>
            <li> , I could just leave it in a drawer along with my other old age toys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Old age, where the hair on your head stops growing out, but instead grows &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; and then comes out other places, like your ears.(heard a comedian say that once)  </li>
            <li> Stays sharp and has no mechanical issues so far.  </li>
            <li> The cutting blade is pretty flimsy so I would be suprised if it works for more than a few months.</li>
            <li> I tend to use it frequently, so I have never had the pulling problem that other people have mentioned.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because of the reviews and my other thing I used was to loud.</li>
            <li> The only problem (though its a big one) is that it didn&#x27;t last long at all.</li>
            <li> The main reason why I&#x27;m returning the other trimmer and keeping this one is that this can actually washed and cleaned vs. the other can only be brushed.</li>
            <li> My only worry is that while the device is clearly of higher quality than the cheap throwaways I have used in the past, it does seem to utilize the same type of cutting mechanism, and I worry that in time this may begin to rip out hairs just as frequently as cheaper trimmers.  </li>
            <li> This is a little smaller than I expected and it feels a little cheap, but it works.</li>
            <li> This new unit is a slight model upgrade and seems to be working well</li>
            <li> After perhaps 9 months of only using it once a week for a few minutes each, it simply died -- would not run at all, even with new batteries and a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> It comes in just two parts, the trimmer and a little brush for the occasional deep clean (hardly seems necessary), so there isn&#x27;t anything to lose and you know it&#x27;ll last you for years.</li>
            <li> The manual says as much, but putting hot metal up my nose is uncomfortable I often need to make two or three passes to pick up the hair  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a cheap trimmer I got at TjMaxx for the past few years</li>
            <li> only negative thing about the trimmer that I can think of is that it tickled my nose hairs a lot the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> I have had several nose hair trimmers in the past that either pulled my hairs or didn&#x27;t work very well.  </li>
            <li> After getting past my fear of ripping sensitive nose hair out and causing an out-of-control nose bleed, I used this product and was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> The only negative it has is that it can get hot after running for a while so your skin feels the warmth when you try it..</li>
            <li> ; no more kids picking their nose as they watch you, assuming you&#x27;re doing the same when you&#x27;re really just \\&quot;plucking\\&quot; nose hairs when they tickle...  </li>
            <li> For such a small unit, this trimmer packs a real punch.  </li>
            <li> The earlier model felt solid, well-built and lasted quite a long time.  </li>
            <li> but didnt last long enough.</li>
            <li> I resisted as long as possible, but finally admitted to myself that I needed to trim my nose hair.  </li>
            <li> That is a total of three months in which I barely used the item and never got it wet.</li>
            <li> It only gets 3 stars cuz it reminds me that I have ear and nose hair long enough to trim.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time even if used daily.</li>
            <li> only downfall is the batteries don&#x27;t last long in it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t know is how long the batteries will last.</li>
            <li> my only concern would be how long blade will last.</li>
            <li> Give a decent close trim with a few passes.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair decently, but broke within a few months.  </li>
            <li> It handles my thick italian hairs pretty well</li>
            <li> Not a forest growing out of my nose and ears, but enough to warrant the upkeep, and it gets pretty thick.  </li>
            <li> It was a hassle, being without a trimmer for a little while, then having to buy a new trimmer (different brand this time) and paying to ship it out.  </li>
            <li> felt a little strange the first day, but now i find myself cutting the hair once a week or more.</li>
            <li> Despite several (non verified) customers complaining about various things I went ahead and purchased this, as number of positive reviews outweighs the negative ones.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to load batteries as well as clearing the cutting head.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- not very loud outside of the room it&#x27;s being used in</li>
            <li> After several attempts and online research, I concluded that the blades are spring loaded and these springs wear down fast due to quality issues.</li>
            <li> The brand new Duracell battery that I put last week was already dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought at least half a dozen of the cheap trimmers found at Walgreens and they always ended up jamming or pulling the hairs.  </li>
            <li> 30 years old, half italian.</li>
            <li> I like that it is small and easily fits into an overnight bag/luggage and stores in a small drawer in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> and since I ordered it early, I did not realize it was defective until he opened it a month and half later.</li>
            <li> I was tired of my previous trimmer (which took twice as many batteries) falling apart</li>
            <li> In less than 60 seconds I had those pesky nose hairs that were hanging out of my nose completely trimmed back.</li>
            <li> Being 6&#x27; 2\\&quot; has mostly been a positive, but time does cruel things to a man, and high on the list of those cruelties is the sudden and rapid growth of nose and ear hair.  </li>
            <li> It uses a single AA battery, which I haven&#x27;t had to replace in the last 2 months with occasional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No need to make multiple passes over the same areas hoping that the trimmer will get those pesky hairs eventually -- this trimmers needs just a single pass.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonably priced item, small and versatile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not much more you can really ask for.</li>
            <li> These are really neat , I&#x27;ve owned some in the past but these are nicer ,as anything else</li>
            <li> I have been fussing with small scissors for years to trim nose hairs and it always took way too much time and ever got everything.</li>
            <li> It does work very well in those small spots where a trimmer cannot reach.</li>
            <li> I think what happened is that I used too much pressure trying to get those flat hairs and thereby plowed up a small wrinkle of skin that got through the slots in the trimmer</li>
            <li> This allows you to remove clipped nose hairs, albeit gently, with a small brush.  </li>
            <li> He was very hesitant to use it because he&#x27;d purchased two in the past, both of which would pull out nose hairs and cause him pain.</li>
            <li> I feel that in might not last a really long time</li>
            <li> The battery seems to last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The flat trimmers don&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> His Sharper Image trimmer finally died after a long life...  </li>
            <li> Flat kills the mangroomer.</li>
            <li> and I think it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time and it&#x27;s quiet.</li>
            <li> I purposely kept running it just to see how long it would last</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how well it works if it is not gonna last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: This didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> I wish it had a long lasting watch type battery or some type of calculator batter in it.</li>
            <li> I may come back an upgrade to 5 stars depending on how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> not meant for flat grooming like side burns.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I had a nose trimmer that pulled hair and took forever to use.  </li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> If looks and feels like it should last a long time</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know how long the blade will last, but I guess time will tell.</li>
            <li> Battery last long time.  </li>
            <li> Not old enough for ear hairs?  </li>
            <li> AT LONG LAST!</li>
            <li> This product seems to be working well and as advertised, although I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to rate endurance.</li>
            <li> Have not owned long enough to comment on battery life.</li>
            <li> And of course it worked just long enough</li>
            <li> One battery last a long time.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done but the battery does not last long in this thing.  </li>
            <li> but it seems to be durable and hopefully will last a long time.</li>
            <li> and I hope it last as long as I expect.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t comment on durability yet as I have not owned it long enough.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to comment on the battery life.</li>
            <li> also the battery last a long time</li>
            <li> The battery life seems to last fairly long.  </li>
            <li> Works well, quiet operation, long battery life</li>
            <li> Nose hair trimmers have come a long way since the last one I bought...</li>
            <li> Battery is lasting a long time.</li>
            <li> Hoping this one gives equal long service.  </li>
            <li> If you are like me and have long nose hairs this is definitely the product for you.  </li>
            <li> (I am a female) and keep wondering why I didn&#x27;t try this a long time ago.  </li>

            <li> Long story short, the blades inside the head are spring controlled....</li>
            <li> It is a sturdy product and expect it will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> It works well and seems like it will last for a long time.</li>

            <li> Does not completely drain the battery even if left unused for a while.</li>
            <li> works well for the nose, long lasting battery.</li>
            <li> Hope it lasts as long as the last one.</li>
            <li> The quality feels as if they will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Batteries seem to last long.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long,  </li>
            <li> Will need to see just how long it last.</li>
            <li> This unit also seems to have enough power and doesn&#x27;t stumble as you use it.</li>
            <li> Finding a decent nose and ear hair trimmer is not easy.  </li>
            <li> It seems to be a wiring issue, sometimes it has good power/speed, other times the motor is slow and weak.  </li>
            <li> WHO HAVE NO LONGER BEEN ANNOYING HIM SINCE I BOUGHT THIS HANDY GADGET!</li>
            <li> I have pretty thick nose hairs</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve got pretty thick nose hairs</li>
            <li> It had a brass head on it which was pretty thick.</li>
            <li> It is slow, the  cutter gets hot and it doesn&#x27;t cut close.</li>
            <li> Or a trimmer that wouldn&#x27;t reach certain areas of the nose, no matter how hard or deep</li>
            <li> Just because I don&#x27;t write a comprehensive review doesn&#x27;t mean my rating is less important.</li>
            <li> When it finally did the motor was not strong despite using a new battery.</li>
            <li> But as far as cutting the hairs, it does just fine.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was more than a little miffed that using the device on my nose often resulted in quick little tugs as the blade yanked a hair out rather than cutting it.</li>
            <li> the motor wavers a bit in sound but the little sucker trims nose and ear hair like butter.</li>
            <li> and I have only tried it as a nose trimmer so far, but it did the trick with little noise or irritation.  </li>
            <li> I was a little put off by the size, as my old nose hair trimmer is not much bigger than a 2&amp;#34; x 2&amp;#34</li>
            <li> A little loud, but what could be louder than a big swatch of ear hair rustling in the wind?</li>
            <li> The on/off switch offers little resistance when jostled back and forth, as in luggage getting tossed around by baggage handlers.</li>
            <li> One of those little gadgets that is well worth a few dollars.</li>
            <li> I had a little trouble receiving it, but it was worth the wait</li>
            <li> Be careful not to accidently knock this against the sink edge (don&#x27;t ask, sigh) and if you do, and the head comes off, and the blade drops out and goes down the sink drain, and you retrieve it from the drain (don&#x27;t ask, sigh), don&#x27;t expect the trimmer to be as quiet as it was new....</li>
            <li> It quietly cuts any hairs that are long enough to go into the cutting cavity of the top end of the trimmer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It also feels a little less comfortable than previous trimmers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the price this is about what I was expecting, and it does a great job of cutting in the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> Feels like it should last as a long time!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve had a battery run edge trimmer/weed wacker, you know exactly what I mean.</li>
            <li> Battery that was included was dead, but after putting in a new one, all was well.</li>
            <li> i have used it a few times and though i was new to this, it never hurt me</li>
            <li> Yep, put new battery in it, but the trimmer is totally dead and cannot be returned.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dead; New battery with no blade attached yields zero response</li>
            <li> But a few months after i brought it it just stopped working, so i brought new batteries and tried again, didn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> And that&#x27;s a waste I can&#x27;t live with</li>
            <li> /&gt;Follow-up: died after a few weeks and new batteries didn&#x27;t solve the problem.</li>
            <li> it did not last very long.  </li>
            <li> The battery last a very long time.</li>
            <li> This trimmer doesn&#x27;t last very long per battery.  </li>
            <li> Battery does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Did not last very long.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t feel like I should expect it to last a very long time.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last very long.  </li>
            <li> but i do not think it will last very long.</li>
            <li> It is safe, cutting only hair and not skin.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is the lack of replacement blades, as replacing the whole device is wasteful and pricey.</li>
            <li> We purchased many trimmers only to be unhappy.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use and get into places that are too difficult to get with tweezers or scissors</li>
            <li> The cover is ventilated so it will dry before the next use.</li>
            <li> I left it out on the counter to air dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate with instructions which are WAY too complicated.  </li>
            <li> They did the job and take up a lot less room than the old trimmer set up we had.</li>
            <li> Cheap enough that if it fails, I will just buy another, but</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve only used it dry)....</li>
            <li> My last didn&#x27;t cut at the top, just the sides, which made cutting some hairs</li>
            <li> Use this a couple of times a week to trim my nose hairs and less frequently on my ears.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses it dry only</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and small, but not too small.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, with more cutting than pulling (but still the occasional &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; every now and then, so not perfect), and it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It just completely died on me after using it probably less than 10 times.</li>
            <li> Easy to knock out that unfortunate nose and ear hair, without any pinching or pain.  </li>
            <li> I may be an old fart, but at least this device will help me be a well groomed old fart.</li>
            <li> Be careful when opening the package for the first time as some of the parts are extremely small and fell out when the package was opened.</li>
            <li> It is not ridiculous just less battery life than I had expected.</li>
            <li> Not much can be said about a male facial hair trimmer...</li>
            <li> My only complaint is not necessarily with this particular model, but may be with all types.</li>
            <li> I could even look in the mirror and aim it at one specific hair and it would not cut it after several tries</li>
            <li> Expected to get an inferior product for such a low price.</li>
            <li> I purchased a MicroTouch Max a long time ago from one of those infomercials and it didn&#x27;t last long at all</li>
            <li> and I also recently bought a Conair model that emits an odor reminiscent of burning hair which does not give one a sense of security when it&#x27;s jammed in a nostril or aural cavity</li>
            <li> You definitely have to be careful when trimming your nose hair that you don&#x27;t trim too short...</li>
            <li> Works very well, no pulled hair &#x3D; sharp blades and tight tolerances.</li>
            <li> Much like some of the other 1-star reviews, my trimmer failed to work properly even on the first use.</li>
            <li> By the year mark this would be very frequent making me think the battery was dead but</li>
            <li> you can rinse it off under the sink, it taks a single AA battery that seems to last forever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Wish it was rechargeable, but it only takes a single AA battery, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> It was such relief after the single hair was cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Single battery appears to provide enough power.</li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t imagine a single way this product could be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When one wants to connect the outer blade unit to the base unit, press down on outer blade once you have (by feel) rotated it to proper orientation, and, importantly, turn it clockwise and do apply some considerable force until you hear it &#x27;snap&#x27; tight-keep on turning until you hear a pronounced snap and will go no further.  </li>
            <li> It even offers the choice of cleaning by running water through the cutting head - a very useful idea since products like this often become clogged with hairs that bog them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li> and apparently there&#x27;s been some government mandate that says they can&#x27;t be as sharp as they once were.</li>
            <li> now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bigger than my old one, so it takes up more room in my hair cutting bag, and I don&#x27;t see the point of the curve in the handle.  </li>
            <li> First one failed, the send me a new one and no issues</li>
            <li> Four or five seconds and of use could possibly cause hearing loose.</li>
            <li> Not very loud</li>
            <li> They sell replacement blades and the whole thing only costs a little less than $13.</li>
            <li> Previously I had a smaller trimmer that used a smaller battery, however the smaller trimmer&#x27;s battery did not last very long, and neither did the trimmer.</li>
            <li> My only wish is that they would include multiple heads, when my got dull I just bought a new device.</li>
            <li> so they would last longer and the motor wouldn&#x27;t bog down so much under heavy loads.</li>
            <li> powerful enough engine causing the trimmer to slow down or stop&lt;</li>
            <li> New batteries did not help, this thing was just plain defective.</li>
            <li> The biggest problem I have had with them in the past is that yes they trim the hair growing freely in the middle of the nostril but not so much for those pesky little irritating ones that tickle the sides of your nose.</li>
            <li> Tips for new buyers: do not wash or put under the water to clean it, if you do so, then you should dry it very well and leave it open, otherwise it will smell so bad!</li>
            <li> Very precise and cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this trimmer for a few days and have only used it a few times, but it seems to work very well and seems to be built well.  </li>
            <li> I could not find anything similar, locally &amp; every one that I&#x27;ve gotten in the last few years has died on me in short order.</li>
            <li> The single battery doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as something requiring two batteries</li>
            <li> I have no clue how long a single AA battery will last in it nor</li>
            <li> Fortunately I put the old base with the new blade head, and got one working trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also aggressive enough and sharp enough to tackle the toughest nasal forest without tugging (OUCH!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this to other men who have facial hair problems.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t rip my booger nets out like the other, more expensive trimmers I have/had.</li>
            <li> I had tried other products but they never had the necessary quality to hold up to regular use.  </li>
            <li> This one seems to cut any hairs instantly, whereas my previous trimmer seemed like you had to keep going over the same area again and again to finally cut the hairs.</li>
            <li> Unlike others that I have tried over the years, this device actually works to cut the hair out my my nose without pulling them out like other such products.</li>
            <li> , only thing is still can&#x27;t get the hairs at peak of nose just inside nostrils like the inner rim, my other trimmer also could not get that spot</li>
            <li> Sharp and a breeze to use!&lt;br /&gt;Unlike those multi-use contraptions that allow you to switch out the tips for various grooming needs, this one has a sole purpose...and it does that purpose</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other rotary trimmers for nose hair before and they left stubble or short fuzz.</li>
            <li> This particular unit can in fact nick you if you&#x27;re pushing the unit&#x27;s rotary blades too hard against the upper corners of your nasal passage.  </li>
            <li> A personal appliance like this that is meant to be frequently handled (especially in a wet environment) should be made to withstand a single drop.  </li>
            <li> It works extremely well, but it will also cut the inside of your nose if you&#x27;re not very careful.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a younger guy without much facial hair to begin with, but for some reason I get the occasional long black hairs protruding from my nose.  </li>
            <li> I needed something lightweight and budget-friendly to clear up his little problem.</li>
            <li> It creeped me out a little bit after I cut all the hair away and could see clear up my nose all the way to parts</li>
            <li> I am surprised this neat little gadget was so affordable.</li>
            <li> The product feels a little cheap and the features feel a little gimmicky but it works</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s lightweight and it gets rid of those little wild buggers like a dream.</li>
            <li> Then started getting a little loud and grindy.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this solves that little problem, and simultaneously grosses out anyone sitting near you when you use it while watching TV.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t drop it, they&#x27;re a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> and I like how this little beast completely removes all hair ...</li>
            <li> He felt a little old and hairy when he saw what it was</li>
            <li> So if you are going to mess with removing and brushing the blades be sure that you have properly secured them to the base unit, and test run it first before inserting in any area to be trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I mean the blade is tiny, thin, barely anything at all - a replacement should have been easy to include</li>
            <li> The circular motion really gets those hard to reach hairs, etc.    </li>
            <li> This trimmer really works; I use it to &#x27;edge&#x27; my eyebrows, trim my nose hair, and &#x27;edge&#x27; around my face in areas that are hard to reach with a razor.</li>
            <li> Works well for the nasal hair, but you have to really push it hard.</li>
            <li> The shaft inside the base unit that spins the blade was spinning fine (quiet and fast).</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re tired of having your nostrils torn up by the old fashioned type of trimmer.</li>
            <li> When it says &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t insert the trimmer past the hairs lining the outer most part of the nostril&amp;#34;... they mean it!</li>
            <li> The small diameter and smooth surface makes it somewhat hard to grasp.</li>
            <li> I just bought my 3rd one and the only reason is because they naturally do get dull and need to be replaced.</li>
            <li> My only issue is that I don&#x27;t really understand the wet capabilities and found the instructions hard to understand.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to get super close to the root of the hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m exchanging it for a new one, hopefully, it&#x27;ll work, but I have a little trust in it now!</li>
            <li> But after 7 months of using it about once a week (and rinsing it thoroughly under hot water according to directions every time), it suddenly got very noisy with an unpleasant buzzing and grinding sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Also, the cutting head has notches to allow hair to enter both on the top of the tip and from the sides.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve bought many things over the years with the Panasonic name without issues so this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Now my sexy husband doesn&#x27;t look like a crazy person.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought \\&quot;Seen on TV\\&quot; trimmers, cheap trimmers, and expensive ones.</li>
            <li> With the battery going lower and lower, it will grab instead of cutting causing more pain.  </li>
            <li> A real problem solver and tweezing out the hairs sucks and can hurt.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a disappointment like most I have tried.</li>
            <li> The pain involved in taming the snot-beasts is just too much for our delicate sensitives to handle.  </li>
            <li> Not too sure if this is potentially dangerous or a defective product or if this is supposed to happen.  </li>
            <li> Now it makes a frightening buzzing sound and is ineffective.  </li>
            <li> You can really hear it working, the air flow through my nostrils is up by at least 25%.  </li>
            <li> Guess it is a safety-comfort vs efficiency issue, so all in all, i&#x27;d rather spend a couple of more minutes on it, that having it cutting</li>
            <li> on top of that it inhibits cutting</li>
            <li> on top of that it inhibits cutting</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one with a expensive laser light from a catalogue.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll probably like this feature a lot more once cold and</li>
            <li> am much happier now that my icky nose hairs are no longer a noticeable problem.</li>
            <li> cheaply made, and built to fail.</li>
            <li> A lot better than plucking and cutting.</li>
            <li> when received it I put a battery and only worked for about a minute hasn&#x27;t worked since not worth sending back</li>
            <li> Strangely you can&#x27;t get replacements for the tip nubbin, but that&#x27;s alright</li>
            <li> were pointing that i had a long one sticking out.</li>
            <li> and I probably shouldn&#x27;t be taking that long.</li>
            <li> The item works well so long as it&#x27;s functioning.</li>
            <li> As long as this trimmer keeps working, I give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Cannot say if it works well or lasts long, because it is going in a Christmas exchange.</li>
            <li> I expected this product to last longer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a strange thing to write about</li>
            <li> I should have bought one long ago.</li>
            <li> Even after multiple tries.</li>
            <li> AA battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Then by the wonders of science i don&#x27;t have long hairs sticking out anymore.</li>
            <li> I expected some pain, especially with the nose hairs, but felt none at all.</li>
            <li> Just feels strange.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wondering if that happened because the hair was too long???</li>
            <li> I bet you kick yourself in the rear for not getting one of these a long time ago.  </li>
            <li> As a man ages, the hair that resides in various orifices tends to grow at an alarming rate.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Takes probably twice as long as the trimmer I used to use.  </li>
            <li> Wish I would have bought it long ago.</li>
            <li> How did is go so long without this thing?</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times so far, and works well.</li>
            <li> They use just one AA battery and it lasts for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Had this over a year - performs well, sometimes has a strange smell but works well.</li>
            <li> Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer - worked as I expected -</li>
            <li> Would stop if it snags a long nose hair.</li>
            <li> A strange thing happened as I creeped over the 30 year mark...</li>
            <li> but I need it because cancer meds make my nose hair grow long and wiry.  </li>
            <li> Be careful that your battery is not low.</li>
            <li> Be careful though:  if the battery gets low, it will pull out hair.</li>
            <li> and I noticed that my nose hairs were growing a bit too long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I survived for so long without this.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, I dropped it and it didn&#x27;t work until I open and closed the head, but guess what, the trimmer gets hot after running for 10 second.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I resisted this product for so long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Apparently, my lobes had begun to sprout long, unsightly hairs that I had neglected to notice until she informed me.</li>
            <li> Trimming long hairs in my beard</li>
            <li> Will see how long it works.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited as long as I did to try a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> In addition, I use a rechargeable battery and the charge holds for a long period.</li>
            <li> I waited so long to pull the trigger and purchase it.  </li>
            <li> it did not take long for him to put a battery in this and get it working...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve replaced the battery a few times thus far, and no issues with the device.</li>
            <li> A helpful tool for long nose hair.</li>
            <li> We have not had it long</li>
            <li> I recommend for any military people who stand inspections regularly or for people who just want to keep hair neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li> If you ever DROP a Panny trimmer on anything harder than a giant pile of Charmin, you might as well throw it away.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what evolutionary benefit that hair growing out of my ears or nose might have once had for my ancestors, but those days are long over.  </li>
            <li> It can get them, but takes a few times passing through where as the old one was immediate and covered a wider area per attempt.  </li>
            <li> I looked at a lot of different models and this one even works when wet (so for shower shaving), and it truly does the job.  </li>
            <li> I had kids and got grey hair.</li>
            <li> I just thought that was part of the joys of aging that I&#x27;d need to deal with as long as I don&#x27;t want hair.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t used it in a long time for that reason and just came across it in the closet and threw it out.  </li>
            <li> I expected it to last longer than that.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because his nose hairs are always so long.</li>
            <li> Should have gotten this long ago.</li>
            <li> Had it for few days and so far the trimmer works.</li>
            <li> Strange odor from the batter compartment</li>
            <li> I wish I had bought it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Double edge blades cut well no matter what angle you have the trimmer at with absolutely no pulling.</li>
            <li> These things have come a long way.</li>
            <li> I promised myself that if my nose hairs ever grew too long, I would trim them.  </li>
            <li> There was the long lost Panasonic trimmer AND....</li>
            <li> how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time as well.</li>
            <li> its a bit strange to stick in your nose</li>
            <li> AAA battery lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> (as long as there are batteries in it, which of course are not included).  </li>
            <li> I no longer have long hair hanging out of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars as it trims well and lasts long on the batteries.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks &amp; so far it works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> Wish I had known about this long ago.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a long time now and never had to replace the battery</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll have to see how long it survives.</li>
            <li> , I won&#x27;t buy another one until this one gives up which given it&#x27;s quality construction should be a a long time.</li>
            <li> (b) I finally got the alleged Wet-Dry trimmer - &amp;#34;use</li>
            <li> battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts as long as a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> I lost count how long.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how long battery&lt;</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to wear my hair long over my ears either.</li>
            <li> I even bought one for a friend as his really long nose hair</li>
            <li> long battery life.</li>
            <li> If you have long nose hairs (whether or not they show themselves beyond your nostrils)</li>
            <li> I expected that all hair trimmers &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; and pull hair (occasionally)</li>
            <li> I wish I would have purchased one long before now; then maybe my friends wouldn&#x27;t be calling me pokey nose.</li>
            <li> I just wanted a basic one that would trim the nose hairs and i could use wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I hope it holds up because I will use this for a long time.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Wahl that was a few years old and not performing well.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Panasonic nose trimmers for a long time.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have had long nose hairs all my life.</li>
            <li> If it lasts that long, probably my ears eventually too...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to get one of these,I&#x27;ve been using scissors for a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time on one battery.</li>
            <li> Everything it was supposed to be, no unexpected surprises.</li>
            <li> Only minus is that it has no cord, but runs on batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not old or anything, but there are some times that my noise hair tickle or makes me feel like I have a hanging booger, which makes me paranoid.</li>
            <li> I had a rechargeable hair remover for long time but it didn&#x27;t recharge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Maybe if the hair was really long, but if you are wanting a close trim, it&#x27;s not going to happen with this one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if mine is underpowered or if it&#x27;s just the normal speed.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to buy this.</li>
            <li> It takes a long long time to do what I want to do with it.</li>
            <li> Stays charged for a long time.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not marked as &amp;</li>
            <li> The product does everything it advertises -- just hope it lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> this one lasts twice as long as those, then it might earn another star...</li>
            <li> , I had long nose hairs as I&#x27;ve never trimmed them before</li>
            <li> It can also be used to remove excess body hair, but it takes a long time.  </li>
            <li> I could because I remember trying a nose hair trimmer a LONG time ago (and the pain associated with pulled hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it took just as long as using scissors, if not longer.  </li>
            <li> One more thing, the plastic package is very difficult to open.</li>
            <li> No guy likes to admit that they need a device such as this, but alas, aging necessitates it ;)</li>
            <li> get what you pay for\\&quot; type product, but clearly it is not.</li>
            <li> Instructions were not clear.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair on my beard and it cuts very well.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, EVERYWHERE, but thanks to this</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m getting old, but this is definitely needed for those annoying nasal hairs, works much better than others I&#x27;ve owned, but has a hf buzz so it tickles a bit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of nose hair trimmers and they all are slow and grab hairs which really hurts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The &#x27;Vortex Cleaning System&#x27; the trimmer boasts is just an open/close vent at the base of the cutter head that allows you (with the trimmer on) to run it under a stream of water for superior cleaning capability.</li>
            <li> This did a good job without leaving me with a bloody nose, as has happened before with cheaper ones.  </li>
            <li> Never, in my life, and with several different trimmers over the years, have I done this little annoying trim job so fast and easy, as well as totally painlessly.  </li>
            <li> Every now and then it briefly slows down, but then speeds back up and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> The second time I used it, the motor starting slowing down.</li>
            <li> When I opened it, a tiny spring (think of the spring in a retractable pen only shorter) flew out and before I could shut off the water it went down the drain.  </li>
            <li> Ill continue to buy panasonic products but will just go back to my cheap non wet dry nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Burned through several other units because they go dull so fast.  </li>
            <li> Much better than less expensive models; the motor seems stronger.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, comfortable device for the trimming of nasty nose hairs.</li>
            <li> So if you have serious hair, you might need a more serious trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, but better than anything less expensive.  </li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s actually a somewhat pleasure experience, which I understand is &#x27;odd&#x27; to say.</li>
            <li> Although, the blades on my previous (similar but not the same, cheapest of their product line)</li>
            <li> I have only used it dry and have yet to try it wet.</li>
            <li> I can not comment on using this wet, I have only used it dry.</li>
            <li> just broke my 2nd trimmer with same reason, slipped from my hand and drop on the sink that was less than foot.</li>
            <li> Only takes one battery and the quality is head and shoulders above my previous one (which was promptly thrown out).  </li>
            <li> This is my second trimmer and a definite step up from the previous one.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is a wet/dry model that with a simple turn of the head will shave with wet (i.e. in the shower or at the sink) or dry.  </li>
            <li> I mean really.  </li>
            <li> Add the fact that it uses plain old batteries and not built-in ones</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a product like this, so I&#x27;m not sure if the sound of it catching a random thick hair and cutting it caught me off guard and startled me</li>
            <li> Also, it leaves behind a feeling of five-o&#x27;clock shadow inside my ear right after use.  </li>
            <li> I took the nose cone off to rinse it off after use and since it has made a funny noise and is dull as ever!</li>
            <li> Considering how many things tend to be disappointing in one fashion or another, this tiny little device (about the same shape as a lightsabre) works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy I bought this, but I am very disappointed in the product I will soon have.</li>
            <li> little machine does its job well and quietly, albeit there is minimal buzzing noise, which is generally acceptable.</li>
            <li> I was a little doubtful about how this product can trim my eye brows but after using it, i am pretty pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> What was convincing was the number of high reviews and the few bad ones.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought several before, but always had to augment their performance with scissors, since none of them cut close enough and always left hair behind in those sensitive places.</li>
            <li> If you push it too far down, it won&#x27;t rotate due to the built-in \\&quot;stopper\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It eats the battery quickly and it work very slow and it does hurt your nose and other areas when trimming the hair....</li>
            <li> It had a weird battery drain problem that I didn&#x27;t think much of the last time I used it - had brand new battery in it when I got it, but then it needed replacing after only a few uses.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Additionally, it lasts a long time in a single battery.</li>
            <li> My only very minor complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t trim facial (non-nasal) hair short enough or at an uniform length.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I did not clean my last trimmer after every use, but with this one I do because it&#x27;s so simple.</li>
            <li> My hair is not very thick or coarse which may have been a factor in the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other trimmers out there, but this one and how it trims is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Vortex is generally similar to just about any other.</li>
            <li> Given that this product costs and functions about the same as any other</li>
            <li> Other reviews have had similar comments.  </li>
            <li> As has been mentioned in other reviews, the trimmer ultimately starts making a grinding noise and the blades bend.</li>
            <li> Along with the trimmer is a tiny brush, a user guide and some other paperwork of no consequence (to me).</li>
            <li> One other thing, it is very quiet.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product due to the very short lifespan.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K is weak and the head gets hot.  </li>
            <li> Have had other similar trimmers that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> Other reviews touted the quiet aspect</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and it does not pull the hairs as it cuts and it makes short work of cleaning up those unwanted hairs.  </li>
            <li> This is my second trimmer as I needed one at my other house.</li>
            <li> OTHER SIMILAR DEVICES DID NOT WORK AS WELL.</li>
            <li> After a little over a month ( 3 total uses, 2 minutes total)</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this little present that I ordered as a last minute gift to go with his electric razor.</li>
            <li> I only use for nose hair trimming so can&#x27;t comment on the other uses.</li>
            <li> I have had other trimmers that looked similar</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K again has a similar design to all the other models but for some reason, this one cuts hair.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these, from two different manufacturers, and they both seem to work just as well as the other.  </li>
            <li> It actually cuts the hairs with one swipe and cuts them extremely closely.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve always tried to find a little private time several times a week to yank both ear and nose bush, but as time has marched on, I began to realize I was losing the war.</li>
            <li> This seems to be a flaw in the design as a lot of other people are having the same problem.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, QUIET, nik-free trimming in all those non-beard places.  </li>
            <li> It worked as expected for about 3 months and then for no apparent reason, it just died.</li>
            <li> I hope it will last as other reviews have indicated.</li>
            <li> only thing I wish was it has another attachment to trim other hair besides just nose hair.</li>
            <li> My Conair had to be retired only due to the metal spring contact, for the AA battery, corroding and breaking off as a result.  </li>
            <li> Blade seems sharper  and faster than other similar products I have had..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used norelco&#x27;s and other electric trimmers and initially I was turned off by the battery power supply.  </li>
            <li> I have only used this on a couple of occasions and have found it to be extremely well made</li>
            <li> This Panasonic cuts closer than other basic trimmers.</li>
            <li> Definitely will cut other problem areas as well.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend the item based on my experience and the other reviewers who have had the same experience.  </li>
            <li> Basically, both units use the same blade assembly which is listed at Panasonic&#x27;s web site and other online merchants for $20 (incl s&amp;h).</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time, but I only use it every few weeks.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> Extremely efficient with only using one battery.</li>
            <li> I even use it for other things - the area between my eyebrows and the hairs I miss on my upper lip.</li>
            <li> Other facial and ear hair is easier to trim with a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s held a little different that his last trimmer</li>
            <li> It uses the same mechanical cutter blades as other Panasonic nose trimmers.  </li>
            <li> They itch and get pulled and are definitely a distraction for any other person that is looking at you</li>
            <li> but still cheaper compare to other products overall.</li>
            <li> Only this is I would recommend using it on anything other than your nose hair...</li>
            <li> I figured it was the battery and tried a couple other AA&#x27;s with the same result.</li>
            <li> Then, a little over 2 months later, after only a handful of uses, it stopped working just like the first.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one other trimmer similar to this</li>
            <li> I share the same frustrations as pointed out in other reviews</li>
            <li> and that actually works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I look like a monkey!</li>
            <li> Tried several other &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; products, but none work as well as this brand.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other nose hair trimmers, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others in terms of speed/battery-charge/ease-of-use, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> I, actually, dropped the other one on accident while cleaning off the counter and dented the end.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning this other brand is as simple as wiping it on cotton towel and your done.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used several other trimmers, including Conair, Remington and Wahl.  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get the hardened steel head aligned back out properly due to the close tolerances with the blades inside.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cleaning it is a simple as rising the head and lower body with a bit of water and soap and then i just simply brush off any extra hairs with the small brush that was included in the box</li>
            <li> The power was pretty weak, changed batteries and still didn&#x27;t work that well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for the last two years and it has worked very well over the years, just washing it out when it starts to slow down.  </li>
            <li> Powerful cutting action means fewer passes are necessary than with other clippers I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> Battery lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> this time, was very careful about keeping it back from the edge of the sink.</li>
            <li> so I can see it pulling your nose hairs if they are very long.</li>
            <li> Well that wasn&#x27;t a very long time.</li>
            <li> I noticed, when changing the battery, that it had an odd metallic smell along with a greasy black film on the battery - New Duracell Battery used;  </li>
            <li> When I first got it I put a new but apparently defective battery in it and almost returned it for the painful snags I encountered.  </li>
            <li> It gets a little hot for using it too long but just by adding water a little at the tip it cools it down a bit.</li>
            <li> Does the job well,  remember to put the cover back on the top, too bad it does not come with a power cord to support a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> I follow the instructions and twist of cap to help dry faster.  </li>
            <li> Works dry or in water.</li>
            <li> It get&#x27;s basically all of the hair in my nose, very close to skin without it cutting me or really even feeling it.</li>
            <li> I have not used it in the shower, just dry environments.  </li>
            <li> and you do not need to have a dry face</li>
            <li> Works in water as well as dry.</li>
            <li> Although it says like you can clean it, I have been unable to figure out how.</li>
            <li> I used it dry.  </li>
            <li> and I dry heaved for a couple minutes.  </li>
            <li> Difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> I would rinse it in water as described in the manual after each use and allowed to dry.  </li>
            <li> Then I shook it to dry it out</li>
            <li> are dry</li>
            <li> So easy to clean up and those nasty itchy nose hairs are gone in a breeze.</li>
            <li> Warning, it may dry out your nostrils if u cut all the hair</li>
            <li> works we or dry.</li>
            <li> Even if it only lasts a few months it was only $12.</li>
            <li> The motor just stopped and despite replacing the battery (with a few different ones I knew worked), it never came back to life.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few different trimmers over the last couple of years but they&#x27;re all junk compared this one.  </li>
            <li> , I have the manual, the vacuum panasonic, and every other brand.  </li>
            <li> It sucks getting older, but this helps.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few different batteries and get the same result.</li>
            <li> Very will made, does the job but doesnt clip close enough - leaves stubble behind.</li>
            <li> Same thing happened, stopped working after only a few months.</li>
            <li> Here is the part where I complain that electronics are now made to last only a few months.</li>
            <li> One of the most annoying things in the world to me anyway is having wild nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic trimmer and thought that my nose hairs were getting too thick to cut.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it really is meant for hair trimming other than your nose or ear as it is a little harder to trim eye brows due to the shape of the tip.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t expect this product to last for so long, but when it breaks down (hopefully after a year)</li>
            <li> Not sure it&#x27;s any better or worse than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing to me how this little trimmer can chew through thick tough nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> My biggest complaint is the device leaves stubble maybe 1mm high in your nose</li>
            <li> While the trimming function worked fine the operation of the unit failed after only a few months.  </li>
            <li> A little strange to use at first - the tip is a little different from the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I love this little hair trimmer, I use this to trim and shape my eyebrows, so much easier and lot less painful than eyebrows threading.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t gotten a single use out of it.</li>
            <li> The bottom portion slides off to allow the insertion of a single AA battery (not included).</li>
            <li> Single battery</li>
            <li> $10 for a single task item.</li>
            <li> I have not had a single problem with it</li>
            <li> it broke just days beyond the limited 30 day return policy.  </li>
            <li> Does not pinch or hurt, but doesn&#x27;t do the single job it was made to do.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, it runs on a single battery and does the job.</li>
            <li> The battery life is a bit lacking, but it is powered by a single battery.</li>
            <li> stars because it doesn&#x27;t come with the single AA battery it needs to work</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex lasted a single use and then broke.</li>
            <li> It takes a single AA battery to power it.</li>
            <li> but I did not feel one single pull, not a twinge, not a hint, nothing.  </li>
            <li> I believe I have sent in every single one of them to be repaired while they were still under warranty.&lt;br</li>
            <li> it uses a single AA battery</li>
            <li> It does work but runs off a single 1.5 volt battery.</li>
            <li> Runs off a single AA battery.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic model, powered by a single AA battery, does the job and is a sturdy product.  </li>
            <li> With this trimmer I don&#x27;t feel a single pull or pinch in my nose and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer runs on a single AA battery.</li>
            <li> Runs well with single battery.</li>
            <li> This was one of the least expensive models available, so it made it a little hard to accept the reviews that were so much better than other models.  </li>
            <li> no better, if as well as trimmers that cost half as much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this happens to everyone, but as soon as you hit middle age you start growing long hairs in odd places.</li>
            <li> Works great for a few months, but once the blades become dull it will start pulling hairs instead of cutting them</li>
            <li> because the actual &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; that cuts could rust, or simply get dull, but I do like this one, and if it lasts it will out do the others, and Panasonic is a solid company.</li>
            <li> He actually got out of his leather recliner after opening this present and went straight into the bathroom to use it... and getting my husband out of his chair to do anything is near impossible,</li>
            <li> only slight complaint is the awkward vibrating feeling when using this in more sensitive areas (the nose people!).</li>
            <li> Better than i expected shipping  wasn&#x27;t  bad ,have used  it on several  occasions now no complaints.</li>
            <li> It will rip the hairs out of you in the most unpleasant fashion.  </li>
            <li> When i first opened this, i was shocked at how small and light the unit is.  </li>
            <li> While the item was not good, Amazon really stepped up to the plate.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes have to go over twice to get them all, but probably is better that way then being too sharp and cutting my nose.  </li>
            <li> Just ignore the other comments about cheap plastic; they are wrong.</li>
            <li> Powerful enough to trim coarse hair with no snagging or cutting.</li>
            <li> Replaced a unit that was far past</li>
            <li> While it is early days with this small gadget, (used it twice)</li>
            <li> not powerful enough to work</li>
            <li> Not powerful enough</li>
            <li> Just not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a solution for hair removal that was not painful or expensive and this product was the answer.</li>
            <li> I swore it was broken for the first 3 months I had it</li>
            <li> It has gotten progressively worse to the point I am going to have to buy a different one even though this trimmer is only about 2 months old.</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this to get rid of annoying nose hairs and found that it works very well in that regard.</li>
            <li> I also felt that they completed the job as expected to trim not completely remove the hair as if using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Within a few minutes he is well groomed-and barely sneezy.</li>
            <li> As embarrassing as it was to order a nose hair trimmer, it is even more so to report that it is difficult to use and not very effective.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is sturdy without any loose parts and I would consider buying it again, but at the end of the day...</li>
            <li> The \\&quot;rocket shaped\\&quot; part with the blades attached becomes loose and starts to bounce around.</li>
            <li> The blades on the inside get loose and end up breaking.</li>
            <li> so there was obviously a loose connection in it somewhere.</li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s a loose contact somewhere in it.</li>
            <li> This has an actual blade that spins around, not a little wire, so if you happen to push it into your skin a little too hard by accident, that blade will slice you open with ease.  </li>
            <li> After only a couple weeks it seems to be slowing down.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve ordered it several times and it always breaks down.</li>
            <li> only problem, it will run down after a while with AA bat.</li>
            <li> Only down side was battery not included.</li>
            <li> However, it seems like it is starting to die down.</li>
            <li> Totally trims my ear and nose hairs down to the skin.</li>
            <li> What dude doesn&#x27;t, deep down, want a nose-hair trimmer?</li>
            <li> The second time I cleaned this trimmer, the spring fell out again and down the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This broke down totally after using it 3 or 4 times.  </li>
            <li> I only ever had it pull a hair once, and that was when I let the battery run way down.  </li>
            <li> This has happened a couple times and it runs the battery down all the way obviously.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used a different panasonic in the past which does not last very long.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trimming a monkey, it&#x27;s just little bits of nose and facial hair.</li>
            <li> let soak for 30min to 2hrs depending on how dirty it is, rinse off with hot hater/maybe brush off with old toothbrush &amp; dry off.</li>
            <li> Depending on how long this little warrior lasts, I would definitely buy it again.  </li>
            <li> so I ordered this along with some other items thinking what the heck, the price is right and it can&#x27;t be any worse.  </li>
            <li> overall, I highly recommend this, but knocking one star off for what seems to me like poor durability.</li>
            <li> I used to use very sharp, pointy, tiny scissors to do those two jobs.</li>
            <li> They sent me a brand new one in about 2-3 weeks, so now I at least have a backup.  </li>
            <li> That sucks, need new blade but can&#x27;t buy one.</li>
            <li> It is ergonomically correct, easy to use, practically noiseless and no pulling of the nose or ear hair while cutting it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bough some trimmers and Walmart which got dirty easily, and eventually it power faded even after changing the batteries.</li>
            <li> Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]]</li>
            <li> My previous nose hair trimmer wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;nice looking&amp;#34; as this, nor was it as quiet.  </li>
            <li> Product works well in the wet or dry; I&#x27;ve owned this for 6+ months and have not had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> My only wish, and therefore one less star, is that it was rechargeable.  </li>
            <li> Does the job, cuts closely, but occasionally pulls the hair causing slight pain.  </li>
            <li> However, this trepidation was short lived because for a small, condensed product, the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair trimmer works like a charm.  </li>
            <li> Im not a particularly hairy guy</li>
            <li> So the only downside to this device is that it seems to burn through batteries faster than I had anticipated for such a small piece of bathroom hardware.</li>
            <li> This is the 3rd trimmer I bought in the past 4 years, and the only one that works well.</li>
            <li> No complaints and less hair left in the sink!</li>
            <li> NO HAIR PULLING - he can use it wet or dry...</li>
            <li> I only used it less than 10 times before it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]]</li>
            <li> I had a previous trimmer that was just total garbage.</li>
            <li> The only reported drawback was a bit of a bite when pressing against his lips but holding it at a slight angle relieved this problem.</li>
            <li> less chance of those things being a paper weight a week later.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is not particularly substantial.  </li>
            <li> but if it was I&#x27;d tell you how well it works, how small it is, that it only needs 1 AA battery, and that it cleans up in a second.</li>
            <li> Recent one lasted two and a half years.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent lots of time in the past plucking nose hairs gone wild and</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, quiet, and simple to use.</li>
            <li> this trimmer has the power to mow through even the toughest nose hair, wet or dry</li>
            <li> After having used it several times however, I have had no issues, never any pain or discomfort, the vibrating sensation can be a bit odd though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it only takes a minute to take care of business, but I don&#x27;t think that I have even changed the battery in the year and a half that I have had it.  </li>
            <li> it handles both wet and dry environments</li>
            <li> I could at least continue to use the product as long as I could plug it in like my old face shavers.  </li>
            <li> Once I mustered up the courage to return, I grabbed the U-pipe and turned it over only to find black gunk coming out.</li>
            <li> It worked well wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> and it takes up less space than the last one I had that had to be stored on</li>
            <li> course, the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black does have its flaws.</li>
            <li> when it powered up seemed to have such a quiet and small motor.  </li>
            <li> I like that you can use it wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]].</li>
            <li> This takes care of the latter half of that problem.</li>
            <li> Less than 18 months later</li>
            <li> I like that it can be used wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> My previous unit was a rechargeable plug-in one and it seems like I only had to charge that once every couple of months.</li>
            <li> Even though it advertises on their internet site for use in the shower, I wouldn&#x27;t try  it simply because a product at the price they sell it for usually isn&#x27;t built to last.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s much smaller and lighter than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> Bought this after my previous Panasonic trimmer finally bit the dust.  </li>
            <li> Works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to, however I recently bought a beard trimmer that has a nose hair attachment, making this product useless to me.</li>
            <li> and I like that you can use it wet or dry.  </li>
            <li> It definitely doesn&#x27;t nick the skin, but on the flip side, it does not trim the hairs as close as I was used to with my previous trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several battery powered trimmers in the past and this is the&lt;br /&gt;first one that actually works!  </li>
            <li> My particular device has serious issues with its battery connection.  </li>
            <li> Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]]</li>
            <li> Not particularly thorough:</li>
            <li> Sad to say, I cried like a teenage schoolgirl at a One Direction concert after using these for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Not sure how short people are going with their facial hair, but it&#x27;s pretty well useless unless you want a very very short stubble.  </li>
            <li> Use wet or dry.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much smaller than my previous one, by Conair (junk).  </li>
            <li> We&#x27;re an... adventurous... couple, so she was disappointed to learn that, while battery operated, this is only a nose and ear hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Especially when my previous trimmer was a knockoff Chinese product that lasted less than 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li> This one seems as though the battery will last longer than the previous one and it doesn&#x27;t bite.</li>
            <li> the problem with both of these is you can&#x27;t buy a replacement blade for less than replacing the entire unit.</li>
            <li> This is my second one as I broke my previous one by dropping it on the floor</li>
            <li> Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]]</li>
            <li> My previous remington at the same price lasted way longer.</li>
            <li> That can make a big difference when you&#x27;re past 40 and need to trim regularly!</li>
            <li> I have been using different brands of trimmer in the past and I hope that this will be the last one.</li>
            <li> I had one of these trimmers that I bought at Bed Bath and Beyond for the same price, and it was half the quality.  </li>
            <li> After consulting the other reviews, I would bet that the problem wasn&#x27;t actually the blade -- those are expected to last for a few years -- but rather</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a useless light to wear down the battery (think Panasonic ER421KC).</li>
            <li> Power is weak, sometimes winds down to barely working, even with new batteries.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t found a long one creeping out since I&#x27;ve started using this trimmer like I used to with the other tool.</li>
            <li> ears and dont have to risk using scissors for other hair that is begginning to grow in strange places where nothing used to appear.</li>
            <li> The sad part is that I know I have now reached middle aged, as if the bifocals weren&#x27;t the first sign.</li>
            <li> lasted a week, doesn&#x27;t even shoot the water out the side properly its just a mess</li>
            <li> I use in very infrequently and often the find the battery weak when I do use it.</li>
            <li> No big deal, but this trimmer avoids all the mess</li>
            <li> Be careful though, these tiny blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> first two were kind of working, but the annoying part was that they were irritating my nose.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Yep, it worked a few times and is now dead (it was brand new in retail packaging).  </li>
            <li> I mean it literally just stops working regardless if you replace with new batteries.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Trying to trim unwanted hair with scissors doesn&#x27;t work so well in certain small places like the nose or ears!!</li>
            <li> So I had just managed to burn out the second of my nose hair trimmers, and I was resorting to scissors, which is scary both because there&#x27;s something sharp and pointy in your nose and because it&#x27;s really hard to get the right angle to clear out those hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve spent in a long time!!</li>
            <li> We used several other trimmers with either limited or no success in terms of dealing with wiry eyebrows or harder than metal ear hairs.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a Y chromosome, but what I do have is a big Jewish nose filled with some really ugly dark hairs.</li>
            <li> When the unpleasant task of nose/ear hair trimming is due, you can&#x27;t do better than Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> The worst lasted a few months, the best one lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li> The cutting blades have plenty of speed and it does a fine job.  </li>
            <li> the other options such as using scissors are no fun.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get carried away with it because it will grab onto any loose skin and give you a nice bloody slice.  </li>
            <li> Well the battery life is very limited.  </li>
            <li> Used it once every 2 weeks for a very limited time</li>
            <li> This little guy gets really close to the skin and reaches the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> It recently went up in price due to demand created by Father&#x27;s day, but should hopefully come down again, so if you aren&#x27;t in a hurry you could wait for it to drop.</li>
            <li> The only thing i don&#x27;t like is I felt it&#x27;s pulling my nose hair a little bit when i use it.</li>
            <li> The battery life is a little short</li>
            <li> I also like to use this after i trim my beared to cut the little hairs left</li>
            <li> Wish it were a little smaller, but no biggie.</li>
            <li> It saves a little aggravation and only needs to be used weekly or as needed.</li>
            <li> I like this little personal hygiene device.  </li>
            <li> when I move the trimmer close to the middle of my nose, it tickles a little bit (but it doesn&#x27;t hurt)</li>
            <li> I will admit, I was a little nervous about getting this and actually using it.</li>
            <li> Bought for my dad who has a little bit of the nose and ear hair starting to come in..</li>
            <li> A little practice was necessary, but I&#x27;ve got the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Finally, I got turned-on to this little gadget from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> A little big and bulky and</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t think of any cons except maybe the instructions could be a little clearer on what positions to turn the various \\&quot;knobs\\&quot; for cleaning, taking apart, changing the battery, etc.</li>
            <li> Gets all nose hair and the little hairs between my eyebrows above my nose.</li>
            <li> I became self-conscious of the little, tiny hairs around my nose.</li>
            <li> Actually works and works well, a little pricey</li>
            <li> You know you have little hairs growing out of your nose, and it&#x27;s gross.  </li>
            <li> Was hoping it would last a little longer than that.</li>
            <li> little device if used regularly can make that problem disappear.  </li>
            <li> I need clippers such as these to make life a little easier.  </li>
            <li> Sounds simple, but I&#x27;ve owned other trimmers in the past that just fell short.  </li>
            <li> and you&#x27;re getting little pieces of hair in your snot for the next week).</li>
            <li> It takes batteries which is a little different than the rechargeable one I once used.</li>
            <li> These &amp;#34;round top&amp;#34; models just can&#x27;t do the job of the flat &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; type trimmers (which are generally half the price).</li>
            <li> I decided that I would buy another and baby it a little (maybe I was too rough on the last one?).  </li>
            <li> The package is made out of hard, clear plastic.</li>
            <li> It is a little loud, but that&#x27;s not a huge concern for me.  </li>
            <li> I dont know if the issue is blade dullness or slow rotation but get ready to ouch a little when you use this.</li>
            <li> I was concerned about the blade, it was a tough sell believing that it wouldn&#x27;t nick me, so I shoved it as far up my nose as possible just to test it out</li>
            <li> In fact it was sharp enough that there wasn&#x27;t the typical pull, yet it also didn&#x27;t chafe my nasal cavity at all.</li>
            <li> I get these hairs that are longer and thicker than the regular eyebrow hairs, and they grow out a half inch longer than the other ones.  </li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work well - hard to fit into a nostril and doesn&#x27;t cut all the hair in its way - frustrating</li>
            <li> /&gt;What is with the fact that every trimmer I have looked at has so many bad reviews.</li>
            <li> Also I did notice that the tip can get kinda warm after a few moments of using the trimmer...not too bad</li>
            <li> - surely it is cutting a hair for each zap because after a while that area is hair free.</li>
            <li> Though it still seems to work, the noise almost makes it most painful to use.</li>
            <li> Only gave it 4 stars as I took it apart to clean the inside and it seemed impossible to reassemble--had to buy another and will just&lt;</li>
            <li> Great way to keep the nose from looking disgusting.</li>
            <li> Disappointing that it was made so cheaply.</li>
            <li> Looks great, but works terrible.</li>
            <li> When I gave it to him, I honestly thought he was going to think it was stupid.</li>
            <li> And not in a painful way, so really there isn&#x27;t too much to say.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been okay -- but either I&#x27;m stupid or this product has its drawbacks, because this is the second time I&#x27;ve nicked the inside of my nose.</li>
            <li> Smooth cutting too.</li>
            <li> It sucks getting old, but this trimmer makes it a bit easier.</li>
            <li> Getting old sucks, but this can help out with unwanted hair growth.</li>
            <li> I was hesistate on given it 5 stars because Im not sure how long this item will last.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Thanks to the Panasonic ER-GN30-K at least I can deal with the jungles that have developed in my nose and ears.</li>
            <li> this product worked well for 31 days - just long enough to go past the allowable return period.  </li>
            <li> This is the third small area hair trimmer that I have owned and as long as it lasts I do not intend on getting another any time soon.</li>
            <li> The cutting action is at the very tip</li>
            <li> I wish I&#x27;d bought it years earlier instead of using small scissors for as long as I did.  </li>
            <li> But I am not sure how long it is going to last.</li>
            <li> nothing too fancy, complicated or dangerous...battery last a reasonable amount of use time...</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;s going to last for.</li>
            <li> Getting old sucks...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few trimmers and most always with disappointing results.</li>
            <li> All products tend to have a small percentage of defects, so I don&#x27;t know if this one will last as long as I expect it to.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Works well and as expected</li>
            <li> I recently bought this and have used it a few times</li>
            <li> Nothing to say, works as expected, just want to rate it with stars and move on to something else.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say here.  </li>
            <li> Second time Dead as a doornail.</li>
            <li> Ive never used it wet</li>
            <li> and when I took it out the next time, it was dead.</li>
            <li> I had trouble turning it on until It finally stopped working.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> This device has received a lot of praise and that is partially why I bought it.  </li>
            <li> * Works with absolutely no pulling/tucking/pinching  </li>
            <li> Trim&#x27;s my nose hair as expected</li>
            <li> The motor doesn&#x27;t drag when you turn it on.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve laid waste to several of them over the years.  </li>
            <li> Only lasted a few months before it died.</li>
            <li> I have had this model only for a few days</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t test the wet aspect per se, but I have rinsed it off for cleaning purposes.  </li>
            <li> Only used a few times and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> It works the way I expected it to.</li>
            <li> An efficient trimmer, although I have only used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> Just be careful it&#x27;s one of those that can get turned on on accident.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried using it wet; it&#x27;s not something</li>
            <li> However, I don&#x27;t used it in any wet conditions.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a few weeks, and I see no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with iTV remote and ordered the leather sleeve on Amazon so you have a point of reference.  </li>
            <li> Instructions on how to take it apart for cleaning could have been clearer, but not really a problem.  </li>
            <li> i have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Had been struggling with a different trimmer for a few years...</li>
            <li> gn30 k vortex wet</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Neither too short, you have to make a few passes to get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> not much to say.</li>
            <li> Really not much to say except that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it well.  </li>
            <li> Have not used it wet.  </li>
            <li> I never got it wet, so</li>
            <li> There was absolutely no sign of life.  </li>
            <li> Not much to say here, except it does as it&#x27;s advertised.</li>
            <li> I had read a few reviews that said it stopped working after a short while.</li>
            <li> Got relatively minimal use.  </li>
            <li> Be careful not to push it into your skin or it can cut you.</li>
            <li> -  careful with that cleaning -  </li>
            <li> It works like I expected it to.</li>
            <li> I have ashima and currently been having trouble taking out my nose hairs</li>
            <li> and you get a &#x27;weedy&#x27; look of partially trimmed ear hair... unless you want to braid &#x27;em</li>
            <li> Trims nose hair as expected</li>
            <li> My nose hair would get trapped in the trimmer and the only way to get it out</li>
            <li> The whole wet/dry part seems a bit of a farce because all it is is a well/chamber that traps hair which can be flushed out with water.  </li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t noisy initially but after using it a few times it became that.</li>
            <li> everyone should have one (they&#x27;re not really for sharing).</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected and woks well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a really hairy guy, but I do need this from time to time for my nose.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a touch heavier than I expected, but</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no pulling on the hair at all which i like</li>
            <li> roughly 18 uses.</li>
            <li> Motor burns out or somehow it gets jammed.  </li>
            <li> Be careful</li>
            <li> This one is a wet/dry model so you can get it wet and not have to worry about it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased quite a few different brands and models of nose hair trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I never used it in wet conditions; just blew out the container with compressed air and kept a AA battery in it.</li>
            <li> Broke after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> But to drop it once and have it dead indicates to me that there is some sort of fragile connection inside.</li>
            <li> The product was everything that I expected based on the product description.</li>
            <li> As expected.  </li>
            <li> works as expected</li>
            <li> all as expected..</li>
            <li> and it was always jammed up and had to soak it and shake the heck out of it to get it to come on.  </li>
            <li> Eventually the entire device went dead and it no longer is functional.  </li>
            <li> Seems to work, but never really felt the need.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Before I could use it a second time, I drooped it a few inches while cleaning</li>
            <li> Not very durable.</li>
            <li> Just be careful.</li>
            <li> Waste of money - died after a month and a couple of weeks, and three uses total.</li>
            <li> However, it has worked just as I expected.  </li>
            <li> It was just what I had expected.</li>
            <li> This device mearly just trims and not very close.  </li>
            <li> Seems solid and not cheap plastic like others trimmers I have had.  </li>
            <li> Usage was minimal may be once every 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Pity.</li>
            <li> Just be careful in how you  use product&lt;br /&gt;so as not to cut either cavity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days</li>
            <li> I have only used for a few weeks</li>
            <li> the product does what I expected.  </li>
            <li> This product does not really do a satisfactory job.</li>
            <li> It worked well when it was functional, but a shame it lasted for only a few months.</li>
            <li> You can also use this wet.  </li>
            <li> I suppose I will try wet at some point.  </li>
            <li> All you need is to switch it to wet mode (shown with a water tap sign) and put it under the water.</li>
            <li> At the time of writing the review it is only available from third party vendors and that is probably the reason behind this unfair price increase.</li>
            <li> works well, haven&#x27;t tried it in wet conditions</li>
            <li> I also ended up with a nose with no nose-hairs, spent a week sneezing -</li>
            <li> Never really cut well inside nostril trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Not much else</li>
            <li> It performs just as I expected, does the job without pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> Everything is what I expected and it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> it hurts when this thing is wet...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suspect that the majority of reviews here are from folks who&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks - and I would have probably given it 5 stars at that time as well.</li>
            <li> It only takes a few seconds----  </li>
            <li> So be careful.  </li>
            <li> This is my reason to minus one star.  </li>
            <li> Felt like such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Careful when taking the bottom off to put t</li>
            <li> and i was not gentle at all</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried out a few different trimmers before this one that just didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> but if you look you&#x27;ll see quite a few that have had issue with it quitting on them after a short time.  </li>
            <li> It works as expected.  </li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, this is my second one and they break after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Cuts nose hairs with absolutely no pain.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money, Worked several times and then died the death.</li>
            <li> I have only had this device for a few weeks...</li>
            <li> Arrived as expected within promised shipping time frame.</li>
            <li> It eats batteries and with no real results.  </li>
            <li> thats is a 1/4 wide.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> This only lasted a few months.</li>
            <li> The only downside is the interior when placing the battery in it smelled like sulfur or something dead.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet while wet.</li>
            <li> I knew to be functioning from my TV remote</li>
            <li> careful not to lose the blade assembly</li>
            <li> /&gt;Robin Williams&#x27; arms |  Unknown</li>
            <li> Does not seem to have the power that I had expected.</li>
            <li> Batteries burns out faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful though when removing the tip for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here but that this nose trimmer works well.</li>
            <li> Minus the hair.</li>
            <li> If you have ever spent time trying to get the hairs out of your nose or</li>
            <li> Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Works as well as expected.  </li>
            <li> Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> Trims exactly I expected.</li>
            <li> Pressure is not very helpful anyway.</li>
            <li> But be careful when washing it.</li>
            <li> Works at expected.  </li>
            <li> Product arrived a lot sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Not much I can say..</li>
            <li> The smell only lasted a few seconds, but</li>
            <li> It does not smell when the battery cover is closed so no worries.</li>
            <li> Have not tried it wet.</li>
            <li> Not really,</li>
            <li> and it got to me before I expected it to.</li>
            <li> It is torture to use and a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s not really working at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is just not what I expected it to be, my husband does not like it at all.</li>
            <li> Be careful when using it or you can cut yourself.  </li>
            <li> such a waste of my money</li>
            <li> Feels solid and not cheap.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can be as careful as you want - it will happen to you.</li>
            <li> it does an average job trimming, if you want to hold it long enough.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but he said it did not really hurt so all in all</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks</li>
            <li> buy it with eyes closed..</li>
            <li> It was just what was expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and I use it a couple of times a month.</li>
            <li> It is also water resistant, and has a slider switch to enable use in wet conditions.  </li>
            <li> I like the wet cleaning feature as well.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected, based up reviews and rating.  </li>
            <li> Even runs when wet, though I haven&#x27;t tried that.  </li>
            <li> This one is built well and works exactly as expected.  </li>
            <li> Works well and as expected.  </li>
            <li> AA minimal.</li>
            <li> Not much discomfort to use in nose. .</li>
            <li> I used it twice over a month period and the third time I went to use it was dead.</li>
            <li> Got wet one time and died.</li>
            <li> otherwise it&#x27;s not really working at all).&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Works as expected, takes 1 AA battery and is washable.</li>
            <li> but you do have to be careful.</li>
            <li> Of course, when you stick a rotating blade up your nostrils, you should be careful.</li>
            <li> I have never tried it wet however.</li>
            <li> it in the shower&amp;#34; - a bit wet, and now the battery burst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &gt; - Trimmer gets jammed every 10 seconds, requiring you to shake it and hope it restarts&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and it came on time.</li>
            <li> Not much to review</li>
            <li> I bought this a few months back and have used it quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is also somewhat hit and miss, since you need to take it apart, wash it carefully so as not to lose any small parts or cut yourself on the double-edged blade.</li>
            <li> Expected a trimmer to have sufficient power to rotate the blades with the speed to cut effortlessly.  </li>
            <li> I have not tried it wet.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it wet.</li>
            <li> I have to tap it on its side to get it to turn on, and even then it may run for only a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Just have to be careful as it can irritate the inside of the nostril if you get too close.</li>
            <li> have used only a few times but it hasnt grabbed hair yet as some commented.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> Careful examination of the warranty means I have to pay to have it shipped to Texas to get replaced or repaired.  </li>
            <li> So I have only used it a few times, and it does what it is designed to do.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Remington brand trimmer for the last few years but always dreaded it.</li>
            <li> Be careful when cleaning the tip head which comes off with a twist, you don&#x27;t want to damage the blade or plastic retaining clip.</li>
            <li> Used only few times.</li>
            <li> Does the job with minimal effort.  </li>
            <li> Heavy duty nose hair trimmer actually goes in and does what it is made for.  </li>
            <li> This works well, there is not much to say because it is a nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I like it because you can use it wet</li>
            <li> What a waste I will go back to stores that have 90 returns.</li>
            <li> Used few different models before this one.  </li>
            <li> It works as I expected.</li>
            <li> Not really stoked with the nose and ear trimmer, Y?</li>
            <li> Broke after not much use.</li>
            <li> cleaned it per the instructions and everything went as expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  </li>
            <li> I only had it a few months.</li>
            <li> he is rough on things</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product works as expected.  </li>
            <li> Works as expected, never hurts</li>
            <li> Works well just be careful it will cut you if you tilt it to close</li>
            <li> Mine quit working entirely after 4 months and just a few uses.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, their current models run from poor to OK.</li>
            <li> It does everything they advertize, including wet cleanup.  </li>
            <li> Was always kept in its box and never used it wet.</li>
            <li> Seems to get the job done with minimal discomfort (every now</li>
            <li> Otherwise the unit may have some trouble starting.</li>
            <li> and i don&#x27;t get cut or any pulled hairs, not much to ask for beyond that.</li>
            <li> does the trick, not much else to add.</li>
            <li> but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.</li>
            <li> It works well enough, but it seems like it&#x27;s struggling after a few uses.</li>
            <li> I called customer support and was told to mail it to a service center?</li>
            <li> Absolutely no issues.</li>
            <li> Does the job as expected</li>
            <li> It gets the hair in the center, but some nose hair on the side on the outer doesn&#x27;t get caught into the cutter.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and leaves nothing behind.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Trimmer worked as expected but when I set it upright in medicine cabinet it would fall out onto the floor, a lot.  </li>
            <li> Then with the repeated bangs on the floor it did not trim as expected.</li>
            <li> Be careful.</li>
            <li> he never used it wet</li>
            <li> I like the wet feature.</li>
            <li> Expect to go over the same area a few times.</li>
            <li> While I am not really hairy</li>
            <li> One of the problems I&#x27;ve had over the last thirty years of riding is that after a few hours, nose hairs start tickling my nose.  </li>
            <li> Occasionally pulls a hair, not a huge problem unless you&#x27;re a drama queen.</li>
            <li> The last time I visited my barber, under instructions from my wife, I asked the barber if he could please get rid of the hair in my ears, that was thick enough to grow potatoes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used on old siccors for many years and hated trimming my nose that way.  </li>
            <li> I sadly had to say goodbye to my old &amp;#34;gross old man hair trimmer&amp;#34; that worked like a champ for 15 years.</li>
            <li> you buy one you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;older technologies of this same type i found to be crap.</li>
            <li> Another nice feature is it stands on its base and doesn&#x27;t require a stand to take up valuable counter</li>
            <li> Well I hate to say I finally own a ear and nose trimmer.......</li>
            <li> The curved base fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li> The blades come loose and grind against the outer shell making it unusable due to slower speeds.  </li>
            <li> It has a broad base and stores easily in an upright position.</li>
            <li> Not a lot of mess or complicated procedures to clean it.</li>
            <li> Battery retains charge for a long time: he doesn&#x27;t use it often but the battery has not run down.</li>
            <li> We both have never used nose hair trimmers before so it is hard for basis of comparison but based on the experience with this product, my husband thought they were decent, but said he pushed them on his skin and they nicked him a little, but thought that if he was careful they seemed to get the job done as he</li>
            <li> Thanks for helping him look a bit less hairy!!!!</li>
            <li> Not sure where they came up with the wet/dry in the product label since I imagine that it would only be used dry but can be cleaned wet.</li>
            <li> Motivated by the fact that not using this trimmer will mean manual hair pulling by a fellow human, the owner of this (let&#x27;s say he is a man) uses it regularly now.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a few of these products over the years , and they all were pretty worthless to begin with and/or died a quick death.  </li>
            <li> I was afraid there would be pain but its absolutely painless !!!</li>
            <li> I had some old piece of crap dollar store nose hair trimmer and then I ordered this bad boy due to all the reviews and its awesome.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The only bad side is, you cant use this for long, it tends to get very hot.</li>
            <li> So far, it&#x27;s working like a charm, no more bouncing off or around!</li>
            <li> They initially worked fine, I&#x27;m not sure if the 2 I received were faulty or if they are just bad overall.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It can be a little difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> I push my trimmer right up against the skin to get at difficult hairs and in over 2 years</li>
            <li> All the reviewers are right and you won&#x27;t go wrong using these hair clippers.  </li>
            <li> It simply won&#x27;t cut anymore and the motor sounds like it bogs down if you slightly turn it.</li>
            <li> short, this device is either not sharp enough or it doesn&#x27;t have enough cutting power.  </li>
            <li> The cutting is sharp and accurate.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not easy to open and the cut blister might hurt people.</li>
            <li> perfect，but battery cover not easy to open</li>
            <li> A few other reviewers complain of the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not comfortable sticking anything up my nose other than the occasional finger</li>
            <li> /&gt;- avoid using a flat negative end battery, the middle one that shown in the picture below&lt;</li>
            <li> It also works for people on the go or someone who doesn&#x27;t have access to a mirror.using a product like this, so I&#x27;m not sure if the sound of it catching a random thick hair and cutting it caught me off guard and startled me</li>
            <li> The product seems to have a life span of 1-2 years, after that the unit seems to slow down and the cutter is not as sharp as it once was, so it is time to replace and buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> Typically, the trimmers were discarded in less than a year after several of tearful experiences.   </li>
            <li> I was concerned about only having the &amp;#34;nose&amp;#34; attachment, but the blade is shallow enough to cut close on my ears.</li>
            <li> By contrast,about 2 years before, I picked something similar for less than half the price and it is still runningand doing it&#x27;s job.  </li>
            <li> I can’t go outside without trimming my facial hair, seriously.</li>
            <li> It gets to hair that other ones I have used had a harder time reaching.  </li>
            <li> I would estimate that its roughly 50% quieter than all of the other trimmers I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d use it for facial hair grooming, as it&#x27;s not precise enough...</li>
            <li> (I think this is due to the wide bars on the guard around the cutters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several different trimmers over the past few years and now I found one that works the way it should.</li>
            <li> I swear, it was almost overnight that I went from having no such hairs to having hairs long enough to braid, and those poor souls who are shorter than me are stuck looking up at that every time they talk to</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than it works</li>
            <li> Durability has been a problem with some other trimmers that lasted roughly a year.</li>
            <li> Now has quit completely, which is disappointing since It&#x27;s not what I would call a high use item.</li>
            <li> have spent years using lousy trimmers which were difficult to clean and didn&#x27;t do a decent job of trimming.</li>
            <li> It in fact makes a mild little bumble-beeish  sound and tickles a bit as it trims those nasty hair follicles out of your nose.</li>
            <li> The first two trimmers I bought (other makes/models) were very disappointing and just didn&#x27;t trim very well.</li>
            <li> I was never impressed with the cutting tool, it is no different from the cheap trimmers you can get anywhere; it doesn&#x27;t trim very completely and pulls sometimes.  </li>
            <li> in removing hair but not very powerful but gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful.</li>
            <li> not a very fun</li>
            <li> Noise is less than the one I had before and is really not very loud anyway.  </li>
            <li> This is a only minor negative for me.</li>
            <li> Not worth the extra few bucks.</li>
            <li> Thats the one and only minor complaint.</li>
            <li> small parts to manipulate to &#x27;center&#x27; and seat when cleaning the device are the only challenges.</li>
            <li> /&gt;My only complaint, and a minor one at that, is that it tends to &amp;#34;fall</li>
            <li> No more Van Gogh episodes (reference to the famous painter cutting off his ear), or bleeding nostrils.</li>
            <li> Not worth it even at the low price it was still a waste of time and materials going into a landfill.</li>
            <li> It acts very weak like the battery is low, but even with a new battery it won&#x27;t cut hair.</li>
            <li> you put in a brand new battery and the speed is just a little too slow in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I am back to using my trusty little scissors!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job well, but I&#x27;ve had little knock-off non-branded trimmers do the same thing for half the price.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different trimmers but this beats them all hands down.</li>
            <li> He used to use a little scissor to cut his nose hair when they get too long.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes for the product but the durability is poor.</li>
            <li> Whatever the secret is I can highly recommend this nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li> When I was looking for a new trimmer (my prior trimmer of 15+ years had failed) I based my purchase upon the reviews.  </li>
            <li> My old one always hurt as it pulled out the hairs rather than cutting, even when new.  </li>
            <li> I used the Panasonic IMMEDIATELY after using the new bargain priced brand name product and the Panasonic clearly was cutting additional hails that the other unit had missed.  </li>
            <li> I previously owned some cheap trimmer and, while it worked, it tickled like crazy when inserted into the nose.  </li>
            <li> The base has a slight angle which fits nicely into my nostrils.    </li>
            <li> I have a drawer with almost half a dozen nose hair trimmers that stopped working after only a few uses.</li>
            <li> The packaging for this handy little tool only shows men, but we all know ladies struggle with those ugly little black hairs sticking out of their nostrils as well!!</li>
            <li> The packaging for this handy little tool only shows men, but we all know ladies struggle with those ugly little black hairs sticking out of their nostrils as well!!  </li>
            <li> Been using it regularly for over 3 years and don&#x27;t have a single complaint.</li>
            <li> The thing was old and the blades were not good.</li>
            <li> is that they are cheaply manufactured to start out working well and work like crap--tugging dully, painfully at the larger nose hairs--after a few months.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it would and then other times it wouldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I waited on this review because of other reviews I saw complaining that it broke on them.  </li>
            <li> He is researching other trimmers.</li>
            <li> But only on small sections.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple other people look at</li>
            <li> This is another milestone in my life,along with bifocals and other accoutrements of aging.</li>
            <li> Seems to have a sharp blade.</li>
            <li> BUT, he actually uses it on a regular basis and hasn&#x27;t had one negative thing to say about it!  </li>
            <li> so well I ordered some for other family members</li>
            <li> As other reviewers had written, this trimmer cuts, rather than pull, your hair.</li>
            <li> There is a weird sensation at first, but you&#x27;ll get use to it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried other electric trimmers</li>
            <li> My nose is cleaner than with any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small enough to throw in your travel kit .</li>
            <li> It has yet to hurt when trimming a hair like some of the other reviews</li>
            <li> i didn&amp;#34;t get the attachments.if there is any way i can get the other attachments,and charge to my credit card</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I think I can extend this recommendation to beaks big and small.</li>
            <li> Other than tickling the nose works well.</li>
            <li> When I was a young man back back in college had you told me that some day everyone would be connected over computer networks and we could share our opinions about nose-hair trimmers with people all over the world, I would have said you were crazy, yet here we are.</li>
            <li> Tried other, this one does no pull but cut your hair</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve never done it before, expect to be quite uncomfortable the first time you do it.  </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to replace other ones he had purchased that just fell apart and or didn&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
            <li> Pretty uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Tried many other brands of these before, and was always disappointed.</li>
            <li> I usually take the guards and such off from trimmers</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t vouch for any other use as the Ear hair hasn&#x27;t crept in yet.</li>
            <li> Works as expected!</li>
            <li> If you plan to use it for ears or other areas do not bother because it does not work.</li>
            <li> and I tried a few others, and they did an awful job, left hair long enough to still see, while being mostly ineffecteve.  </li>
            <li> Before they got this they used small scissors and there were occasionally &amp;#34;accidents&amp;#34; that resulted in pain and blood (as you can imagine).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like how it is so low power, but it does small jobs well.</li>
            <li> I initially gave it 5 Stars, but no more.</li>
            <li> Small slits on the outside allow the hair to enter.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase due to the battery power.</li>
            <li> this.&lt;br /&gt;Money well spent!</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d like to use it on other people.  </li>
            <li> Due to how well it</li>
            <li> Other than that it does its job.</li>
            <li> other trimmers I&#x27;ve used have pulled the hairs.</li>
            <li> It gets hair my other trimmer missed.</li>
            <li> but as others have concluded the blade fail after the first battery change and it makes a grinding noise and now it does not work at all.</li>
            <li> I dropped my first one and it failed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried about every other cure, so</li>
            <li> I like that it has a small curve which actually complements its design</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other trimmers in the past and they all seem to work the same.</li>
            <li> Never a very pleasing thing to have to do!</li>
            <li> have tried the remington clipper and small scissors for the nose hair with mixed results.  </li>
            <li> I got this based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t return this one due to time limit ran out.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews on here and from other sites as well.</li>
            <li> Have used other trimmers of different brands in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for a few months and wish I had purchased it long before.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure how well it would work for facial hair.</li>
            <li> Alkaline battery lasts a long time, but I&#x27;d recommend a rechargeable battery to cut waste.</li>
            <li> I gave my other trimmer to my parents and bought this one.</li>
            <li> work grate not under powered like a lot of the other ones.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t pinch like other nose hair trimmers</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t plan on using this for anything other than your nose.  </li>
            <li> - Thought the first time was an unfortunate fluke</li>
            <li> It has other uses</li>
            <li> I agree with the other 5-star ratings.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t catch the hair like some other trimmers do.</li>
            <li> so it cuts hair and doesn&#x27;t tangle and pull like other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I chose this by reading the reviews of other users and am in agreement.  </li>
            <li> four other for family members as gift.</li>
            <li> After hating all the time you spend in front of the mirror with razor sharp scissors in your nose, I figured it was time to get a devoted nose trimmer.  </li>
            <li> However, it has been an isolated incident, and I&#x27;ve yet to have any other issues with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this based on other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother trying any other style of trimmer.</li>
            <li> So lets not pretend that I intent to use this for other than trimming nose hair.  </li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed, and the value (price) if phenomenal.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get nicked by it nor did I experience any of the hairs being pulled out like some of the other reviews had mentioned.</li>
            <li> He says it doesn&#x27;t pull like some other trimmers-</li>
            <li> But if you want to substitute one for the other that will not happen with these.</li>
            <li> I still have not found a trimmer that works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Other then that</li>
            <li> This seems to cut it without the &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; I get from other trimmers.</li>
            <li> The replacement worked for about 3 weeks - I used it no more than twice - and has now also died entirely.</li>
            <li> So often in the past similar products were a letdown.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure why they are calling it a facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I recommend this clipper over any other.</li>
            <li> I had the Wahl but the battery connection was not consistent</li>
            <li> I had to stop and hold the device still with one hand to keep the hair relaxed and to seek a pair of scissors with the other.  </li>
            <li> Reading the other reviews on-line convinced me to buy this one.  </li>
            <li> back to small scissors I will go</li>
            <li> Not that it made any difference one way or the other.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really sure how they call it a facial hair trimmer though.  </li>
            <li> It works well, doesn&#x27;t cut or pull, and stays sharp.</li>
            <li> so be careful while using!</li>
            <li> I have purchased two other brands and they just did not work.  </li>
            <li> Sharp, does not pull, just cuts.  </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and seem to cut the hairs in no time at all.</li>
            <li> so I cant compare to other makes/models.</li>
            <li> Waited to long to try, and couldn&#x27;t return waste of $20.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about it at first</li>
            <li> My husband tells me that this does not pull his nose hairs at all like other trimmers do.</li>
            <li> Hope the blade stays sharp.</li>
            <li> All I feel is a tickle in my nose, but other than that painless.</li>
            <li> I would recommend if you have lots of hairs in your noise and are scared of using sharp objects to get in there.</li>
            <li> it is sharp and does not pull hair or cut skin</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> There is absolutely NO PAIN or discomfort!</li>
            <li> have never known anybody using it, so it was somewhat scarey at first.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this product to other family members as well as my friends who need to purchase or replace a trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Sturdy and has not fallen apart like other hair trimmers have</li>
            <li> We have had this for about six months and use it every other week and have not needed to change the battery.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what else to say about it, other than it definitely does the job it was made to do.  </li>
            <li> I use mine every other day before a shower.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t snag, cut, or cause any other problems.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, unlike the Remington, which never cut me, the Panasonic has drawn blood three times.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I figured I needed to buy other newer batteries.  </li>
            <li> Although it does trim facial hair, it does take a lot of time because the shaver part is quite small.</li>
            <li> I went to use the product the other day</li>
            <li> Would recommend over other comparable models even by Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> and all the other products seemed to have even lower ratings.  </li>
            <li> I tried the other type, [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> /&gt;You google and learn that it&#x27;s probably due to infections from ingrown nose</li>
            <li> No more humiliation when getting caught occasionally \\&quot;plucking\\&quot; nose hairs when they tickle; no more out of control sneezing from the pain when occasionally \\&quot;plucking\\&quot; nose hairs when they tickle</li>
            <li> It does not seem too sturdy, so I am not entirely confident that it will last.  </li>
            <li> One was for me, and the other for my daughter.  </li>
            <li> : after using it for a while, the metal part gets warmer.&lt;br /&gt;While it is not too hot, it might be a bit uncomfortable depending on people.</li>
            <li> I also like the fact it takes a battery as several other brands in the past have ceased working due to issues with the rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> He also tried other brands, none of them works as well as Panasonic</li>
            <li> Works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s due to the sharpness of the blades, or the design but</li>
            <li> Not much to it, but it works!</li>
            <li> which I was concerned about from other model I had.</li>
            <li> other than that it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> all my life i got nose hair trimmers from tv advertisements and other brands  .</li>
            <li> I tried the other nostril;</li>
            <li> It does other surface areas</li>
            <li> This works extremely well.</li>
            <li> THE OTHER ONE DIED AFTER A MONTH</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the small amount of burn smell while in use.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s small enough to leave out on the counter.</li>
            <li> No more unsightly boogers stuck in the hairs nor hairs hanging outside my nose.  </li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t found any other nose hair trimmers that do the job as well as this.</li>
            <li> But other than that.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, quiet, and works painlessly.  </li>
            <li> I always used small trimming scissors but for 12 bucks to time savings is immense.</li>
            <li> or I just lost the other one without even knowing it.  </li>
            <li> few minor pulls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small and quiet also.</li>
            <li> In other words it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t tickle the inside of your nose as much as other cheaper trimmers do, which I like.</li>
            <li> may even use it to trim hair at other parts of your body, for instance, eyebrows, bread,</li>
            <li> read some reviews of other brands and they weren&#x27;t favorable.</li>
            <li> It just makes you want to press harder!</li>
            <li> There is no hair pulling as I had with other units.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I have to fiddle with it endlessly to get it started.  </li>
            <li> The other reviews here influenced me to purchase this.</li>
            <li> Im not sure how they classify this as a facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Buy other brand.</li>
            <li> Does not cut inside your nose like other product.</li>
            <li> I will be trying some name brand batteries to see if it will last past one clipping.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned two other nose trimmers over the years.  </li>
            <li> I used to have my hair cut every other week and never worried about nose or ear hair.</li>
            <li> Blades are sharp so they cut,don&#x27;t pull.</li>
            <li> so I would not have to pull it or use sharp scissors.</li>
            <li> I will recommend this to other friends.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a cheaper nose hair trimmer and it did a pretty lame job.</li>
            <li> It gets used every other week and still works as well as the day I got it.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many nose hair trimmers and always been disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and quiet too!</li>
            <li> Had hairs pull a couple times but other</li>
            <li> Other shavers have just SUCKED - didn&#x27;t work, or hurt to use them.  </li>
            <li> (I am not sure why this is nor if its even related but this one lasted a month).  </li>
            <li> Other trimmers require you have to see what you are doing.</li>
            <li> Past experiences have been a mixed bag.  </li>
            <li> Other models always seemed to fluctuate in power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other Panasonic trimmer that I have purchased have performed well.</li>
            <li> I will not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are other moments when you say: I want to make a blended smoothie.  </li>
            <li> Listen to me: I will be buying this exact brand and model for the rest of my life, should it ever fail.</li>
            <li> Takes care of those pesky hairs without pulling or any other discomfort.</li>
            <li> He mentioned it being sharp so be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well, won&#x27;t buy any other.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t had any problems with pulling of hairs or any of the other issues people have described when using rechargeables, but YMMV.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well with no nicks.  </li>
            <li> The blades must be sharp because they cut without any problems.  </li>
            <li> This is a painless way to get those hairs that would bring tears to your eyes if you tried any other method of removal.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used for other areas.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not willing to try it out.</li>
            <li> I have other ones ( 1  )</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s expected to do !  ...</li>
            <li> i read all the other reviews to decide on which model/brand to buy.</li>
            <li> This unit is average in its ability to perform expected task.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like I had a lot of clippings stuck up there either, like some other brands (where you blow your nose</li>
            <li> I bought it because it has an on off switch instead of a twist on off mechanism like other nose hair trimmers.  </li>
            <li> That seems to be the modus operandi of the other trimmers when they are going out.  </li>
            <li> Works extremely well.</li>
            <li> Guarantee assured is the other name of amazon.</li>
            <li> other than that miscue has worked well.</li>
            <li> Not able to get it to actually work.</li>
            <li> I bought this through other&#x27;s account</li>
            <li> On from Sharper Image, And the other for a no name company.&lt;br /&gt;Both</li>
            <li> It cuts closer than any other I have had.  </li>
            <li> other males who are as hairy as bears may may to use it</li>
            <li> Gets in to spots in my nose and ears that other trimmers could not reach.</li>
            <li> Once the hair that used to be on my head, somehow decided to migrate to my nose and other places, I was needing to find this item.  </li>
            <li> It does the job of trimming nose hair as well as other hair.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well...great for ears and nostrils.</li>
            <li> I just wish i had purchased this a long time ago but was always thinking it would be a waste of money and not work.</li>
            <li> Getting rid of those little hairs in the hard to get and sensitive areas of the ears and nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the fault of the Chinese for making such worthless products; then again if we didn&#x27;t continue to buy their trash, this would quickly become much, much less of a problem.</li>
            <li> Never really came to life, and its not like I&#x27;m hacking down bushes in the amazon with it.</li>
            <li> Mowing down wide swaths of unsightly nose and ear hairs has never been easier.</li>
            <li> Other than that, the device could be a little stronger but what can you expect from a single AA battery power source.</li>
            <li> Great little unit to get rid of those nasty nose/ear hairs.</li>
            <li> Not great for precise hair trimming or in tough to reach spots.</li>
            <li> Overall though this nose trimmer was a huge disappointment compared to the few cheaper no name brand ones Ive had in the past.</li>
            <li> Once removed...have to be very careful .</li>
            <li> If you decide to buy it, be very careful with it.</li>
            <li> I had to be very careful not to hurt myself.</li>
            <li> What a tremendous upgrade this little trimmer is compared to the one that by the way, was not that much less expensive than this one.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K uses a single AA battery as opposed to cheaper brands I have used in the past which rely on a single AAA battery.</li>
            <li> be careful very sharp, works well.</li>
            <li> The 3rd one I have tried other two not very good results...</li>
            <li> poor battery contact - and new batteries don&#x27;t help.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind rubbing this thing around your nostrils for a long time trying to catch the hairs that you can see plain as day...</li>
            <li> Husband can single handedly mow down pesky ear and nose hairs at whim now!  </li>
            <li> , I have a norelco trimmer that&#x27;s still going strong after 4 years, bad thing norelco stopped making that model.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve had others previously that did not work as expected.  </li>
            <li> the idea is to trim nose hair which protrudes from the sides of your nasal cavity... not to leave a &#x27;bush&#x27; of partially trimmed hair that is cut off at half</li>
            <li> Clean-up was also quick and the fact you can disassemble the cutting head makes thorough cleaning a breeze</li>
            <li> Bogus advertising, poor engineering led me to the net and further research.&lt;br</li>
            <li> With advanced age has come a flourishing but unwelcome crop of nose hair, which if left untrimmed starts to tickle annoyingly.  </li>
            <li> At that point, something happened to it where it got real noisy, and stopped cutting properly.</li>
            <li> It took over 10 years for my previous Panasonic trimmer to degrade (it still worked...just not very well), so there was no question about which unit to replace</li>
            <li> However, it really tickes my inner nose when cutting nose hair, to the point of making my eyes water.</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times and its almost dead</li>
            <li> Although, cutting oneself is not entirely impossible as I just did it this morning.</li>
            <li> Every now and then a slight pinch, but certainly never made me bleed.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s no excuse for excessive nose hair with this inexpensive little trimmer.</li>
            <li> In looking at reviews on the Panasonic website, this is a fairly frequent complaint  Made in China!  </li>
            <li> Like other buyers said, at the price its not worth taking up their warranty to pay for the shipping cost to their facility in Texas.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle after looking at other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> When I shopped for a Panasonic replacement I was concerned about the negative comments in several reviews but decided to go ahead and give it a try based on my past experience with the brand and the relatively low price .....</li>
            <li> Just long enough to fail outside of the return window.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this exact trimmer back in college (think 2006) and it was a piece of filthy garbage back then.</li>
            <li> I have tried other trimmers with no success.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t take the trouble to return it unless it fails completely right away, but I would never buy anything else like it again if I could help it.</li>
            <li> Only complaint, which is very minor, is that the seating of the blade is a little touchy.  </li>
            <li> After getting tired of grooming unsightly hair in different methods I finally broke down and got this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> it works but its slow, i think mostly because the unit pushes the hair down instead of cutting it</li>
            <li> it works well and does what it is supposed to do, no more no less, not sure what else to say.</li>
            <li> This is not some fake review, it&#x27;s just hard to come up with original accolades for a nose hair trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing, I thought Panasonic was supposed to be a reputable company</li>
            <li> Several reviewers complained that they bought these, only to have them fail early.</li>
            <li> The battery holder is way too flimsy, and after using it awhile, the motor starts slowing down and intermittently stopping due to</li>
            <li> It feels a little weird at first due to</li>
            <li> Weak, battery did not last long.</li>
            <li> Based on other negative reviews I am going to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> He always complained about other nose and facial trimmers I have purchased.</li>
            <li> I used to use a flat edged trimmer but the angles required to operate made it difficult to do a complete job.  </li>
            <li> And the cap actually stays on tight, which was always a problem with the ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  </li>
            <li> You still need to be a little careful.</li>
            <li> Works well.....a little skimpier than I expected, but functional.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little lighter weight than I expected.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed since i spent more on this one than my last one that lasted 7 years</li>
            <li> Tough getting old.</li>
            <li> I have previously purchased one other that stopped working after uses in the &amp;#34;single digits&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> previous experience, I was reluctant to use the included nose trimmer tips that came with other grooming kits after trying them once.</li>
            <li> It works well and doesn&#x27;t leave those sharp little prickles that other machines do.  </li>
            <li> It was cleaned following Panasonic&#x27;s instructions (how hard can it be?)&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> It technically trims hair, but it does so sporadically and is hard to aim.</li>
            <li> You hardly notice it doing its job except for the low hum of the motor.</li>
            <li> When I got this I felt a little silly trying it out for the first time.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s obviously very poorly made and doesn&#x27;t seem likely to last very long.</li>
            <li> It seems like a cruel joke played by God upon mankind that as you get older and your vision fades somewhat, that hair starts to sprout from places where it never sprouted before while at the same time the hair on top of your head begins to thin and vanish.  </li>
            <li> the motor wearing out (due to the failure of internal springs that operate the blades).  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe that these have an average rating of four and one-half stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful in handling...smooth surface and small diameter makes it prone to slipping and dropping.</li>
            <li> dare I say it makes cutting these fun?  </li>
            <li> A completely average nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> The quality control is shoddy and the warranty period is short.</li>
            <li> My only complaint has to do with cleaning the cone blade.</li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of was in getting the product out of</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the price dropped before I received it.</li>
            <li> and I use it on average once a week to get rid of my &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Short lifespan seems to be a common failing of this device.</li>
            <li> The next time it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, and of course I&#x27;m just a few days past the 30 day return policy.</li>
            <li> One really big complaint:  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how durable it will be long term though...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an average</li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer no more than 15 times,and for how long you can use it to trim your nose or ears?</li>
            <li> For a $12 product, it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> For a $13 trimmer, it&#x27;s not worth the $11 in shipping to &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; get a replacement.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it sometimes doesn&#x27;t start.</li>
            <li> I bought this to break free from trimming the nasty nostril hair with the tiny pair of scissors found in male grooming kits.  </li>
            <li> I have dark hair</li>
            <li> One AA battery powers the sucker instead of an internal battery that dies after a year or so and isn&#x27;t replaceable.</li>
            <li> He had a cheaper model that I purchased at a drug store - not worth it because it fell apart in no time.  </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m long past caring about my looks, but hair coming out of one&#x27;s ears and nose</li>
            <li> It seems that the only complaint people have with this product is the build quality - so it&#x27;s hit or miss.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do very well at trimming.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d use it for facial hair grooming, as it&#x27;s not precise enough</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it tickles my nose, making me want to sneeze while using it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe a simple item like this is so delicate.  </li>
            <li> only negative I see</li>
            <li> Below average.</li>
            <li> Loses a star for durability, I wouldn&#x27;t want to drop it, but if you take care of it, it should last years.</li>
            <li> As you can imagine, there&#x27;s only one way to fix the immediate problem - yank!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to sound so disgusting, but you&#x27;ll thank me for not buying it and experiencing the same.</li>
            <li> This device is for those delicate areas that require pinpoint precision, and not for removing extensive amounts of hair.</li>
            <li> To late for return of this low quality product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Having your nose hairs tugged out en masse is never a fun thing.  </li>
            <li> It worked amazingly at first, after a few uses it turned useless.</li>
            <li> I use this maybe once per week on average.</li>
            <li> Not worth the hassle for return under warranty</li>
            <li> covered by warrantee but not worth the shipping price to send to panasonic.</li>
            <li> So it,s probably not worth the time and effort.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d rate it average.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only kidding, it must have lasted at least three years.</li>
            <li> All covers close/open are rather confusing and w/o a proper look, u might damage the cover.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely not worth the $.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even mess around with other ones...</li>
            <li> Has a tendency to pull sometimes and that&#x27;s not fun.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is after i use it, I have to take a Q tip and get rid of the all excess hair that sticks in my nose.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and join me in moving out of the dark ages.</li>
            <li> The item trims well, however the tip is a bit bulky / wide, so if your nostrils are narrow this presents a problem.</li>
            <li> I used this a few times and then it got harder to start.  </li>
            <li> When battery runs low, thick nose hair can (sort of) jam the cutter and cause some discomfort.</li>
            <li> Tickling makes me the nose hair even more annoying to have, though.</li>
            <li> This worked well, so much better than the micro-touch product which was worthless</li>
            <li> My local retailer stopped carrying the Panasonics, so I was forced to purchase what they had.  </li>
            <li> a love / hate review.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also have annoying nose hairs that tickled my nose on many embarrassing occasions.</li>
            <li> it a plus if you need to spend a considerable amount of time trimming so your hand or arm doesn&#x27;t get tired.  </li>
            <li> but I can see it having some difficulty with thick coarse hair.</li>
            <li> It may just be that my facial hair isn&#x27;t as thick as theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new one is slow and dull.</li>
            <li> It is serious about not just being a nose hair trimmer, but trimming other facial hair!  </li>
            <li> Even with a new battery it fails to cut off a lone hair, and instead gets jammed.  </li>
            <li> Anyone writing bad reviews must have silver-back gorillas as first cousins !!</li>
            <li> I chose this one because it was less expensive then others, but really even if I paid $30 for one it will still break within a year.</li>
            <li> But since mailing it to Texas for warranty service would cost at least half of the ten dollars I paid for it, I just tossed it.</li>
            <li> Much better than the crap I&#x27;ve purchased previously at the drug store.  </li>
            <li> Plowed down the embarrassing hair I never paid attention</li>
            <li> It allows me to trim the hairs inside my ear down to a level where they don&#x27;t make scratchy sounds against my hearing aids.</li>
            <li> and it hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> He says it cuts the nose hair down to the nub without irritation.  </li>
            <li> It worked for maybe 10 uses, then the motor started slowing down.  </li>
            <li> Power seems to fluctuate up and down for no reason.  </li>
            <li> Eats batteries and when is slows down, it pulls and plucks rather than cuts.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that the blade speed sometimes slows down and it sounds like the rotating blades are binding a bit.  </li>
            <li> I could breath noticeably easier after I cut down the thicket out of my nose.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It broke down after two months of use that too when I was abroad.</li>
            <li> I have yet to received any accidental cuts, yet trims down almost to the skin.</li>
            <li> Cuts and cleans with out bogging down.</li>
            <li> This thing works well and doesn&#x27;t pull (well, who knows 6 months down the line).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see, on down the road, how it holds up.</li>
            <li> , I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO PULL DOWN MY the hairs of the nostril.&lt;br /&gt;IT</li>
            <li> this thing trimmed everything down within</li>
            <li> If the replacement breaks down again, I will not be replacing it.</li>
            <li> Broke down after 3 uses for 5 seconds each, now I have to spend time with Panasonic support to replace it?</li>
            <li> The battery runs down without use, and needs to be replaced after every use.</li>
            <li> I may edit this review at some point for and update down the road.</li>
            <li> You can hear the motor bog down a bit</li>
            <li> Shuts off, slows down etc.</li>
            <li> However, after about six or seven uses it slowed down as if the battery was dying.  </li>
            <li> Slowed down metabolism.</li>
            <li> I use it with an Eneloop rechargeable battery, which keeps the cost down.</li>
            <li> My husband dropped his tip down the drain</li>
            <li> I was startled and dropped a piece down the drain.</li>
            <li> Within 2-3 seconds all hair is trimmed all the way down.  </li>
            <li> You heathens at Panasonic have let Nigel Reddingwood down again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m imagining this thing filmed in slo-mo with a macro chopping down the forest of unwanted hair with logs spinning off, falling and bouncing off the bottom of the sink</li>
            <li> I put my money down and the device was out of the box as soon as it arrived.  </li>
            <li> I bought 2 in case one did shut down, however.  </li>
            <li> Cuts down the ear hair.  </li>
            <li> And it always falls blade side down.</li>
            <li> I use it all the time to keep those nose hairs down.</li>
            <li> Either way,  two trimmers down.  </li>
            <li> I would be worried about it&#x27;s water resistant properties as time goes by and parts wear down.  </li>
            <li> Break down and get one.  </li>
            <li> but instead it was a step down.</li>
            <li> Trims down to the nub.  </li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t bog down.</li>
            <li> two things brought it down a star:&lt;br /&gt;1.)</li>
            <li> Would order it again if and when this one goes down.  </li>
            <li> Forget getting the trimmers that have one row of clippers going down the shaft.  </li>
            <li> This thing mows down and takes no prisoners.  </li>
            <li> Now people look in my eyes instead of drifting down to those unsightly fibers coming out of my shnoz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then they would go down and in a couple of days swell again.</li>
            <li> Other than a little tickling</li>
            <li> Wife no longer tries to pull my nose hairs!!</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands but for the money this one has them all beat!</li>
            <li> Get those unsightly nose hairs and other areas out of there!</li>
            <li> Amazon will not take it back because I&#x27;m past the return policy!  </li>
            <li> Other than a little tickling it did the job well and quickly.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had four other trimmers before and they all sucked!</li>
            <li> I have tried so many other brands that are sold in stores because I hate having to order this one, but won&#x27;t waste my money on those anymore.</li>
            <li> From what I read in the comments, this is due to the malfunctioning springs inside the little blade.</li>
            <li> Other than that it tames my nose hairs well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the little scissors, tweezers (ouch), and other electric trimmers and all of them sucked.</li>
            <li> My fear with ordering one of these was that it would occasionally pull a nose hair instead of cutting it, and those are very sensitive hairs to pull.</li>
            <li> I am so sick of stuff being made so cheaply.</li>
            <li> I have used it  minimally over the past year but blade seems to remain sharp and it causes no discomfort during use.</li>
            <li> For the hairs that lie flat against the skin inside the nostril, like mine, it has a hard time getting to them.</li>
            <li> I had a single AA battery powered small plastic Panasonic nose trimmer that lasted 30 years.  </li>
            <li> (not sure if they sell replacements), takes a single AA battery, and is waterproof.</li>
            <li> Fabulous little tool, no longer do I have ugly hairs coming out of my nose.</li>
            <li> It fits well in either hand, and is very sharp.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few of these devices from other manufactures and they worked</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this based on a few other reviews.</li>
            <li> So after making due with it for a few years, I saw the ER-GN30-K Vortex trimmer on Amazon and decided to give it a whirl (no pun intended).</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Unlike a few other hair removers for the nose this one doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint we have is that it could be a little sharper.</li>
            <li> Very sharp.</li>
            <li> Very small and quiet.  </li>
            <li> Beard and mustache hair is too thick for the trimmer&#x27;s tiny little blades and motor to handle.</li>
            <li> A little bigger than a thick marker.</li>
            <li> The blades still seem to be very sharp.</li>
            <li> One other feature I appreciate is that the unit does not sound like a jet engine when you are trimming your ears.</li>
            <li> You can clean this bad boy under running water.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure I got a bad one, but damn, this things sucks.</li>
            <li> I upgraded from my old nose hair trimmer and the difference was dramatic.  </li>
            <li> Just like my previous one, it has a tendency to not go on.</li>
            <li> I noticed a couple of the tongues on the hair guard were ever so slightly bent inward.</li>
            <li> I also got carried away with it and now have one and a half</li>
            <li> This world is an unfair and cruel one, and even the best of us can be petty sometimes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve turned this thing on and stuck it up my nose, and when I remove it, my nose has less hair in it.  </li>
            <li> Never used water on this unit, thinking that I may damaged a previous unit by cleaning the tip with water.  </li>
            <li> THIS ONE HAS LASTED LESS</li>
            <li> I used the previously published reviews to make a decision</li>
            <li> In less than four months, it stopped working.</li>
            <li> my previous nose/ear hair trimmer often pulled out the hair, causing discomfort.</li>
            <li> Takes less than a minute.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used others that cost less, but don&#x27;t work as well.  </li>
            <li> It is faster than my years-old nose hair trimmer, and it pulls and tugs less for a pain-free experience.  </li>
            <li> I have less ear and nose hair now.</li>
            <li> It seriously needs an additional trimmer attachment for \\&quot;other\\&quot; facial hair.</li>
            <li> so it takes up less counter</li>
            <li> and it was a bargain from the warehouse because the packaging was slightly compromised.</li>
            <li> less than 15 min after recieving it.</li>
            <li> it might of fell 3 and a half foot</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not exactly super hairy at 41, but it did stutter.</li>
            <li> and you&#x27;ll experience less pain.</li>
            <li> I used this for less than 6 months, probably less than 20 times.  </li>
            <li> Most of the time, it&#x27;s covered, but when I put the battery in, it suddenly smells horrible.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer was a Wahl brand</li>
            <li> I did my research on this on the web and based on previous reviews</li>
            <li> Previously, I had bought 2 nose hair trimmers from off brand companies.</li>
            <li> My previous unit was a Conair product.  </li>
            <li> I settled on this one based on my previous Panasonic and the reviews.  </li>
            <li> Never will I miss the ripping of hairs and tears in my eyes when I used my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> The instructions and control are unnecessarily complicated for such a simple device.</li>
            <li> My previous one pulled my nose hairs and did a so so job.  </li>
            <li> Requires much less dexterity than scissors.</li>
            <li> I was hoping, based on the ratings of this item, that this would out perform my previous one.</li>
            <li> but considering I paid less than $13</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s not super efficient.</li>
            <li> the odd ear hairs as well</li>
            <li> I would have given five stars if it were not for the slight tug I experience while trimming.</li>
            <li> This product lasted me less than 6 months before it died.</li>
            <li> This is quieter than the previous two I had.</li>
            <li> And at about half the cost too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMR</li>
            <li> I owned another Panasonic trimmer previously, but lost the blade while cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well, painfully pulled instead of trimmed, and fell apart the second time my husband tried to use it.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these in less than 8 months.</li>
            <li> Typical of these nose trimmers (which as I&#x27;ve moved into my 40s have become an necessity)</li>
            <li> This broke after less than 6 months of use.  </li>
            <li> They work as described and I have less nose hair for my girlfriend to complain about</li>
            <li> While this electric Panasonic nose hair trimmer does a good job at cutting man-hairs from my face, it stinks as a drink blender.</li>
            <li> so half the time I use it</li>
            <li> It also stands up so it takes up less space sitting in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Look, it&#x27;s made of plastic and uses a somewhat underpowered battery, but what do you want for less money than a movie ticket?</li>
            <li> Just like ones that I have previously used.  </li>
            <li> My previous trimmer died.  </li>
            <li> Small pieces, really complicated sounding--for a first timer like me.  </li>
            <li> The blade speed is lower and the trimming efficiency is also less.</li>
            <li> The closeness of trimming is also less than the Andis.</li>
            <li> slightly uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> It worked for about a year and a half and then just quit one day.  </li>
            <li> The barrel is slightly curved towards you so that is a plus and makes the shaver easier to use.</li>
            <li> bought this one, and it works as well as the previous unit.</li>
            <li> I typically need to trim these hairs about once a week.</li>
            <li> No complaints after using it a half a dozen times.</li>
            <li> If this one breaks in less then two years, I&#x27;ll change my ratings from four stars to something else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It stopped working after 10 times of use (previous one lasted for almost two years).</li>
            <li> and I have yet to change it after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is timid compared to a previous Panasonic model I had.</li>
            <li> perhaps half that long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and we always keep a supply of those in the house unlike odd battery types.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I expect this to be another one of my &amp;#34; collection&amp;#34; in less than six months.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The slight curve does helps.</li>
            <li> I like that it takes batteries so that it is one less thing I have to charge.  </li>
            <li> previous nose trimmer was a Norelco</li>
            <li> my previous crappy version.</li>
            <li> This one seems to run faster/quieter than previous ones.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels heavier and sturdier than previous trimmers I owned, and it operates that way too.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a slight task to contour and shape,</li>
            <li> but could of gotten it at FRY&#x27;s for less.....</li>
            <li> Took me less than 2 minutes each trimming session.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I have trouble with it</li>
            <li> you try to trim half way..</li>
            <li> It failed the same way after only one use.  </li>
            <li> Less than 24 hours from time of order.  </li>
            <li> You will need a small cup,white vinegar, pour small amount in to cup just enough to soak silver tip/spinning blade</li>
            <li> Had to return for warranty and paid for shipping which costs half of the price of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You could spend less and get something that will not do the job.  </li>
            <li> I thought mine had quit until i realized the guard was jamming the cutter from getting slightly bent</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work in less than a year.</li>
            <li> However, despite the picture of a handsome guy using it to trim his stubble, this product is TERRIBLE for facial hair.  </li>
            <li> otherwise you will have a black stain where ever you used it but don&#x27;t worry it comes off.</li>
            <li> I docked one star because, for the price, it seems odd that it doesn&#x27;t have any attachments or side burn trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for half a year now without a breakdown but</li>
            <li> slight odor when you trim you nose hairs</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, came quickly, no complaints.</li>
            <li> But the fact that you&#x27;re buying something that will only work a handful of times is ridiculous, even for this price.</li>
            <li> I dropped this thing less than one foot into the sink and it broke.</li>
            <li> The inexcusably difficult to open package is why I gave it only 2 stars.</li>
            <li> which is what my previous trimmer would often times do.  </li>
            <li> Its a bit quieter than my previous Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Panasonic sent me this trimmer after my previous Panasonic trimmer stopped working while under warranty.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Panasonic would not pay for me to ship it to there factory for repair despite this unit still being under warranty and the previous one breaking as well.</li>
            <li> I like that it is quieter than my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer, a no-name brand I bought at WM for under $20 trimmed well and lasted 7 years.</li>
            <li> But you&#x27;re causing slight vibrations to your nose hairs as they cut, so what do you expect.</li>
            <li> /&gt;(as well as Smoke Detectors),change less often, and w/Alarms about triple the life of alkaline.</li>
            <li> This clipper replaced a previous unit that I had lost.</li>
            <li> The unit stopped working after less than 10 uses.  </li>
            <li> I used it for maybe less than three months.  </li>
            <li> Removes small hairs from small areas inaccessible to scissors, such as ears canals.  </li>
            <li> I like this way this works, but can&#x27;t give it five stars because the previously one died before I thought it should.</li>
            <li> That will cost half of what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> Might have a slight oil smell at the start</li>
            <li> Lasted less than a year with weekly use.  </li>
            <li> I just threw out my two previous ones.</li>
            <li> As you get older hair starts growing in all the wrong places.  </li>
            <li> Only complain is that its not easy to trim stray hairs off the eyebrows as it&#x27;s not designed that well for that function but for everything else this one is hard to beat.  </li>
            <li> For the nose and eyebrows, it works well but does not cleanly get down close to the skin for nose hairs.</li>
            <li> For the highly rated item with a lot of sales I wasn&#x27;t skeptical at all.</li>
            <li> Very gentle while cutting the nose hairs close to the skin.  </li>
            <li> five stars in comparison to other products at about the same price and rating based on effectiveness, ease of use, lack of pain and not having weird long grey hairs growing out of my nose and ears, at least</li>
            <li> Other devices have been less effective and reliable, and some have pulled rather than cut nose hair in a gruesome fashion.  </li>
            <li> The nose hair is a little thicker, and it stopped once when a thick hair jammed it up, but it still easier takes care of the nose hair with minimal pulling, as long as I go slow.</li>
            <li> I have used a similar looking device in the past and it was not very good.</li>
            <li> But at first use, my tears started rolling down uncontrollably because instead of cutting my nose hairs, this little device was yanking and pulling on the hair instead.  </li>
            <li> My old nose hair trimmer has been going on a few years strong and after those few year of putting that thing in my nose, I was disgusted with myself.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;*the tip gets hot with cutting friction for prolong use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> He says I poke his brain, but I know that&#x27;s not true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few different trimmers over the years but they&#x27;ve either failed by design or simply not well made.</li>
            <li> It also saves you the mess since practically all the hair falls inside the tip.</li>
            <li> one negative in my view, and it&#x27;s appreciably minor, is the rotary configuration doesn&#x27;t work as well for eyebrow trimming.</li>
            <li> ONCE WE PUT AWAY THE CHRISTMAS MESS AND OPENED THEM AND PURCHASED BATTERIES, ONE DID NOT WORK.  </li>
            <li> cuz it&#x27;s always a mess storing them and so on..</li>
            <li> its lasted about 3 uses and its starting to pull hair now which is not a good thing.</li>
            <li> Not cool.  </li>
            <li> blade is sharp enough that I can&#x27;t feel any snagging or pinches, however it is on the thin side</li>
            <li> Now, one nice, (and particularly disgusting) feature of this thing is that it&#x27;s wet/dry, so whatever the moisture condition of your nose or other hairy orifices you wish to groom, you can fearlessly trim away.  </li>
            <li> Probably because so many get broken, unless Amazon is just mad at me.</li>
            <li> Very weak motor even with a new battery.  </li>
            <li> Smells a little odd...</li>
            <li> My main grudge is that it seems to be \\&quot;under powered\\&quot; and hence forth not able to cut the hairs so well as some other trimmers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not returning it as it seems absurd to return something after putting it in your nose</li>
            <li> It is less painful to quickly pull the hair out with tweezers.</li>
            <li> I just hope it holds out for some time and not break down in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I do wish the motor was just a bit stronger as it seems to get bogged down sometimes.  </li>
            <li> I kept half expecting a sharp stab of pain as a hair was ripped out painfully, but it did a good job of cutting.  </li>
            <li> I kept half expecting a sharp stab of pain as a hair was ripped out painfully, but it did a good job of cutting.</li>
            <li> but I see no evidence of o-rings in the battery compartment to ensure a water tight seal.</li>
            <li> This trimmer gets the job done and can find its way to tight spaces.  </li>
            <li> Works well inside tight places and on surfaces.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that I can get in close tight spots and don&#x27;t have to worry about getting cut.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to anyone frustrated with trying to find a nose hair trimmer that actually works well.</li>
            <li> I was very tentative and delicate with it because I expected to get a painful snag any second.  </li>
            <li> I really like the trimmer, but I had to drop the review due to the poor longevity and poor warranty.</li>
            <li> After calling, Panasonic will fix it under the two year warranty, but they won&#x27;t cover shipping to them, so it&#x27;ll be just as expensive to ship as it is to buy a new one.</li>
            <li> I was shocked by how close of a trim this product offered and how quickly it trimmed the hair.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer really seems to work well; not like the last 3 that I&#x27;ve tried and been disappointed with.  </li>
            <li> It works, but not cleanly or efficiently.</li>
            <li> but they should up the sturdiness and charge $25 for a quality product rather than selling a crap product that works but breaks easily.</li>
            <li> It does not cleanly remove the nose hair.  </li>
            <li> So I needed to get that under control, my nose was going crazy and tweezers are actually way more painful than I expected!</li>
            <li> Thick negroid hair is a different matter all together; I&#x27;ve had difficulty with other trimmers of similar design, but this trimmer cleaned me up thoroughly for both nose and ear hair (even those folded tucked-in difficult to reach areas).</li>
            <li> I just used it for about several times and it&#x27;s broken down and doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Just be a little cautious while using it</li>
            <li> The downfalls are it is a little bulky.</li>
            <li> it feels just a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K has never had a problem with my hair while I have used it to trim my nose, ear and even a little bit over my lip.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> When I put in a battery it sputtered a little bit and then stopped working.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this little fella.  </li>
            <li> If I jiggled it, it would run for a little while.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job well and uses little power so you&#x27;ll save money on batteries.</li>
            <li> I immediately tossed it in the rubbish bin when this little guy showed up on my doorstep.  </li>
            <li> There is also an included little brush.</li>
            <li> He was a little suspect when I bought it</li>
            <li> The product quality is a little &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; if you will.  </li>
            <li> He says it tickles a little but no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> Enter this neat little trimmer,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nifty little trimmer.</li>
            <li> gets everything done in my nose without any pain, does tickle a little though.</li>
            <li> But I picked up this little gem based on its reviews and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
            <li> If you are looking specifically for a &#x27;rotary&#x27; trimmer, this one has little room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT SEEMS A LITTLE UNDER&lt;br /&gt;POWERED</li>
            <li> Does the trick and keeps those little nose hairs under control.</li>
            <li> I give this little gadget five stars.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little hesitant to use this in the shower as it advertises but when I do, I will update this review.</li>
            <li> Still pulled the hairs a little...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this little guy.  </li>
            <li> Was a little unsure about this product because of the blade type.</li>
            <li> The process itself is painless, effortless, and requires so little time.</li>
            <li> This little tunnel borer takes care of that without bleeding or lawsuits</li>
            <li> And when I breath out, they do a little dance in the wind.  </li>
            <li> It disassembles for cleaning will get the job done with a little patience.  </li>
            <li> I had this for a little over two years.  </li>
            <li> The body also has a little angle to keep it from rolling out of the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> With this one you just slip in and run it around a little, and it does the job.</li>
            <li> It is a tickles a little, but no pain.</li>
            <li> I think I got a little cut in the nose from being too aggressive.</li>
            <li> Little</li>
            <li> little curly cues started emerging from my nostrils.  </li>
            <li> it does heat up a little during use but it in no way compares to the pain from waxing.</li>
            <li> I have yet to need the little cleaning brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> I bought one because I have messing with little nose scissors and it also works wonders or the hard-to-shake area under my nose, ears etc.</li>
            <li> Removes the little nose hairs with no pain</li>
            <li> I have tried this type of trimmer before as an attachment to other electric razor/trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> It was the green and grey Panasonic one and was terrible for most things.  </li>
            <li> It still causes a little discomfort but it works</li>
            <li> One doesn&#x27;t sharpen the little blades inside.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not worth the cost of the item plus shipping!  </li>
            <li> It is a little underpowered, but it works well and cleaning</li>
            <li> This little deal has helped even the odds.</li>
            <li> the little blades don&#x27;t cut, they just pull my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Little maintanance and doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> This was a little stocking stuffer for Christmas for my husband.</li>
            <li> You can hear the little hairs being trimmed away, and that&#x27;s it.</li>
            <li> but it had too little power to cut through them</li>
            <li> but I can say that if you&#x27;re one of those \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; people who have thicker than average nose hairs, this trimmer is up to the task!</li>
            <li> This nifty little device is quite an invention.</li>
            <li> Not with this little guy.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a year ago.  </li>
            <li> Literally I&#x27;m in pain the trimmer tore hair and a little skin off of my face.</li>
            <li> In fact it tickles a little.</li>
            <li> Cut my pesky little nose hairs in no time.</li>
            <li> They want $22 for a replacement little blade.  </li>
            <li> I do like how it has the little switch</li>
            <li> Even has a neat, little chute through which you flush water.  </li>
            <li> The the other 4,896 people would have destroy the site!</li>
            <li> I have purchased other brands of trimmers in the past, but none compare to this Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I did a little research and ended up purchasing this nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> However, he had a little blood afterward</li>
            <li> so I got scared of them and have made do with little scissors since.  </li>
            <li> Im Not Use To This Little Thing</li>
            <li> it looks like little dudes went up there and shaved me with razors.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that I wish I knew about this product sooner!</li>
            <li> This little trimmer works excellently.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This little gem does the job, without noise or pain.</li>
            <li> This little guy gets the job done.</li>
            <li> have to say that it lacked a little bit in it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li> Works well on the lip, nose hairs or for those little eyebrow hairs that you need to wax.  </li>
            <li> Wish my Panasonic shavers worked as well as this little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Seems to lack a little power</li>
            <li> eyebrows is a little trickier but you can do a little work with it...</li>
            <li> This little gadget does the trick.  </li>
            <li> This thing is a little louder than you might expect.</li>
            <li> Little peach fuzz?  </li>
            <li> I think the little head protector thing could be a little closer to the blade to get a closer shave.</li>
            <li> There comes a time in you life when those little hairs in the nose continue to grow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little curved</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out and hurt you like other hair trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a little while.</li>
            <li> little device takes care of that for me.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I have tried similiar products with little luck.  </li>
            <li> It takes some finessing to get all of the hairs, but with a little patience, it happens.  </li>
            <li> There is little if any pinching.</li>
            <li> Not sure what other thing to mention</li>
            <li> It has a neat little shape to it.  </li>
            <li> cause it tickled a little bit</li>
            <li> Have purchased several trimmers only to be disappointed, some cut the skin, some pulled, or simply did not cut the hair.</li>
            <li> , I was a little bit worried about being brought to tears as a gadget</li>
            <li> This is one nifty little trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have to admit that it tickles a little bit until you get used to it.</li>
            <li> recommend it in a heartbeat for clearing up those little places that might need some trimming.  </li>
            <li> what else would you want out of this little thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My wife uses it for areas where there are small, difficult to get at, unwanted individual hairs (such as eyebrows - what were you thinking?</li>
            <li> This thing is a little champion.</li>
            <li> Also, sometimes it&#x27;s pulls nose hair a little bit, so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li> Was hoping it might be a little closer to the skin line</li>
            <li> It even helps out with the eyebrows when you dont have time to pluck every little hair.</li>
            <li> I had been using a tired battery, hence my previous critical review.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is I hate when products don&#x27;t include the batteries even though it is pretty much expected.</li>
            <li> Must be very careful with the small plastic parts</li>
            <li> Although it didn&#x27;t last more than a year or two, at least it didn&#x27;t give me weird pain and unpleasant tickles in the nose.</li>
            <li> The cutting blade is safely hidden, and the only way you will potentially nick yourself is if you crush the unit against your skin.</li>
            <li> Expect you nose to be a little sore for a few days after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABM</li>
            <li> I used it like that for a few weeks (although it was a little unnerving as it sounded like I was shoving a mini wood-chipper up my nose and in my ears).  </li>
            <li> this little trimmer took the few stray fuzzies away with out all the hassle</li>
            <li> This is the only trimmer which works on my tough hair.</li>
            <li> It works great...can work around tough places your scissors or the larger trimmers cant.</li>
            <li> The issue is likely due to the small cutting slots (both units have a similar head design, which is why I ordered this one).  </li>
            <li> Works as expected and it doesn&#x27;t hurt!!!</li>
            <li> that happens, it means the blade is stuck (when this happens it makes absolutely no noise so its hard to figure out its in fact</li>
            <li> The motor is very quiet (much quieter that the Mangroomer) and they have added a little drain hole at the bottom of the base.  </li>
            <li> I thought I had bad batteries and after buying fresh ones it still wouldn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> It actually trims hair instead of pulling on them, which I know is a common complaint with these trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Comes in the infamous plastic shell packaging, so be careful when you open it.</li>
            <li> it has a cap for the cutting end and the battery is purported to last about a million years (really only two or three).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d have to awkwardly tilt the clippers to get them in my nose, flaring my nostrils the whole time.</li>
            <li> I have both a circular type and a straight edge type cutting blade.  </li>
            <li> I use this for nose and ear hair, it trims very close without cutting or pinching.</li>
            <li> As it turns out, he wasn&#x27;t just bring lazy; rather it was incompetent devices prior to his one.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Irish nose bushes which occasionally need substantial cutting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been absolute hell, painful, and not very efficient.</li>
            <li> Before I got this, I was trimming the hair by small pointy scissors, which is pretty dangerous thing to do now</li>
            <li> The head is very maneuverable, so you can get at stray hairs no matter how awkward.</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t seem like it would allow much hair to enter the cutting area.  </li>
            <li> I get sudden pain occasionally from it cutting my nose hair.</li>
            <li> I had this thing and used it about once a week, three weeks after i had it it died, don&#x27;t waste your money and time</li>
            <li> and I had few embarrassing moments when I thought I had cleaned my nose hair well</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just dead.</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Had trouble from the beginning getting it to turn on.</li>
            <li> I have tried two of these and both have stopped working within a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I had another model of Panasonic trimmer that stopped working after a few months.  </li>
            <li> It slipped from my hand and fell into the sink and left it broken and inoperable .</li>
            <li> - I guess everyone&#x27;s trying to shave a few dollars off here and there.</li>
            <li> Nobody NOSE the trouble.........</li>
            <li> It gets the job done in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> been using it for few months.</li>
            <li> I will write an update in a few months.</li>
            <li> but I can&#x27;t think of anything I&#x27;m missing in this one.</li>
            <li> For the men with wild hair in the eye brows, nose and ears, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s dead.............</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and haven&#x27;t had a problem with snagging hairs or being over powered by the nose jungle.  </li>
            <li> But after it dried, works well.  </li>
            <li> I find that it takes a few passes with the trimmer to get things trimmed to the extent I would like.</li>
            <li> On the definite plus side, I have not experienced any &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; or discomfort at all from this clipper.</li>
            <li> you will be shouting and crying in no time</li>
            <li> and he has had a few in his time.</li>
            <li> Not cheap junk.  </li>
            <li> It sputtered to a stop for a few weeks and required a firm tap to get started.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s dead.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and it gave up.  </li>
            <li> Waste of plastic.</li>
            <li> It worked well, while it worked, but ended up breaking after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> Spend a few minutes with the owners manual rather than automatically tossing it.</li>
            <li> I always used scissors, which is foolish and a waste of time.  </li>
            <li> Just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> All I know is I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now</li>
            <li> Had trouble with hair root getting irritated/infected.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s possible to get it to run faster sometimes by &amp;#34;tweaking&amp;#34; the battery cover or holder, but it just keeps getting worse over time.</li>
            <li> Bought in June and dead in March.</li>
            <li> I waited a few months before reviewing.  </li>
            <li> However after using it a few times it stopped working.</li>
            <li> It makes a lot of clicking sounds which I assume to be the hairs, but now I wish I had opted for a model that has the L.E.D. lighting because while it looks like I&#x27;ve got the job done, I still see a few strays when I&#x27;m looking in a mirror in my car in daylight.</li>
            <li> After a few moments in each nostril my schnoz was painlessly clipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The run of nose/ear clippers are cereal box prizes that fall apart after a few months.</li>
            <li> And that it is, from the few I have tried.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised for a few months.</li>
            <li> and it dropped on the floor - ONE time - and it was dead,</li>
            <li> P)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using it a few months after purchasing.</li>
            <li> I have also tried the thin reciprocating linear blade trimmers, but found myself chasing after each individual hair and that just didn&#x27;t cut it for me</li>
            <li> BUYING THIS TRIMMER WAS A WASTE OF MONEY FOR ME.</li>
            <li> the battery is nearly or completely dead.</li>
            <li> After that it was simply dead.  </li>
            <li> It broke after just a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend as a gift and the friend has informed me that after a few uses, it is no longer turning on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a bit of a gimmicky feature where you twist a ring, turn on the unit and run the tip under the water.  </li>
            <li> I like that this requires no cord or plugging in since the power cords always seem to go missing when you need them.</li>
            <li> Just dead.  </li>
            <li> Bought this on February 25, 2015, and as of May 27, 2015, it is completely dead.</li>
            <li> In a few moments all the unwanted hair is gone; no drama, no wincing, and no holding your hands in preposterous positions.  </li>
            <li> When this happens I have to hit it a few times</li>
            <li> After a few months it just stopped working altogether.</li>
            <li> This has been with me for a few years now, and works like I need it to.  </li>
            <li> Went to it and in just a few minutes the job was finished.  </li>
            <li> I shook and blew out excess water and dried it with towel.  </li>
            <li> I did get nicked once, and it was not comfortable.</li>
            <li> Now completely dead.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After figuring out this secret, I could actually breathe easier, just like after porting the intake runners on a 70 Olds.  </li>
            <li> Stopped working well after a few months.</li>
            <li> It broke after a few uses</li>
            <li> I do like how it does not pull and doesn&#x27;t leave me crying for momma by the time I&#x27;m done trimming the amazon rain forest from my nose...</li>
            <li> I never take the trouble to return things</li>
            <li> /&gt;But the round surface makes this trimmer sketchier for edging my mustache.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that he hasn&#x27;t tried a few</li>
            <li> broke in a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Just stick it in your nose and twirl it around a few times and you are done.  </li>
            <li> a couple / few times get everything.  </li>
            <li> Within a few minutes I went from looking like a hobbit to looking like a well groomed business tycoon.</li>
            <li> It was as expected  Came in late but doesn&#x27;t pull nose hairs</li>
            <li> This broke after using it a few times.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it with water yet, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it would have any trouble.  </li>
            <li> Worked for a few months and then it died.  </li>
            <li> So I can see brow stubble left behind.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different brand for about 7 years and was never really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I owned a few trimmers before</li>
            <li> but it Stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> Just a few senconds couple times a week</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic Vortex trimmer to replace a Sharper Image trimmer that I had for a few years.  </li>
            <li> I used it not only to trim the hair in my nose which was irritating me, but also to trim my mustache, and the hair in my ears.  </li>
            <li> Died in a few months.</li>
            <li> I thought the battery was dead and replaced it</li>
            <li> Have had for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I have tried using it a few times until I threw it in the trash.</li>
            <li> Rotary round is the way to go for nose hair.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Some hairs you need to go over a few times and you need to think where the hairs are and keep hitting that area.  </li>
            <li> Got it for a few dollars.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been having trouble with the on/off switch not working.</li>
            <li> It stopped working a few months after I got it.  </li>
            <li> it was completely dead.</li>
            <li> Wasted money.</li>
            <li> after a few uses the springs just bust out and pushes the blades harshly against the tip head..</li>
            <li> just keep it at my desk for everyday use.</li>
            <li> But after using this every 2 or 3 weeks for a few months, I have had zero pulled hairs.</li>
            <li> DONE WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your.</li>
            <li> There seems to be a lot of complaints about these things breaking after a few uses.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t killed this trimmer yet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of this type of hygiene device.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all plastic, so maybe something inside came lose, but it&#x27;s completely dead.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because the girlfriend kept pointing out a few stray hairs every now and again.</li>
            <li> Had been slogging along with a cruddy old trimmer that finally died a few weeks back.  </li>
            <li> Why go to all the trouble to manufacture what turns out to be</li>
            <li> Have used this for a while now and have not seen any trouble at all.</li>
            <li> You had to go over the area a few times to get the job done.</li>
            <li> UPDATE AFTER FEW MONTHS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes once or twice a week prevents me from looking like a walking hairball.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks, used it a few times-</li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> The ergonoic design is not comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> Imagine my dismay when one day (after a few weeks of use and cleaning in accordance with the directions) the trimmer did not turn on.</li>
            <li> The narrow shape allows it to reach the caverns at the tip of my nose.</li>
            <li> I had a cheap trimmer from some grooming kit I got at a drug store and it was crap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now, and used it on nose, ear, and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I cleaned and dried the head unit and still nothing.  </li>
            <li> With the exception of those few moments, it cut well.  </li>
            <li> With the exception of those few moments, it cut well.  </li>
            <li> they just are not available..</li>
            <li> I have had several cheaper models and was not really happy with them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just dead.  </li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s dead.  </li>
            <li> after a few uses the springs just bust out and pushes the blades harshly against the tip head..</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic nose hair weeder finally failed after 12 years.</li>
            <li> at this price, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I kept going for a few years.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this toy.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I thought the batteries were dead</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trim every day and this thing is dead in a month.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with warranty, waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> Takes a few passes, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Of course, you can just figure it out after a few cleanings.</li>
            <li> This nose trimmer from when I received it acted like the batteries I used were almost dead.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit to replace a dead Wahl trimmer</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on some overpriced tool.</li>
            <li> Is not Comfortable to use</li>
            <li> It was loud and did a lousy job.  </li>
            <li> I have used this a few times &amp; it works well.</li>
            <li> The trimmer rinses out in a few seconds under running water.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this now for a few weeks and it works quite well.</li>
            <li> This thing is like a lawn mower through hair, no pulling, and gets everything in just a few passes.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s totally dead.  </li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few uses.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are a few downsides:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I understand some reviews were harsh on this product</li>
            <li> Some are shabbily made and fail early.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve owned a few.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s been a few months since I&#x27;ve had it</li>
            <li> For the price this something you can buy a few of and leave them in your travel bag, drawer, and your vacation home</li>
            <li> fades again after a few hairs.  </li>
            <li> Yanks a few hairs out.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE ALREADY WASTED MY CASH ,</li>
            <li> Some folks complain that it stops working after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> so its not secure but not flying around my luggage.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for a few months now</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull and does the job in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> and yes it was totally dead.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than tiny nose hairs blowing around in my nose as I breathe.  </li>
            <li> Item broke after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> Misses a few here and there.</li>
            <li> Have to go over a few times.</li>
            <li> stopped working after few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and used it a few times.</li>
            <li> After a few uses the blade popped out of its place.</li>
            <li> Been wanting/needing these for a few years...</li>
            <li> I purchased this in July 2012, dead by December - changed the battery, no help.</li>
            <li> Takes a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I gave up on electric nose hair trimmers a few years ago.  </li>
            <li> if you put this in your travel kit, remove the battery, or run the risk of arriving at your destination with a dead battery.</li>
            <li> I cannot believe that Panasonic will put their name on such a poor piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and used it for a few times in a year.</li>
            <li> Conveniently, it was a few days after the return period from Amazon expired.</li>
            <li> but it works painfully slow at the slowest speed imaginable for two weeks till the the Japanese steel loses it&#x27;s edge.</li>
            <li> it is not the smallest thing out there, but it is not huge either.    </li>
            <li> , dried everything out with paper towels, air dried it for a few days, put a brand-new AA in, fired it up, and - boom - another battery leaking toxic fumes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not a huge ding,</li>
            <li> It has a small part that can go down the drain.</li>
            <li> Just don&#x27;t let the small piece inside fall down the sink.</li>
            <li> ** crack and every where else that you did not expect, it&#x27;s like terraforming after a certain age, WTF!</li>
            <li> so you may not know when it&#x27;s functioning less than usual</li>
            <li> With small electronics like this, I think that half the quality is determined by the durability of the item and</li>
            <li> Less than $13!</li>
            <li> What keeps breaking, a small black plastic nub (I find it rattling in the battery compartment and once that occurs, that is the end of the it.)</li>
            <li> Less room for error (and pain!).</li>
            <li> He had reported that other trimmers pulled on hair and was painful, but that this model is not irritating.</li>
            <li> FYI guys, don&#x27;t use it on other parts of your body that are hard to reach.</li>
            <li> I have used several other brands of nose trimmers and while this one is not perfect, it is one of the betteer ones that I have used.</li>
            <li> After a short use of once or twice, the haircut starts to get sloppy.</li>
            <li> is something that, left unchecked, will make it difficult to swim, sky-dive, and can, in extreme cases, interfere with eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No pain in trimming, and it gets all the hairs that are hard to get to with other trimmers.</li>
            <li> A litter bit hard to get everything to come apart for cleaning,  but other than that it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Although it does a very good job cutting the hair in nose &amp; ear canal, the cutting area is very narrow, this making it difficult to cut hair on the ear lobe, for example.</li>
            <li> After hating 2 different drug store models that only resulted in shorter ugly little black hairs, I resorted to using scissors...</li>
            <li> but this is common with other brands as well.</li>
            <li> It works, but the cutting head has only a small opening, so it takes multiple passes to get everything.  </li>
            <li> a month - blades are sharp and there&#x27;s no catching.</li>
            <li> seems to have common traits as other panasonic nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After going through some other reviews, this seems to be a common problem with this model.</li>
            <li> Other units I have used needed battery changes at least weekly.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull any of my hair when cutting and even though I press pretty hard , no cuts.</li>
            <li> The tip&#x27;s small openings are somewhat less effective than an exposed cutting mechanism, but also less painful.  </li>
            <li> Plain and simple--the product didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
            <li> One of them just plain didn&#x27;t work 50% of the time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of trimmers that clog up, goop up, or just plain work like poop.</li>
            <li> We followed the directions and nothing....meaning that this little trimmer removed very little if any hair.</li>
            <li> However, after the first few seconds, you realize it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> It works but always feels like it will give out at any moment.... not strong.</li>
            <li> First time using it, it had a metallic smell to it, also it feels real cold and naked</li>
            <li> but just after a few uses it does begin to pull which can be pretty painful</li>
            <li> This trimmer can cut the hair really close to your skin without you being anxious about it cutting you.</li>
            <li> The con about this product is that it has very less power is does not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> issue he had was getting into the tip of his nose (an awkward direction) and some hair was cut short, but not completely removed.</li>
            <li> There has been no easy way to trim ear hair.</li>
            <li> Should be careful when dismantling and assembling the parts before n after cleaning, as the parts in the nib are delicate and small.</li>
            <li> Very odd.</li>
            <li> Not easy to follow instructions for use and cleaning.</li>
            <li> the battery contact is not good, thus it takes a few tries every time you want to use it</li>
            <li> is not easy to use .&lt;br /&gt;Battery not included&lt;br /&gt;Razor not included.&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not in the trimming business to remove all my nose hair, but had to remove a few irritating ones that grew too long.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, they do not - so you need to order a new one when the blades get dull.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this type of trimmer, was not sure how it could trim anything without exposed blades.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been having this about 2-3 months and nothing major has gone wrong</li>
            <li> 2 months later it was real dull, heads needed replaced.  </li>
            <li> No more being tickled by little hairs.</li>
            <li> Slick little trimmer.</li>
            <li> This was so much quicker and less painful.</li>
            <li> The instructions for dry cleaning were complicated compared to the wet method.</li>
            <li> And every time, you can hear the motor slow down as it struggles through each stiff hair.  </li>
            <li> First when it lost rpm speed I thought I had the bad battery.</li>
            <li> Manual is pretty bad, but works as advertised.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this trimmer I was shocked at how well it trimmed and on just 1 AA battery.  </li>
            <li> Pretty painful.  </li>
            <li> but I have had a few nose hair trimmers in the past.</li>
            <li> The head/cutting internals broke after three uses (and a few days past the return period).</li>
            <li> If you are tired of pesky long nose hair, get it.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few others in the past but nothing comes close.</li>
            <li> Nothing worse then long nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Usually these types of trimmers yank a few hairs bringing a tear or two to my eyes.</li>
            <li> the only complaint i have about it, is that it&#x27;s kinda weak when it comes to power.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these in the past.  </li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased a few ultra-cheap nasal weed whackers and they just weren&#x27;t up to the job.</li>
            <li> And I ahev used a few in the past</li>
            <li> Not sure what happened, it was just dead.</li>
            <li> Not bad for the price but annoying to have to keep replacing.</li>
            <li> but then quickly slow down to a stop within 3-4 seconds.</li>
            <li> I found it a little difficult to get the battery cover back on as there are no lines or dots to use</li>
            <li> it, but prepare to adjust to those little hairs looking &amp; feeling weird if you don&#x27;t use it constantly.</li>
            <li> The cutting action is acceptable, but I am not excited by the construction quality.</li>
            <li> For an older guy&#x27;s trimmer, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> After hating 2 different drug store models that only resulted in shorter ugly little black hairs, I resorted to using scissors OUCH!!</li>
            <li> that didn&#x27;t scratch my nostrils raw.  </li>
            <li> I need a new cutting blade.  </li>
            <li> This one, after a couple weeks, lost it steam (batteries are new) and cutting sharpness.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know they only last 1-2 years and have to be replaced or the blades get bad.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very horrible because it wasted more battery than it did work.</li>
            <li> I did and having absolutely no nose hair is almost as annoying as having too much.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this is a common problem and related to poor quality control.</li>
            <li> /&gt;this is a common problem and related to poor quality control.  </li>
            <li> It gets ALL the hairs; from the little nooks in front, to way up in there!  </li>
            <li> After about five minutes with this little thing, I can now flare my nostrils with no shame!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s probably not worth the time and money to go through them to get one that works!!</li>
            <li> so she could trim those little hairs that we ladies grow on our face as we age!  </li>
            <li> That is actually a little embarrassing if you ask me!  </li>
            <li> This little guy is a champ!  </li>
            <li> last Trimmer is Twelve years old and was purchased at a Base Exchange where I had very little variety to chose from!&lt;br /&gt;Yet</li>
            <li> Well, but, I mean, less strandy-like.  </li>
            <li> then I dropped in on the counter a little too hard and it never worked again.</li>
            <li> Not very effective, leaves small hair intact.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Second off, the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough and instead of cutting the forest in my nose, it pulled out the trees....</li>
            <li> I have bought a few similar type of trimmers\shavers in the past only to be sadly disappointed after realizing how useless they were as they wouldn&#x27;t work properly or like they were advertised to do.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why men grow hair in their ears when it falls off their head, but this little tool takes care of, at least, the ear problem.</li>
            <li> As some negative comment on ear hair trimming, I was a little concerning about this Panasonic Trimmer.</li>
            <li> it wouldn&#x27;t cut any hairs and had very little power to it.</li>
            <li> Very little maintenance required.</li>
            <li> very little noise...works well.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done with very little drama.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done and takes up very little space</li>
            <li> Does not pull and cuts with very little effort.</li>
            <li> It is tough to tell when that is happening until you realize you have to work harder to get the job done.</li>
            <li> It works well for making sure I don&#x27;t have a bunch of terrifying thick black tree trunks poking out of my nostrils, threatening to claw people in the face who are unfortunate enough to have a face-to-face conversation with me.</li>
            <li> , I was a little disappointed with the feel of the whole thing.</li>
            <li> Works a little slow compared to a past unit I had, even with a fully charged battery.</li>
            <li> It got consistently high ratings here, and elsewhere, and no one ever complained about the blades pulling at the hair instead of cutting it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Much like Indiana Jones bad guys must fear spinning mechanisms, so now must my nose hair fear the Panasonic ER-GN30-K.</li>
            <li> No yanking on hair or anything painful and gets very close when</li>
            <li> Too bad it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t look like a crazy old science professor.</li>
            <li> I am not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several over the years and they were all lousy, causing pain when they pull on the hair.</li>
            <li> but I am not sure of the longevity, although there are no signs of it breaking yet.</li>
            <li> no more comments from my fiance</li>
            <li> otherwise the initial vibration is a bit startling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use a cheaper device in the past to trim my nasal hair.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic that failed.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> I have owned manual trimmers in the past.</li>
            <li> It does run a bit noisy for a small device that runs on a 1.5V AA battery.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure but either way should not do that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and compact</li>
            <li> This has worked well for him for the past month.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I am not sure why my wife chose this model</li>
            <li> in again against the cutting surface every time it is taken apart, if so then taking it apart frequently will shorten the blade life.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just not sexy.</li>
            <li> Small size and works well.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I will be replacing this with a small &#x27;reciprocating&#x27; trimmer.</li>
            <li> small in size</li>
            <li> It is small, portable, battery operated, and gets rid of those oddball hairs, wherever they may be.</li>
            <li> Reading over some of the mediocre reviews reveals that people have had it snag on their facial hair, so this reinforces what I just said.     </li>
            <li> , no more nose afro.</li>
            <li> In mere seconds, its all gone, and not just shorter, but still there... but actually gone.  </li>
            <li> No problem cleaning it--takes up small space for storage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it would be used for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> Dead!</li>
            <li> Small.  </li>
            <li> Not much more you could ask for.</li>
            <li> What a waste!</li>
            <li> I had another one in the past and it pull and</li>
            <li> /&gt;His first time using it to trim his mustache it caught on a hair and kept spinning without cutting the hair!  </li>
            <li> Not sure why anybody would want to use it on their eyebrows though as the packaging directs.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Using the thing to cut ear hair is like having a small jet engine in your ear.</li>
            <li> HE HAS HAD A COUPLE IN THE PAST</li>
            <li> No pain or excessive noise.</li>
            <li> No more sore nose for me resulting from pulling those</li>
            <li> I have purchased the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; models in the past.  </li>
            <li> not overwhelmingly so&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I hate to post this, because it sounds like when they work they work well, but I think it&#x27;s worth knowing that there may be some quality issues.</li>
            <li> A few friends have bought this on my recommendation!</li>
            <li> Gets in places you can not get to with a small scissors.</li>
            <li> This has helped me in ways my ordinary razer couldn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> fact that the motor glitch could and should be repaired means no more than 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I used Amazon Prime shipping and got it in 2 days and on time as usual.</li>
            <li> Also includes a small cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;Takes time to trim - hence rated one star below.</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon delivered on time.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like these trimmers, but this one surpasses all expectations.  </li>
            <li> And now it is past Amazon&#x27;s time limit to return this, so I am stuck with it.</li>
            <li> No more stranglers to worry about.</li>
            <li> Not the usual Panasonic toughness that I&#x27;m used too.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think with today&#x27;s trend of (faux) authenticity and history (hipsters, safety razors, old-timey beards, small batch rye, etc)</li>
            <li> Small and efficient and does what is claimed...</li>
            <li> No more walrus</li>
            <li> Waste of money!</li>
            <li> Not sure why but this does not work as well as I thought it would.</li>
            <li> and the end was open making it a bit scary.</li>
            <li> Nose hairs are a thing of the past without yanking hairs</li>
            <li> I have bought numerous nose trimmers in the past, some expensive, but was never completely satisfied with any of them.  </li>
            <li> I thought it was just another trimmer like the ones I had bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> It is small and well manufactured.</li>
            <li> no more &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> then it usually kicks in.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s clogged</li>
            <li> ears, nose, eye brows any where you need a small trimmer</li>
            <li> You can hear the cutting action.  </li>
            <li> Not exactly sure what that was for anyway.  </li>
            <li> Therefore I have used items like this in the past.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for technology used pluck em out now no more.</li>
            <li> Small too so takes up no room.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, since receiving this the same day we ordered it, I have had no complaints.</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say</li>
            <li> before i got this this, i use small scissors.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these not really sure it would do the job.</li>
            <li> that water doesn&#x27;t enter the battery case (not sure if it will, just being cautious).</li>
            <li> No more tickly nose hair.</li>
            <li> No Porsche for me, but no more unsightly ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li> But no more.</li>
            <li> and I am not sure if it cuts anymore.</li>
            <li> Works well, no hassel, not sure why i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars; probably because.... I don&#x27;t like trimming nose hair period..</li>
            <li> Not sure if they degraded the quality of this product.</li>
            <li> and it was LAME and did not last.  </li>
            <li> No more hairs hanging out of our nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does not pull or irritate your nose when you are trimming and doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of small hairs in your nose for you to sneeze out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is small, and needs one AA battery, were the device it self is water proof.</li>
            <li> No more eating nose hairs 👍</li>
            <li> No more nose hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not magical, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> It is a mediocre product for shaving your back.</li>
            <li> It is a mediocre product for shaving your back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what evolutionary function this serves, but I needed to get a handle on it.</li>
            <li> I used to trust panasonic products but now no more</li>
            <li> Like this small appliance.</li>
            <li> no more yucky hair where they don&#x27;t belong</li>
            <li> No more worrying about having hairs ripped out by the root or waking the family with a noisy device.</li>
            <li> the Wahl and Remington models I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Before getting the Panasonic, I would just manually pull out my nose hairs, usually with my fingers.  </li>
            <li> My last rotary trimmer lasted a couple of years and I would venture to say that if this fails after a couple of years, i would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a bit small, but it does the trick.</li>
            <li> If you want an in-expensive nose hair, ear hair or uni-brow trimmer for a small price this is your trimmer.  </li>
            <li> No more nagging about the nose hair.  </li>
            <li> No more problems after I have adjusted the connector tabs.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s the battery connection or just what.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what a 5 star nose and ear hair trimmer should look like (nor is it on my bucket list), but... if you need to get the job done and you&#x27;re on a budget - this one works.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll see if it lasts longer than the usual year a nose hair trimmer lasts (with infrequent use).</li>
            <li> It seems a difficult thing to find a facial hair trimmer that works.</li>
            <li> Beats using a small pair of sissors</li>
            <li> Not sure why you&#x27;d need two.  </li>
            <li> Beats the small scissors</li>
            <li> Since it&#x27;s so small, so is the collection area.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s curved shape is greate because it prevents the unit from rolling on a small shelf or from the sink to the ground - genius.</li>
            <li> Cleans the hairs out of the nostrils so no more pesky hairs.  </li>
            <li> Gets rid of all my nose hairs, no pain and no more stray hairs.</li>
            <li> I have bought in the past.  </li>
            <li> no more fuzzy.</li>
            <li> as it performs good...then later, by design it fails....)  </li>
            <li> trimmer is small but well constructed.  </li>
            <li> Was skeptical until I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Construction is not metal, but feels solid to hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Lasted 6 weeks, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> I wondered if it would cut the inside of my nostrils or pull the sensitive hairs it was cutting.  </li>
            <li> Multiple batteries tried, all failed.</li>
            <li> I have a at least four of these in the past few years and all of them were sub-par (</li>
            <li> I got this thinking its like those ordinary ones in the stores.</li>
            <li> No more nose hairs in this nostril.  </li>
            <li> Waste of money !</li>
            <li> Even at this low price, this is a FAIL.</li>
            <li> It is small, so it fits anywhere in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> No more nostril stares for that ole guy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple nose trimmers in the past.</li>
            <li> I was tired of cutting my ears with my regular shaver and having to deal with embarrassing scabs on my ears when in public.</li>
            <li> It was difficult to open.  </li>
            <li> No more bleeding noses.</li>
            <li> It works, not outstanding t.hough</li>
            <li> No more nose hair, ear hair, excess whiskers,</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of them in the past 6 months.  </li>
            <li> so I’m not sure if this is a design change</li>
            <li> No wires, waterproof, small, hence transportable, runs on 1 AA battery.</li>
            <li> of course it was past the return policy timeline.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it failed me utterly recently, when the battery started leaking acid and the trimmer stopped working.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If the blades were included in the shipment they were not an obvious inclusion in the package and we now have a completely useless trimmer since a bladeless trimmer is no longer a trimmer...would be helpful to know how to buy &#x27;replacement&#x27; blades.</li>
            <li> which i am not sure of yet.</li>
            <li> Not elegant, but why should it be when it is in your nose?  </li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 trimmers in the past and none of them seemed to work well.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is no more to add.  </li>
            <li> Comes in a small package</li>
            <li> Not sure if this is a battery issue or product issue yet.  </li>
            <li> I can fix sometimes by jiggling and fooling around with it, but usually I end up replacing the rechargeable (eneloop) battery.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Obviously, I am not able to comment on longevity, but unit is warranted for 2 years parts and labor.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money folks!</li>
            <li> Well contoured so you can access small areas,like your ear canal and your nostrils.</li>
            <li> I have a spare in the glove box since it&#x27;s so small</li>
            <li> dont even need to use water just remove the head and blow on it to get the small pieces of hair that might be in there out..</li>
            <li> it will be and my grandfather is only unfortunate that he did not have one of these.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems silly to worry about nasal and ear hairs, but I actually look forward to trimming them with this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for ear and nose hair which I find disgusting as he is 61.This is much better than anything he has&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not better if you want to use it on your sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li> Panasonic device is not built to last &amp; it appears it was designed to fail at a preset time</li>
            <li> (it sounds silly) and that&#x27;s a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the return policy is only 30 days</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the blade(s) had simply fallen off</li>
            <li> Not sure if the distraction is what helps, or if the hair being pushed out</li>
            <li> Cleaning it can be a bit on the difficult side, but it does well enough at trimming</li>
            <li> No more worry about the snout</li>
            <li> I have purchased in the past.  </li>
            <li> The blade comes off and is replaceable if it fails later.</li>
            <li> you can wash the tip, its small and portable.</li>
            <li> I have not heard any complaints from him and he usually shares what he thinks ;</li>
            <li> One of the few things I&#x27;ve purchased of late that does what it says and how it says without me having to finagle something.</li>
            <li> and it is small.</li>
            <li> It is unbelievable</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, efficient.  </li>
            <li> Small and versatile.</li>
            <li> The first one I bought, a Wahl model# 5560, really disappointed me.  </li>
            <li> It never pulls the hair, any hair that gets in it&#x27;s way is a dead duck, PERIOD!  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if its a downfall with the product or just how often he uses it</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this means the pain and anguish of dying battery will one day lead to an inevitable bloodbath.  </li>
            <li> Not sure what you can say about an inexpensive device like this.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s together again.  </li>
            <li> But the overall &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of my nose hair is now weird.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep it and HOPE I can find batteries, find out how to insert them and try to resolve no more China stuff.</li>
            <li> only &amp;#34;warning&amp;#34; I&#x27;d give is that the first couple of times I used it, it felt almost like it was shocking my nose</li>
            <li> used to use traditionally small scissors to cut my noise hairs</li>
            <li> Not sure I want to test the wet/dry</li>
            <li> I usually shake it out but maybe rinsing it would be easier.</li>
            <li> Not really sure what thats all about</li>
            <li> No more pain.</li>
            <li> Bought two waiting for this to fail but the second one is still in its plastic shell.</li>
            <li> It has to be taken apart and this is usually a project.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on</li>
            <li> I also tried it for small touch ups on the face and want one for myself.</li>
            <li> No more hair in my nose and ear.</li>
            <li> so im not sure how that will work.</li>
            <li> That took quite a while to get used to (not sure I have</li>
            <li> worried it would dig into my skin or even worse bog down in my nose and get trapped in the hair.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I&#x27;m not a hairy guy, but the occasional tickle in my nose drives me CRAZY.  </li>
            <li> the job advertised but very slow compared with other models I have owned.</li>
            <li> Sad I even need one, getting old sucks!</li>
            <li> This one is no better or worse than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> I ended up getting it to “work” by bending the blade guards up a little allowing the blade to spin but it made an awful noise and got hot after &amp;#60;30 sec of use.  </li>
            <li> Vortex Cleaning&amp;#34; claim is a little ridiculous.</li>
            <li> read other reviews reflecting concerns about leaving hairs behind and not being efficient.  </li>
            <li> The quality is poor, be careful if you drop it, going to burn your nose!</li>
            <li> It may have cut me a little bit, which was irritating for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> due  to poor  quality  .</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any pulling as I had in other trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Sometimes it misses a few hairs, and for some reason, can have trouble with getting those lone hairs that are crazy long.</li>
            <li> Seems a little fragile, I am always afraid of breaking it.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have commented on the poor design of this unit.</li>
            <li> The Remington was a complete disappointment and seemed really dull.  </li>
            <li> It does the job, doesn&#x27;t hard, but it is as ordinary as ordinary can be.</li>
            <li> Too bad it died in less than two months after only being used a few times.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was deathly afraid that this thing would pull a really thick nose hair and cause me to scream, but I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I have tried different ones before and bought a different style for my husband that was so flimsy and basicly worthless.  </li>
            <li> It worked moderately well for trimming nose hair, but left annoying stubble.</li>
            <li> The result is that it pulls hair more the cutting it, which can be/is painful?  </li>
            <li> However, the motor is very weak and takes a long time when trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li> not very good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at fixing things up to use it.  </li>
            <li> You have had some of these made years ago that were not very good.  </li>
            <li> The cutting heads stay cleaner and I haven&#x27;t had to disassemble it to clean the cutting heads, as I had to with past trimmers without the drain hole.  </li>
            <li> This spring is so small that it can be hard to reposition or even see if you don&#x27;t know</li>
            <li> I got the product, put new batteries and was very disappointed that it was running on a very low power as if it was going dead!</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t get it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Based on the average of the comments it seems you have a 1 in 10 or 2 in 10 chance of getting a poorly built trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I also have some weird lip hair in strange places.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and was so disappointed to find out that while this worked really well for about one month until it didn&#x27;t work at all....</li>
            <li> Nothing hurts worse than getting a nose hair tangled in this trimmer due to slow motor.</li>
            <li> No good, waste of money and time.</li>
            <li> I do have some weird long stray hairs that poke out every now and then from my nose</li>
            <li> I bought the less expensive version that lasted less then 3 months.</li>
            <li> I have unusually tough nose hairs and have tried several nose hair trimmers in the past and have been left disappointed.</li>
            <li> nothing worse than smiling and having nose hairs come tickling their way down to say hello.</li>
            <li> It was broken after less 10 uses.</li>
            <li> Once I received the trimmer I was a little skeptical as it did look like the previous trimmers I had bough from the superstores.</li>
            <li> Every single one of them failed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;First time using I went for it and was bleeding pretty bad from my nose and was extremely uncomfortable for a few days because of pressing the trimmer up against the inside of my nose...</li>
            <li> I used to be a crude repulsive hairy man with few social skills.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few over years and that combo is VERY hard to find.  </li>
            <li> Takes care of the hard to get a hairs.</li>
            <li> It gets works on skin creases of face where electric shaver has a hard time.</li>
            <li> press hard against the inside of your nose</li>
            <li> If you are feeling the pinching of hair then you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> If I press to hard, when re-seating it, the blade won&#x27;t cut as close.  </li>
            <li> it pulls nose hairs so if you have a hard time of waking up in the morning just turn this on and stick it in your nose.</li>
            <li> How hard can it be?  </li>
            <li> Hope it lasts (i.e. that the blades don&#x27;t get too dull, too soon).  </li>
            <li> Hard to avoid the temptation.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to always answer.</li>
            <li> was to pull the trimmer really hard and to rip out the hair.  </li>
            <li> But, I bought 2 of them and it is really hard to find one that works this well.  </li>
            <li> I was worried it would be hard to use and would &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; by snagging or clipping skin.  </li>
            <li> Hardly any power.  </li>
            <li> Hard to find a product specifically for nose hair.  </li>
            <li> was to insert it too hard into my nasal cavity.</li>
            <li> At the $10 price point, it&#x27;s hard not to recommend this for all you unkempt men out there.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to reach through razor.</li>
            <li> You can hardly even hear it running.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t yank your hair out, which is hard to find in any electric razor or trimmer.</li>
            <li> , I wish I could get replacement blade as it has gotten dull, and a replacement head as I dropped it</li>
            <li> When allowed to get dull it can be uncomfortable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It gets into hard to reach places.  </li>
            <li> I had clippers that were getting dull.</li>
            <li> gets to all those hard to trim spots &amp; does the job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hygiene tool to replace one that I suspected may have been getting dull.</li>
            <li> HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO MAKE A BATTERY OPERATED NOSE HAIR TRIMMER.</li>
            <li> How hard is it to make a nose hair trimmer that works?</li>
            <li> how hard it is to find quality, well-built products these days.  </li>
            <li> Sounds like a slam dunk, what can be so hard?</li>
            <li> Cuts close and gets the hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> I did not realize how dull the blades were.  </li>
            <li> i would think all would when they get dull anyways.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm for cleaning up those hard to get to places..</li>
            <li> Either way, shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, just don&#x27;t press too hard.</li>
            <li> My one concern is what happens when the blades dull or what not</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just the blades going dull</li>
            <li> but I presume it should not be too hard.</li>
            <li> He needed something to get in to those hard to reach places like his ears and nose.  </li>
            <li> You would be hard pressed to beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> I find it has a hard time getting ear hair.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding a product that would take care of the nose and ear hairs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to replace it, but hard to reach the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> you hardly feel it.(unlike</li>
            <li> Although maybe I guess I have some hard hairs</li>
            <li> and I found out the hard way</li>
            <li> and my friends will give me a hard time about it</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s hard to get them all and keep up with  </li>
            <li> and I wonder if the blade is getting dull.</li>
            <li> But the idea that I have to use a certain amount of words in my review is stupid.</li>
            <li> Not worth it!!!</li>
            <li> (Or at least if they do, I didn&#x27;t make it past page 10 of their site&#x27;s ridiculous 100</li>
            <li> After a few minutes the end heats up and can be a little uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> So far I have nothing to say bad about this product.</li>
            <li> At least that&#x27;s the case with me.</li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t cost alot and now I know why .</li>
            <li> , just seems like it isn&#x27;t built for longevity which is why it loses two stars.  </li>
            <li> This one protects your skin and only let&#x27;s the hairs into the cutting area.</li>
            <li> This one looks like a response to all of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Signs of age (at least those) are now gone.</li>
            <li> No more cutting the inside of my nose with a pair of scissors or grossing people out with long hairs hanging out of my proboscis.</li>
            <li> At least for my nose, I could feel the trimmed hairs for a couple of days afterwards.  </li>
            <li> DO NOT get it anywhere near your beard unless you like being painfully violated.</li>
            <li> Not my proudest purchase, but being in my late 40&#x60;s I gave in.</li>
            <li> However, the shipping was too late.</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t complained about it, so I&#x27;m guessing it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> it SUCKS.  </li>
            <li> That just sucks.</li>
            <li> But it gets the job done so far without any painful catches.</li>
            <li> Blade inside cone is delicate and can fall out.</li>
            <li> It only does a minimum job cutting ear &amp; nose hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least 5-6 nose hair trimmers</li>
            <li> we are so pretentious, almost embarrassing.</li>
            <li> Setting it up was slightly confusing</li>
            <li> This is the response I got from the Panasonic personnel: SUCKS  </li>
            <li> This trimmer jammed, wouldn&#x27;t run, then randomly unjammed and yanked the hairs out with some skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve made a mistake of cutting mine too much and breathing through my nose felt uncomfortable for a while.</li>
            <li> I wish the cutting surface were bigger or had an alternative cutting area for larger areas.</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have sideburns or mustache, at least for now.</li>
            <li> , it was a delicate process</li>
            <li> It loses one star.</li>
            <li> it sucks it pulls the hair.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t understand why anyone would prefer the manual trimmers which have similar cutting head designs.  </li>
            <li> Even with this complaint, I&#x27;d still buy it again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> And, three stars or lower would be downright dishonest.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Normally, I like mentioning about the negative aspects of the items I review as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any negative thing about this product</li>
            <li> I use it at least once every 1-2 weeks just on my nasal passages.  </li>
            <li> off, the way this was described (at least the way I read it)</li>
            <li> I accidentally dropped it once, but that was enough to deform the cutting unit so that it no longer works.  </li>
            <li> or it&#x27;s a shoddy piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy this product because of some negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> This thing sucks.</li>
            <li> I was concerned because of some of the negative comments it has.</li>
            <li> I had an aolder Panasonic trimmer from the late 90&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I took the cutting head apart and tried to re-adjust it, but no matter what, I couldn&#x27;t get it back working the way it was.</li>
            <li> Well, by the time we bought batteries and tried the trimmer it was too late to return.</li>
            <li> works well been using this for at least 6 months.</li>
            <li> I got this item in late January of 2014 and it was DOA by the end of 2014.</li>
            <li> My father-in-law saw a list of the worst possible Christmas gifts and decided nearly all of them were things he wanted.</li>
            <li> I have had several trimmers for the years and all but the Panasonic were disappointing.  </li>
            <li> The one complaint - it could be a closer cut.</li>
            <li> So, it&#x27;s too late to return it</li>
            <li> least that&#x27;s what my neighbor told me before he borrowed</li>
            <li> I have not spoken to him lately</li>
            <li> /&gt;2-not enough close cutting leaving hair in the side of nostril etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> WE FIGURED THAT THEY BOTH WERE NOT WORKING, IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETURN.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims, but not spectacularly.</li>
            <li> The openings at the cutting edge are too short.  </li>
            <li> Growing up sucks.</li>
            <li> It works well for personal grooming, with no pulling or cutting of skin.  </li>
            <li> My last one cracked on the cutting head and had to be replaced.  </li>
            <li> So there&#x27;s that at least.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe all the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> I read all the negative reviews before buying but none of those reviews can be applied to this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Late shipment with no notice</li>
            <li> I called it that because it finally started pulling out the hairs instead of cutting them.</li>
            <li> I makes the ugly old man hairs go away.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative from my husband.</li>
            <li> Second, it seems to miss the nose hairs that need cutting.  </li>
            <li> this was a common problem.</li>
            <li> Others just don&#x27;t cut hair as they should or are designed for use by someone with at least three hands.  </li>
            <li> Bought this is late November.  </li>
            <li> Tried to return to Amazon, but, of course, too late.  </li>
            <li> I purchased despite some negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Duh</li>
            <li> But it sucks battery life, just a bit too faster than what I would like.  </li>
            <li> sucks now</li>
            <li> I tried this thing out and it will cut hair, at least for</li>
            <li> The removeable blade is made of part plastic and part metal (the metal part does the actual cutting).  </li>
            <li> At least it didn&#x27;t cost a lot, otherwise I&#x27;d be upset.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to be a common problem, but I just thought I&#x27;d share my experience with it.</li>
            <li> It pulls and rips like it hates you because you&#x27;re late with its money.</li>
            <li> Research on the internet reveled this to be a common problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for at least a year and use it about once a  month.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll keep it but not really thrilled with it.  </li>
            <li> Have tried a lot of inexpensive trimmers and they failed quickly or simply worked poorly...</li>
            <li> (at least they tell me instead of letting me walk around clueless)</li>
            <li> He hasn&#x27;t complained about it yet.</li>
            <li> and it still ran slow.  </li>
            <li> Works well but just a tad bit slow power.</li>
            <li> I use it on my boyfriend to trim his thick and fast-growing nose hair.</li>
            <li> and my hand got tired before the batteries dead.  </li>
            <li> Even when rotating slowly it still does it.</li>
            <li> This device is kinda slow</li>
            <li> Soumds slow but does the job.</li>
            <li> , it was also slow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks now, twice a week, and the battery and motor doesn&#x27;t show any signs of getting slow or losing</li>
            <li> but like my dad the hairs in my nose grow like a thick viney jungle.</li>
            <li> Yes they are kinda thick.</li>
            <li> Works well on thick hair.</li>
            <li> It is definately not comfortable at all and is much worse than the Wahl that I had 10 years ago.</li>
            <li> A few years ago I had a simalar item which was frustrating to say the least.  </li>
            <li> A lot of the Nose Hair trimmers work slowly, and you must go over the area repeatedly.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these and both have broken within a few months.  </li>
            <li> It also goes slowly and noisily.</li>
            <li> this does the job well, no pulling of hairs &amp; it crops them close as well, when the battery is dying it gets slow</li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and the trimmer had no problem trimming it closely, without tugging my hair.  </li>
            <li> I have thick hair, and the trimmer had no problem trimming it closely, without tugging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> never seems like it is doing anything as it seems slow moving, but it does.&lt;br</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s slow, and takes time to trim.</li>
            <li> I hate nose hair and had never found a product that really worked.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s motor turns the cutter head slowly, so it takes forever to use.  </li>
            <li> Works o.k., slow for my liking...</li>
            <li> No joy: For three minutes it worked like a charm, but then its motor slowed as though the battery were dead.  </li>
            <li> Replacing the battery did not help, and so my morning manscaping turned from an efficient exercise into a slow torture of ear and nostril hair being dragged from my flesh by a slowly rotating blade.  </li>
            <li> Slow process.</li>
            <li> Definitely safer than either pulling it off (very PAINFUL) or use a tiny scissor.</li>
            <li> I have purchased less expensive trimmers in the past and they do not last.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I returned to Panasonic and was given a new one fairly quickly, disappointed that I had to pay the return shipping..</li>
            <li> Lasted 3 months, not very happy</li>
            <li> I was looking for a way to deal with annoying hairs that didn&#x27;t involve me stuffing some tiny sharp scissors up my nose.</li>
            <li> No more paying 8-10$ to get my eye brows done!</li>
            <li> No more itchen!  </li>
            <li> ain&#x27;t itchin me no more!  </li>
            <li> No more complaints!</li>
            <li> mean after all you shove this thing up in your nose--</li>
            <li> I mean, after all it&#x27;s a nose hair and ear hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> No more cuticle scissors in my nose or ears!  </li>
            <li> No more tears!</li>
            <li> Not much more to say!</li>
            <li> - I&#x27;ve had that issue with another brand trimmer in the past and it hurts!  </li>
            <li> I have purchased other trimmers over the years getting mediocre results.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the Wahl (and other non-rounded head models) cut no closer than my beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> No more blood!</li>
            <li> , I mean ... 2 things.</li>
            <li> With my overactive 60-year-old nose hair glands working in overdrive, I use to pull hairs out by the handful, but no more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of nose hair trimmers that were lousy</li>
            <li> no more cuts!</li>
            <li> It Is Time To Mow The Lawn.&amp;#34;  I know what they mean by that.  </li>
            <li> No more party favor nose!</li>
            <li> I mean it gets every hair where you put it.</li>
            <li> No more nose hairs!  </li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s not like there is a lot of technology going into these things.</li>
            <li> power.i mean i dont have foorest growing out of my nose</li>
            <li> Small, compact, and works as described!</li>
            <li> I have had trimmers in the past that feel like they are ripping your hair out!</li>
            <li> I mean, if you use it once</li>
            <li> Sticking a small rotating metal object in your nose can be a little scary.  </li>
            <li> , i mean come on this</li>
            <li> Item is POS already quit working!Just past 30 day return policy!</li>
            <li> If you know what I mean, and I think you do.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to do some seriously mean things to it to break it.</li>
            <li> but this nose hair trimmer made an impression on him so that must mean something.</li>
            <li> I used small scissors for years, but never again!</li>
            <li> No more pain trimming those Picasso style brush nose hair!</li>
            <li> all mean could use grooming tools at some point.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I just got a bad item, or if this is Panasonic&#x27;s way of getting men to man up and go back to tweezers, scissors, whisky, and cigars.  </li>
            <li> It takes years off a mans looks when he has a clean nose with out all the nasty hair showing,  Uck.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended for people who hate wasting in front of the mirror.</li>
            <li> or if it caught a hair and had slight trouble cutting it.  </li>
            <li> or if it caught a hair and had slight trouble cutting it.  </li>
            <li> They have made what is usually an uncomfortable, unpleasant, tedious and painful task into a simple grooming procedure that is totally comfortable, pain-free and convenient.  </li>
            <li> and no more using scissors extremely carfully afraid of making my nose bleed and pain.</li>
            <li> Well, Im not ashamed to say that past 40, I got hairs that Im not proud of.  </li>
            <li> The ER-GN30 has a very small blade</li>
            <li> Got tired of poking myself with the small scissors I used to use.</li>
            <li> A very small part  </li>
            <li> I felt so old when I HAD to buy one of these :-(  </li>
            <li> No more: it&#x27;s a false economy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately for them, I cut them down before they ever had the chance.  </li>
            <li> It can also trim that pesky unibrow that you have been wanting to split apart for so long but were too lazy to trim until you looked in the mirror one day and realized how bad you look with your nose hair sticking out and unibrow.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You seriously feel nothing; all you hear is the hairs being trimmed.</li>
            <li> Panasonic changes the design periodically and the last model was not effective and often painful.  </li>
            <li> My previous remington model tended to get clogged with hair, and after an unfortunate drop stopped responding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But the way it cuts hair seriously makes me question the Amazon reviews reliability.</li>
            <li> No accidental cuts with scissors - a bonus if you have shaky hands.  </li>
            <li> I thought - how ridiculous.</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I have a serious problem in those areas.</li>
            <li> But seriously, it might burn your face if it starts getting hotter.</li>
            <li> I have some serious stuff going on in the nose hair department.  </li>
            <li> a mediocre product?&lt;br /&gt;The motor sounds like it is running on half power.</li>
            <li> I used this product less than 10 times and unfortunately it began to fall apart.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve found that it has some serious issues when it comes to reliability.  </li>
            <li> He also is having some serious memory loss and executive function issues associated with dementia.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real impressed with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Keep it shallow.</li>
            <li> I have used various nose/facial hair trimmer and ended up going back to scissors because they were horrible.</li>
            <li> Nose hair, ear hair, even the random hair in an odd place of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d buy another one, and I think you should seriously consider this one if you&#x27;re in the market.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer was slightly irritating and painful.  </li>
            <li> You have to make some serious effort to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> I seriously use this for everything.</li>
            <li> The price, seriously we can all afford $12 bucks.  </li>
            <li> It had a little integrated flashlight that was essentially useless.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Admittedly, I was a little skeptical about ordering this product.  </li>
            <li> i was a little skeptical of the battery power vs rechargeable plug in, but now I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s actually a little uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> tried little scissors, but they seemed painfully  tedious.</li>
            <li> (I know, it&#x27;s a little weird.)</li>
            <li> /&gt;The secret to using this wonder-tool in the nose is to jam it in there  - hard - and ream it around.  </li>
            <li> It can grab and pull hairs and it can do that little annoying game where that one giant hair just seems to jump out of the way, no matter what you do</li>
            <li> Get rid of those nasty nostril hairs, ear hairs, and for that matter, any other little loose hairs that are where they should not be.  </li>
            <li> second one that goes bad within 3 month.</li>
            <li> Still this only happens maybe once every 5 times, and I will admit that I might just have extremely bad luck with batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd one of these bad boys.    </li>
            <li> Not a good position to be in.</li>
            <li> This not a good trimmer</li>
            <li> it failed after few months</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s unpleasant to look up and be greeted by long nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy another Panasonic trimmer since my last one was painful to use.  </li>
            <li> and if you squeeze your nose to stop a sneeze or when you&#x27;re swimming, the stubble can be quiet painful believe it or not.</li>
            <li> thing is way too complicated and heavy.</li>
            <li> Absolutely appalling customer service.  </li>
            <li> Shocked how low the price was for the quality.  </li>
            <li> no good</li>
            <li> no good</li>
            <li> no good</li>
            <li> no good</li>
            <li> Not good for neck trimming, but it does everything else quite well.</li>
            <li> This is not a good purchase and I would never buy one again.</li>
            <li> Have bought two, each failed within a few months.  </li>
            <li> Not good but</li>
            <li> Not a good product.</li>
            <li> It was mesmerizing, but disgusting.  </li>
            <li> The last item I purchased like this was so painful to use that I threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This has absolutely no attachment which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> Not a good experience for me.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately that one went missing after going through airport security.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 others before for my husband and they were not good.</li>
            <li> Product is not good.</li>
            <li> I was really disappointed, and apparently Amazon will not let me return it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is not good as the reviews show.  </li>
            <li> Not a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, need to go at it a few times until the job it done.</li>
            <li> Even the lowest setting is not good.  </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve yet to experience it, I&#x27;m told that when the batteries get low you will experience the painful pulled hairs of \\&quot;old.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have been using it with an Eneloop for a while now and have not experienced any loss of power or slow downs.  </li>
            <li> though I usually use it only for those annoying nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I was sick of cutting myself with scissors, so I ordered my first Panasonic trimmer about 3 years ago.  </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed that pulling out nose hair would actually make me sick.  </li>
            <li> (right between my Phoenix Wright manga and my Nintendo DSi XL), which means I can take it with me and remove disgusting hair and debris from my nose, face, ears, and neck any time I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other versions in the past and it was always painful.  </li>
            <li> My nose would get runny, and I would start sneezing and other things, and eventually get a cold.  </li>
            <li> my nose hair trimmer is awkward, and diminishes my Thoreauian attitudes in other aspects of my life.  </li>
            <li> Quite weak,  not much good</li>
            <li> Disappointing, given how durable other Panasonic grooming devices have proven to be over the years.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was very disappointed with this trimmer after using it for the first time.</li>
            <li> sometimes a single hair in the nose becomes very irritating, difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> You will need to replace it in a year or two since the blades get dull and pull the hair (ouch)!</li>
            <li> I hardly ever rate anything!  </li>
            <li> And it is not washable as it is impossible to dry</li>
            <li> Seems like the blades spin a bit slower and tugs a bit which is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different types of these trimmers through the years and hated them all.  </li>
            <li> After using this a few times I finally threw it in the trash because it kept nicking the inside of my nose which was predictably very painful.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not pleasant while using a weak battery.  </li>
            <li> Customer service at Panasonic was absolutely impossible to deal with (confusing automated responses, getting transferred all over the place incorrectly, one group claims you have to talk to another group, etc, endless frustrating loops)  </li>
            <li> How dumb I was.</li>
            <li> Still, I can&#x27;t believe how weak this is.</li>
            <li> It was weak.</li>
            <li> My husband was looking to replace a nose trimmer that consistently pulled his nose hairs and made him miserable</li>
            <li> Playing with scissors against the mirror and being frustrated about the itchy result is long gone.</li>
            <li> Turn it on, jam it up your nostril a few times, and no more nasty long nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Weak motor.</li>
            <li> the motor was weak UNTIL I found this on Amazon and took a dive.  </li>
            <li> there are 3 springs that somehow are now either too weak or something else I can&#x27;t tell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Motor too weak.</li>
            <li> It seems like the motor on mine is exceedingly weak.</li>
            <li> This product Sucks!</li>
            <li> It does seem weak.</li>
            <li> Hopefully it will continue to work, however weak sounding, and prove to be a quality grooming device for years to come.</li>
            <li> It may be the engine is just a bit too weak to take the increased resistance as time goes, but it still does the job sufficiently.</li>
            <li> Weak motor.</li>
            <li> Ever seen Dumb and Dumber.</li>
            <li> For that, I need to take off the guard to use it, and am not sure if I will eventually cut myself - kinda scary.</li>
            <li> It seems a bit weak but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Weak.  </li>
            <li> It sucks!</li>
            <li> Update - It failed quickly, not sure if I will buy it again.  </li>
            <li> Weak and ineffective.</li>
            <li> I will never own another brand!</li>
            <li> After a couple years with this item, I dropped the cutting blade down the sink during cleaning (my fault).</li>
            <li> very difficult to install battery,power seems a little slow.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;are very hard to find, but</li>
            <li> The biggest reason was nose hair,so very hard to get at.</li>
            <li> I was shocked to see the bad and mixed reviews on the other Panasonic trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Very bad trimmer, not strong, not close, not worth even the small expense</li>
            <li> Poorly made, weak power, woul not reccoment to any one.</li>
            <li> This policy is stated in the Warranty so tough luck.</li>
            <li> times it stalls when it hits a tough tuft of hair.</li>
            <li> Trimming nose hairs went from annoying / painful to quick and painless.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a tough review</li>
            <li> So my husband and I have bought no less than four trimmers in the past year and each and every one has just been awful!  </li>
            <li> Works poorly, not very effective.  </li>
            <li> The front tip is very delicate.</li>
            <li> Broke the third week, very unhappy.</li>
            <li> It is very slow, but will eventually get the job done.</li>
            <li> Granted, I do have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> However,  the speed varies a lot and is very slow at times.</li>
            <li> It is a blessing not use a small scissors again!!  </li>
            <li> As a result, you could have dozens of little hairs stabbing the inside of your nose.</li>
            <li> Although the battery was a little awkward to put in correctly(yes, the battery), that&#x27;s where any and all complaints I had with this product ended.</li>
            <li> No one has broken into the house, and if someone did, why steal just the nose hair trimmer?</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping that it would solve my trouble cutting nose hair.</li>
            <li> The product arrived broken.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to worry about poor quality rechargeables that are often used in tools like this.</li>
            <li> After having another brand&#x27;s hair trimmer break after literally minutes of use, I returned the broken trimmer to the store and went online to buy this.</li>
            <li> so i knocked off some stars for poor durability</li>
            <li> I bought this in November of 2014 and it already is broken.</li>
            <li> So irritating.</li>
            <li> Not happy with this product.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality control from a foreign-made product.</li>
            <li> I got tired of hearing the wife complain of tickle kisses and dingle-berries hanging from my face</li>
            <li> Least expensive shipping option was $3.50 (about 30% of what I paid for the trimmer).</li>
            <li> After a couple of months the trimmer started performing really poorly.  </li>
            <li> Broken.</li>
            <li> Not a happy customer.</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Now it&#x27;s inexplicably broken after about four uses.</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this project at all.</li>
            <li> Additionally, it&#x27;s poorly built.</li>
            <li> Alas not.</li>
            <li> I hate nose hair aka human body barb wire.</li>
            <li> Not a happy thing.</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you are tired of pulling nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I got tired of using my razor to cut my ear hairs and bleeding all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend who complained that trimming nose hairs was difficult-</li>
            <li> They claim the secret is the double-edged blade.</li>
            <li> not because of the user - just poorly made).</li>
            <li> Not great.</li>
            <li> A number of attempts failed to straighten out the blade guards (but, then again, I&#x27;m not really a handy guy).  </li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t broken.  </li>
            <li> Was not happy at all</li>
            <li> Poorly made.</li>
            <li> It is a poor product for protecting you from bears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a poor product for protecting you from bears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the functionality of this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product has changed for the worse.</li>
            <li> was reason behind one of them breaking.</li>
            <li> However, I dropped it off my counter approximately 3-3 1/2 feet on to a carpeted floor and it no longer works.  </li>
            <li> Poor quality product.</li>
            <li> I have owned this nose hair trimmer for approximately 2 years.  </li>
            <li> It was so thin and</li>
            <li> This is poorly built and does not cut ear or nose hairs neatly or closely.  </li>
            <li> Got tired of those wimpy things that don&#x27;t cut squat.</li>
            <li> I tried cleaning the unit and changing the battery, but still no joy, so into the wastebasket it went.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly expensive nose hair trimmer (at least when I paid for it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these things and both have broken.</li>
            <li> and this is the least expensive of the bunch.</li>
            <li> and they both have broken after one use, I would recommend not purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Seems like a strange thing to write a review for, but one thing i wished i&#x27;d known before i bought it - these things tickle like crazy!</li>
            <li> but it walways poorly built.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Product made poorly.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the others who gave this a poor rating.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a great product.</li>
            <li> Alas, the things we do for fashion.</li>
            <li> Really poor construction, flimsy, poor design</li>
            <li> either so not happy at all with quality or the return policy for poorly made items.</li>
            <li> At that time, you will see the solitary index mark on the base of the outer blade unit is aligned with theindex mark on the blue dial.  </li>
            <li> It was broken out of the box.</li>
            <li> I hope it doesn&#x27;t get any worse because this is about all I can take.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a lot in day to day life that&#x27;s worse than pulled nose hairs</li>
            <li> Seems anytime I put them in a suitcase and travel, they arrive broken at the destination broken</li>
            <li> The quality is extremely poor on this product.</li>
            <li> The battery life is not great.  </li>
            <li> So not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Broken after 1 month and about 3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t beat the price either, the least expensive I found.</li>
            <li> poorly constructed...</li>
            <li> that makes the trimmer part move (like a gear) has broken and we can&#x27;t fix it.</li>
            <li> This was broken as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li> Alas I settled on this gem solely on the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Tired of sizzor cuts?  </li>
            <li> One of my worse purchases from amzn.</li>
            <li> Do the work not great though.</li>
            <li> It does not leave any hairs behind.</li>
            <li> I had been using an old one that did a very bad job.</li>
            <li> That is, the thickness of the metal protector around the blade, while hard, is very thin.</li>
            <li> had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the flat base lets you set it on the end</li>
            <li> This product replaces a previous Panasonic nose and ear trimmer in which the cutting blades became dull and started &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; nose hairs instead of cutting....</li>
            <li> Stick it up your nose, seriously, just do it!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The packaging was terrible, almost impossible to open, but shears, not scissors finally did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but my old Brookstone trimmer was just too bad at trimming hair, so I decided to five this one a try.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased some nose hair trimmers in the past at a local chain store, but they were awful.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t have a crazy amount of nose hair, so I&#x27;m not sure why these devices keep failing.  </li>
            <li> Not sure if my nose is just numb to the feeling or what.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my nostril hair with small hair-cutting scissors for years.</li>
            <li> and I felt the unit was a pain and was not good at all at clipping the nose hairs-it was a tedious process as well as</li>
            <li> hate having a long hair or two stick out of my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid it will cut my nose if I get one little piece wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought a new one and it is horrible.</li>
            <li> - I didn&#x27;t get cut and even though you feel a slight tug when it cuts, it doesn&#x27;t painfully pluck.</li>
            <li> Nothing dramatic, just a 2 foot fall from my face into the sink.</li>
            <li> The difference is dramatic.</li>
            <li> It does the job, not too expensive and it does what is expected not that bad after all.</li>
            <li> This is a ton less painful.  </li>
            <li> I hate nose hair more than I hate Al Qaeda!  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in the purchase because I threw away my old one which I used over 15 years without any issue.</li>
            <li> Just disappointed that Panasonic didn&#x27;t stand behind their product (I just bought it less than 4 months ago) and provide a prepaid shipping label</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my other trimmers weren&#x27;t painful</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like buying products that become landfill when one little part goes bad.</li>
            <li> Of course, the eyebrows overgrow a little too, but that problem isn&#x27;t as bad - yet.</li>
            <li> Poorly made, very weak motor.</li>
            <li> it does the job well without all the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using a small nose hair scissor and it can be extremely tedious and painful!</li>
            <li> Sorry, failure!  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing out on until I bought this bad boy Panasonic.</li>
            <li> The bad reviews I read didn&#x27;t seem to be about the product&#x27;s performance, just about it&#x27;s reliability; seemed to stop working in a few cases.  </li>
            <li> Hated but used it for years until finally I dropped it and broke the battery cover.      </li>
            <li> My husband hated his last trimmer and we replaced it with this one.</li>
            <li> I am one of those poor, unfortunate sots who has a lot of nostril hair.</li>
            <li> Very sad to see reliable in the past brand Panasonic losing the quality in this days.</li>
            <li> Trimmers do always tickle in an inhumane way, but it&#x27;s something that only has to be done every once in a while.  </li>
            <li> poorly made, eats batteries, uncomfortable (pinches and plucks out hairs).</li>
            <li> Since I have the old man ear hair syndrome, I needed some quality product to attack those nasty ear hairs.</li>
            <li> Sadly, this isn&#x27;t the device for you (but with the cleaning feature, no irreparable harm done...except to that poor banana).</li>
            <li> For around 10 bucks it&#x27;s not worth returning, but I am disappointed it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> course, not to get too down and dirty with the hygiene here, but I trimmed any nose hairs I could find with it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ha!</li>
            <li> which can be very painful, especially in your nose!</li>
            <li> Trimmer spins very slowly and pulls the hairs and cuts very poorly.</li>
            <li> a little disappointed.</li>
            <li> I tried an Andis nose hair trimmer also but it was terrible and barely cut anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , the blade sometimes slows down a bit which gets annoying.</li>
            <li> I was opting for the manual method which meant taking a pair of small scissors and cutting what hair I could without cutting my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Motor went out after three uses and was very weak any ways.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very weak.</li>
            <li> but i&#x27;m left very disappointed.</li>
            <li> and it was already dead !!!!</li>
            <li> no more watery eyes!!!</li>
            <li> No more waxing for me or my husband!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be stupid like I was because I must say I was a little scared.</li>
            <li> get rid of those annoying little hairs.</li>
            <li> AA batteries power it, which is a little annoying but for $12 ish who can complain?  </li>
            <li> You can hear all the annoying little hairs being annihilated by it.</li>
            <li> It runs slow and stops sporadicaly, plus hairs so bad it will bring tears to your eyes</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I cannot return it because it is beyond the 30 day return policy.</li>
            <li> My husband is not impressed with this item.</li>
            <li> so buy it, you can not go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical that it might pull the hair</li>
            <li> What was wrong with the er 411?</li>
            <li> But boy was I wrong.</li>
            <li> Gets at ALL DIFFICULT to reach</li>
            <li> Sadly, my husband didn&#x27;t realize it had a two year warranty on it</li>
            <li> Used twice before it failed.</li>
            <li> For the quality and what it does, the cost is just too expensive.</li>
            <li> &quot; You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of experience with these devices...</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone with unfortunate hair placement.</li>
            <li> it leaves a lot of hair uncut.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of these for years.</li>
            <li> if you can afford to pay for this, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the hairs on my eyebrow are gone</li>
            <li> I have always used a pair of scissors and was skeptical this would work as my fear was it would pull the hair instead of cut</li>
            <li> and unfortunately the bag they lost just happened to be the bag that had all of my bathroom items in it.</li>
            <li> Failed after three uses.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  </li>
            <li> The engine failed in two months.</li>
            <li> But I have been known to be wrong.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, whether you are vain or not this aberrant growth can lead to some difficulty with your interpersonal relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it stopped working after 10 months.</li>
            <li> If dropped, the blades get off kilter and no matter what I did to try and make it work again failed.</li>
            <li> Failed after a month.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately all of these groomers have problems with being dropped onto tiled bathroom floors</li>
            <li> I feel quite silly using it, but I can&#x27;t deny that it works.  </li>
            <li> Once that happens..it will be difficult to align and will not as before.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t expensive as compared to</li>
            <li> everyone else who is doing it all wrong, STOP.  </li>
            <li> it does fail after a year (twice a month - 24 uses, pro rated at $1 per use,)</li>
            <li> I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> YOU ARE PREPARING BLIND DATE, YOU MUST HAVE IT.&lt;br</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong for the money.</li>
            <li> Took it apart again to see if I had something in the wrong place</li>
            <li> Boy, was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> it became completely useless.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> wait, guess I was wrong.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s not an expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly w/ no tugging of those oh-so-sensitive hairs.  </li>
            <li> Now it sounds awful and won&#x27;t cut properly.</li>
            <li> I think the blade angle must be wrong and that it is not well designed.  </li>
            <li> so it is useless.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the replacement window has expired so I can no longer exchange it.</li>
            <li> , I could see it making users uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> if they deem it was a flawed unit.</li>
            <li> If anything goes wrong with it</li>
            <li> This is just sad.</li>
            <li> but it looks like there must be a lot of either fake or just kneejerk reviews.</li>
            <li> something wrong with this, and it cut my skin...</li>
            <li> probably the alignment of the blades inside went wrong that led to this.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> but it failed to operate in 3 months.  </li>
            <li> For the money, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> A sad fact of being well over 40 is that you find hair growing in places that you didn&#x27;t have a problem with in your 20s or 30s.  </li>
            <li> Over 1000 review can&#x27;t be wrong.</li>
            <li> Unable to trim after 4 uses.</li>
            <li> , The switch has failed to turn on the trimmer once or twice but repeated trials have succeeded.  </li>
            <li> sorry i bought it.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately there are hairy men in this world and unless you want hair dangling out of your nose</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this nose trimmer</li>
            <li> but it proved me wrong.</li>
            <li> which is terribly painful to say the least.</li>
            <li> ...it simply failed.</li>
            <li> Not a happy customer!!  </li>
            <li> I put in a battery and it failed to work</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> Can trim those difficult to get to areas.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as to how well this would work, but it does the trick.  </li>
            <li> Mine just died randomly after four months of use, before I finished one battery...</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> So I finally got disgusted, threw it in the trash, and ordered this one.</li>
            <li> If you are shopping for a trimmer--I promise you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Not perfect.  </li>
            <li> so that was a scary thing to witness.</li>
            <li> Not as expensive as others but</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m sorry that you need this.</li>
            <li> Weird.</li>
            <li> If mine fails, I&#x27;ll update the review.  </li>
            <li> Useless product.</li>
            <li> It works like it should and wasnt to expensive.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, return time has passed.</li>
            <li> For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> (sorry TMI)</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is a product that Panasonic engineers should redesign.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
            <li> The cutting head is poorly designed for cleaning and repair and it EATS batteries.</li>
            <li> I think something went wrong with the blade.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This one seems like I have to replace the batteries every month, which is a pain and gets expensive.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a blister pack, but was not too difficult to extract.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say I have not had a nose hair randomly tickle my nose for a while now.  </li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this.</li>
            <li> but sadly....</li>
            <li> Moving on to another brand, and that is unfortunate because this thing is a champ while it works.</li>
            <li> For the price of this unit you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> nothing beats an expensive pair of Revelon tweezers,a car rearview mirror or&lt;br</li>
            <li> I cant recall what there names are, Sorry.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately within two months they both stopped working.</li>
            <li> Plucking my nose hairs proved painful, and using scissor was a delicate procedure.  </li>
            <li> Extremely flawed engineering.</li>
            <li> Ordered this and was skeptical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate, too, because when it works, again, it works well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price of it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After a year of infrequent usage (once every 2 weeks or so), the trimmer fails to work well</li>
            <li> Really uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> It is weird that Panasonic doesn&#x27;t sell replacement blades.</li>
            <li> Now there is a faint weird smell permeating from the trimmer whenever I change the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing wrong about this product, if you need it get it.</li>
            <li> Overly complicated design.</li>
            <li> I bought the ER-GN30-K trimmer and used it twice before it failed to come on even after I changed the battery.  </li>
            <li> Assuming I had maybe done something wrong, I bought another one.  </li>
            <li> I find it distinctly distasteful to see that on otther people, so I like to keep my nasal passages &amp;#34;groomed.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> There were always areas that were difficult to get to, and I had to contort my face to get into areas in my nose.  </li>
            <li> Buy it, You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> I am so sorry I didn&#x27;t have one before this!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Even course and difficult to trim hair is cut.  </li>
            <li> worked once...then failed....</li>
            <li> Maybe I am being unfair because it didnt say in the description that it included any attachments, but i was looking for ONE unit to do nose, ear and the razor attachment for eyebrows, like the mangroomer one I had before.</li>
            <li> He had never owned one before and thought it would be uncomfortable or pull, but as it turns out, he was incorrect.</li>
            <li> and I felt weird giving this as a Christmas gift</li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I threw away the packaging before using it</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this.  </li>
            <li> I def recommend this product if you&#x27;re tired of cutting your self with scissors.</li>
            <li> Sorry about the title....  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, in a drunken stupor, I purchased this online again since I forgot that it was once in my possession.</li>
            <li> Manual nose trimmers appeal to those who may use DE razors (like me) but often get horribly reviewed because they end up grabbing and tugging like a vice rather than simply scrubbing</li>
            <li> My husband has the tolerance level of an infant when it comes to pain, so he was skeptical about a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is the 3 rd unit i have gotten that failed.  </li>
            <li> and it makes u uncomfortable and</li>
            <li> or so then wre useless.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> Cons: if you look at it wrong, it breaks.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they were wrong.</li>
            <li> It randomly came to life eventually and has worked since then, but I have no idea why or if it will continue</li>
            <li> Sorry, you may not borrow it.</li>
            <li> Like the contact was applied wrong.</li>
            <li> Need to buy batteries separate, which tend to be a bit expensive as they are bought in packages.</li>
            <li> I cannot blame it on excess hair removal so that leaves a lousy product as the answer.</li>
            <li> I should have returned it then, but I figured that I would just put up with a mediocre piece of equipment, which I did until around a month ago (May).  </li>
            <li> Cutting head is poor quality.  </li>
            <li> ZERO STARS, COMPLETLY USELESS SITS IN BATHROOM CABINET ,</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sad.</li>
            <li> weak,no power, useless,other reviews are WRONG, this has to be the second worst unit I have ever had.</li>
            <li> And for a mere $12, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Needless to say its going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Cleaning too complicated and time consuming.  </li>
            <li> I returned product after learning how tedious and time consuming cleaning would be.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> When it comes in contact with a hair, it stops and pulls and tugs on the hair and then may slowly and painfully pull it out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The directions failed to say batteries were not supplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ts useless.  </li>
            <li> Mediocre.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.   </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a lousy Remington version.  </li>
            <li> Not HUGELY impressed.  </li>
            <li> Am I holding it wrong?  </li>
            <li> I had a Phillips trimmer that was a different design which cost me $20 and was just awful.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend casually told me that I have &amp;#34;old man</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby who is a casual guy when it comes to grooming.</li>
            <li> This unit will trim your nose hairs, but it is very poorly build, overall a terrible quality.</li>
            <li> Very poor design of blades and nozzle.</li>
            <li> DOES VERY POOR JOB.</li>
            <li> Trims very poorly.</li>
            <li> I realized that this item is very poorly made.</li>
            <li> I used this product once to trim nose hair, and it did a very poor job.  </li>
            <li> The blade is very thin and spins around inside the blade guard.</li>
            <li> Not sure how they get away with selling crap like this.</li>
            <li> I can now talk to people without wondering if I have that one long disgusting nose hair sticking out.</li>
            <li> no more annoying nose hair.</li>
            <li> Horrible, died after 2 uses and was stored properly in a dry room not in the bathroom.&lt;br</li>
            <li> worst 15 dollars ever spent the thing worked one time and never again</li>
            <li> It does a lousy job of cutting hairs, that is unless you want to stand in front of the mirror and spend 20 minutes doing so.</li>
            <li> thinking I might do something wrong and end up cutting the inside of my nose.</li>
            <li> It even trimmed the weird crazy bread hairs that pop out of no where...</li>
            <li> I am so sick and tired of these trimmer reviews.</li>
            <li> I have owned two other nose hair trimmers in my life and they were both terrible.</li>
            <li> No more painful plucking!</li>
            <li> Broke in less than 2 month, use once then stop working very disappointed, 😠</li>
            <li> Needless to say, it was unpleasant.  </li>
            <li> I tried one of the little comb looking nose trimmers and it was awful.</li>
            <li> Sorry Panasonic for the bad review.</li>
            <li> I feel bad for all the dentists who had to deal with looking at my face at weird angles before I had this thing.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I am one of them that got a bad unit.  </li>
            <li> - Cutting unwanted ear, nose, eyebrow hair?&lt;br /&gt;- Join the club, my friend...</li>
            <li> Use to use either a razor or scissors and was constantly cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> I knew when I took it out of the box that I was in for disappointment.  </li>
            <li> Totally unhappy.</li>
            <li> He also trimmed the awkward mustache hairs under his nose.</li>
            <li> * Washable with cold water  </li>
            <li> Needless to say that inside one&#x27;s nostril, that is painful.</li>
            <li> The cutting head has a tendency to heat up while in use</li>
            <li> the trimmer in the nose and hear the blades cutting the nose</li>
            <li> It sounds like its cutting</li>
            <li> Use caution if removing the outer cutting blade.</li>
            <li> No pulling or cutting flesh.</li>
            <li> I made this choice between a manual trimmer and an electric trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The manual trimmer seemed awkward to actuate the trimmer and hold it in the area that you are planning on trimming.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Cuts the hair without cutting your skin.  </li>
            <li> Was afraid of it hurting</li>
            <li> For those who say it pulls hair or seems to stop cutting, I&#x27;d suggest changing the battery.  </li>
            <li> I checked the cutting head closely.  </li>
            <li> Works well, does not cause pain when cutting.</li>
            <li> It felt like they were ripping the hair out, rather than cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The cutting head stopped working after about six months.</li>
            <li> Maybe the hairs inside the nose are curled away from the cutting mechanism.</li>
            <li> No worries on cutting yourself with the blades.  </li>
            <li> pass\\&quot; hair cutting performance.  </li>
            <li> Awkward Looks at my nose anymore&lt;</li>
            <li> A few grains in the ear are the worst as it irritates and sometimes makes me feel that something is crawling in my ear, this has solved that problem.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> ordered one and it wasn&#x27;t cutting the hair well</li>
            <li> I have had one occurance where it seemed to have almost yanked a hair out of my nose instead of cutting it, thus leaving me in a bit of pain.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a number of differ trimmers, but this one does the job with out cutting or pulling the hairs.</li>
            <li> No worries of cutting skin.</li>
            <li> They didn&#x27;t work well, pulled hair instead of cutting it.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic seems to require a lot of time and moving around inside the nostril to find the cutting edge.</li>
            <li> the cutting blade design makes the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid to apply pressure for fear of nicks.</li>
            <li> This works well at cutting, The battery life lasts forever.</li>
            <li> , I end up cutting myself........</li>
            <li> /&gt;Unfortunately, the blade on mine stopped cutting after about 4 1/2 months.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not concerned about cutting my nose when using it.</li>
            <li> When it comes to cutting hairs in your nose and ears, this thing kicks ass.</li>
            <li> I use it for cutting my nosie hair, it makes me laughing.</li>
            <li> When I tried to trim the nose hairs, I had to hold them in place for it to cut through them which was awkward and took for ever.  </li>
            <li> Turns out, in my stupidity, and, carelessness</li>
            <li> Then it just stopped cutting hair.</li>
            <li> I think something fell out of the cutting end...</li>
            <li> Every now and then, it will &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; one out rather than cutting it...</li>
            <li> The instructions say it&#x27;s dirty..</li>
            <li> This trimmer works as advertised; cutting ear and nose hair off close to the skin without pulling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have some crazy nosehairs or anything, but this thing couldn&#x27;t cut it, literally.</li>
            <li> I was desperate to replace it.</li>
            <li> The panasonic&#x27;s rotary trimmer does not have the serration and the circular cutting motion</li>
            <li> Seriously, it&#x27;s crazy.</li>
            <li> No worries about it pulling hairs or cutting you at all.</li>
            <li> This is infuriating.  </li>
            <li> I should have been concerned when the instructions said something about \\&quot;getting used to the cutting head\\&quot; or something to that</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s there to protect you from accidental inhaling of dangerous substances.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It sort of grabbed at the hairs instead of cutting them upon coming in contact, making it uncomfortable and even painful on occassion.</li>
            <li> feels like i installed a cold air intake for my nose.</li>
            <li> The vortex seems to be standing up well to the test of time, and still cutting hair.</li>
            <li> My nostrils had become so overgrown, I was afraid I was going to suffocate in my sleep.</li>
            <li> Was afraid it might be &amp;#34;grabby&amp;#34; but no issues.  </li>
            <li> I call it Dirty Hairy because it blows away the unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointing.  </li>
            <li> A bonus is it drives the cat crazy.</li>
            <li> When cutting the motor slows appreciably.  </li>
            <li> this trimmer cuts all those pesky nose hairs without cutting or scratching the inside of your nose.</li>
            <li> I did one time and ending up pulling out nose hairs instead of cutting them....</li>
            <li> The trimmer is well-designed and you don&#x27;t feel it cutting when you use it.  </li>
            <li> No chance of cutting your skin with it.</li>
            <li> This IS the closest cutting trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> And ever since I reached 30, my nostrils have become a forest of eager vines desperate for daylight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you can hear it cutting the hair.</li>
            <li> and they all eventually burned out to the point where it was pulling the hair out rather than cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The dual cutting system is not just hype, as I had worried.  </li>
            <li> thing EATS batteries like crazy.</li>
            <li> Awful ... Don&#x27;t waste your $$.</li>
            <li> After about 5 uses, I noticed that it started pulling on my hair, instead of cutting it.  </li>
            <li> When it did run, it was quite inefficient at cutting hair in the areas it&#x27;s designed to handle (nose &amp; ears).</li>
            <li> It beats cutting the hears with a scissors.t</li>
            <li> From the outset, this trimmer has lacked sufficient cutting speed, which results in pulled nose hairs.  </li>
            <li> It cuts close without cutting you.</li>
            <li> but we go through batteries like crazy</li>
            <li> It gets a close cut, without ever cutting your skin.</li>
            <li> saves me time and the anxiety of cutting myself.  </li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this price!</li>
            <li> go wrong here, buy this!</li>
            <li> WRONG!</li>
            <li> well this thing did not work as the rest of people say,for me it was another useless solution!</li>
            <li> you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> Sorry!  </li>
            <li> But dang if that one random ear hair wont stay away!  </li>
            <li> Its Panasonic, you cannot go wrong with this company!</li>
            <li> Trims without tugging, which is the worst part usually.</li>
            <li> Without going into gory details, lets just say I bought this for my husband as a gift to MYSELF!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what is happening, but I think it might be pulling my nose hair or shocking my nose!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed, you would think it would have lasted at least 6 months for the price.</li>
            <li> sometimes it pulls nose hairs and can be very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco one star and very difficult to use and figure out.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, the Brookstone trims hairs to the base as where the Panasonic trimmer struggles and is time consuming nonsense.</li>
            <li> The circular motion of the trimmer -- the way it works its almost impossible to cut yourself.    </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s about impossible to cut yourself with this thing</li>
            <li> Does what it is meant too do, trim away in those impossible places - ears and nose.</li>
            <li> DO NOT use a weak battery in this unit or you&#x27;ll be sorry!!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Those small grooming scissors were terrible at getting at any but the longest of hairs and was very awkward and sometimes painful to use.  </li>
            <li> motor is very weak, it gets caught on my hair which is very painful.  </li>
            <li> The battery connection is bad.</li>
            <li> This bad bad boy went in there and took care of business.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull or tickle badly like some trimmers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> so I got this bad boy.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps there was a bad lot of them.  </li>
            <li> Too bad.</li>
            <li> Not to bad.</li>
            <li> I have nothing bad to say about it</li>
            <li> and it was off to the races with this bad boy.</li>
            <li> I had read some bad reviews</li>
            <li> I am not a stickler, I know some electronics are going to be bad out of the millions that are produced.  </li>
            <li> This is a bad purchase....</li>
            <li> Either i got a bad pack of 2AAs at Costco or this thing drains power like a maniac.  </li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t too bad, and my nasal passages have never been so hairless.</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager, I had a dentist with a bad nose hair problem.  </li>
            <li> I plunge for Er-GN30-K for one reason- if it&#x27;s that bad...</li>
            <li> Bad -&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> I think I just got a bad one the 1st time.</li>
            <li> I used to pull out the hair of my nose, but since I use this, I&#x27;ve yet gotten rid of another bad habit.</li>
            <li> Also, electronics + water is usually bad.  </li>
            <li> It just gets the job done, have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
            <li> I am an engineer and this looks bad.</li>
            <li> /&gt;That was bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had others, but they went bad after a while.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> But for price its not to bad, just don&#x27;t expect quality.</li>
            <li> Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that bad</li>
            <li> /&gt;Operation isn&#x27;t bad for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t feel all that durable or well constructed.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s bad about it.</li>
            <li> His nose wasn&#x27;t that bad, maybe the battery needed to be changed.</li>
            <li> Then again, for the $20 I paid at the time, guess almost two years isn&#x27;t bad...</li>
            <li> So, bad product, bad service.</li>
            <li> /&gt;to bad</li>
            <li> I pop this bad boy in to trim out those offensive hairs and then use soap and water to wash.</li>
            <li> Beats the painful plucking.</li>
            <li> GRRR.</li>
            <li> Was totally shocked when I saw a piece of hair on the body of the unit.</li>
            <li> It was a really painful</li>
            <li> ISN&#x27;T PAINFUL..</li>
            <li> This is an EXTREMELY painful process.  </li>
            <li> and yes it was painful ;</li>
            <li> those ugly ear</li>
            <li> and it was highly painful.</li>
            <li> But you can feel it working (not at all painfully though) and it does the trick.</li>
            <li> No pulling or painful trimming that some have mentioned.</li>
            <li> And because I have an ugly mug, I often go months without looking in the mirror.</li>
            <li> and I ended up frustrated with the results</li>
            <li> After about 5 seconds it pulled hair out of my nose that was so painful it brought tears to my eyes.  </li>
            <li> Got this product for my boyfriend as he kept trying to pluck his nose hairs and it looked incredibly painful.</li>
            <li> Do some maintenance and trim those ugly things off.</li>
            <li> I thought this would be painful</li>
            <li> I asked if it was painful to use</li>
            <li> It was inefficient and painful.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness something that gets rid of the ugly nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I can cut my ugly nose hair whenever I have to without painfully pulling them out.  </li>
            <li> and it was painful.</li>
            <li> Been really sick, so</li>
            <li> Sick of all of the trees growin in the ol&#x27; bat cave?</li>

            <li> worthless.</li>
            <li> This is one of those annoying things you will never want o need but eventually have to have.  </li>
            <li> if I could rank it that high&lt;br</li>
            <li> How filthy is this thing?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Ladies hate the hairs of the nostril.&lt;br /&gt;Gentleman must have this one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I often had to loosen and re-tighten the base to get it to power on.</li>
            <li> Annoying, noising, itching, and doesn&#x27;t work well</li>
            <li> Hate and don&#x27;t use anymore.</li>

            <li> Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> You have to move it around to get a close cut on ear/nose hair - this can be somewhat annoying</li>
            <li> I hate nose hair.</li>
            <li> I admit that I don&#x27;t use it overly often its just to trim up some nose hairs when they get annoying.</li>

            <li> It does the trick without that annoying tickle.</li>

            <li> Gets rid of those annoying nose hairs.....</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d give this 0 stars, but 1 is the lowest like how my bum feels now because of the violent thrashing it</li>
            <li> Crap, stopped working after a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> It is over-hyped crap.</li>

            <li> A real disappointment.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my mother, she had been waxing and hated it</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATED the Remington, from it&#x27;s design to it&#x27;s performance.  </li>
            <li> I always hated hair coming out of my nose, it was always embarrassing.</li>
            <li> and I hated using it.  </li>
            <li> No one ever commented about my nose hair, but it was one of those things that I knew existed and I just hated.</li>
            <li> it replaces a Philips Norelco that I&#x27;ve used (and hated) for about a year.  </li>
            <li> The others I have had would pull out the hair and it would be very painful.</li>
            <li> you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Order it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>

            <li> Very disappointed in the quality.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointing Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed in Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but was very disappointed that it did not come with a case.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
            <li> This is the worst product ever made.  </li>
            <li> Terrible Product Quality/Design!!!    </li>
            <li> Gets all the annoying hairs out of your nose, ears, and evens up my beard!!!</li>
            <li> it still came on but something must have happened on the inside as it made a terrible raquet after that...</li>
            <li> Awful!  </li>
            <li> I bought this one (Remington NE-3 Precision Wet/Dry Rotary Nose and Ear Trimmer - http://www.amazon.com/Remington-NE-3-Precision-Rotary-Trimmer/dp/B00005B6ZM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr-mr-title) on Amazon and it was terrible.</li>
            <li> Tears through those vicious nose hairs like they were nothing!</li>
            <li> (Very painful!).  </li>
            <li> It has kept my nose and ear hair from looking terrible.</li>
            <li> I bought it to remove nose hair - it&#x27;s terrible at that!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm on those awful nose hairs</li>
            <li> I was feeling bad, like my nose hair was indestructible!!!</li>
            <li> well, it was awful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a zap gun, but for those nasty hairs that drive you (and your spouse)</li>
            <li> Seriously,i feel disgusted seeing people who&#x27;s hair sticking out of their ears and nose in stuff.</li>
            <li> What terrible quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a cruel curse to be growing hair in the place that require this product and not on my head.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had friends (including girlfriend) mention my nose hair, and it&#x27;s been awfully embarrassing</li>
            <li> Worst nose hair trimmer ever!</li>
            <li> After 4 uses.. USES not months, the blades somehow make really horrible noise</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  </li>
            <li> Because goats can&#x27;t talk, and thus make terrible customer service representatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worst part is it tickles the nose a bit</li>
            <li> I could not believe how well this trimmed those nasty, unsightly nose hair.</li>
            <li> It is a terrible, awful, despicable, unsusable product.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> this product is performing very poorly!!!!  </li>
            <li> Also, I will not be using it terribly often</li>
            <li> Terrible quality.</li>

            <li> Worst nose trimmer I have ever had.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s taken some nasty falls to a tile floor and is still hungry for nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so disappointed !!</li>
            <li> gosh, it smells really bad whenever i opened the battery compartment!!!!</li>
            <li> I had another one that felt like it was either shocking me or pulling nose hairs out.</li>
            <li> Now it makes a terrifying grinding noise.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is terrible.  </li>
            <li> The problem lies solely with this terrible product.  </li>
            <li> and this one is terrible.  </li>
            <li> It is pathetic.</li>
            <li> This blade assembly looks awfully flimsy.  </li>
            <li> Let me tell you, this is an awful bum trimmer.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use exclusively on my disgusting nose hair.</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible product.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I have horrible allergies in the winter, and my nose hairs tend to crust up with all sorts of unpleasantness.</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper rechargable trimmer and it had horrible battery life</li>
            <li> The Brookstone and Sharper Image products were awful, and didn&#x27;t do the job.</li>
            <li> What a terrible product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> My husband loves it and I love not seeing his weird ear and nose hair. I gave it 4 stars bc it really doesn&#x27;t last as long as it should. I have to buy him one every year but you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> So so, doesn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li> This is a must have. Works better than any other one that I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Day 1 - This thing works great for trimming nose hair and hairs in &amp; around the ears.  Much better than another one I had picked up a few years ago.  Seems powerful enough. Good design. Seems easy to maintain and keep clean.</li>
            <li> Lol haven&#x27;t tried it wet ;-?</li>
            <li> Never fully functioned properly. Sometimes it would and then other times it wouldn&#x27;t. Replaced the battery two or three times to see if that was the problem and also cleaned it according to the instructional manual. Never really came to life, and its not like I&#x27;m hacking down bushes in the amazon with it. This did not hold up to moderate usage. Now I&#x27;m back here shopping for a decent one after throwing this one in the trash.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  However, this things have a tendency to be great out of the box...the real test is how well it&#x27;s performing in a couple of years!  Here&#x27;s hoping it holds out better than the last Remington I bought at Target!!</li>
            <li> It gets the job done, but does take quite a bit of moving and finagling to catch all the hairs.  Also I did notice that the tip can get kinda warm after a few moments of using the trimmer...not too bad but it is noticible.  I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and still working fine so no complaints on that tip &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I had this thing and used it about once a week, three weeks after i had it it died, don&#x27;t waste your money and time</li>
            <li> Second one I&#x27;ve bought because I dropped the first one and the metal things at the tip bent. Strangely you can&#x27;t get replacements for the tip nubbin, but that&#x27;s alright as it&#x27;s pretty cheap and does come with a protective cap. Just be a little cautious while using it and it&#x27;ll work forever. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect trimmer.</li>
            <li> I waited on this review because of other reviews I saw complaining that it broke on them.  Mine is still working fine after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is awesome!</li>
            <li> Takes care of the hard to get a hairs. It does the trick.</li>
            <li> Bought this a gift and the person who received it is happy to have it and says it works great</li>
            <li> Great product delivered on time.</li>
            <li> Great for fighting back any signs of old age. Nip/snip it in the bud. Don&#x27;t look like a crazy old science professor. Clip that s@#$ back!</li>
            <li> This Panasonic trimmer is much better than a Panasonic trimmer we ordered from Amazon last year  (Model #ER430).  It&#x27;s easier to hold and doesn&#x27;t have the &amp;#34;hokey&amp;#34; mirror attached to it.</li>
            <li> It easy use than I think.</li>
            <li> People used to recoil in horror at the site of my nose hair.  Now, my life is like a beer commercial with my super shiny sniffer.</li>
            <li> Nice personal groomer to have handy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt; - Love the curve of it, fits very nicely in your hand for trimming&lt;br /&gt; - The tip is nice, no issues with cuts or burns from trimming too close to the skin&lt;br /&gt; - Like the switch so you can run it under the water, can trim in the shower or just clean it out&lt;br /&gt; - Battery run so no need to charge it</li>
            <li> Had it for 3 u.yrs and still working. Cleaning is easy breezy.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Had two in the past, but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> Takes care of unwanted hair with no problem.  A+</li>
            <li> I purchased this product in mid March.  It is only the beginning of May and the product no longer works.  Unfortunately I cannot return it because it is beyond the 30 day return policy.</li>
            <li> What a bargain! It gets kind of hot after prolonged use, but considering that this is my first nose hair trimmer, I must have been running the motor for a while to get rid of a lot of nose hairs. It&#x27;s safe. It never has nicked me or caught on the inside of my nose. I really like that a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a single battery, the humbly ubiquitous AA, and I must say that it&#x27;s a great value!</li>
            <li> very good,easy to use.</li>
            <li> Non comparison with others tools. It&#x27;s perfect, no noise, precise cut and you can even wash it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had one for years, this is a replacement and certainly does the job. Arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> Just like my previous one, it has a tendency to not go on. You have to smack it in the counter to get it going. Otherwise is ok.</li>
            <li> This thing kicks unwanted nose,ear hairs butt. But seriously it works great,form fits your hand not a lot of noise and easy to clean in the sink.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Easy to wash with soap and warm water.</li>
            <li> Works well and as expected</li>
            <li> 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned -- I misplaced the first one.  (How in the world could someone misplace a nose hair trimmer?  I have no idea, but I accomplished it. No one has broken into the house, and if someone did, why steal just the nose hair trimmer? Who knows what I did with the first one, but I digress).  Works great for controlling hairy noses and ears.  (It&#x27;s an older guy&#x27;s tool, clearly).  Inexpensive to own and operate.</li>
            <li> This is a keeper.  So far, this clipper looks like it will live up to it&#x27;s battery life estimate.  I would have replaced the batter in my old clipper by this time.</li>
            <li> I expect more from a brand like Panasonic. It is OK not an amazing one.</li>
            <li> My husband is very virile and his hair amount and consistency are congruent.  We have tried several trimmers mostly for, eh, his nose hair.  He raves about this trimmer.  It&#x27;s important to keep it free of particles so should be cleaned after use.  If it seems to be running sluggish, change the battery and you are good to go.  Will highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Overall, great.  sometimes it pulls nose hairs and can be very uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> Works quickly. Easy to clean.  Edit: Changed to 4 stars. I had a problem with mine where it quit spinning at all. Then I took off the tip and tried it, and it would spin just fine. I noticed a couple of the tongues on the hair guard were ever so slightly bent inward. I think maybe one of my kids knocked it off the counter and it got dinged. I tried my best to straighten it back out, and it works now, but it sounds a little gritty. I don&#x27;t remember if it sounded that way before. I know replacement blades are available, but it doesn&#x27;t seem that replacement tips/hair guards are. I&#x27;m taking off a star because a flimsy hair guard like this ought to have replacements available.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li> When you turn 55 as a guy...get  a gift that you never wanted..&lt;br /&gt;The gift of Ear hair both on the outer and inner part of your ear&lt;br /&gt;The gift of out of controll noise hair&lt;br /&gt;The gift of eye brows that grow overnight&lt;br /&gt;Well, this product cut it down very close to the skin&lt;br /&gt;This will stop you from using a razor blade on your ears and bleeding.&lt;br /&gt;A+</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used.  Don&#x27;t over think this one.</li>
            <li> Very effective. Easy to use and easy to clean. No issues. Switch does not seem cheap like some other models.</li>
            <li> I like this product since it has a very nice design. The pros about this is that it is very sleek in design and does it job 98% of the time. Cleaning is pretty easy. The con about this product is that it has very less power is does not perform as advertised. It does not cut my eyebrow that well since it says it will and I had few embarrassing moments when I thought I had cleaned my nose hair well, it turns out my friends were pointing that i had a long one sticking out. Not a good position to be in. Overall, like the product but will try something else in the future</li>
            <li> Cures vertigo! Vertigo which makes everything spin around you,is caused by a hair rubbing a nerve in your ear.I tried Adavert,a dizzy medication,did not work.Trimmed hair in my ear and instant success.Have not had vertigo for years.By design,tip does not go in far enough to hit eardrum,also too blount.Had this trimmer for years.It suddenly stopped working.I took off black top with trimmer blade and washes out,working great again.</li>
            <li> Works great. So far it hasn&#x27;t pulled or pinched anything. Its very easy to clean, simply requiring you turn the head to the water setting, and stick it under the faucet. Also pretty compact and light.</li>
            <li> Works well but not very powerful (PRO) but after using it a few times, being battery operated is a good deal.  You don&#x27;t need anything any more powerful to get the job done.  Expect you nose to be a little sore for a few days after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABM</li>
            <li> This product just stopped working shortly after purchase. When I flick the power on. It&#x27;s just dead. Tried changing the battery several times. It wasn&#x27;t the battery. Waste of money.</li>
            <li> This works really well. Nose and ear hairs are easily removed with this trimmer. Every now and then it briefly slows down, but then speeds back up and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> My husband is not impressed with this item. He is researching other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Worked well for about a month, but it no longer cuts very well.</li>
            <li> Great price on a great device, this is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased, after a year I dropped the first one &amp; even though it still worked &amp; I&#x27;m still using it, it seemed like it got louder, I didn&#x27;t even open up this second unit yet, but when trimming ear hair like I said it was louder, but I just can&#x27;t dump it for that reason. Anyway this trimmer always trims without pulling or snagging my nose hair or any hair for that matter, it fits in the hand nice &amp; the head is small enough to get anywhere you want to trim.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my boyfriend and he used it about 2-3 times. When he went to use it a couple of days ago, it did not work. I try replacing the battery but still did not turn on. So this product will not be recommended to anyone.</li>
            <li> Tremendo funcionamiento</li>
            <li> Works well, long battery life, and easy to clean.  I&#x27;ve dropped it on the tile a few times and it still works great.</li>
            <li> I am hair stylist and been using it every day on my male clients.  It works perfect. so buy it, you can not go wrong.</li>
            <li> I used it 20 times and speed and sharpness not diminished. It gets works on skin creases of face where electric shaver has a hard time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Not painful. Does a good  job. Would buy again. Very quiet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product. The downfalls are it is a little bulky. I&#x27;d probably buy something rechargeable next time but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I purchased this in December of 2013 - and the thing didn&#x27;t last even for one year. It eats batteries, the blades seem &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; even on first time use, etc. I can&#x27;t believe that these have an average rating of four and one-half stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I just had to return and make certain that I didn&#x27;t give this but one star. Going on almost three years, now, I tried it out again. Tried four different batteries. Doesn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;eat&amp;#34; batteries so much as it just won&#x27;t work, period, with brand new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to buy Panasonic products TOO much, I think, as they&#x27;re generally middle-of-the-road in quality and price. No more: it&#x27;s a false economy.</li>
            <li> Does the job, hasn&#x27;t cut me, hasn&#x27;t broken (had it a year) and is pretty mild on the batteries.  You&#x27;re buying a nose-hair trimmer, not an iPad.  What more do you need to know?</li>
            <li> It does what the product description says and is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Bought it cuz I&#x27;ve got a bush up my nose. I&#x27;m glad that I&#x27;ve got it for the price it does wonders.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it so far, he mainly uses it for his nose.  I tried it once myself.  It doesn&#x27;t pull hair, it cleans up easily, there&#x27;s no &amp;#34;accidentally hitting the button too easily&amp;#34;, &amp; it&#x27;s very comfy for the hand.  It does its job well.</li>
            <li> Came ahead of scheduled delivery, works great!    After using this 5 times it stopped working, changed the battery, still doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Nobody likes to see stray hairs. It&#x27;s disgusting. This keeps my husband&#x27;s ear hair in check. It keeps him presentable. I am surprised this neat little gadget was so affordable.</li>
            <li> Exactly works as advertised</li>
            <li> No issues with it so far. Works well.</li>
            <li> Excellent device. I&#x27;ve used is many times since becoming an orifice werewolf. It sucks getting old, but this trimmer makes it a bit easier. Really easy to clean, too. I plan to use it as a stocking stuffer for the rest of my werewolf clan.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times now and it works great. I think the quality is just so-so but for what it needs to do it&#x27;s great. I feel that in might not last a really long time but I will continue to update. Please let me know if you have any questions.</li>
            <li> do not waste your money. this gadget I dropped from  my nose to the sink. since that moment it doesnt work. is disposable</li>
            <li> Battery that was included was dead, but after putting in a new one, all was well. Works well and is painless.</li>
            <li> Worked well but broke after after about a year.</li>
            <li> It was good while it worked, which was 3 or 4 times. It just won&#x27;t turn on any more. I tried two fresh batteries, nothing. Junk.</li>
            <li> works great, keeps my nose hairs at bay. would recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great and is cheap. Even if it only lasts a few months it was only $12.</li>
            <li> Pros.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;*Fast in removing hair but not very powerful but gets the job done.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to clean on wash mode turn switch on the device.&lt;br /&gt;*Needs on one AA Battery.&lt;br /&gt;*does not bite your skin.&lt;br /&gt;*easy to hold&lt;br /&gt;*good design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;*easy to lose the cap.&lt;br /&gt;*the tip gets hot with cutting friction for prolong use.&lt;br /&gt;*should have been bit more powerful</li>
            <li> Dammit. But only on small sections. Good stuff though! Especially on the cleaning mechanism. Probably one of the smartest ideas for a shaver I&#x27;ve seen</li>
            <li> Works great. Note that it needs one AA battery (not included).</li>
            <li> Works well but instructions for cleaning do not match device.  Still have not figured out how to clean it.  I have had a couple other people look at and they cannot figure it out either.</li>
            <li> This works as described. If I would ever need another one I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> This is my first nose/facial hair trimmer and it&#x27;s quite simple to use. Cuts the hair right off and easy to clean the device.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend if you don&#x27;t like tweezers and can&#x27;t stand even a smallest amount of pain! The nose trim took 2 minutes and was absolutely painless!</li>
            <li> The overall shape and usage of this product are nice and simple, which is great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t come with any sort of protective case, instead it just comes with a little cap that can easily pop off. Also, it would be nice if they had different settings for the razor, but there is just the one on/off switch. Otherwise, it&#x27;s a good product! Small, compact and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> this is a very neat trimmer.  I was skeptical that it might pull the hair but it does the job very nicely.  I actually bought one for myself and then bought another for my husband.</li>
            <li> I feel safe that it won&#x27;t cut inside my nose nor pull hair. I hope my nose hair grows fast enough, can&#x27;t stop of using it.</li>
            <li> Much better than I thought.</li>
            <li> broke after 3rd use.  worthless.</li>
            <li> It works painlessly. Helps me stay groomed and the battery seems to last a decent amount of time. I haven&#x27;t had to change it yet.</li>
            <li> I actually can&#x27;t believe I am reviewing a nose hair trimmer. When did I get hair in my nose that needed trimming? This is another milestone in my life,along with bifocals and other accoutrements of aging. I&#x27;m shocked.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway..this little thing works very well.Plowed down the embarrassing hair I never paid attention to.(Why didn&#x27;t anyone tell me?? I mean,it couldn&#x27;t be braided or anything,but it was noticeable.) There is no pulling or plucking or tugging until your eyes tear up with this.Just stick it in there,move it around and that&#x27;s it. NO pain. I also got carried away with it and now have one and a half eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;All kidding aside,this little thing is marvelous!! It fixed a problem and did it quickly and neatly. It is a small appliance and tucks away quickly. I really like this thing and since it is from Panasonic,I know it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had three of these Panasonic trimmers, and not one of them lasted longer than a year.</li>
            <li> It does the job it says it will. Not too loud, which is nice. It&#x27;s effective.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this and have used it a few times and it&#x27;s great so far. For $10 it works well, is easy to clean and has a fairly sharp blade. It does occasionally pull on some long hairs but is pain free for the most part and is much better than using tweezers.</li>
            <li> Works well! It DOES seem to heat up after about 5 minutes of usage but doesn&#x27;t affect it and I probably shouldn&#x27;t be taking that long.</li>
            <li> Thirty dollar stainless still sharp scissors from two decades ago aren&#x27;t this easy. Scissors don&#x27;t do as good of a job on your own ears either. I had to go over the same spot twice to get rid of the hair, but the hair is gone now.</li>
            <li> This is very nice, works just as we needed it to with unnecessary hairs.  Worth it!!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased one of those a couple of months ago. During my recent move I lost my old one and I&#x27;m reordering this same model. It&#x27;s a great product and very affordable.</li>
            <li> This is a reasonably priced item, small and versatile!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure on the long term how durable this is, however for the price I don&#x27;t expect it will last for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had an ancient Panasonic trimmer for, well, ever.  With replacement blades and nose assembly no longer available, I was due, overdue, for an update.  The good: Old unit wasn&#x27;t waterproof, new one not only is, but is much easier to clean with its flow through cutter head feature.  Cutters also act on the end of the unit, yielding faster and more consistent results.  It is also much quieter in operation, which makes trimming ear hair possible without destroying your hearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The not quite as good: Old unit was easy on the battery, I had one alkaline last for years and the one that&#x27;s in it is only the third I&#x27;ve ever had to put into it.  New one seems to be harder on the battery, take more juice to work, so I&#x27;ll be surprised if a brand new battery lasts 6 months.  New one is significantly larger, but that also makes it easier to grasp, so sort of a trade off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Build quality is excellent, as one expects from Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I was overdue for an update and I&#x27;m pleased with this choice.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had an easier time trimming my nose hairs. Excellent purchase.</li>
            <li> instructrons not clear, battery used up too quickly.  I am not satisfied at all.</li>
            <li> Bought two of these as gifts and the receivers loved it! Easy to use and works great!</li>
            <li> It works great for trimming my nose, ear and bushy eyebrow hairs that seem to have grown into a Forrest of unmanageable brush. I was thinking about buying a weed whacker but this was a better buy and less susceptible to injury and a trip to the hospital. Thanks Amazon!</li>
            <li> This one actually works!  It looks the same as many of the others Panasonic put out in the in the past, but it actually works and works well - bravo!  They finally got it right.</li>
            <li> I have the battery problem that everyone else has but on mine if you take the battery cover off and move the battery around it will turn on. However, I can&#x27;t seem to find a logical reason why it turns on if you wiggle the battery around. I was hoping I could fix it by stuffing a shim in there or whatever. If anyone else has figured out a solution please let me know. It seems to work fine once it powers up. I&#x27;ve had it for a while now and its been like that from day 1.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for months now and it is great.  The cut is clean and comfortable, no pulling.  It fits the hand well and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several over the years and they were all lousy, causing pain when they pull on the hair. This one is comfortable, right-sized, cleans easily with water, takes standard batteries, is quiet, and is virtually pain-free. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This little guy does the job nicely if you take your time and have a fresh battery.  It allows me to trim the hairs inside my ear down to a level where they don&#x27;t make scratchy sounds against my hearing aids.</li>
            <li> Works very well and very easy to clean. I&#x27;ve not used others so don&#x27;t have a good reference point but can&#x27;t really see what else they could offer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used a personal groomer like this before, so I have nothing to compare it to. I&#x27;ll try a pros/cons list:  Pro: Easy cleaning - just turn the top portion, run some water through, and you&#x27;re done Ergonomic/light weight Cuts hair  Cons: Gets hot after about 20 seconds of operation. The manual says as much, but putting hot metal up my nose is uncomfortable I often need to make two or three passes to pick up the hair  Overall, it seems like a decent trimmer at a good price.  If my experience changes, so will my review.</li>
            <li> It cleans easier than the older versions but doesn&#x27;t cut hair as well</li>
            <li> Worked 4 or 5 times okay, but now doesn&#x27;t work at all.  The one by Andis worked better/laster longer imo.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old one I had.  The head design is superior to others, in that it cuts much more consistently at the tip.  Seems well made.  Price is good.</li>
            <li> The unit is compact, easy to clean, fits snugly in the nostril and adequately performs its designated task.  The only drawback (nose-stubble) is likely universal to all nose hair trimmers.  I can&#x27;t bring myself to rate it higher because I resent its necessity.  This is not the product&#x27;s fault.  This world is an unfair and cruel one, and even the best of us can be petty sometimes.</li>
            <li> This is an effective trimmer that is easy to clean.  The battery seems to last a long time.  I have had this one several months and the original battery is still fine.</li>
            <li> Nothing to say, works as expected, just want to rate it with stars and move on to something else.  So...</li>
            <li> I just crawled out from under a rock and bought a proper nose/ear hair trimmer. Based on the reviews, I chose this one. I used to use very sharp, pointy, tiny scissors to do those two jobs. I can&#x27;t count how many times I stabbed myself. What a dope.&lt;br /&gt;It was like moving a century into the future with this thing.&lt;br /&gt;Zero pain and very effective at ear and nose hair removal. It&#x27;s also very easy to disassemble and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I love it.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose clippers I have used.</li>
            <li> I feel really old having to say I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; this nose and ear hair trimmer, but it isn&#x27;t my first of this kind of grooming tool so I can say it is a good unit.  What makes it work so well, I think, is that the design allows for flow through blade cleaning without disassembly. &#x27;So after each use it is simple and quick enough to just twist open the cleaning port, shoot some clean cold tap water through it, give a shake, and put it away.  Also, the cutting head has notches to allow hair to enter both on the top of the tip and from the sides. That makes &#x27;blind&amp;#34; trimming, like in the outer ear, easier and quicker and more effective.  I&#x27;ve been using this unit for about a year now and the batter is still good; since motors drain batteries quite quickly, and I use this cutter at least once a month, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty good.</li>
            <li> Product has lasted less than a year with very light use. Had trouble from the beginning getting it to turn on. Was not a battery problem as I tried fresh batteries. I also tried adjusting the battery tabs, still no improvement. Bottom line, its a very low quality product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve turned this thing on and stuck it up my nose, and when I remove it, my nose has less hair in it.  So yeah, it works.</li>
            <li> It worked for 5 minutes then stopped working</li>
            <li> Piece of junk.  I keep buying these $10.00 junk nose clippers, I need to upgrade.!!</li>
            <li> I am so sick and tired of these trimmer reviews. As everyone who follows this thread knows, a few years ago Panasonic had a very fine product, the er 411. Panasonic has since gone backwards. This model is barely acceptable. It is very slow, but will eventually get the job done. It is better than anything else on the market, which isn&#x27;t saying much. C&#x27;mon Panasonic! What was wrong with the er 411?</li>
            <li> Gift to my Dad.  It works great.</li>
            <li> This ear and nose hair trimmer barely runs--almost from the start, it slowed down and sounds as though the battery is low, but the battery is new. Perhaps a little light oil on the blade would lessen the resistance...</li>
            <li> Not much to say here.  Easy to clean, works well, does what it is advertised to do.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, well made, and cheap. I was expecting it to tickle and I thought I&#x27;d be sneezing out bits of nose hairs all day, but surpringly it is very comfortable and most hair ends up in the trimmer. It is easy to clean. Only thing is I wish it had a rechardable battery, but for the price I don&#x27;t mind putting in a AA battery, which I haven&#x27;t needed to replace since I got it 6 months ago.</li>
            <li> I have used several different nose hair trimmers but this one works the best for me.  It cuts fast, doesn&#x27;t injure the user and is lightweight without being cheap.  I use it on my nose, ears and sometimes eyebrows.  It is easy to clean and the batteries never need to be changed.  This product definitely gets my vote as a morning-must!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY THIS TRIMMER!  Stopped working after one use.  Never used water on this unit, thinking that I may damaged a previous unit by cleaning the tip with water.  This is the worst product ever made.  I have previously purchased one other that stopped working after uses in the &amp;#34;single digits&amp;#34;.  Just stops turning on.  Terrible Product Quality/Design!!!    Fool me twice...</li>
            <li> - Cutting unwanted ear, nose, eyebrow hair?&lt;br /&gt;- Join the club, my friend...&lt;br /&gt;- Unit is very quiet, nicely angled, amply powered, easy to maneuver, easy to clean, and runs on one standard AA battery. Cuts hairs cleanly without pulling, so far. - What&#x27;s not to like? (except the task itself...). Can&#x27;t comment on longevity, but quite pleased with overall quality. Do your friends, wives, girlfriends a favor, and stay groomed.... especially there. They&#x27;ll certainly appreciate it.</li>
            <li> I just purchased the product so I cannot discuss its durability, but it performs really well taking care of my husband&#x27;s nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> I have used that for 3-4 times since I bought it. It is very easy to use and I have not found anything negative about it.</li>
            <li> I´ve been using this product for several months and have no complains about it; it trims very well and does not hurt the inside of your nose tissues while doing it. I would recomend this product as it fulfilled my needs at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It is not expensive and serves the purpose. It is always advisable not to pluck hair and scissors is anyways risky specially if you want to cut hair in your nose. I thought to give this product a try and i was very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> My husband said it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> It works. Husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy way to trim nose hair. Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used scissors from time to time, but this makes life so much easier! Apparently you can replace the blade after a suggested three years, but for the price of the unit (I paid $10), I don&#x27;t see there being a need. Anyway, a couple of minutes in each nostril and I&#x27;m good to go for a long time! You&#x27;ll need to supply your own battery.</li>
            <li> I dropped my 10 year old Conair trimmer and was in need of a replacement.  I picked this up about a month ago. This work great - better than what I had which I really liked.  I like that you can rinse this and not have to worry about damaging.</li>
            <li> very well functioning trimmer. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to . I&#x27;m definitely happy with this purchase. A necessary piece of every mans medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> Worked one time. Second time Dead as a doornail.</li>
            <li> The interior of my nose is hair-free as a result of using this fine device. And it&#x27;s washable under a stream of water while operating. All my friends have thanked me for buying it.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on the good reviews I read. Once I received the trimmer I was a little skeptical as it did look like the previous trimmers I had bough from the superstores. I could not see the blades and could fathom how it worked. But boy was I wrong. This little thing works great! You can hear it go to work on the unwanted hair. Great product at a good price! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> works very well and is very thorough</li>
            <li> This thing is a lawnmower, lol.  Works really well.  Buy it for sure.</li>
            <li> I last one died after 3 years, so replaced with this new model.  This one may have too many options than I needed.</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping that it would solve my trouble cutting nose hair. It does the job if done with care but it tends to stall somewhat.</li>
            <li> Used it for a month and then all of a sudden it stopped working. it turns on but does not trim anything. first i thought that i had weak batteries but putting in new one did not help. still turns on but works as if its on low power and does not trim anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy who is somewhat of a gorilla. This is PERFECT for eyebrows and nose. it is not painless at all and works fast. No more paying 8-10$ to get my eye brows done! and no more using scissors extremely carfully afraid of making my nose bleed and pain. Thanks panasonic! awesome.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer - handy, easy to use and does not pull or hurt the face in any way. Good trimmer</li>
            <li> This is a significant improvement over previous nose trimmers.  It&#x27;s extraordinarily quiet and cuts effectively.  Moreover, the price is very reasonable.  I highly recommend it. Update: this stopped working after about a month.  In looking at reviews on the Panasonic website, this is a fairly frequent complaint  Made in China!  Need I say more?</li>
            <li> I have owned several nose hair trimmers over the years but this one is by far the best. Gets all the hair and is super easy to clean being a wet dry.</li>
            <li> Does the job and is quite and does not pull hair! I would highly suggest all men buy this model.</li>
            <li> I HAD AN OLDER VERSION OF THIS THAT LASTED 10 YEARS THIS ONE HAS LASTED LESS THAN A YEAR DONT BUY IT</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product, works great, well made.</li>
            <li> Works as described and trims with no nicks or pulled hair. Happy so far keeps my nose hair in check.</li>
            <li> It works well and doesn&#x27;t leave those sharp little prickles that other machines do.  Very quiet too so the whole world doesn&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing.</li>
            <li> Works exactly how described. Worth the $$. Very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> liked mine and the sale price was so great that I also Bought 2 as gifts</li>
            <li> If you are in need of trimmed hair, this is your product.  The blade/motor spin quickly which reduces hair from being yanked out from your skin.  Make sure the battery is newer and the blade is clean and you won&#x27;t have any problems with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last one that I had only lasted a year.  It needed a blade replacement.  The blade replacement was the same price as a new product, so I decided to purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Does the job but it is overpriced as far as I am concerned; a luxury that I could just as well do without.</li>
            <li> If you need it, it works.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and it doesn&#x27;t hurt!!!</li>
            <li> Works fine. Seems to have a sharp blade.</li>
            <li> It works. No problems</li>
            <li> This get&#x27;s the job done. I think it does a better job than others in it&#x27;s price range. Actually, I can&#x27;t really imagine more expensive products doing a better job than this one.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see how it can be a &amp;#34;Facial&amp;#34; hair trimer. Its just a nose hair trimmer, but it works great. IT..Like...cuts my nose hair.</li>
            <li> Cheapest one I found and it works.  Does not get everything the first time and tickles but that is expected.</li>
            <li> It does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy.  It&#x27;s quick.  It&#x27;s safe.  And they say you rarely have to change the batteries - which makes sense since most people don&#x27;t use it for more than a few seconds every couple weeks or so, I imagine.  At least that&#x27;s the case with me.</li>
            <li> easy use and cleaning. Trim hair in the nose well.&lt;br /&gt;One of things that needs to improve is the packaging. It&#x27;s not easy to open and the cut blister might hurt people.</li>
            <li> The product arrived broken. Contacted Panasonic. Although all the customer service people were nice, the Panasonic policy is: Damaged product. Here&#x27;s the address for our repair facility. You pay shipping and wait for the repaired item to be returned to you. This policy is stated in the Warranty so tough luck. On the other hand Amazon gave me an instant full credit and sent me a label to print out so the I could sent back the product. Thank you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Gave it to my husband as a gift because he&#x27;s wanted a good quality trimmer. He is very pleased with it! Fast shipping, Recommend!</li>
            <li> Quit working after 6 weeks.  Just over the 30 day return policy with Amazon on the product.  MAYBE I simply got a lemon.  Thought I was safe with so many reviews.  Move on.</li>
            <li> The previous reviews were so right as far as &amp;#34;no pulls&amp;#34;, cuts.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product highly and I will order for my wife</li>
            <li> I like this product because it works. Only thing I did not like was it uses AA batteries and seems to be low on power. But then again it works fine so maybe it is supposed to be low on power.</li>
            <li> This is good for trimming nose,ear and facial hair. Ive never used it wet so I can&#x27;t comment on that. Its been holding up for a while. Nothing much to complain about.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the quality and power of this trimmer. It will cut the coarsest of of facial and nose hair.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted a new nose hair trimmer for awhile.  This was exactly what he needed.  He loves it and so far it it working perfectly.  I would recommend.</li>
            <li> Have had this a couple weeks, very easy and painless to use to get rid of unwanted hair. Wish I had thought to get this sooner.</li>
            <li> My husband really liked this this trimmer for his random nose and ear hairs.  Easy to use and much better than his previous Shaper Image trimmer, which was more expensive.  He highly recommends this Panasonic model.</li>
            <li> THE BEST I EVER TRIED! It works so well. I tried others way more expensive and yet this worked so much better</li>
            <li> This little devil works great.  I&#x27;ve trimmed ear hair, nose hair, and beard hair around the lip - all without issue.  I was worried about pinching of the lip, but no issue.  It cuts quick and easy without pulling, even on the coarse facial beard hair.  It is a little loud, but that&#x27;s not a huge concern for me.  It is washable, which is nice.  It&#x27;s small, compact, and curved to fit the hand firmly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Requires 1 AA battery that&#x27;s not provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with this trimmer and would suggest it to others.</li>
            <li> It works great.  No pulling.  I love it.  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12</li>
            <li> Does a very nice job - quick and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;You do need to use it regularly.. maybe 1 time per week or so...&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t press hard against the inside of your nose or it may pinch the skin!</li>
            <li> I really like how you can take it in the shower with you if you need to quickly trim those unsightly hairs.  It doesn&#x27;t get all the hairs at once, so you will have to go at it for a bit.  However, this is a great trimmer and well worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> I do not like the fact that this only runs on batteries. No wall socket plug in &#x3D; not convenient.</li>
            <li> I use this one or two time then is not working, very low quality</li>
            <li> Great price can&#x27;t wait to try it</li>
            <li> Works as adervertised. Hurts like hell. You&#x27;ll have to make the call yourself if the pain is worth it.</li>
            <li> Simple to clean.  Simple to use.  I like simple.</li>
            <li> Good. But I like the Norelco better</li>
            <li> I bought many nose clipper and this is among the best amazing product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer a couple of times but its the only one that will actually work. so far so good</li>
            <li> Ok blades seems not to be that great</li>
            <li> Exceeded my expectation.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked really well, but did not last a year. I used it about five or six times. It worked fine the last time I used it a month or so ago. I put it away and when I took it out the next time, it was dead. Changed the battery--still no go. I am so sick of stuff being made so cheaply.</li>
            <li> Great device, that is light, convenient to handle, and efficient.</li>
            <li> Use it every week. Works really well.</li>
            <li> Everything I had hoped for and everything I needed.  I say to it, &amp;#34;you are so beautiful, to me.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems from this product. It works well and doesn&#x27;t cause any pain.</li>
            <li> Really efficient product! Already recommended it to all my friends.</li>
            <li> Works very well,  I have not used a whole lot just yet,  but big improvement over my previous device.  Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Not a fan of this device.  I have tried two of these and both have stopped working within a few weeks.  Panasonic has always gone above and beyond in my book but this device seems cheaply put together.  The problem I think I was having was a battery compartment issue.  The connections did not seem to hold properly.  I would look elsewhere for a facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This works well, better than the mangroomer one I had before.  That lasted only a couple weeks, and was problematic from day one.  This one is a little more solid.  Easy to disassemble for cleaning, but as with most of these, doesn&#x27;t really seem to spin very quickly.  I kept half expecting a sharp stab of pain as a hair was ripped out painfully, but it did a good job of cutting.  Other than a little tickling it did the job well and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Little noise, great price, and comes with a cap to top it off.  Good deal.</li>
            <li> I had trouble turning it on until It finally stopped working. The battery connection is bad. If I hold the bottom of the battery outside its slot, then it works.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the fact I can wash this.</li>
            <li> Finally the perfect trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I have spent years using lousy trimmers which were difficult to clean and didn&#x27;t do a decent job of trimming. It was nice to finally find a good trimmer at a low price. I was also glad that it isn&#x27;t a rechargeable trimmer, it becomes annoying having to frequently charge a trimmer for long periods of time just to have them run down quickly.</li>
            <li> inexpensive, and works as promised. use it for nose and ear hair every once in a while and it hasn&#x27;t let me down.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work, I give up on these they just don&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> I give it only 4 stars because I have only had the trimmer for a month. It works great so far but I am not sure of the longevity, although there are no signs of it breaking yet.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a year now and it still works like a charm and does exactly as advertised. Easy to clean,easy to use well worth the money if your thinking about buying it.</li>
            <li> Great for nose hair. Haven&#x27;t tried it anywhere else. Fast shipping! Thanks!</li>
            <li> My husband didn&#x27;t have much luck with electric trimmers before.  But this one actually works, he says!  And I saw the results - it actually trimmed his nose hairs and ear hairs quite short with almost no discomfort.  For the coup de grace, he trimmed the monobrow connector at the top of his nose (something I have to keep reminding him to do), and it worked almost as well as tweezers, in much less time, with much less pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean, too.  All told, a good product.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it.  He says it cuts the nose hair down to the nub without irritation.  East to use and powerful.</li>
            <li> So far, so good. Have had it for 2 months, no issues</li>
            <li> Works well and is 100% pain free</li>
            <li> So far a very good product but (maybe all are the same) it feels just a little flimsy. But it does work really well.</li>
            <li> If I have to be at the age where this has become necessary, it&#x27;s nice to have a tool that makes it easy, clean and painless. Hooray!</li>
            <li> My husband is happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works well for hair nose, eyebrows, or precision detail-shaving of moustaches of beards. It&#x27;s way more powerful than the last one I had. The only issue is that it didn&#x27;t come with a AA battery, so that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t rate it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> works well, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> Does the job perfectly. No pulling of the hair or any sort of pain while using it. Does tickle the nose a little at first, but one gets used to that. Also great for trimming up the eyebrows and for getting the hairs close to the nose. Runs quietly and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> No TMI here.  Nuff said when I say it works well</li>
            <li> I got this trimmer for my elderly father to use.  It is small and compact, and easy to use.  It doesn&#x27;t make much noise, much quieter than a traditional shaver.  It is small enough to easily fit into a nostril or ear and actually cuts the hair, rather than ripping them out like another brand he tried.  It is safe, cutting only hair and not skin.  The batteries seem to last forever which is a definite plus.  Be careful when opening the package for the first time as some of the parts are extremely small and fell out when the package was opened.</li>
            <li> No more itchen!  This little shaver gits all the hairs real dang good and I&#x27;m sure dang proud to own it even though it&#x27;s probably made in China.  Lord bless them people over there even though they&#x27;re taken our jobs and I don&#x27;t have no money in the bank.  I am a happy man and ma hairs ain&#x27;t itchin me no more!  Hot damb!  I really am happy today even though I don&#x27;t got no dough.  Think I&#x27;ll go git me a chick with ma new good looks and eat me an organic apple for breakfeast instead of meat!  That stuff just clogs ma arteries.  Been having chest pains and ma right arms hurts.  lol!  Must be all that Mcdonalds food I used to eat coming back at me!  Just like a clogged sewer pipe.  I gots to go now but I jsut want to say that I sure luv this shaver.    God bless ya,  Brett</li>
            <li> I use the Panasonic product for ear and nose hair.  It is very effective and amazingly quiet.  Easy to clean.  Does a great job.  I&#x27;m very happy I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted.  Most noticeable is the velocity with which the blades turn; very fast.  Nothing to criticize.</li>
            <li> As this is my first nose and facial hair trimmer, I don&#x27;t have much to compare with. It is doing what I expect. It cuts nose and ear hair well.   After only a couple weeks it seems to be slowing down. It seems that the batteries should last longer than that. Maybe that is my lack of understanding on how to clean it.  I would get it again, but again, I have only had it a couple weeks.   [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]]</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic product in this line.  Just bought this one because my other is better for travel.  This product works outstanding and was worth every cent paid.  Works as advertised.  Not much more you can really ask for.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean. No complaints. Solid product.</li>
            <li> Great stocking stuffer!</li>
            <li> Does not cut very well. But it works...</li>
            <li> This trimmer works perfect. It tickles a bit but no big deal. I&#x27;m sure they all do that. I love the fact that it uses one AA Battery. This way you don&#x27;t have to set it on a charger rather you can just throw it in a drawer.&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast&lt;br /&gt;easy to use &amp; clean&lt;br /&gt;washable&lt;br /&gt;1 AA battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;it should come with a supermodel to do it for you.</li>
            <li> I recommend it without a doubt...this trimmer saved my nose from hairy days..</li>
            <li> Home run here. This trimmer is fast, strong, and convenient. The Panasonic ER-GN30-K has never had a problem with my hair while I have used it to trim my nose, ear and even a little bit over my lip.&lt;br /&gt;What matters in trimmers from what I&#x27;ve learned is the thickness of your hair. Everyone has different thickness and growth. My hair is quite thin, blonde and light. One AA battery and this thing has been flawless. Im always scared that it will pinch or pull - but never had it happen with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item without a doubt. For the price (I ordered some other items, making shipping free) it is worth every penny. You dont want a 2 dollar trimmer. You do get what you pay for, but theres no reason to spend a mint on something when this works great.</li>
            <li> To quote George Kastanza \\&quot;your ears, your knuckles, your nose, you got to stay vigilant.\\&quot; Product works great. Chicks don&#x27;t dig nose hair.</li>
            <li> First of all, it has an ergonomic design, it is very easy to hold it. It&#x27;s trimming performance is also very satisfying for me. As a result, I think it is a great product. I really liked it and have been using for a few months without any issues.</li>
            <li> A handy dandy grooming tool.  I bought this some years ago and it is still going strong.  It does the job quickly, easily and thoroughly. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many of these types of trimmers, this one is by far the best that I have ever used. It is designed to clean very easily.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer on the market because its the only trimmer that works inside my nostrils without hurting me. The flat trimmers don&#x27;t work.  Great Price.</li>
            <li> I have used the trimmer twice and has done a good job. I had another trimmer awhile ago but this one seems to be of better quality.</li>
            <li> Best nose trimmer I have owned to date!</li>
            <li> Nice tool for trimming ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li> What nice product works very good and quick.Everyone I know were told about this website. Thank You Golden Bird</li>
            <li> Sturdy. Gets at ALL DIFFICULT to reach&lt;br /&gt; facial hair.</li>
            <li> Worked great for six months.  Not working now.  Cheaply Made</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this for a couple of weeks, but it works very well and was a great price. I&#x27;ve had no discomfort (such as pulling hairs) at all. It&#x27;s not very heavy, but it feels solid and durable.I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 2013 update: I still have this trimmer and it has been great. It works just like it did when I bought it - smooth trimming with no discomfort. If you can get this item for under fifteen dollars, I would consider it a good deal.</li>
            <li> got this item as a gift, works great so far. my only issue is that they did not make a holder on the unit for the cleaning brush. im pretty sure i will lose the cleaning brush eventually since its always separated from the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;over all it&#x27;s great, worth the buy. no more comments from my fiance</li>
            <li> The item works well so long as it&#x27;s functioning. Mine broke after 2 uses. Had high hopes for the product but the durability is poor. I didn&#x27;t even get use it in the shower or anything. Moving to the Wahl products now.</li>
            <li> My first nose hair trimmer had scarred me for life, because every time I tried to use it, I felt like I was being tortured. The Panasonic ER-GN30-K changed the way I looked at nose hair trimming. Its quiet, quick, and efficient. The fact that it can be rinsed underwater is a great part of the bargain. You seriously feel nothing; all you hear is the hairs being trimmed. Don&#x27;t be afraid to put it against your noise \\&quot;walls.\\&quot; The last trimmer I had cut them, but this one is elegant and efficient, never missing a hair. If you want a comfortable, practically pleasant experience, buy this product.</li>
            <li> Does a great job , very easy to clean, reliable and simple to use. I have had the unit for about a year with no problems.</li>
            <li> I just tested it. I have to say it&#x27;s great to have something to trim my nose hair. This product just did that. The only thing i don&#x27;t like is I felt it&#x27;s pulling my nose hair a little bit when i use it. But it&#x27;s safy enough.  One more thing, the plastic package is very difficult to open. Anybody knows an easier way to do it?</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic ear/nose trimmer.  The first one stopped working after about a year.  I thought I might have just gotten a defective one.  So I ordered this one since it had excellent reviews.  It worked for maybe 10 uses, then the motor started slowing down.  I replaced it with a new AA battery and it still ran slow.  I cleaned it well but to no avail.  Then it started making a grinding noise from the blade area.  This thing doesn&#x27;t work well and I will never buy a Panasonic trimmer again.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and the first time I went to use it it wouldn&#x27;t cut any hairs and had very little power to it. I changed the batteries several times with new ones. I think mine was defective because you couldn&#x27;t even hear it running. Amazon gave me a refund.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. Very pleased. Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Very simple but good design. High quality.</li>
            <li> It gets all those embarrassing nose hairs.  It&#x27;s washable too, which is a big plus.  And it only uses one battery.</li>
            <li> Got for someone else.  They liked it and made well.</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer once and then took it on a 2-week business trip.  When I tried to use it a second time, it wouldn&#x27;t operate.  When I got home, I tried a different battery but it still wouldn&#x27;t work.  I had another model of Panasonic trimmer that stopped working after a few months.  I&#x27;m through with Panasonic trimmers.  In addition to quitting after a short time, they also go through batteries very quickly.  I&#x27;ve ordered a Groom Mate Platinum XL Plus - Nose Hair Trimmer.  It&#x27;s manual so I don&#x27;t have to worry about conking out or using up batteries.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose &amp; ear hair trimmer ever. After having tried and given up on many other brands, I am extremely grateful to have discovered one that actually works the way I hoped it would. The tip is smooth and rounded and fits perfectly into odd shaped nasal and aural cavities. The blades are really sharp &amp; fast, so no hairs get pulled. It delivers a clean, fast cut, and is easy and quick to clean. The slightly bent body is ergonomically designed to perfectly fit in the hand. I should mention that I think its smallish size makes it ideal for travel, and for the hand size of most women, and smaller guys. Big beefy men with large hands may find this trimmer a bit light and small, but it works beautifully!</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer works great for me! It cuts shorter (more like trimmers used to)so I feel like I had the nose hairs trimmed, rather than feeling hairs that still need trimmed when I breathe. We ordered another for my wife. As long as this trimmer keeps working, I give it 5 stars. I also like how you can turn the dial and clean it under the faucet...it pumps the water thru and cleans it out! Cool!</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer does exactly as advertised. It cuts hair easily without any pain. It is very quiet and lightweight. Very easy to use and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a ear/nose hair trimmer. It&#x27;s a very good product and the price is good, too.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It&#x27;s quiet and effectively does its job.  I use it for nose hair and also stray facial and body hairs.  At a relatively inexpensive price, it&#x27;s a great investment.</li>
            <li> works great and is quieter than I was expected</li>
            <li> Really good for the nose</li>
            <li> My husaband loves this but he just wishes the blade was smaller. Overall good though.</li>
            <li> I have a really hairy nose, and this little gizmo does a great job of trimming the werewolfness away! I use to have a different brand one, I believe it was Braun and this one is significantly better.</li>
            <li> Greatest product of my life. If you don&#x27;t have one I would suggest you get one. It reaches well in the nose and the sound of the nose hair getting trimmed is so...in a lack of a better word ~ satisfying.</li>
            <li> so far so good.  kind of cheap feeling, but consistent with the price.  Hopefully it will last a while.</li>
            <li> Works fine and if you have ever nicked your nostril with a manicure scissors you will appreciate this much safer method.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who now shaves his own head...thus no barber to tighten up the&lt;br /&gt;other places.  He likes it and I love not having to take care of this for him.</li>
            <li> GREATEST NOSE-HAIR TRIMMER I&#x27;VE USED.&lt;br /&gt;I have so much hair in my body, especially nose, so I have to trim it every one week.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used many different brands for nose trimmer, but they don&#x27;t last literally 6 months; they are flimsy, easily broken, and not working well. However, this product is very solid and easy to use and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of some products that are worth more than the price.</li>
            <li> I really like this clipper. It&#x27;s very easy to use and completely painless with wonderful results. I would highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> Ever had a nose hair trimmer that would \\&quot;tug\\&quot; on the hairs and pull them out rather than trim? Or one that would leave a hair or two untrimmed, making you spend the better part of an HOUR trying to cut that particular hair? Or a trimmer that wouldn&#x27;t reach certain areas of the nose, no matter how hard or deep you pressed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, this hair trimmer has none of those disadvantages. It&#x27;s the best on the market that trims neatly, completely, painlessly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy trimming!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean, nice build quality and great design.</li>
            <li> worst 15 dollars ever spent the thing worked one time and never again</li>
            <li> Needed a new one and this one &amp;#34;fits the bill&amp;#34;.  Works perfect!</li>
            <li> i just used it once and after one month i tried to use it again and it was already dead !!!!</li>
            <li> Best one I have ever owned!</li>
            <li> Very good nose and ear trimmer.</li>
            <li> Really works good on trimming my nose hairs. Easy to clean and uses one AA battery. Has a cap you can place on top when you are finished using it. I love it.</li>
            <li> This not a good trimmer</li>
            <li> Very well built and extremely easy to clean. I&#x27;ve had this for over a year and no issues.</li>
            <li> Sad I even need one, getting old sucks! LOL. This works pretty well. For nose hairs,change the batteries at even the slightest hint of loss of power (a lower pitched &amp;#34;hum&amp;#34;) because if you don&#x27;t, the blade will pull, instead of cut, the hair. Trust me if you don&#x27;t listen for it, you WILL feel a hair pulled instead of cut, and you WILL immediately change the batteries. I&#x27;m teaching you this, so you might not have to feel that torture. They say these devices, like my battery powered toothbrush, have circuitry that just cuts out the motor entirely if it senses low voltage. But I can tell you that, much like my battery powered toothbrush, I can audibly hear, and feel, the motor losing power...so that stuff is bunk.</li>
            <li> Great, as advertised, and my wife &amp;#34;borrows&amp;#34; it as well.  I used it for nose, eyebrows, and above-the-ear trim-ups.</li>
            <li> It worked fine, and still does as long as I change the battery every few uses. That ain&#x27;t good. It could be a faulty switch as the reason for it not turning on. Good batteries don&#x27;t go dead after 5 minutes of usage.</li>
            <li> good product, works as advertised</li>
            <li> Item is as described very happy with it would buy again</li>
            <li> I tried this one twice, but still can&#x27;t give more than 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this product a couple months ago, and when it came I was impressed.  My previous nose hair trimmer wasn&#x27;t as &amp;#34;nice looking&amp;#34; as this, nor was it as quiet.  However, after about 4 uses, the trimmer stopped turning on at all.  I tried swapping several batteries, but this did not help.&lt;br /&gt;After notifying Amazon of the issue, I had the item replaced with another one.  Nonetheless, after 3 or 4 uses, the trimmer completely stopped turning on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have a crazy amount of nose hair, so I&#x27;m not sure why these devices keep failing.  However, I do not recommend buying one as you will likely have to return/replace it.</li>
            <li> Great little unit to get rid of those nasty nose/ear hairs.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend. Broke after 1st use.</li>
            <li> It worked great for about four times. Today it is making a humming noise, but not cutting any hairs. Is there something I can do to fix it ?</li>
            <li> First class unit. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Works good, but I buy one every 9 months or so the battery contacts rot somehow.</li>
            <li> Perfect trimmer for my husband.  Now he can trim his own ears.</li>
            <li> Excellent little tool that does an pretty good job with nose hair.</li>
            <li> What a wonderful little item.  Specially great for nose and ears.</li>
            <li> Very quiet .best purchase ever</li>
            <li> The clean up is NOT easy and I do not notice a significant change after use. Would NOT recommend.</li>
            <li> Best nose ear and facial hair trimmer. Running strong after a year.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a stocking stuffer at Christmas. It hasn&#x27;t even been six weeks, and it just stopped working.  The return policy ended at 30 days. Guess we are out of luck unless I get a response to this review.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying this product if it won&#x27;t even last 2 months.</li>
            <li> Heats up, nit the most efficient but good enough not to bother with returning.</li>
            <li> Does EXACTLY what is needed.  Perfect product!!</li>
            <li> Product works well in the wet or dry; I&#x27;ve owned this for 6+ months and have not had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> Does a great job; had other trimmers that would miss or not get as close.  So far so good - hope it lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for a week then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on unless I shake it. It quit working completely after a month. It worked great But it was cheaply made.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk.  I used it one (1) time and now it doesn&#x27;t work and because it has been more than 30 days I can&#x27;t return it or exchange this defective one for one that works.because</li>
            <li> This is great  Use to use either a razor or scissors and was constantly cutting myself.  This does a much better job without the irritation.  Like the clean feature too.</li>
            <li> Worked for about 3 months and then died.  Save your money and buy something with a better design.</li>
            <li> Awesome Item exactly as described and VERY FAST SHIPPING</li>
            <li> Works very well, a little in the large side</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend because I couldn&#x27;t take his nose hair. It worked very well for him and is easy to use. I like that it is so easy to clean. Good buy!</li>
            <li> This works very well for nose and ear hair.  It isn&#x27;t too loud and is very powerful.  I&#x27;ve purchased a few over years and that combo is VERY hard to find.  Cleaning is super easy as you just twist off the tip and run it and the trimmer under water.  Best of all it runs off of a standard battery so you don&#x27;t have to worry about poor quality rechargeables that are often used in tools like this.</li>
            <li> I received it and it looked fine. When I put in a battery it sputtered a little bit and then stopped working. Now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. Haven&#x27;t gotten a single use out of it.</li>
            <li> Getting old sucks, but this can help out with unwanted hair growth.</li>
            <li> I love it! does the job and doesn&#x27;t kill the batteries</li>
            <li> Worked really well out of the package . It slipped from my hand and fell into the sink and left it broken and inoperable . At least it didn&#x27;t cost alot and now I know why .</li>
            <li> great product  works well</li>
            <li> comfortable ergonomic handle, cuts what needs to be cut. Thank you Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Great unit, great power option.  Keeps me trimmed perfectly and I love that I don&#x27;t have to plug this in and charge it.  Just pop in a freshly charged NiMH rechargeable and I&#x27;m off and trimming again.</li>
            <li> Excellent design and performance!</li>
            <li> Works Much Better that the older one I had!!</li>
            <li> Quick, easy to use.  Does not pull or pinch.  Easy to clean.  Does a good job, wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer , affordable price.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Keep the blade clean and clear, rinse often.  I&#x27;ve found that a strong rechargeable battery will work, but an alkaline with 1.5 volts is better.</li>
            <li> This one works, and gets the hair off the nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;Great solution for the hairy men...</li>
            <li> I have a hairy nose and this makes it seem like I was born without hair in my nose at all.  It&#x27;s got a weird shape like some erotic Batman toy, but it does the job so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Purchased this trimmer for my husband.  His Sharper Image trimmer finally died after a long life...  His concern was if this model would match the efficiency of the SI trimmer.  He was pleasantly surprised at the performance of the Panasonic trimmer and continues rave about it.</li>
            <li> Works great! Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product, works as it says. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This thing is cheap and does exactly what it states, and does it well. No further explanation needed, you should buy one.</li>
            <li> Works great!!  Wife no longer tries to pull my nose hairs!!</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of this trimmer that lasted for a decade, so I had no hesitation in going to Panasonic again.  I knew when I took it out of the box that I was in for disappointment.  The earlier model felt solid, well-built and lasted quite a long time.  The difference in materials and build quality is obvious.  I guess they don&#x27;t want them to last a decade anymore.  More money in their pockets if you have to replace it frequently.  Mine lasted for about a week.  Then, it began acting possessed.  I can get it to work on occasion if I unscrew the bottom cap and play with the positioning of the battery, but even then the RPMs rev up and down, the blade makes a grinding sound and the unit puts off a strange odor.  I wish Husqvarna or Honda made a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this little fella.  Works great and so easy to clean-up.  Definitely gonna order another one.</li>
            <li> Great device to combat nose hair. Rather you think you need it or not!</li>
            <li> After 2 months of use it gets really noisy, but it gets the work done.</li>
            <li> worked out perfectly.  Just what the old nose needed</li>
            <li> Works excellent I can finally breathe without a tickle inside my nose.</li>
            <li> I have had others so I was scared this one would be as ineffective and just gather dust in a drawer.  I thought I should have to pay more for a decent trimmer, but I was wrong.  It does what it is suppose to do and just what you need it to do.  Buy it!</li>
            <li> Cut close, cuts too close at time but good performance.</li>
            <li> As I got older nose hair become another grooming issue that I was not used to having to deal with. I used to use the nose trimmer attachment on a Panasonic trimmer and grooming tool, but I noticed it didn&#x27;t always do the best job. I decided that since there is not a cure for nose hair, and plucking them out is torture, it was time for a dedicated nose hair trimmer. This device is great, especially for the price. It is definitely more power than the attachment on the multi-function grooming tool. A quick pass through keeps nose hair at bay and I haven&#x27;t found a long one creeping out since I&#x27;ve started using this trimmer like I used to with the other tool.</li>
            <li> I have owned several of these same type nose and ear clippers but,  this one is super.&lt;br /&gt;Well made to last for many years of service.  Easy to clean and looks good too.</li>
            <li> Works great...time will tell.</li>
            <li> My husband says this trimmer works better than any other he has ever owned and has lasted longer as well!</li>
            <li> Does what is says and does it well.  Very easy to use and comes at a great price.  I recommend putting it near the area you want to trim first and then turn it on...otherwise the initial vibration is a bit startling.</li>
            <li> This is a great product but the second one I&#x27;ve purchased in 2 years.  The original one, the motor burnt out.  Its an affordable device so I don&#x27;t mind replacing it, just seems like it isn&#x27;t built for longevity which is why it loses two stars.  As far as functionality goes, it does a great job.  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of other trimmers out there, but this one and how it trims is the only way to go.</li>
            <li> Panasonic quality is apparent.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I really liked it for 6 months or so until it died. I took it apart, cleaned/oiled and checked contacts and it worked for a week and died again.</li>
            <li> Really works deep and right!</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my brother in law. Basically went off the reviews which majority were good ones!</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t work.  That says it all.  It looks like it does but it doesn&#x27;t.  People who sell this kind of stuff should have a hard time sleeping at night.</li>
            <li> This trimmer really works, unlike others I&#x27;ve purchased.  I used the previously published reviews to make a decision and I made the right choice.</li>
            <li> Works well but just a tad bit slow power.</li>
            <li> Amazon continues to exceed my expectations. Amazon is a great marketplace resource for the consumer. The Panasonic hair trimmer is great. I find customer reviews very persuasive.</li>
            <li> works much better for me than the &amp;#34;toothbrush&amp;#34; style trimmers. very comfortable to use and the results are great.</li>
            <li> This works very well for both me and my husband. While we each use it for different tasks, it covers all of the bases. With both of us using this product, I really like being able to rinse it with water. Cheap and good. Doesn&#x27;t get much better than that!  Six months later......... I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying this one. In less than four months, it stopped working. It couldn&#x27;t have been from over-use because right after I purchases it, I bought a ladies one for myself to use. My husband didn&#x27;t even run water on it. He also cleaned it after every use. The problem seems to be in the battery area. If I jiggled it, it would run for a little while. Sadly, my husband didn&#x27;t realize it had a two year warranty on it so he threw it away. We&#x27;ve bought many things over the years with the Panasonic name without issues so this was a disappointment.</li>
            <li> Gives me illusions of adequacy in close social situations.</li>
            <li> Now I can remove all nose hair good products</li>
            <li> Best product like this that I have fiund</li>
            <li> I bought two, one for me, and one for my step-son, since neither of us want to &amp;#34;share&amp;#34; this type of device.  Hardest part was figuring out how to open it to put the battery in (NOT hard at all)  Seems to do exactly what it is supposed to and is easy use and clean.  Thank you Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a few trimmers and this is the best so far.  The others would hurt.  the blades would not be able to cut and end up pulling.  This one protects your skin and only let&#x27;s the hairs into the cutting area.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality! Thank you.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband and honestly, wasn&#x27;t expecting much.... BUT, he actually uses it on a regular basis and hasn&#x27;t had one negative thing to say about it!  Most definitely one of my best purchases here on Amazon.com!  Would definitely recommend this item!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before I bought this and it paid off. This is a great product. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Great battery life. If you&#x27;ve got stubborn ear and nose hair, incorporate this trimmer into your grooming ritual. Someone will thank you for it, expressed of implied.</li>
            <li> Nice ergonomic design. Trims hair easily.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer. It works well and has lasted me for several months with no problems. I&#x27;ve had to replace the battery a couple times, but nothing more than I would normally expect. It doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out, which hurts, but it really cuts and works well. Five stars from me.</li>
            <li> Product arrived quickly. Cannot say if it works well or lasts long, because it is going in a Christmas exchange.</li>
            <li> I really, really like this nose-hair trimmer. I use it on my boyfriend to trim his thick and fast-growing nose hair. It has worked very well so far, even in the shower! This has made my boyfriend look so much more presentable!</li>
            <li> Looks like other cheap nose hair trimmers that I have had, but this thing is really sharp.  Gets rid of the hairs good and quick. Kind of expensive, but in this case you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> you can find much better ...</li>
            <li> husband looks much neater now.  able to get those sprouts</li>
            <li> Not enough power. Totally unhappy.</li>
            <li> Hubby uses this for nose and ear hair.  He finds it simple to use and keep clean.  He loves it.</li>
            <li> Works well for keeping those ugly nose hairs from making unsightly public appearances; love the ability to run water through the head to clean it without having to take it apart</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use a cheaper device in the past to trim my nasal hair. It finally went the way of the buffalo. I purchased this unit with no expectations. From the time I opened the package, this unit has impressed me. The design is superb. Lightweight, but yet built solid. Directions are clear on care and maintenance. Easy to take a part and put back together. Doesn&#x27;t get any better than this.</li>
            <li> best thing i ever used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if i change one thing it would be to make it a pluggable tool and not just a battery operator</li>
            <li> This works great for me. I like the way it is tilted, guess it doesn&#x27;t make a difference in how it works but it seems easier for me to hold. Comes with a little brush to clean it with.</li>
            <li> Works great. Does best job of cutting ear hair.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is super quiet and works great to trim nose, ear and other hairs that you just don&#x27;t want.  The blade doesn&#x27;t come in contact with the skin so you don&#x27;t feel it at all.  Of course it doesn&#x27;t shave right to the skin but for the hairs you are trimming you don&#x27;t notice at all.  Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great ordering and receiving experience. Product met expectations.</li>
            <li> Only wish it had a rechargable battery, otherwise works just great!</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic that failed. The second one only lasted five months. Time to try another brand.</li>
            <li> Works well easy to clean, highly recommend!!!</li>
            <li> This is one of those annoying things you will never want o need but eventually have to have.  Quiet, painless ad does the job well.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product for men and women.  It does the job as advertised.  A little hard to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Used twice before it failed.</li>
            <li> Never pulled nose hairs very gentle and effective great product purchased one and is worked so well I ordered some for other family members</li>
            <li> This device has received a lot of praise and that is partially why I bought it.  Worked well twice and now simply won&#x27;t turn on.  Oh well ... life is too short to worry about refunds and warranties on a $12 trimmer.  Maybe someone else can benefit from my experience.  I would not buy again.</li>
            <li> Good little personal grooming device.  It trims effectively.  The head can be easily disassembled and washed.  The only issue I see is that it seems to use a lot of battery power.  I use it about once s month and have to replace the battery about every 6 months.</li>
            <li> This thing works okay, but for some reason it just feels and sounds fragile.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it. Pain free hair removal!</li>
            <li> buzzed my skin pretty good but didnt draw blood, first timer though. great quality, great price. would buy again but this one will last awhile.</li>
            <li> Works better than any other nose clippers I&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Works well, use it to trim nose hair, and it does a wonderful job!</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a little too guarded, so it doesn&#x27;t cut as easily as our old one, but it definitely does the job at a good price!</li>
            <li> Excellent product!!! Gets all the annoying hairs out of your nose, ears, and evens up my beard!!!</li>
            <li> I read the reviews on this and on competitive products before making my purchase.  This trimmer had the most positive stars and least negative stars.  I&#x27;ve used it now a couple of times.  As other reviewers had written, this trimmer cuts, rather than pull, your hair. I concur.  I am very happy with my purchase especially at the price.  I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 20, 2012 Update:  Love this trimmer!!  No complaints.</li>
            <li> works for both ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li> came very quickly and works well. You need nothing more than a quick change of batteries</li>
            <li> Still works after over a year. I have no complaints.  UPDATE (3/27/2017): $h!t still works. Amazing.</li>
            <li> I am happy with this so far. I have had it for 4-1/2 months now with no problems. No snagging and a close cut make it worth buying.</li>
            <li> Works well and Im used it for more than one year.</li>
            <li> Well nothing but good to go with this. Never had one before but works awesome. Price and everything for its standards are great!</li>
            <li> Works great! Would recommend</li>
            <li> Replaced this one for same model that was dropped and stopped working. A great buy and the cutting technology cuts quickly and easily. No tugging or scraping like some models, no pain whatsoever! The cleaning feature keeps it clean and oderless too unlike other brands and models. The best trimmer you will buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a Sasquatch but I have had a few nose hair trimmers in the past. The biggest problem I have had with them in the past is that yes they trim the hair growing freely in the middle of the nostril but not so much for those pesky little irritating ones that tickle the sides of your nose. From various rotary or micro trimmers this blade design seems to catch every hair without catching any skin. It is easy to clean and I like the larger barrel size for hand comfort and ease of use.</li>
            <li> This works well, better than the one This one is more solid.Trims very fast. I used couple of trimmer before but this one feels much better in use. It works for ear perfectly too.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I expected of it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankful for all the reviews on this item that lead me to trust this purchase!</li>
            <li> Only had it a few weeks, but so far so good. Very quiet too.</li>
            <li> This product worked great until I accidently dropped it from about a 1 high on to tile... it still came on but something must have happened on the inside as it made a terrible raquet after that... It worked amazingly up to that point but it&#x27;s not tough at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and son. And then for his father. Everybody is excited. The cool thing is convenient and inexpensive. Men will appreciate.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well. Decently quiet, no snagging (important!). Decently well-built for the cheap cost to me. I bought it purely based on reviews and was not disappointed. My only caveat (and the reason for giving it 4/5 instead of 5/5) is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a replacement blade - I mean the blade is tiny, thin, barely anything at all - a replacement should have been easy to include while still makin&#x27; the margins - I guess everyone&#x27;s trying to shave a few dollars off here and there.</li>
            <li> Simple and effective. Nothing to complicated and great results. Less is more with this.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t work too well.</li>
            <li> Good value and works well</li>
            <li> my previous nose/ear hair trimmer often pulled out the hair, causing discomfort. my new panasonic cuts hairs cleanly, without \\&quot;grabbing.\\&quot; i&#x27;m definitely impressed with its performance.</li>
            <li> It works, it rinses clean. Wish it was rechargable than it would be perfect, but I knew when I bought it it took batteries, which last a good time.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to! Best one I have ever used actually. A very happy nose is what I now have thanks to this product.</li>
            <li> great gag gift.  Product works great too.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great, is portable, and has a nice feel.  I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because it&#x27;s a bit underpowered and somet times won&#x27;t turn on.  After 6 months of use it also starts pulling hairs out now and then - ouch!  Good for the price but would probably try something else next time.</li>
            <li> works nicely.  does what it supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Like most men, I have used several nose-hair trimmers over the years. Each seemed to work well in the begenning but went downhill fast. Typically, the trimmers were discarded in less than a year after several of tearful experiences.   This one seems to be better than than any other trimmer I have tried. The dual-edge blade really is better than the old blades. I cannot comment on the durability of this product as I have used it only for a month, but my experience so far has been better than with any other trimmer.  Bottom line, I strongly recommend this trimmer for any man who want to safely and quickly trim his more hair.</li>
            <li> First off, this is my first and only nose trimmer.  It works amazing.  I was using an attachment to my Remington (not an actual nose trimmer attachment) and it was ok but only got the long hairs.  After using this one, I will never go back to the attachment.  It got every hair in my nose, and I trimmed my goatee with precision and ease.  Be sure to read all the warnings first.  I made sure not to press hard on my face or nose to avoid potential bleeding.  The cleaning drain is pretty cool.  I follow the instructions and twist of cap to help dry faster.  My only wish, and therefore one less star, is that it was rechargeable.  It uses one battery and seems to last a while but I think I will invest in more rechargeable batteries from energizer or Duracell, etc...</li>
            <li> I have owned a number of these type clippers over the years.  This one is compact and by far the easiest to keep clean.  You just pop off the blades and rinse under water.  Couldn&#x27;t be simpler.  Takes less than a minute.    Ease of cleaning is nice, but it means nothing if the product doesn&#x27;t do its job.  This product does a great job.  It gets to hair that other ones I have used had a harder time reaching.  Perhaps of its shape and slender form it can get into those more recessed areas.      My only issue, and I need to figure this out, is that it seems to have more energy when I use a regular battery.  When I use a rechargeable one, even right from the charger, it doesn&#x27;t seem to sound as strong.  May be a perception issue on my end.  I will need to check it out further.  But even with that rechargeable battery it does get the job done.    Great product, easy to use, slender and so simple to clean.</li>
            <li> Great for the price. It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> An ergonomic hair removal tool that works!</li>
            <li> love this product, had other trimmers but this one is great SO FAR !!  does not pull or bite, or nick !!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for christmas. Even though we haven&#x27;t opened it up yet, it arrived in a timely matter and thats all I can ask for. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Does the job, cuts closely, but occasionally pulls the hair causing slight pain.  Power seems to fluctuate up and down for no reason.  Easy to use and ergonomic.  Not sure if I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> Nobody NOSE the trouble.........Great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Love it does the job!</li>
            <li> Recent purchase so haven&#x27;t tested it&#x27;s durability over time, but it has demonstrated itself as having the most power to cut my strong Italian nose hairs compared to cheap ones I&#x27;ve bought over the years.  So far it was strong enough to do the job and quick without pulling my hairs.  I don&#x27;t know why everyone else makes their product so darn weak, but I&#x27;m happy with this one.</li>
            <li> It a good product. Does the job</li>
            <li> Just okay but not great as many stated. Nothing special about the trimmer. For the quality and what it does, the cost is just too expensive.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, it&#x27;s quiet, it&#x27;s cheap, i love it!!!</li>
            <li> these nose clippers works great. It&#x27;s light weight but made of high quality product. I have thick hair on my beard and it cuts very well.</li>
            <li> It works very well and easy to clean it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works much better than I expected. I told my wife we need to order one for both of my son&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It works well but it is not at good as I thought. It does cut most hair but fine hair like in the ear it doesn&#x27;t get it all.</li>
            <li> Years ago, I wanted a Panasonic and instead received a Remington as a gift.  Hated but used it for years until finally I dropped it and broke the battery cover.      I was shocked to see the bad and mixed reviews on the other Panasonic trimmers.  So, I went on Panasonic&#x27;s site and looked at all the models.  This one looks like a response to all of the negative reviews.  I took a chance because there were no reviews about it on Amazon.  Well, turns out it works GREAT.  Very quiet and trims great.  I was worried that it would be too large (as the photo appears), but it is actually small (the right size).</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean up. Good to have one.</li>
            <li> Much better than the last generation. Outstanding value, too.</li>
            <li> I saw mix reviews on this.  I actually liked it.  Does what it is suppose to do.  I like the fact it uses the battery, so I can quickly replace the battery instead of waiting for a charge.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find one that didn&#x27;t tickle, but this one definately works well. Good price and no pulling hairs yet.</li>
            <li> Did not work and it costs than the price to ship it back for a refund from Amazon.</li>
            <li> This nose / facial hair remover is pretty impressive. My husband used it for both his nose and his ears. He also trimmed the awkward mustache hairs under his nose. He&#x27;s so impressed with it he is using it instead of waiting to go the barber once a month...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue he had was getting into the tip of his nose (an awkward direction) and some hair was cut short, but not completely removed. He said once done he felt a difference breathing through his nose.... But I don&#x27;t think removing the unwanted hair from the ears is a cure for his hearing problem... He still needs a hearing aid....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, you can use this product w/ and w/o water. It&#x27;s just one AA battery. It includes a cleaning brush. And it&#x27;s best to have a close up mirror to asst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re very pleased with the results of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****Update Aug 2012. Product still doing it&#x27;s job. No problems. No issues.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small, compact, and very easy to maintain. It gets the job done in a few seconds. There is a weird sensation at first, but you&#x27;ll get use to it.</li>
            <li> been using it for few months. so far...great! pain free and gets all the hair. been through a couple and so far this one is the best</li>
            <li> Hey - Thank you to Panasonic for making this great product. They have made what is usually an uncomfortable, unpleasant, tedious and painful task into a simple grooming procedure that is totally comfortable, pain-free and convenient.  And using it is as easy as rolling off the proverbial log.  Congratulations on a fine product -- you could easily charge more for it.</li>
            <li> - this has got to be the best trimmer on the market!  It works so well, trims closely and does NOT pull hairs.  10 stars if I could rank it that high&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve used others that cost less, but don&#x27;t work as well.  It truly is worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;- I know this can be washed using tap water, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to hold it under running water</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my grandfather after his nose hair-trimmer stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He likes it as much or better than the first one.</li>
            <li> Works good and is water resistant.  Just trim and go.  Good price.</li>
            <li> It works. The battery life is a little short but I use rechargeables so I don&#x27;t mind too much. Cleaning it is easy.</li>
            <li> I bought this clipper as a backup to a Panasonic I&#x27;ve had for years (thinking \\&quot;that nothing lasts forever.\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read other reviews reflecting concerns about leaving hairs behind and not being efficient.  But, for the price, it would be my backup. To be fair, this cutter works but not nearly as well as my older one.  I&#x27;m keeping it \\&quot;in a pinch\\&quot; but if you&#x27;re looking for a primary clipper ... I&#x27;d suggest further investigation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thought might be to go to a local shaver shop first and find out the choices available.  That&#x27;s what I plan to do when my older Panasonic \\&quot;dies\\&quot;  ... \\&quot;perish the thought.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> In my experience, these type of products tend to deteriorate quickly, but I must say, so far I&#x27;m very impressed. The product feels great in my hand, nice build, looks great. It cuts hairs fast and without pulling. The wet/dry aspect is very appealing. Much better than the cheaper versions by Panasonic. I will write an update in a few months.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer works well without yanking and pulling of nose hairs. Excellent buy...</li>
            <li> After using several different hair trimmers, it is nice to finally have one that really works. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Works good, easy to clean</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer just about four months ago and after using it several times a week on both my nose and ear hair I&#x27;m happy to say I&#x27;m still on the original battery I installed the day I got this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer does a good job of cutting close. I recommend using a mirror, especially on the nose or you will miss things. I&#x27;ve only had it grab hair and yank instead of trim once or twice which is far better than the last trimmer I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is sold as Wet/Dry but I see no evidence of o-rings in the battery compartment to ensure a water tight seal. I would not use this in the shower or allow it to be submerged in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;Vortex Cleaning System&#x27; the trimmer boasts is just an open/close vent at the base of the cutter head that allows you (with the trimmer on) to run it under a stream of water for superior cleaning capability. The instructions even remind you to mind the position of the exit port to avoid splashing water all over. I&#x27;ve tried the Vortex system under two sink faucets and a bathtub faucet. None of which produced more than a trickle of water out the exit port and I really wasn&#x27;t impressed with how clean it left the unit. It was far easier and you can get the trimmer much cleaner by disassembling it and cleaning it with the small brush it comes with. This task is easily accomplished. Disassembly and reassembly are a breeze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all it&#x27;s a good trimmer that does it&#x27;s job well and uses little power so you&#x27;ll save money on batteries.</li>
            <li> Very quiet, no muss, no fuss.  I don&#x27;t know what battery life will be like, but the trimmer works very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried multipurpose machines, but this does a better job.</li>
            <li> This works really well.  It is faster than my years-old nose hair trimmer, and it pulls and tugs less for a pain-free experience.  I would definitely recommend it at this price and considering how important it is to personal grooming.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I wanted ,does a great job and easy to handle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this trimmer for a few days and have only used it a few times, but it seems to work very well and seems to be built well.  I&#x27;ve used the cheap Remington ones, or the ones from Walmart before, and they always seem to break down or not cut very well.  These worked very well and will hopefully continue to do so.  They cut the hairs in the nose and ear very well, and seem to work well in other areas also.</li>
            <li> This is an essential grooming tool. You must have one. It&#x27;s not very expensive, so I say \\&quot;grab it!\\&quot; You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have less ear and nose hair now. The girlfriend is pleased.</li>
            <li> So far ths trimmer works pretty good. I was hesistate on given it 5 stars because Im not sure how long this item will last. If it&#x27;s dropped, may not survive and the head comes off a little too easy. But, it does work great, better than expected.</li>
            <li> Very handy little device. Lightweight yet sturdy. Easy to operate and clean.</li>
            <li> My old nose hair trimmer has been going on a few years strong and after those few year of putting that thing in my nose, I was disgusted with myself.  How filthy is this thing? Should I open it up and clean it out?  Why isn&#x27;t this thing waterproof?  I immediately tossed it in the rubbish bin when this little guy showed up on my doorstep.  It&#x27;s perfect.  Easy to clean, waterproof, powerful, priced-welled.  Clean yo noses, fellas!  No one likes looking at hairs flying out of your nose like your grandpa.</li>
            <li> I have owned manual trimmers in the past. This is the first time I have an electric trimmer and I LOVE it! It is:  * Easy to use and set up  * Requires one AA battery (not included)  * Washable with cold water  * Easy to remove the blade for thorough cleaning  * Quiet when in use  * Works with absolutely no pulling/tucking/pinching  I used it for my nose and it worked great. I haven&#x27;t tried other electric trimmers so I can&#x27;t compare but I can&#x27;t think of anything I&#x27;m missing in this one.</li>
            <li> good article, vrery fuctional, exactly what i needed.</li>
            <li> Wonderful!  My husband loves it!  We&#x27;ve had others previously that did not work as expected.  This one works as described; it&#x27;s fantastic!!!</li>
            <li> Works well.  Don&#x27;t know why it is three times bigger than the one I had to replace.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this price! This does the best job on my pesky eyebrow and nose hairs and I understand why it&#x27;s the top-rated trimmer -- because it simply is!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Waterproof -- entirely. Used it in the shower. Gets every angle perfectly and is entirely pain free!</li>
            <li> It removes the hairs that are hard to remove and makes you feel clean.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband.  He uses it no problem.  It actually trims hair instead of pulling on them, which I know is a common complaint with these trimmers.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> My nose is cleaner than with any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used. Don&#x27;t leave as much of a stubble problem.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is top quality and very effective.  I am pleased happy with the purchase...  The item arrived quickly.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I was excited to get this and it worked just ok for a few weeks then just quit. I feel cheated on this one.  In the garbage it goes.</li>
            <li> Worked well initially but quickly faded. Eats batteries and when is slows down, it pulls and plucks rather than cuts.</li>
            <li> I had struggled with bad trimmers for years, but this Panasonic trimmer is great.  The difference is visible from the first time I used it upon its arrival.</li>
            <li> Very bad trimmer, not strong, not close, not worth even the small expense</li>
            <li> Has worked great so far. Does a much more thorough job than scissors.</li>
            <li> Great product that gets rid of all the hair.</li>
            <li> Works great! Doesn&#x27;t pull, works well.</li>
            <li> Works great for the nose. I would not use it for anything else, as I have no reason to. I also feel this is designed for just the nasal passage. Easy to clean, effective, and pain free.</li>
            <li> Great product and fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Hard to get excited about a nose hair teimmer but works great. It&#x27;s small enough to throw in your travel kit . The angled head is smart.</li>
            <li> Does the work as described</li>
            <li> Works great.  Trim&#x27;s my nose hair as expected and I think it even chopped up a booger or 2. hahhahha</li>
            <li> Prior to the GN30, I had just purchased another Panasonic trimmer.  Awful!  Underpowered so that it yanked out nose hairs instead of trimming them - the experience brings tears to my eyes, literally.  It had a little integrated flashlight that was essentially useless.  BUT, with the GN30, Panasonic got it right.  This is a clipper instead of a yanker!  Works great!  No Pain!</li>
            <li> Excellent if not the best nose hair trimmer.  Other facial hair, well not so good.  This unit is designed to do one thing real well and it does it.  It seriously needs an additional trimmer attachment for \\&quot;other\\&quot; facial hair.</li>
            <li> I have had this for awhile now, it seems to be hit or miss if it will work. I tried replacing the battery but it seems there is a poor connection inside the unit that has happened pretty much from day one. I would keep looking, this one does not seem to be worth it unless you want a lot of frustration.</li>
            <li> Does what it needs to, no problems.</li>
            <li> I clean it every time I use it (followed directions with it) and let it dry out for an hour or two before putting it back together. Still using the original battery too! Great little device.</li>
            <li> Have you ever noticed how nose hair trimmers and key chain compasses suddenly appear at Macy*s around Christmastime? And most of the time the trimmers you see, no matter where, are JUNK. (&amp;#34;Gosh Son, you&#x27;ve given me a nose bleed as a stocking stuffer! Thanks!&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, these aren&#x27;t junky at all. They&#x27;re really high quality and work better (a lot better) than any others I&#x27;ve used. I thought the price was very reasonable, too.</li>
            <li> This device actually does what it claims to do.  Nice to have a well groomed look!</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer- the trimmer works well. It&#x27;s painless and quiet. Works dry or in water.</li>
            <li> Update: This product was great while it lasted. The only problem (though its a big one) is that it didn&#x27;t last long at all. Maybe one year. Very disappointing, I thought Panasonic was supposed to be a reputable company but I guess not.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, great product</li>
            <li> After having another brand&#x27;s hair trimmer break after literally minutes of use, I returned the broken trimmer to the store and went online to buy this. Nice build quality, well-designed, and best of all it actually works great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several trimmers of this sort over the years. The Panasonic Vortex is generally similar to just about any other. It does a very good job eliminating those fine hairs that crop up in the nostrils and in and around the ears. However, its promotion statements claims that it can also be used as a facial hair trimmer. I strongly doubt this. Nothing about the size, weight or sharpness of the device&#x27;s blades indicates to me that it could effectively used on the beard area. What distinguishes this product from any number of similar ones is its ergonomic design. The size, shape and materials used in the construction of the Panasonic Vortex fits comfortably in the hand and makes it easy to store away. The manufacturer also claims that its water-resistant, making it capable of use in the shower, though I haven&#x27;t tried this myself. Given that this product costs and functions about the same as any other I would chose it over others based on its better design qualities.</li>
            <li> Very nice, should have gotten this years ago.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works really well and the battery last a very long time (of course you don&#x27;t need to use it too often). I use this on my nose, ears, and my eyebrows (edges and between) and it works for all. You just have to get the right angle for each application. It does not get that dirty in the first place, but it cleans easily too.</li>
            <li> I bought this one (Remington NE-3 Precision Wet/Dry Rotary Nose and Ear Trimmer - http://www.amazon.com/Remington-NE-3-Precision-Rotary-Trimmer/dp/B00005B6ZM/ref&#x3D;cm_cr-mr-title) on Amazon and it was terrible. (see my review)  This one is 100% better. Much easier to clean. The motor doesn&#x27;t drag when you turn it on. Does a much better job. The parts don&#x27;t fall out. Much quieter. Inexpensive and worth the money. Even looks better (although I really don&#x27;t care about that, but you might).  If you need a trimmer, this is just as good or better than the others I&#x27;ve tried, for less money.</li>
            <li> For the men with wild hair in the eye brows, nose and ears, you can&#x27;t go wrong with the trimmer. Everytime I see a man with hair in this areas that can be braided, I want to go up to them and tell them about this product. For that QC - modern look in a man, this it the product for you. I do a lot a research on products before I buy. I always look at the reports from Consumer Report and they rate this trimmer in the top five for its price. So, if you want that clean look with no wild hair in your eye brows, ear and nose, this is the trimer for you. Why look like a cave man when you can look like the modern man that anyone would want to be next to.</li>
            <li> Works much better than the previous model. Will likely buy another one or two as spares since it took a while to find this one. Panasonic changes the design periodically and the last model was not effective and often painful.  This fixes all those issues.</li>
            <li> This product works very well. It is painless, fairly quiet, easy to use, and works well. I&#x27;m very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> Used it once. It worked great.  Stopped working after that lol.  For 10$. Not sure what I expected lol</li>
            <li> Really like this shaver. Ideal for cleaning up the long hairs that are hard to get to otherwise. I wash it with soap and water after each use and have had no problems with it.</li>
            <li> Works well. Blade is sharp so there is no pulling, and the motor seems powerful enough.</li>
            <li> The best, hands down, I&#x27;ve ever owned. Flat kills the mangroomer. This is a solid product. It will impress you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s dead.............&lt;br /&gt;I had written originally how awesome it was, now it&#x27;s rattling so loud I can not even hear the blade hitting hair.&lt;br /&gt;Half way working.&lt;br /&gt;I guess I got what I paid for......</li>
            <li> Really useful tool. It is holding up well. My only complaint is the lack of replacement blades, as replacing the whole device is wasteful and pricey.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my husband &amp; he really likes it!!</li>
            <li> Not bad for $10. Works as advertised so far.</li>
            <li> Worked better than I expected. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Best one I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Not very effective, leaves small hair intact.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience owning an electric Nose/Facial Hair Trimmer. Out the box, the trimmer feels nice and lightweight, but the material and build quality is good. The unit uses one AA battery.     There is an attachable cap and detachable blade that can be removed and cleaned. There is also an included little brush. This unit has a nice amount of power and is great for trimming off nose hairs that might be difficult to reach and remove.     Off course the unit can also be used to trim and neaten your eyebrow and facial hair. The only drawback is that this device does not have some type of recharging station. So if you use it often, you&#x27;ll be needing plenty of AA&#x27;s. Otherwise this is a solid trimmer at a decent price.</li>
            <li> I was surprised by how well this worked. No sharp edges visible yet cuts the hair really well. Great for the price</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is great!  Popped in a fresh AA battery, and trimmed my eyebrows, nose hair, and sideburns perfectly.   Easy as a simple razor to clean, just open the &#x27;valve&#x27; and pour some hot water through it.</li>
            <li> I had a shrubs jutting from my nostrils.</li>
            <li> Came as promised - perfect shape!</li>
            <li> product works very well and as expected</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son, he loves it...if it withstands a teenager, then it is a good product...</li>
            <li> Gift for my husband. He had reported that other trimmers pulled on hair and was painful, but that this model is not irritating. He was a little suspect when I bought it and we almost sent it back, but that was based on his prior experience. He took the risk to take it out of the package and try it, and now uses it regularly.</li>
            <li> Really you get what you pay for. It&#x27;s very inexpensive and it doesn&#x27;t trim the best. It has yet to hurt when trimming a hair like some of the other reviews said but it definitely takes some nifty maneuvering to get the hair.</li>
            <li> Just as described.  Works well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many nose hair trimmers and this one definitely is the sturdiest.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times now and haven&#x27;t had a problem with snagging hairs or being over powered by the nose jungle.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on the fence as to whether this product is worthy of the Panasonic name.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the blade speed sometimes slows down and it sounds like the rotating blades are binding a bit.  I wash the tip off with water and it seems to do this then also.  But after it dried, works well.  The product quality is a little &amp;#34;plastic-y&amp;#34; if you will.  Other reviews have had similar comments.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it as it does trim nose hairs well otherwise.</li>
            <li> Works nicely and it was super affordable.  Way better than my old method of using the Swiss army knife&#x27;s scissor to trim my nose hair.</li>
            <li> worked fine no pulling</li>
            <li> This is very handy and it works well.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had quite a bit of experience with these devices... and I&#x27;ve laid waste to several of them over the years.  I found they didn&#x27;t last, they nicked too much, didn&#x27;t cut close enough, etc, and always went back to scissors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to give these a try and I have been really impressed.  It fits well in either hand, and is very sharp.  I found that it took me no time at all to trim up and I have yet to nick myself.  It appears well built and I think it will last a long time.  Clean up is a breeze with the wet wash option at a turn of a dial.  I also like the fact it stands on end so it takes up less counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give these a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I used to own a philips norelco trimmer and it would always take forever to cut anything. This Panasonic trimmer is far superior for the same price. This has a different design which allows the hairs to fall in the center and provides a much more efficient cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply product, great price, works as it should!</li>
            <li> This thing is so simple and works so well, I should have bought one years ago. Tickles in the nose and ears are now gone. Signs of age (at least those) are now gone. Cleans easily. Cheap enough that everyone can own one.</li>
            <li> Nose and ear hair... who wants to discuss that?  Let&#x27;s just say it works very well and I&#x27;ve had it for over a year...</li>
            <li> This trimmer does the the job neatly in nose and ears and is easy to keep clean and maintain.  It does not pull the hairs as other manual turn around trimmers that are cumbersome to clean and do not work.  It is compact and easy to carry when traveling.  I am happy that I found it.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does.</li>
            <li> Works great. Like the angle design and easy cleaning</li>
            <li> This works great.  Just want I needed.</li>
            <li> This product works great.</li>
            <li> Great product, it does the job well. I had another trimmer for years and never thought I would find one I liked more, but this one wins out. The trimmer trims safely from various angles, even head on. Priced well, Seller shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected. Have bought one before for my husband, and he loved it, so I got it for my brother.</li>
            <li> Great product at a cheap price.  Men, as you get older you&#x27;ve got to do a little landscaping and this is just to tool to do it.</li>
            <li> Had a Panasonic before. This has the exact same head mechanism as the prior model. Thing does NOT spin fat enough (a problem the old one exhibited but after several years of use) so it tends to pull hairs rather than cut them. Needless to say that inside one&#x27;s nostril, that is painful. NOT RECOMMENDED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is with the fact that every trimmer I have looked at has so many bad reviews. Can&#x27;t someone make a trimmer that works and can be used in a pain free manner?</li>
            <li> Does a good job provided you do not apply too much pressure to the nose.  If you are feeling the pinching of hair then you are pressing too hard.</li>
            <li> No guy likes to admit that they need a device such as this, but alas, aging necessitates it ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a number of trimmers - mostly your garden variety brand from the local drugstore - and these are BY FAR the best I have owned. Very easy to use, but best of all is that they do the job so much better (and faster) than previous trimmers I have owned. There is no pulling and they are very versatile, whether trimming nose, ears, eyebrows etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this trimmer if you are considering them!</li>
            <li> Nice and quiet, comfortable, and gets the job done.  Hasn&#x27;t pulled a hair since i started using it either.  Very easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> works great. Haven&#x27;t tried for eyebrows but will try that next.</li>
            <li> As has been mentioned in other reviews, the trimmer ultimately starts making a grinding noise and the blades bend. Since Panasonic doesn&#x27;t sell a cheap replacement top, the whole trimmer is useless. I expected this product to last longer.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been looking for a decent trimmer for a couple of years now.  The one we had broke and apparently there&#x27;s been some government mandate that says they can&#x27;t be as sharp as they once were. We don&#x27;t know that for sure but it certainly is strange that we can&#x27;t find anything that works like the old one, which was also a Panasonic, but quite old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses this the most but I use it to trim any stray nose hairs.  If I&#x27;m going to the dentist, for example, I don&#x27;t like my nose hairs to look gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband uses it for his ear hair and his nose hair.  It&#x27;s a strange thing to write about but you get to a certain age and suddenly you&#x27;re sprouting hairs in places you&#x27;ve never had them. This trimmer didn&#x27;t do a good job on hair in either place and was quite diappointing. Neither of us would recommend it.  The Panisonic Vortex is only slightly better than the no-brand one we were using so we&#x27;ll continue the great search!</li>
            <li> Works comparable to any good brand nose hair trimmer on the market. I have experienced no pulling when using it to cut nose hair. It is also a capable eyebrow trimmer as well, but I don&#x27;t have any ear hair to test it on. The cutting head has a tendency to heat up while in use but this is common with other brands as well. The ability to wash it with water with the vortex action is convenient but I believe it is still necessary to remove the head after washing to allow it to dry fully.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic nose and facial hair trimmer is a really great product. It works better than any other trimmer I&#x27;ve used, and everything about it is simple: Simple to use, simple to clean, etc. It also gets excellent life out of 1 AA battery (which is also simple to change). The blade seems to be very sharp, too, because it cuts hair very close. For the price, this trimmer is a steal!</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s advertised to do and does it well. I recommend it to anyone who needs to trim especially in the ears..</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and does the job. Easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> Does not turn on. Tried many different batteries and it simply won&#x27;t work. Lasted on two months. Of course, I&#x27;m outside the return window now so it&#x27;s useless.</li>
            <li> This is my first shot with one of these, I got fed up with the small scissors. This thing works awesome! It cuts short, doesn&#x27;t pull on any hair, and is easy to move around. The cleanup is pretty simple too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this probably once a week to just buzz areas, I&#x27;d recommend it to any guy who&#x27;s looking for a clean look, especially in the nose area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean after every use!</li>
            <li> My friend wasn&#x27;t very pleased with his old trimmer. Was very pleased to receive this. It seems to work well.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well until I dropped it. I decided to try a different kind Philips Norelco NT9110 Nose and Ear Trimmer. I recommend the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer  and I will order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a younger guy without much facial hair to begin with, but for some reason I get the occasional long black hairs protruding from my nose.  To remove these, nothing really works except a nose hair trimmer.  My previous remington model tended to get clogged with hair, and after an unfortunate drop stopped responding at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic unit was a great upgrade.  It not only cuts better, but is quieter at the same time.  The blades are well covered, and haven&#x27;t knicked my skin yet.  It uses a single AA battery, which I haven&#x27;t had to replace in the last 2 months with occasional use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that is pretty standard for a decent trimmer, but what sets this unit apart is that it washable!  This is a pretty nice feature to have.  Instead of trying to tap or scrape out the hairs, you just open up the top and rinse everything out.  This makes for much easier and more sanitary cleanup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an awesome trimmer, and I really can&#x27;t find any negative things to say about it.  I would recommend it to anyone with unfortunate hair placement.</li>
            <li> Oh yeah!  This one really works.</li>
            <li> it failed after few months</li>
            <li> constantly have to take the batteries out and put them back in</li>
            <li> Every ear/ nose trimmer I have ever owned has just felt cheap (but how much technology do you need to trim the hairs out of your nose and ears, really?) In any event, in my pursuit to find something of quality, I was convinced by the positive reviews and decided to purchase it. The motor is strong and the blades are sharp. It is far better than any micro-trimmer I have ever used! I was concerned about only having the &amp;#34;nose&amp;#34; attachment, but the blade is shallow enough to cut close on my ears. I am extremely impressed so far!</li>
            <li> This worked at a 4-star level at first, but far too briefly.  After perhaps 9 months of only using it once a week for a few minutes each, it simply died -- would not run at all, even with new batteries and a thorough cleaning.</li>
            <li> I think this is the best trimmer I have ever used. The battery lasts a long time and it&#x27;s quiet. No snags or tugging on any hairs. Works great and cleans well with a simple rinse. Great price too!</li>
            <li> With a good battery this little guy keeps me looking in top trim. Easy to use and quick, I use it several times a week after shaving.</li>
            <li> Great for 2 weeks. Then it started making a raspy noise. The sound was unbearable...Guess I got a lemon.</li>
            <li> YUP  good deal.  would buy again.</li>
            <li> I like the way it feels in the hand. Its not too noisy. And for the price it was worth it. It works really well and is sturdy, the last 2 I bought broke (a different model and company something like a micro touch and then the micro touch 2?  Bot were cheaply made and both broke near the blade)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad side is, you cant use this for long, it tends to get very hot. not where it burns you, but enough that you cant use it near skin. it cools quickly though.</li>
            <li> Item works great.  My husband was pleased and so am I, his wife.  He says it tickles a little but no complaints at all.</li>
            <li> it is good but not great... it leaves a lot of hair uncut. i would not  recommend it at all</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have used since growing nose hair. Great product works better than product from local big box stores. Great wet rinse that cleans all hair left from the brush.</li>
            <li> It;s comfortable and easy to use, works well, and it is easy to clean. I should have bought one long ago.</li>
            <li> This product is quite easy to use.  It can be cleaned under running water.  It does run a bit noisy for a small device that runs on a 1.5V AA battery.  Comes in the infamous plastic shell packaging, so be careful when you open it.</li>
            <li> Works great, good price. Very glad I grabbed this.</li>
            <li> By far its better than the other trimmers I have bought. More durable.</li>
            <li> i like it,but i didn&amp;#34;t get the attachments.if there is any way i can get the other attachments,and charge to my credit card,that would be great  thanks</li>
            <li> This product does a very nice job and isn&#x27;t very difficult to use.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone. Works Great!  The Panasonic ER-GN30-K trims those hard to get to ear and nose hairs great.</li>
            <li> Not sure how much there is to say about a nose-hair trimmer! Does its job, does it well, no &#x27;nipping&#x27; or discomfort at all. Great item, great price.  After a couple years with this item, I dropped the cutting blade down the sink during cleaning (my fault). Point is, I had been so happy with it, I immediately ordered another one (though ironic that it&#x27;s cheaper to re-buy than get a replacement blade...).</li>
            <li> Should have got this years sooner. Beats the painful plucking. Quick easy and very effective.</li>
            <li> My nose and ears feel blessed and well treated since this unit arrived.  They have never been better treated.  Yours will be forever grateful for being subjected to this &amp;#34;beauty&amp;#34; treatment.</li>
            <li> Works as well as any facial trimmer and it was a bargain from the warehouse because the packaging was slightly compromised.</li>
            <li> It works great and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  Only complaint, which is very minor, is that the seating of the blade is a little touchy.  If I press to hard, when re-seating it, the blade won&#x27;t cut as close.  Other than that, it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I have fairly large nostrils. I like to keep that prominence to a minimum. Every so often I would notice hairs both long and short poking out around the edges, which I would hedge back with scissors, fingertips (did I say that I have large nostrils?) and  tweezers. While I don&#x27;t mind a good cry or sneeze or two, I needed something modern, something hygienic, and something that would keep me from plucking my nose hairs in public. Enter this neat little trimmer, the Panasonic ER-GN30-K. At first, I did not think that it could possibly trim the finer and shorter hairs. This trimmer is able to get deep up in my schnoz and clean the edges well. The blades seem set back just a bit too far for short hair, but it gets the job done well. After prolonged use, the tip warms up a bit. Not blazing, just warm. When the battery begins to lose charge the trimmer is less effective. It is tough to tell when that is happening until you realize you have to work harder to get the job done. This is a only minor negative for me. I think I can extend this recommendation to beaks big and small. Good job Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I am using this product from about 10 months. This product is really good and it&#x27;s really easy to operate. It doesn&#x27;t consume battery very much. I generally redistribute the AA battery in about 2-3 months!</li>
            <li> Not for eye brows. Works other wise. Would buy a dual use next time.</li>
            <li> This device worked good for 2 years, but after 2 years it just quit.  No dropping it, no battery loss.  It just stopped working.  So if you think $15 bucks is worth 2 years, then go for it, I think the way I treated it and didn&#x27;t over use it, it should have lasted a lot longer</li>
            <li> To be honest - I have no idea if there are better competing models, but that&#x27;s only because this one does what I expect it to do - keep my ear and nose hair in check. And under $15? A no brainer.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical of these for years. How dumb I was. It is the perfect solution to hair that needs to be kept away from sight. quiet operation, zero pulling, zero pinching, just clean to the skin &#x27;cut&#x27; of nasal hair or ear hair. I think people forget how many others look closely at your face/nose/ears...say, at work etc. I&#x27;m one happy 53 year old, who will never again have someone say anything about a nose hair that needs to go. Ha!</li>
            <li> This was purchased for my husband so he can clean his ears. He loves this &amp; surprised how well it does what it says it can do. Prompt shipment &amp; excellent packaging. Love, love, love it!!</li>
            <li> When I opened this product I was concerned with its size.  It is tiny compared to most trimmers, it barely fits in my hand.  However, this trepidation was short lived because for a small, condensed product, the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair trimmer works like a charm.  My favorite part? The circular motion of the trimmer -- the way it works its almost impossible to cut yourself.    The circular motion really gets those hard to reach hairs, etc.    The batteries in this product also lasted a pretty long time.  I purposely kept running it just to see how long it would last and my hand got tired before the batteries dead.  This is a product I would definitely recommend.  Natalie S. for Amazon Vine</li>
            <li> First of all, I gave 1 star to this product since it stopped working after I used it ONLY ONCE. I didn&#x27;t even wash it with water so it is the product that has problems. It doesn&#x27;t matter how well it works if it is not gonna last long. In my case it lasted like ONCE.  AND  somehow my review is DELETED.  I would NEVER recommend this piece of junk.</li>
            <li> This is a quality grooming tool as far as I&#x27;m concerned.  I&#x27;ve owned a few of these devices from other manufactures and they worked okay but not like this one...of course they were cheaper too.  You do get what you pay for in life and, if you can afford to pay for this, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be sorry.</li>
            <li> Works good so far the material does feel like something you buy from the dollar store but II guess you get what you pay however it does get the job done my nose hairs have never been so short the reason I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars and would probably be two if no for the performance is because if I turn it off but leave the battery on it gets hot I&#x27;dk why so I have to take the battery every time it could be a safety issue I&#x27;m not sure but either way should not do that</li>
            <li> After using it multiple times, I feel that it is up to the task.  It&#x27;s relatively quite and doesn&#x27;t irritate my nose when I removing the hairs(just a bit ticklish).  It&#x27;s small and compact so it&#x27;s ideal for bringing on the go. I don&#x27;t really have much in the way of ear hair so I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s effectiveness on that.  I will say this is my go to tool to keep my nose tidy.</li>
            <li> Tried several of these for the ole nose but this works the best. It doesn&#x27;t allow you to go to far and irritate the hair back in your nose.  Trust me, it does it job!!</li>
            <li> The trimmer cuts close and does what it says it&#x27;ll do, but shortly after it&#x27;s first use it started making weird noises and eventually stopped working altogether within 4 months of first use (and maybe used 6-7 times in that time frame). Mind you, I kept up with cleaning, maintenance, etc.  Bottom line: I&#x27;m very disappointed and would not recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Other than tickling the nose works well.</li>
            <li> Great item, good value, works well. Only had this for a short time but based on my experience, I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Only lasted a few months before it died.</li>
            <li> This is a must have for any guy who wants to keep their ear, nose, and brows in check! No girl wants to see a rogue curly-que coming out of your nostrils on a first date or a 500th date for that matter so cut those bad boys back with this easy to use man-scaping tool. My favorite feature is its ease of cleaning, all you have to do is twist a knob and run water through it while its turned on and whammy you&#x27;ve got a clean device. Im not a particularly hairy guy so I can&#x27;t say for certain how this would hold up against an amazon jungle level of nose hairs or a Frida Kahlo-esque unibrow but it definitely does the job for me! I should clarify why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. So the only downside to this device is that it seems to burn through batteries faster than I had anticipated for such a small piece of bathroom hardware. It is not ridiculous just less battery life than I had expected. Other than that its awesome! Stay fresh bromigos!</li>
            <li> Cuts most of my hair in my nose, gets all the little hairs on my chin and cheeks, but when I tried it on my eyebrows it made my eyebrow bright red, so not really useful if you want to use it for that use. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the hairs on my eyebrow are gone but I don&#x27;t like the aftermath it created.   Overall, great product. A must buy for all men with hairy nose hairs.</li>
            <li> This is the second unit I&#x27;ve purchased and the second that has just died for no apparent reason. Of course after the time frame for a return or replacement. Would not buy another.</li>
            <li> great for getting rid of  nose hairs. It works great.</li>
            <li> Weed-whacks my nose hairs like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>
            <li> Ours never worked. Sent it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Im sure it&#x27;s a good product based on the glowing reviews... However mine arrived and worked for about 2 seconds then stopped.  I tried multiple batteries and was able to play with the switch and got it running again for another 10 -15 seconds then it quit completely.  Returned it back to Amazon less than 15 min after recieving it.</li>
            <li> Oh, the joys of adulthood. This trimmer works gently and fairly well. I find that it takes a few passes with the trimmer to get things trimmed to the extent I would like. On the definite plus side, I have not experienced any &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; or discomfort at all from this clipper. It seems to be easy to clean and use.</li>
            <li> Husband likes it and uses it often to trim unruly hairs and to keep his sideburns and neck un-fuzzy between haircuts. He has had several and really likes this one.</li>
            <li> This is a nice device. I bought three of them so i can give it to my dad and grandparents. :)</li>
            <li> This is the third brand I&#x27;ve tried but the first one that actually worked. In fact it works very well. Thank you Panasonic for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer! After looking through many products I decided to buy this one for the fair price! I did great in buying this trims perfect and does not pull hair!</li>
            <li> It works great. I did not give the fifth star only because I would have loved it were rechargeable. Great Shipping and seller. I fully recommend.</li>
            <li> Husband requested this for Christmas- and he loves it.  :-)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend because he&#x27;s much taller than me and it&#x27;s unpleasant to look up and be greeted by long nose hairs. Not only does it work in the nose but it also works on his neck/upper back area to get rid of any stray hairs.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband -- he loves it!  Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Ive tried several different trimmers and most don&#x27;t trim very well. This is the first one that really does what it says. It costs a little more but it really works compared to the cheap ones you get at the drug store. When I was a young man back back in college had you told me that some day everyone would be connected over computer networks and we could share our opinions about nose-hair trimmers with people all over the world, I would have said you were crazy, yet here we are. What a glorious time to be alive.</li>
            <li> good with all areas that need hair removal</li>
            <li> Tried other, this one does no pull but cut your hair</li>
            <li> It works good, but its not durable I dropped and broke my first one with less than a 1ft drop.  Second one I popped off the top and the blade fell off the the top and went down the sink- replacement &#x3D; 22$ , replacement of device &#x3D;13$  I called panasonic - and best price I could get from VP of customer service is 9$ for the part &#x3D; still not acceptable.  Save your money, buy something that parts are replaceable at a reasonable cost, and that is more durable.  I wont be buying anything Panasonic anymore.</li>
            <li> falls apart easily and not very effective. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after the first time I washed it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nifty little trimmer. You&#x27;re not going to shave a beard off with it or anything, but it works fine for touching up spots after shaving or in around difficult areas like the nose and ears and whatnot. Luckily I&#x27;m don&#x27;t have old man ear hair yet, but if I did, this would be my go to.</li>
            <li> I once had nose hair and hair around my ears.  Now I do not. Wonderful</li>
            <li> This trimmer arrived quickly as was estimated. It is packaged in a sealed plastic container which can easily be opened if there is a road crew nearby that would lend you their pneumatic drill. Along with the trimmer is a tiny brush, a user guide and some other paperwork of no consequence (to me). It has an attractive appearance and is easily gripped with a comfortable hand fitting. The bottom portion slides off to allow the insertion of a single AA battery (not included). This is the most quiet trimmer I have ever owned. It performs very well in trimmming nose hair, which is its only purpose for me. When finished trimming it will stand up on its end to minimize counter space if that is a factor. I would give this trimmer more then 5 stars if it were possible to do so. This is a winner.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for this kind of trimmer, this works great. I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of months, on one set of batteries still, it just does the job.</li>
            <li> This is a great affordable trimmer that works as advertised and is easy to clean. I use it mostly on my nose but have used it a few times to get those out of place facial hairs.</li>
            <li> Finally; a nose hair trimmer that actually lasts more than a few uses!  I&#x27;m sure you could find a more expensive one but why bother; this one works just fine.  No more cutting the inside of my nose with a pair of scissors or grossing people out with long hairs hanging out of my proboscis.</li>
            <li> Good product for cleaning your nose hair. The motor is powerful and does not choke like similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the best product to trim your eyebrows as the blades are designed to trim nostril hair.</li>
            <li> I have a fast rate growing of hair and I use this daily works great can&#x27;t complain don&#x27;t rush using it the first time you can get razor burn in your nose.</li>
            <li> I had the hand turn model which was of good quality but it did not work.  I have had this model only for a few days so I will update.  After a couple uses, I must say it is the best.  It does not pull or hurt.  It is quite effective it less time compared to trimmers and other models.  Plastic.  It runs hot if used longer than a minute.  Water cleaned.  Dried fast.  I hope it holds up.</li>
            <li> Now my nose hair doesn&#x27;t wave at people on the street as I walk by</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer!  Definitely worth the 5 stars!</li>
            <li> The hair trimmer worked great, but the motor just died on me after 1 year and two weeks of use. I used the trimmer moderately, maybe 3 to 4 times a week and never used it in water (which is one of the features). For a name brand like Panasonic, this concerns me, since I now have to replace the trimmer. Will now go with another name brand like Norelco or Wahl.</li>
            <li> Put the battery in.  Slide the button up. Hear the blades whirring.&lt;br /&gt;Put the trimmer in the nose and hear the blades cutting the nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;Works the same on the hairs of the ear.&lt;br /&gt;No more hair sticking out where you don&#x27;t want it.&lt;br /&gt;Happy I bought it.</li>
            <li> Purchased an item like this at a store.  Did nothing.  Obvious that this one does the trick.</li>
            <li> My husband was so happy to receive this. It works great and he uses it all the time. Great product!</li>
            <li> Really effective tool against nose hair.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Buy it if you need it.</li>
            <li> Boy, getting old sure does suck...Never thought I&#x27;d be writing a review on a nose/ear hair trimmer.  But, as I get older, I seem to be growing hair in all the areas that I would prefer not to.  In addition, losing hair in areas that i would like to retain hair.  But enough about me.  This Panasonic hair trimmer works very well.  It&#x27;s very powerful.  I was worried that it would pull the hair more then trim, but that&#x27;s definitely not the case.  The unit is constructed very well.  I haven&#x27;t test the wet aspect per se, but I have rinsed it off for cleaning purposes.  Still works like a charm.  I don&#x27;t have a reason into going into pros/cons on this since it works as I had hoped it to.  Nothing really to complain about.  With regards to the practice of trimming ear or nose hair, the one recommendation that I have is to do it continuously.  If you&#x27;ve never done it before, expect to be quite uncomfortable the first time you do it.  At least for my nose, I could feel the trimmed hairs for a couple of days afterwards.  Especially when I went to itch my nose.  Also, the feeling of shorter hairs in your nose will give the sensation that there&#x27;s something in your nose.  Strange, really.  Anyway, after continuous use, I no longer have those feelings.  Not sure if my nose is just numb to the feeling or what.  I would definitely recommend this to those hairy nose and ear people.  As myself!</li>
            <li> i dont always have 20 words about any product i review. they seldom reqier more then it works as its saposed to. and this one dose work as its saposed to, cant say how long it will last but for the price if it last a year or 2 that will be good</li>
            <li> I finally feel like I have found the best nose hair trimmer ever. Does not cut or hurt your nose at all very smooth, totally smooth nose!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  The trimmer is what it was advertized.  Would recommend to a friend.  One of the best that I have purchased in the past three years.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my boyfriend who wanted an easier way to trim his nose hair. He says the trim is quick and, most importantly, painless. Also, he didn&#x27;t have to \\&quot;baby\\&quot; the trimmer or the trimming process - i.e. not much care is necessary to make sure you don&#x27;t nick yourself with the trimmer. Based on his reaction and continued use of the product, I recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Not dependable. It fell apart and continues to have issues. I would n.ot order another but remain an Amazon customer</li>
            <li> Best nose trimmer that I have ever owned. Cuts close and easy to clean. I highly recommend this nose trimmer for the price.</li>
            <li> Does a great job removing nuisance ear and nose hairs which my wife loves to complain about. No more complaints!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband to replace other ones he had purchased that just fell apart and or didn&#x27;t work well at all. This has worked well for him for the past month. Cuts well, does not pull and is easy to use and clean. So far still in one piece!</li>
            <li> Works great on nose and ears, better then my last one and has more power, single one AA battery and easy to clean, good price also.</li>
            <li> Works very well for battery operated. It cuts well, and no &amp;#34;tugging, or pulling&amp;#34;, which can be a deterrent for me.</li>
            <li> Just as advertised. No problems at all.</li>
            <li> Only used a few times and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Fell apart way too soon.</li>
            <li> Terrific, as advertised.</li>
            <li> I read a lot of review before buying this. What was convincing was the number of high reviews and the few bad ones. One AA battery and it runs great. Cuts quick, clean and short. Great for nose, ear, and eyebrows. Its like using a pen on your face. Very pleasantly surprised. Its light, it&#x27;s quiet, it&#x27;s small and compact.</li>
            <li> BRRRRR.. Grind the nose hair out.  Works great!  Doesn&#x27;t pull hair.  Washes out nicely.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean. That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for out of a noise hair trimmer.  I&#x27;ll admit I did not clean my last trimmer after every use, but with this one I do because it&#x27;s so simple. You turn the top and put it under the faucet. Yeah, I can handle that.  So far it&#x27;s working strong, but I&#x27;ll update if that changes.</li>
            <li> The title of the item says it all and it does a pretty damn good job ! I would definitely recommend it to someone else</li>
            <li> It actually works! I&#x27;ve never found one of these to actually cut this close and its actually cleanable as well. you need this</li>
            <li> Everyone should have one of these or something like it. I bought a second one after using the first one for over 6 months.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know you could get such a quality product for this price. Bought it based on the reviews and it performs. Doesn&#x27;t snag or pull, feels pretty natural, works great.</li>
            <li> Now my sexy husband doesn&#x27;t look like a crazy person.</li>
            <li> works great, just keep the battery fresh/charged.</li>
            <li> A minute or two and my nose holes look like they&#x27;ve had a Brazilian wax job. Well, maybe not that close but this works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This didn&#x27;t last long. Blades wear out, start to get hot and make a lot of noise.. No longer cut effectively. No replacement blades sold so it&#x27;s a piece of garbage.. I don&#x27;t like buying products that become landfill when one little part goes bad. Especially when it&#x27;s already removable!! GRRR.</li>
            <li> came with batteries, very easy to use, does the job and is little and easy to clean. I will buy again if needed</li>
            <li> Works very well. I have not yet had it pull on any hairs which my older one was constantly doing. It is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Probably the best civilized way to remove hair in  the nostrils due to aging.  You still need to be a little careful. Definitely safer than either pulling it off (very PAINFUL) or use a tiny scissor.</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer is great, because it doesn&#x27;t hurt! Oh and it trims your nose hairs too. But in a non-painful way! What more could you want?</li>
            <li> I ordered this item for my mother, she had been waxing and hated it so she asked me to order for her. Love&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer cause my old trimmer finally gave out on me. I liked this one because it is affordable and can be cleaned with water. So far it&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li> I thought I was buying a professional trimmer, it was high priced but basically the same as the crappy unit I already owned</li>
            <li> The older original model was more powerful but this one does the job. Use it weekly on ears and nose</li>
            <li> Had to reorder this because the first package was lost. When the second arrived, I used it. It&#x27;s nice, small, and eash to use. Clening it also very easy.</li>
            <li> I have fairly fine hair and this doesn&#x27;t do very well. It sounds like its cutting well but sure misses most for me I still need to use tweezers. I don&#x27;t understand how it gets so many great reviews.</li>
            <li> Love this item. It&#x27;s so useful and it has not hurt me at all. I&#x27;m going to give them as gifts for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Best one, clips close and clean no pulled hairs and cleans out easy.</li>
            <li> So far so good. It works well after a month of use.</li>
            <li> I got this home and was immediately disappointed when I discovered it kinda pulled at my nose hairs. Pretty uncomfortable. A week later it wasn&#x27;t working. I assumed that it was the battery, changed it, and nope it was broke. Pretty disappointing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great while it works but I&#x27;ve ordered it several times and it always breaks down. Too bad because it would be perfect if it lasted.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Use a good battery though so it doesn&#x27;t tug and pull.</li>
            <li> I like this it works great to &amp;#34;mow the lawn&amp;#34; up in my nose.&lt;br /&gt; The rinse through feature is fantastic &amp; really works to clean it out after use.&lt;br /&gt;I mean after all you shove this thing up in your nose--yuck!&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is it is too short.&lt;br /&gt;to do a really thorough job &amp; still have to use scissors to get the ones waaaaaaay up in there.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Panasonic ER-GN30-K because of the reviews I read. Several of the more popular (read advertised) nose and facial hair trimmers did not receive the high marks this one did. The nose trimmer I previously owned is no longer on the market and although it worked well, the Panasonic outperforms it in the areas of pinch due to hair pull, design, size and sound. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month now and I don&#x27;t foresee any problems in the future. I definitely recommend this item. 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to keep my mustache and beard clean and tidy, as well as to trim nose and ear hair. It is a fine product that works in the shower and over the sink. Although it is for light-duty, the trimmer is perfect for my personal grooming needs. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great on nose, ear and eyebrow long hairs. It is quiet and does not irritate the skin.</li>
            <li> Weak, battery did not last long. Would not buy again.</li>
            <li> I purchased 3 hair trimmers from Amazon....this Panasonic, the Phillips Norelco and the Wahl 5546-200.  Wahl and Panasonic easy to use and they work really well.  Philips Norelco one star and very difficult to use and figure out.  So if u r in the market, I suggest either this unit or Wahl...they are similar...do not buy Philips Norelco NT9110</li>
            <li> its works ok on nose, little loud for ears</li>
            <li> Ineffective ... takes forever</li>
            <li> Everything is as advertised. It is super easy to clean and set up. It shows no signs of being cheaply made or breaking anytime soon. But the way it cuts hair seriously makes me question the Amazon reviews reliability. Granted, I do have very thick hair. Still, I can&#x27;t believe how weak this is. To test it I ran it straight through the corner of my eyebrow (lol). I&#x27;m not kidding. It did not leave a clear streak through it. Like, it didn&#x27;t look like it does when someone has a scar through their eyebrow or if you were to run a clipper through your eyebrow (or straight razor). Even after multiple tries. I don&#x27;t get it. How is that okay? It doesn&#x27;t give a satisfying cut feel and noise when you run it through your nose. I will do so like four or five times before I just sigh and give up because it&#x27;s not cutting any more hair after its first pass through. You can press it very hard against the skin and hear a view more hairs getting zapped but even when applying way more strength then you ever should with this it doesn&#x27;t cut that much more hair. How is this so far ahead of all the other similar products in terms of reviews ?</li>
            <li> Decent for the price and does the job on nose hairs!</li>
            <li> We purchased many trimmers only to be unhappy. They either broke or didn&#x27;t work or last. This one is a keeper and works great. My husband wants me to buy another one just do if we ever need one we don&#x27;t have to go through the process of elimination again. It works great on his ear hairs as well.</li>
            <li> Some products fall into that \\&quot;How exactly do I review this\\&quot; type of item. This is one of them. I mean, after all it&#x27;s a nose hair and ear hair trimmer. There&#x27;s nothing more to it. It is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, with that said, it does the job it&#x27;s designed to do. I have not run into any &#x27;pinching\\&quot; or anything like that. It seems to trim just fine. I like that you can rinse it off under the sink, it taks a single AA battery that seems to last forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside I have to it, is that it feels cheaply made. Mine has lasted awhile so far, but I have this feeling that with more regular use it may not hold up very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that I have nothing but good things to say about it.</li>
            <li> works better than expected, would recommend to everyone... well made and comfortable to use... the best nose trimmer that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Does what it says it does. Cant ask more from a nose hair trimmer. Easy clean easy battery change. Mew.</li>
            <li> Works great. Exactly what i needed</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive yet effective solution for trimming nose and ear hair.    It is easy to clean, and battery life seems good so far.    Tip: running water through the tip may not be enough to fully remove hair from the blades. One time, the blades wouldn&#x27;t turn, so I disassembled the tip and found some hair jamming the mechanism. Problem solved. (I suspect that many of the 1-star reviewers ranting about how their trimmer \\&quot;just stopped working\\&quot; might not be cleaning it after every use, as suggested by the manual, or not cleaning it thoroughly. Your mileage may vary.)    My experience with the trimmer has been very good. Much safer and more effective than trying to use scissors!</li>
            <li> gets everything done in my nose without any pain, does tickle a little though.</li>
            <li> I got the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Nose, Ear because the reviews said it was best for those gross ear and nose hairs. It works great. Makes a satisfying series of zaps as you move into a hairy area - surely it is cutting a hair for each zap because after a while that area is hair free. Gets slightly warm as it does its work. I wonder where the hairs go? Do they need to be emptied after many uses or do they just drop to the floor? I could breath noticeably easier after I cut down the thicket out of my nose. Needs 1 AA battery I think.  I have not tried it with eyebrows or facial hair but I doubt it will work as well.</li>
            <li> Seemed like a good product but the top popped off, the blade fell out and that was the end of it.  Cheap.  Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Trimmer spins very slowly and pulls the hairs and cuts very poorly. Have tried a number of new batteries to no avail. The cheap Harbour Freight one does much better.</li>
            <li> First time using any electric accessory for nose and facial hair trimming and must say, this product is pretty solid. Inexpensive and does the trick perfectly well!</li>
            <li> Great, quiet trimmer!</li>
            <li> First time buyer. Works super great. Just what I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> I dropped it once in my sink and it broke. Coincidentally I dropped it the very first time I was using it and had to go to wall greens and by one to finish trimming.</li>
            <li> Stopped working a month after use. replaced batteries and still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this product very much.  It is a better quality than the ones he&#x27;s had in the past.  PLUS it can be used w/water.  Very pleased on this and very reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well, but I&#x27;ve picked up cheaper ones that work a little better.</li>
            <li> I took a chance on this based on a few other reviews. This works so easily, I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t get one years ago. I think it&#x27;s about impossible to cut yourself with this thing and it removes the hair.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 uses. Can I obtain a replacement?</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!  Easy to use, easy to clean and does exactly what is promised.  I highly recommend this product for men and women.</li>
            <li> so far so good- it&#x27;s lightweight and easy to use and get into places that are too difficult to get with tweezers or scissors</li>
            <li> Wow! This is the 3rd trimmer I bought in the past 4 years, and the only one that works well. It works REALLY good. The first two trimmers I bought (other makes/models) were very disappointing and just didn&#x27;t trim very well. So I gave up for 2 years and went back to tiny scissors. Then I found all the good reviews for this baby and decided to try once more. I&#x27;m glad I did. Not only is this the best trimmer in the world, but it&#x27;s nearly the least expensive. I am happy!</li>
            <li> Blades don&#x27;t last that long</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nose hair trimmer- does the job. Very compact and it works. Not much else to say. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> than other methods for us old guys.  Great product and well worth the small price, no chance to stab yourself and it&#x27;s fast.</li>
            <li> Man&#x27;s #1 hygiene accessory!  Truly a miracle worker!</li>
            <li> Sometimes have to go over twice to get them all, but probably is better that way then being too sharp and cutting my nose.  I use it around my eyebrows too!  Got one for my hubby also, this is not something I wanted to share with him!</li>
            <li> Bought it to trim my nasal and ear hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some times it stalls when it hits a tough tuft of hair.</li>
            <li> This item surpassed by expectations. First of all it is higher quality than any other nose hair trimmer I have ever owned including wahl. it feels solid, it is very simple to use, the blades cut very well and a few months into it and I haven&#x27;t noticed any decline in how we it cuts. The ability to rinse it out with water is great but if you don&#x27;t want to use water it still works grade it has an internal compartment where the hair goes, you turn a dial which opens up a hole for the water to flow through but you can also blow air through the trimmer and clean it out that way though it doesn&#x27;t do as good of a job as water. For the price it really can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve owned. I&#x27;ve had two or three over the years. Quality. AA battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It works the way I expected it to.</li>
            <li> This is truly a must have machine when you reach the age hair is growing where you dont need it. Compact powerfull and precise. It does exactly what it was planned to do and with a price of 10 dollars you cant expect for more</li>
            <li> it does the job. but the tip can run a bit hot if you run it for more than a min or two. and sometimes can pinch you if the hair gets caught and the blade stalls a bit. that&#x27;s another thing, the blade sometimes slows down a bit which gets annoying.</li>
            <li> The product do the job, I like the fact that you can clean it with water, very portable and lightweight.</li>
            <li> This is the Cadillac of nose trimmers.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after two weeks. Not what you&#x27;d expect from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Works really well but heats up pretty fast when using.</li>
            <li> This is a really good nose hair trimmer, it leaves my nose with no visible hairs &amp; its easy to wash it out. I also like to use this after i trim my beared to cut the little hairs left so i don&#x27;t need to shave.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work.  I just threw it away rather returning it.  Thankfully it was cheap in the first place. Would not recommend.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this thing! He uses it every chance he gets lol</li>
            <li> Great product. My expectations were low for such a device. I have always used a pair of scissors and was skeptical this would work as my fear was it would pull the hair instead of cut it.&lt;br /&gt;However, it does a great job of trimming the hair and not pulling it out at all. It&#x27;s painless, quick and convenient. As a nose/ear hair person I stamp my approval on this product.</li>
            <li> Since my husband uses this product, I&#x27;m sharing HIS review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can seal the workings so you can use it in the shower, or wash it thoroughly. Its very effective, but oh my, it tickles!!&lt;br /&gt;Its reliable and effective. Strongly built, quiet. I am very impressed with this device. It claims yu can trim your beard with it, I do not have one, and am not sure it would survive long doing that, but for nose, ears and eyebrows, its very good indeed.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s the best nose hair trimmer I have purchased. I bought the less expensive version that lasted less then 3 months. This one seems much more sturdy. It&#x27;s a good product, would recommend purchasing one.</li>
            <li> After using this product only for 2 months , all I can say is avoid buying this sub-standard product.It worked well for 3 weeks and than it started making very loud noise.The blades and the nozzle has unwanted friction bcos of which it makes very loud noise.Very poor design of blades and nozzle.I can no longer use it bcos of this and have discarded it in trashcan.</li>
            <li> Got it for a great price and I have only tried it as a nose trimmer so far, but it did the trick with little noise or irritation.  It feels a little cheap, but it was so kind of what I was expecting.  Can&#x27;t comment on durability as I tried it once, it worked and I expect it to work again next time.  My only complaint is I hate when products don&#x27;t include the batteries even though it is pretty much expected.</li>
            <li> Worked o.k for a few uses but required several passes &amp; never cut real close. Eventual started to pull more than it would cut &amp; finally stopped working all together. Going to try another brand &amp; this one will go into the trash.</li>
            <li> Tried many other brands of these before, and was always disappointed. This one works well. Only down side is that it burns through batteries pretty fast.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer I have Ever used. It&#x27; doesn&#x27;t RIP the hair out, like so many others I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s easy to clean. Overall, it&#x27;s actually a somewhat pleasure experience, which I understand is &#x27;odd&#x27; to say. Works so well that I bought this latest one for my 13yr old son.</li>
            <li> Tried more nose trimmers than I care to admit. This one is the best! Cuts well, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and price</li>
            <li> So far so good. Only time will tell.</li>
            <li> Purchased a multi-tool Panasonic trimmer from Costco for 4x the price of this just to get the same functionality, thinking it&#x27;ll be better. Nope! Something&#x27;s lost I guess when you try to get one tool to do multiple tasks vs. a dedicated tool. This turned out to be quieter, smaller and easier to handle. The main reason why I&#x27;m returning the other trimmer and keeping this one is that this can actually washed and cleaned vs. the other can only be brushed. Now mind you, I know this comparison as like comparing apples to oranges as the multi-tool was wireless and could do much more, but my need was limited to what this trimmer can do and it more than met my need!</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Was surprised how well this works.  I usually take the guards and such off from trimmers so I can get in really close, but I didn&#x27;t have to do that with this one.  It gets ALL the hairs; from the little nooks in front, to way up in there!  Those little hand held manual ones always did a good job too, but they are so clumsy.  This one gives equal or better performance without any struggle.</li>
            <li> This thing pulls my nose hairs. Even when rotating slowly it still does it. It&#x27;s a Hit and Miss days</li>
            <li> I was first introduced to this product by my Audiologist.  During a visit to her office she used this unit to trim the hair in and around my ears.  I was so impressed I checked if it was available on Amazon.com and immediately ordered one.  I am greatly pleased.</li>
            <li> It works- quickly and painlessly. Much more effective than some other products on the market. The circular blade system works much better than my single straight arm trimmer did.</li>
            <li> It works great, although I haven&#x27;t tried it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; yet. It has a very comfortable handle, and is not too complicated to figure out. My last trimmer was a Panasonic and it lasted years and years. I hope to get the same longevity out of this one.</li>
            <li> my boyfriends nostrils are Hair Free! yee haw</li>
            <li> It is about okay product compared to my last Panasonic product, which has more details (larger trench on the head tip)</li>
            <li> Had been thinking of buying a trimmer such as this for a while. Glad I finally took the step. A very neat &amp; efficient way of brushing up an aging face. A really good value.</li>
            <li> Works very well &amp; easy to keep clean.</li>
            <li> Lets face it, nose hair is really one of the most unattractive things that grows on the human body. I have had multiple nose/facial hair trimmers and while they all worked fairly well, none of them were anything I would write home to mom about. I received the Panasonic ER-GN30-k as a gift, among many other bathroom items, as I recently had an airline lose my luggage and unfortunately the bag they lost just happened to be the bag that had all of my bathroom items in it. Anyways, I am not sure why my wife chose this model but I am very grateful that she did as this is by FAR the best nose/facial hair trimmer I have used yet. Trimming nose and facial hair is now a 100% completely painless endeavor. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, my other trimmers weren&#x27;t painful but you could definitely feel what was going on. That just isn&#x27;t the case with the Panasonic. I also have to mention how quiet this unit is. I would estimate that its roughly 50% quieter than all of the other trimmers I have owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anytime I come across an item that I absolutely love, I buy an extra one and stick in a box at home. That way if it ever breaks, I have another one ready to go. My wife calls it my \\&quot;must have kit\\&quot;. Anyways, adding an item to this kit is basically the biggest compliment I can give an item as I only do it with items that I cant live without. With that being said, the Panasonic ER-GN30-k is the latest addition to my must have kit. Its an absolute must have item in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 Stars!</li>
            <li> Still use it to this day, great for quick trim work</li>
            <li> Super product!  Quiet, light, and thorough!  No more cuticle scissors in my nose or ears!  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It cleans your face, nose and ear hair very nicely.</li>
            <li> Very quiet... works well.</li>
            <li> Works well, have been using for ~6 months now and still cuts well.</li>
            <li> This does what it&#x27;s suppose to but it rolled off my desk and it doesnt even turn on with multiple trys with different batteries it might of fell 3 and a half foot so i knocked off some stars for poor durability</li>
            <li> It works as advertised. Got the package on time. Fully satisfied with the purchase. Would definitely recommend it for others.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer on the market. It does a remarkable job in the trimming of all your facial hair including those little hard to get to places. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I have used nose trimmers since last 5 years. I ordered this one as I felt my last one was about to conk off any time. It does what it is supposed to do. My main grudge is that it seems to be \\&quot;under powered\\&quot; and hence forth not able to cut the hairs so well as some other trimmers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not returning it as it seems absurd to return something after putting it in your nose and it does what it is supposed to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light weight...which in a way is good for travel but feels too light in the hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you can buy it but if you have the patience try looking for something better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE :-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It broke down after two months of use that too when I was abroad. had to buy a new one from the pharmacy on a urgent basis. When I say \\&quot;broke\\&quot;..No, it did not fall or anything. Its motor just stopped working! Yes ( even with new batteries!)</li>
            <li> In purchasing this, I had forgotten to take into account the possibility of stubble inside of my nose. My nose constantly itches and I cannot stop sneezing and I am full of regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The thingie works perfectly otherwise, though.</li>
            <li> Already stopped working!</li>
            <li> An efficient trimmer, although I have only used it a few times.  The first time you take the cap and blade apart, it will never be as quiet again, the blade does make some fair amount of noise, but not enough to bother/affect your hearing, imo.  The quick washout feature works and is handy so as to not take the cap/blade apart very often.  I think the noise comes from the blade having to bed-in again against the cutting surface every time it is taken apart, if so then taking it apart frequently will shorten the blade life.</li>
            <li> after just a short time of using this product I am ready to get rid of it. it pulls nose hairs so if you have a hard time of waking up in the morning just turn this on and stick it in your nose. you will be shouting and crying in no time</li>
            <li> This is a perfect option when you are trying to help you out with the facial hair and even with the nose one</li>
            <li> No complaints and less hair left in the sink! It is perfect to use in the shower to save prep time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a cheap trimmer I got at TjMaxx for the past few years and it has finally crapped out. I replaced it with this one and it is a nose of fresh air. It has a nice strong motor and it cuts well.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my father.  He was reaching that point in old man years where his nose hair was longer than his head hair.  It was getting embarrassing.  The simple fact that he uses this is a testament to the product.  He looks better, my whole family feels better and all is right with the world.</li>
            <li> About five years ago I had a Panasonic trimmer (I forget the model #) which worked great. Unfortunately it finally wore out and I replaced it with a different Panasonic trimmer which was...awful (it didn&#x27;t trim very well, and tended to \\&quot;pull out\\&quot; hairs; why Panasonic ever decided to discontinue the original trimmer is beyond me). So after making due with it for a few years, I saw the ER-GN30-K Vortex trimmer on Amazon and decided to give it a whirl (no pun intended). This thing is as good as my original trimmer! I&#x27;m very, very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I loved this, almost didn&#x27;t get it bc of the reviews. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> It really works great!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. Keeps the hairiness at bay.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly with no hair snagging. This is the best nose trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This device is kinda slow but eventually it gets all the hairs you need removed. Cleaning is easy, the only thing to be aware of is that it doesn&#x27;t come with a battery and the tip that cuts the hair get a bit hot.</li>
            <li> Arrived in 24 hours- husband likes it well.</li>
            <li> Tears through those vicious nose hairs like they were nothing! Has worked flawlessly for the many months I have had it. Easy to clean, easy to use. Makes my wife happy that I am at least somewhat groomed.</li>
            <li> It trims pretty well, and it was well worth the money paid for it. I only gave it four stars comparing it to my mental image of what an ideal trimmer would be. Still, I think most people would be happy with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I am &amp;#34;required&amp;#34; by Amazon to write something here, but come on, I&#x27;ve already said it.  Who wants to do a lot of reading anyway about a nasal hair trimmer.  It&#x27;s just not sexy.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it gets the nose hairs. Won&#x27;t blow your socks off, but works well.&lt;br /&gt;I like the replacement battery option rather than rechargeable.</li>
            <li> I found a great way if not perfect way to cut the hairs in my nostrils. Can assist well with ear hair or the uni-brow. Very pleased I bought one, very inexpensive at about $15-$20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t go wrong here, buy this!</li>
            <li> Good. Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> A truly great product! I&#x27;ve hand it for about two months and this trimmer really mows the grass. Guys, its great on nose and ear hair which for me is an issue. I&#x27;m still using the original batteries with no signs of slowing down.</li>
            <li> For ten bucks it&#x27;s everything I wanted to clean nose hairs. Can&#x27;t vouch for any other use as the Ear hair hasn&#x27;t crept in yet. Gentlemen over 25 do yourself a favor: find a female friend, look to the ceiling, and ask if your nose is gross. If so, buy this and never look back.</li>
            <li> Just got this razor today. I usually don&#x27;t write reviews, but this is so much more effective than my older Conair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and it works perfectly on nose hairs, ears, etc. Truly a great find!</li>
            <li> Although it does a very good job cutting the hair in nose &amp; ear canal, the cutting area is very narrow, this making it difficult to cut hair on the ear lobe, for example. The cleaning ability and ease of battery change, and other features are excellent, however.</li>
            <li> This was supposed to be a two pack, but there was only one.</li>
            <li> its a good tool to clean up. The only part is the after math. All the cut hair, after several days when they grow back are like pins and prink inside causing itch.</li>
            <li> My husband is showing his age…through his nose and ears. The hair just keeps coming! But I picked up this little gem based on its reviews and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint. I can no longer call him Gramps since his orifices are currently hair-free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried I don&#x27;t know how many nose trimmers and never found one I liked until this one.  This works great both for my nose and ears.  It cuts easily and quietly.  This is a quality product.</li>
            <li> So far the best nose trimmer I owned.  This had the best review on the Japanese website kakaku.com.  You can turn the head portion of the devise and open this release hole so that the water will run through the trimmer and exit the hole for easy cleaning.  I would recommend this for everyone!</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Trims closely, easy to clean, quiet, no pulling. Doesn&#x27;t make me hesitant at all to put it near sensitive places. Excellent product, highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Great buy!!! Works very well and I am very impressed. My fiancee loves this!! It does not pull hair and it is safer then using scissors to trim his nose and ear hairs!!!</li>
            <li> The husband&#x27;s ear hair was getting longer than the beard on the hippie that lives next door. I needed something lightweight and budget-friendly to clear up his little problem. This arrived in two days and saved our marriage. Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Nothing more to say - it is a nose hair trimmer. It cuts nose hair great. Highly recommend this. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job. Just be careful it&#x27;s one of those that can get turned on on accident.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for one purpose only: to remove straggling nose hair. I&#x27;m not in the trimming business to remove all my nose hair, but had to remove a few irritating ones that grew too long. This trimmer did its job well and efficiently. I tried using regular scissor-like trimmers and they didn&#x27;t work at all. This trimmer won&#x27;t disappoint and was painless to use (for both my nose and I). Both my nose and I are pleased.</li>
            <li> I hate nose hair more than I hate Al Qaeda!  Also, I noticed that pulling out nose hair would actually make me sick.  My nose would get runny, and I would start sneezing and other things, and eventually get a cold.  Do yourself a favor and get this, it works!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Very high quality, works without problems. Good price. Panasonic bravo. amazon thanks. I am very glad. Buy - you will be happy.</li>
            <li> After having owned a few of these, I can say that this is by far the best trimmer I have used.  Easy to use.  Battery powered so no need for recharger cables clutter.  I have yet to received any accidental cuts, yet trims down almost to the skin.</li>
            <li> excellent. well built quiet a great value, and does its job well.  UPDATE 8-29-15: Use caution if removing the outer cutting blade. the inner blade is very small and easily lost. i lost mine so i have to order another one. you cant replace the cutter. A simple case of a guy who didnt read the instructions, not panasonic&#x27;s fault. No need to even remove it you can flush water through it w/o.</li>
            <li> Broke and not working after 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> Great at trimming down nasal shame.  Every now and then a slight pinch, but certainly never made me bleed.  Easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> Have tried other brands but for the money this one has them all beat!</li>
            <li> Great item, works very good!</li>
            <li> My old one was in use more then 3 years without any problem until I accidentally dropped it.This is a new version and its excellent device.</li>
            <li> I have finally been able to get my nose hair under control. Now I no longer have to braid it to keep it nice and neat. Also, I can hear because my ears are hair free. This was a good product at a good price. No complaints so far!!</li>
            <li> Very excellent and process</li>
            <li> I was not expecting a product that would not pull hairs, but this is really a great trimmer!  I would recommend this to anyone!  The trimming is quite good, and I really like the ease of disassembly for simple cleaning.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with this purchase. I got it for my boyfriend whose gotten older and his nose hairs longer! It holds a charge well and seems to clip really well. It isn&#x27;t loud and performs great!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to use . Works well in nose and ear. I bought 3 of them and I am saisfied.</li>
            <li> The blades need to be sharper. Pulls a bit too much</li>
            <li> Great little grooming aide.</li>
            <li> Not bad when it works. As most have stated on all these type of trimmers, a AA battery powered device will be kind of weak, but they do get the job done.&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m not exactly super hairy at 41, but it did stutter. Second one worked much better.</li>
            <li> I love it.. easy to use and clean. must have,,</li>
            <li> Best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. I have unusually tough nose hairs and have tried several nose hair trimmers in the past and have been left disappointed. Before buying this item I did some research and found others saying how good this one was and boy were they right. It took care of my nose hairs in a matter of seconds. I recommend this to anyone guy.</li>
            <li> Failed after three uses.  I have a lot of wiry ear and nose hair, which was why I needed the thing, but I&#x27;m not my grandfather yet, either.  It was weak.</li>
            <li> Works great for a few months, but once the blades become dull it will start pulling hairs instead of cutting them (Very painful!).  I would still give it 5 stars IF they sold replacement blades... Unfortunately, they do not - so you need to order a new one when the blades get dull.</li>
            <li> very difficult to install battery,power seems a little slow.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic trimmer that my husband requested.  After many years of use, the first one became dull.  It is a very good buy for the money - well made and easy to use - and hope this one is as good as the first one he used for so long.</li>
            <li> Delivered as promised.  Met all my expectations.  Cuts and cleans with out bogging down. Good price, good product.</li>
            <li> Great product, good price, and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> This is better than some but not as good as the Heavy Duty Nose Trimmer</li>
            <li> Wish I didn&#x27;t need this. Hair seems to grow everywhere but on my head. A helpful tool for the deforestation of places that should be barren of growth!</li>
            <li> Received the product this weekend. Installed the battery and unit did not turn on. Was totally shocked when I saw a piece of hair on the body of the unit. Seems like a returned item to me. Rather go pick it up at a local store</li>
            <li> Great.  Does the job and is compact and efficient.</li>
            <li> Nice value. Works well and is more comfortable when cutting than most. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> use this to line up my beard... its awesome!!!</li>
            <li> Great nose clippers.  These really do the job in trimming the hair unlike those made in China.  Even thought they are a little more expensive, they are worth it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works fairly well, always have a fresh battery. If the battery gets old or you try and use a weaker battery it will get stuck and die with your hair stuck in it and it really hurts when you have to pluck it out. I wish it had a long lasting watch type battery or some type of calculator batter in it. Or a rechargable built in for the price of this unit it really should. That is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars.It works well otherwise, I tried to use a battery that had been sitting for a while, that&#x27;s a no go.</li>
            <li> works very well. I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer I have ever purchased, and I am impressed with how well it works. It&#x27;s painless and affordable to the consumer. No complaints pertaining to the performance of this product.</li>
            <li> stop working after 3 times use......</li>
            <li> Not much can be said about a male facial hair trimmer...as we get older we find we have hair growing out of spots that we could never imagine.  I used this on my pesky nose hairs, for my unibrow, and for the peach fuzz growing on my ears.  The trimmer works exceptionally well and gives a close trim.  I have a sharper image trimmer that uses a C size battery....it seems under-powered as compared to this Panasonic unit with a AA alkaline battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ON rechargeable batteries: They are not recommended as Alkaline will give it the power it needs...however, I found that this trimmer works just FINE with a Eneloop battery and is just as strong as with an Alkaline battery.  I have been using it with an Eneloop for a while now and have not experienced any loss of power or slow downs.  Your experience may vary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great unit, priced a bit higher then others but worth the extra $.  5/5 for me.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one.  Very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The engine failed in two months.</li>
            <li> I like it, got the hairs pretty well.&lt;br /&gt;it can run a bit warm tho...</li>
            <li> I was reluctant to buy another Panasonic trimmer since my last one was painful to use.  But the reviews convinced me, and I also want to recommend this model.  It works great and it doesn&#x27;t pull or pinch.  No more tears!</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband because his last one broke, and he&#x27;s super happy with it.  He really likes that you can use it even in the water.</li>
            <li> Work as stated.  No pinching for hair, for now.</li>
            <li> My hubby says it&#x27;s a really good one and he has had a few in his time. He rekons it&#x27;s the best one he&#x27;s had</li>
            <li> Small size and works well. The price is very reasonable and my Dad likes it better than the more expensive one he had last.</li>
            <li> Have used it for about 12 months and it&#x27;s worked great.  It is amazing how effective it is inside the nose and ears.  High quality that&#x27;s great appreciated !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I finally decided to stop wasting my money on those super-cheap nose hair trimmers that fall apart. This thing is sturdy, reliable and offers fantastic battery life. Plus, when it trims the hair, it makes a really satisfying &amp;#34;snap.&amp;#34; I like to think that this sound is putting all of the other stray hairs on notice.</li>
            <li> If you are looking specifically for a &#x27;rotary&#x27; trimmer, this one has little room for improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I feel the &#x27;reciprocating&#x27; trimmers do a better job with fewer missed hairs &amp; quicker trim times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will be replacing this with a small &#x27;reciprocating&#x27; trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for nose and ear.  DO NOT get it anywhere near your beard unless you like being painfully violated.</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job. Dont buy cheap $8 -$10 ones at tjmax or marshall. Spend few more dollars or wait till price is $10 for this one. Strong and works well</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a fantastic job and worth every cent. There has been no easy way to trim ear hair. I&#x27;ve tried using a razor and beard trimmers and they don&#x27;t work. This unit trims quite well with no ripping of the hairs out and without any discomfort Cleans up very easily with water. Uses 1 AA battery. The unit is quite compact. I would have paid twice as much for this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well.i&#x27;ve been staying away from the &amp;#34;all-in-one&amp;#34; trimmers and more toward single purpose trimmer.So how does it work? I stick it in my nose or in my ears and it makes this crunching sound. Then by the wonders of science i don&#x27;t have long hairs sticking out anymore. Are you gonna use this on your pubes or to shave team logos into your hair? No. You can rinse it off in the water and its good to go.  Seems to be holding up pretty good, have not had issues with it pulling my hair like a sissy</li>
            <li> This unit really cuts close, easy to clean, remove top and rinse with water. If some else uses it you can disinfect if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem, it will run down after a while with AA bat. Not plug in style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is convenient with out cord though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobby&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RH</li>
            <li> Great little product! Removes hair quickly, easily and painless.  I would definitely recommend. It is very portable and has a low humming sound.</li>
            <li> Got it very fast. Had a chance to use it now. It is very well built for a inexpensive unit.  Works very well, no pulled hair &#x3D; sharp blades and tight tolerances. I really like the fact that all you have to do is rinse it out with water. My old unit that it replaced you had to take it apart to clean. One other thing, it is very quiet. My old unit was so loud that it hurt my ears when grooming them. This one you barely notice. Another nice feature is it stands on its base and doesn&#x27;t require a stand to take up valuable counter space.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: Well built, cheap, quiet, cleans with running water&lt;br /&gt;CONS: none</li>
            <li> It works as advertised . Who can ask for more .</li>
            <li> I bought this in November of 2014 and it already is broken. Never used in water ever. Thought it was battery but its not. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product due to the very short lifespan.</li>
            <li> No pulls or pain. 1 AA battery lasts and lasts. Panasonic makes great devices. They also have a 2 AA shaver that is as good as ANY I have ever used.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say about it. It works. I haven&#x27;t tried using it wet; it&#x27;s not something I think I&#x27;ll use more than once every few months.</li>
            <li> Works as expected! Not much more to say!</li>
            <li> It works well so I like it so far. Have not had time to use it much yet, but so far so good.</li>
            <li> nothing worse than smiling and having nose hairs come tickling their way down to say hello. This thing works well and doesn&#x27;t pull (well, who knows 6 months down the line).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who has nose hair growing like he&#x27;s Rapunzel, nose hair version. He used to use a little scissor to cut his nose hair when they get too long. I figured this will be a good investment. He&#x27;ll use it often, it&#x27;ll probably make the process faster, and it won&#x27;t break easily. I was right on all three counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves this thing and even now, months after using it, he still marvels at the ease of trimming his ever growing hair. It&#x27;s easy to clean. Just take apart the top and run it under the tap. The battery lasts forever. We haven&#x27;t had to replace the batteries since we had it. All in all, it&#x27;s well worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1/03/2013: Yet another year. We changed the battery for this thing only once. It is still going strong and he uses it a lot.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very sharp.</li>
            <li> great product gets those hard to get areas</li>
            <li> Works in and out of water no issues with it.</li>
            <li> Although this thing works.... it needs more power I think...maybe its all in my mind.. it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be very quick?!? If you don&#x27;t mind rubbing this thing around your nostrils for a long time trying to catch the hairs that you can see plain as day... then this is the nose hair trimmer for you.  needs more RPMS?!?!?</li>
            <li> I shave dad now that he cant and a neighbor recommended this model cause it works great around the nooks and crannies of his dad&#x27;s wrinkled face when he does him.  It is definitely useful for that kind of thing and dad does look neater now.  I did think it would be easier to use because of all the glowing reviews and it is  on me but on dads wiry hair it takes a lot of repeat passes to clean him up.  I think its dads coarse hair and not the fault of the tool.  But I have been known to be wrong.</li>
            <li> this thing tears it up!  Wish it were a little smaller, but no biggie.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for over a month and it serves it&#x27;s purpose. However, I don&#x27;t used it in any wet conditions.</li>
            <li> I owned 4 to 5 cheap nose hair trimmers in the past, Panasonic ER-GN30-K is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best trimmer I have bought over the years.  It doesn&#x27;t bog down like most and has a clever water port for rinsing.  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Great transaction A+++++++++++</li>
            <li> Good! AWESOME PERFECT LOVE IT!!!!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, works great</li>
            <li> In reviewing this product, I am a new user (I.e. have used it less than ten times). Overall, the trimmer was easy to set-up and use, and has been effective at cleaning up any unwanted ear/nose hair. Durability-wise, it appears to be well-built, but only time will tell. My initial impression is that it&#x27;s an excellent product for what you pay for it, and would gladly recommend it to those who are seeking a similar product.</li>
            <li> The older you get the more hair in the nose and ears.  This does a great job, and keeps me well trimmed.</li>
            <li> Small, inexpensive, lightweight, compact and effective. Would appreciate more power/motor speed, but it works as advertized.  Not yet sure about battery life...appears sufficient for 1x week use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought \\&quot;Seen on TV\\&quot; trimmers, cheap trimmers, and expensive ones. I like this one the best, it is smartly made, moderately priced, well built, and functions as it should without the pain some trimmers have. For most people this is really all you should need. Sure you can buy a cheaper one, but why not get one that is going to stick with you for a while. The battery lasts a considerable amount of time, and it is easy to clean. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Fortunately for me, I don&#x27;t suffer from nose hair problems, but my husband does. I got this for him for Father&#x27;s Day 2011, and he loves it! He actually got out of his leather recliner after opening this present and went straight into the bathroom to use it... and getting my husband out of his chair to do anything is near impossible, *lol*.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, he doesn&#x27;t have anything to compare this Trimmer to because he&#x27;s never had a powered one before, always using scissors. Well, he was thrilled with the results this Trimmer gave him. I asked him specifically if it pulled the hairs or hurt him in any way and he said it did not. He said the action of the blades was smooth, the cut close, and the clean-up easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He appreciated that they included a Cleaning-brush with the Trimmer and a Cap to keep the blade-housing covered when not in use. Oh, and it takes 1-AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read a lot of Reviews here at Amazon before buying one of these things; and it seemed to me the biggest fault was in pulling the hair instead of providing a clean, sharp cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that&#x27;s why I bought this Panasonic Trimmer. It got consistently high ratings here, and elsewhere, and no one ever complained about the blades pulling at the hair instead of cutting it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic Trimmer is a keeper. Buy one with confidence!</li>
            <li> Not my proudest purchase, but being in my late 40&#x60;s I gave in. I expected some pain, especially with the nose hairs, but felt none at all. Buy one and tuck it away before you start looking like one of your hairy uncles.</li>
            <li> Great while it lasted. It stopped working after 4 or 5 uses.  I replaced the battery, took it apart, no luck.</li>
            <li> Broke after just two uses...I&#x27;m not sure how it has such great reviews. Maybe I just got a lemon.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS OK. IT SEEMS A LITTLE UNDER&lt;br /&gt;POWERED BUT I GUESS YOU DON&#x27;T WANT A BUZZ SAW&lt;br /&gt;IN YOU NOSE OR EAR.............</li>
            <li> It worked very well while it lasted. But after 7 months of using it about once a week (and rinsing it thoroughly under hot water according to directions every time), it suddenly got very noisy with an unpleasant buzzing and grinding sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course it has a two-year warranty. But since mailing it to Texas for warranty service would cost at least half of the ten dollars I paid for it, I just tossed it. I&#x27;m trying a Philips model now to see if it&#x27;s more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Edit:&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Philips model but didn&#x27;t like it. It buzzed and vibrated, and was much fussier to use. So I&#x27;m buying another one of these Panasonics, and hope it will last longer than the first one.</li>
            <li> Works like most ten dollars trimmers</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer if you have some extraneous nose or ear hair that needs removing. I got this for my husband, who says it works way better than the one he had before. Cuts very close with no pinching or pulling of the hairs.</li>
            <li> Very nice unit. Light, not noisy, effective.</li>
            <li> I have only had this product for a few weeks, and I see no problems. The trimmer gently trims the hair, without hurting your nose.</li>
            <li> This little device was exactly the inexpensive solution i needed for a growing problem &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;Fresh battery made it work even better</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my husband  who needed a new trimmer and he loves this one! Great gift for men.  I even used it once!</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer,works good for my hubby.So simple to use mainly for use for Men.Try you will like it.</li>
            <li> I am blessed with hair and nothing is more unattractive than having rappel lines hanging from your nostril. This bad bad boy went in there and took care of business. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Thank God!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little surprising at first-then you get used to the vibrations.  Makes you sneeze the first couple of times.</li>
            <li> A good buy and works very effectively in cleaning up that unsightly hair.I do like the ability to clean it whilst the motor runs under the tap.</li>
            <li> good stuff...small in size</li>
            <li> Works great! used it for nose hair trimming. Cut every piece of hair :)</li>
            <li> This arrived quickly and was packaged to protect the product.  Getting the product out of the plastic blister pack, was the hardest part of the set up for use!  The instructions were easy to follow, although it&#x27;s use is pretty straight forward.  Lesson learned, use a new battery when you start!  I particularly like the cleaning ability for this trimmer. I&#x27;ve had others that were similar in shape, but being able to run this under a stream of water with a little soap, gives me a better sense that it is really being cleaned! I may come back an upgrade to 5 stars depending on how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these trimmers for myself initially. I use it mainly for my ears, so that it is easier for me to insert ear plugs at night to sleep (We live in a really noisy neighbourhood.). I also use it for my nose and eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day when I was visiting my 96 year old Dad, I caught him trimming his nose hairs with a small very pointy pair of scissors. I thought he was going to give himself a lobotomy! Right away, I ordered a trimmer for him, which he uses regularly and frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate this trimmer four stars, rather than five, because its not possible to buy a replacement blade for it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product that does exactly what it is suppose to do. You will not be disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s  me but I could not figure out how to push the inside blade out of the end of the outside blade so it shaved of hair.  My husband who is a lot more mechanical savvy than I am couldn&#x27;t figure it out either.  How hard can it be?  I figured there was something defective with it so I sent it back.  So irritating.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is comfortable to use, and easy to clean.  The &#x27;vortex&#x27; nonsense is just a bit of over-engineering; really Panasonic, it&#x27;s a nose hair trimmer, not a lawnmower.  Just be sure to let it air dry before putting it back together after cleaning it.</li>
            <li> This is worth paying a few dollars more for.  It is well made, and works.</li>
            <li> I had an old Panasonic that I lost in a move. This is every bit as good as the old one.</li>
            <li> Works well and very easy to use.  A great improvement on what I used to use.</li>
            <li> It works great.  I should be using it more often.</li>
            <li> This little tool is the best! Does the trick and keeps those little nose hairs under control.</li>
            <li> This thing is way better than other cheap ones. Not as noisy, and it doesn&#x27;t pull your hairs.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Great trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutely amazing. I bought it for my boyfriend and he says that it is the best hair trimmer he has ever owned. It doesnt pull your hair or anything and doesnt get hot. It is fast and efficient.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic wet/dry nose and facial hair trimmer was just what I was looking for. the price was very reasonable and the delivery was very quick.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer arrived on time and works fine. You need to refer to the manual for cleaning though.</li>
            <li> I got this for my son. So far, it does a great job of trimming excess hair.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact you can put it under running water to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;The price is so reasonable that I won&#x27;t feel like my money was wasted&lt;br /&gt;when it needs replacing.&lt;br /&gt;It worked so well, I got my brother one for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Love this item, very glad I purchased. Works more efficiently than cheaper models.</li>
            <li> Worked fine for a while, then quit working. Not a battery issue. Bought a different brand.</li>
            <li> Big improvement over my old trimmer.  Much more quiet and does a better job of trimming with less nose tickle.</li>
            <li> Best Product for this use I have every used.  works great and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t and don&#x27;t plan to submerse it in water but so far the trimmer works great.  Highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It does not pull the nose hair like earlier model did; I would highly recommend this nose hair trimmer to anyone</li>
            <li> The product is good and useful. However, the shipping was too late. I want to reduce one star even though it is useful.</li>
            <li> I have several different Panasonic trimmers.  All are excellent in avoiding the unkempt look.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I like this Panasonic trimmer. No pulling of hair. It actually cuts it. Easy to clean. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As said in most of the other reviews, this thing actually works. Unlike others that seem to pull more hair than they cut, this one does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do, and for a very reasonable price. It takes a AA battery, and although others mention that using a rechargeable battery will produce undesirable results, I had no problems at all using an Eneloop, although I&#x27;ll often rotate many of my rechargeable batteries, so maybe that&#x27;s the trick.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try any other trimmers just because i find these ones good. Although, the blades on my previous (similar but not the same, cheapest of their product line) Panasonic trimmer went blunt after 3 years, and I am using it moderately, maybe once every two weeks or so. So I bought three more for the next decade.</li>
            <li> Basically my title says it all. This trimmer does a GREAT job on nose hairs but that&#x27;s about it. If you plan to use it for ears or other areas do not bother because it does not work. If you want it just for the nose area, then it works perfect! Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I am verry thrilled about this product. It&#x60;s safe to use (I admit... when I bought it I was a litle sceptick), light and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer  works well, seems well constructed and is a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband earlier this year. He hasn&#x27;t complained about it, so I&#x27;m guessing it gets the job done. Not to mention it still works. No complaints here. Good quality and even better price.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> A great product.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Worked great right out of the box but with way less than a year&#x27;s use it doesn&#x27;t cut. The trimmer makes a grinding sound even after thorough cleanings and careful re-assembly.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and is sharp to remove hair from most difficult to remove places. I was able to get done is less than few mins.</li>
            <li> trims my nose hair and cleans out easy... thatssss about it...</li>
            <li> Good product, works well, but quality could be better.</li>
            <li> Broke after two or three months of use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a semi gag gift for my boyfriend at Christmas time, but it turned out to be a great product!</li>
            <li> I use this tool more often to complete my shave than I use it to trim nose hairs. Indeed, the trimmer can be used anywhere that a razor has&lt;br /&gt;trouble with. It works on the nose, ears, upper lip, chin, and between the eyebrows. The fact that it is cordless makes it very easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;The only negative thing about the trimmer that I can think of is that it tickled my nose hairs a lot the first time I used it.</li>
            <li> Works very well on nasal hair. Very easy to use and clean. No pulling or cutting flesh. Nice product works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut from the top, but rather the sides of the blade. Remember that and you&#x27;ll experience less pain.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple in design and purpose. Effective. Seems to burn through the battery pretty quickly though. Also the clean aspect by flushing it with water design isn&#x27;t really applicable and is overall kind of pointless as it doesn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have PCOS and it said would do faces.  It takes awhile to do the face with it ebcause it doesn&#x27;t cover adn very big area.</li>
            <li> I made this choice between a manual trimmer and an electric trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The manual trimmer seemed awkward to actuate the trimmer and hold it in the area that you are planning on trimming.&lt;br /&gt;This one you just turn it on touch the area and the unwanted hair is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that would be great for a future model would be a small white LED light in the tip to make it easier to see the lighter colored hairs.</li>
            <li> Does the job and arrived quickly</li>
            <li> Very good and do exactly what it is intended for.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. Great product!</li>
            <li> I had it for a short time, but it is working as advertised. And I felt no pinching/pulling that some reviewers have reported.</li>
            <li> Quieter and smoother than cheaper competitors.</li>
            <li> every man needs this in his grooming kit!  you wont be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Works just fine for the hubs.</li>
            <li> Does the job perfectly. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> This thing is garbage. Works great about 5 times and then always falters under the stress of my steel wool nose hair.</li>
            <li> The small diameter and smooth surface makes it somewhat hard to grasp. I&#x27;ve had problems with iTV remote and ordered the leather sleeve on Amazon so you have a point of reference.  Hence, I believe the reason for some reviews indicating dropping and damage.  So if you are prone to dropping things go with the larger diameter Panasonic unit (I believe performance will be similar).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Performance was very good.  I compared it to a older design (that I still have) of a Panasonic nose hair trimmer and you could see the results since you needed to clean it out versus flushing. I would clean out the old Panasonic unit with a moistened Q-tip and you see your results.  I cleaned out the ER-GN30K using Q-tip method versus brushing or flushing out and was amazed how well and how fine cuts were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just be careful in handling...smooth surface and small diameter makes it prone to slipping and dropping. Hence, the four stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, son was also impressed by results. He was using a pair of scissors (embroidery), which I told him is not the way to go...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll make this short and sweet...  I&#x27;ve tried at least twelve different models over the years (including that huge trimmer from Sharper Image) and this works better than all of them put together.  No pulling. Easy to clean. And thoroughly effective. Hope it lasts (i.e. that the blades don&#x27;t get too dull, too soon).  Come to think of it, though ... for the price, if it only lasts six months it would still be worth it.</li>
            <li> This machine does just what i want with ear hair but tickles/hurts in the nose. Can just get it in enough to get rid of unsightly nose hair.</li>
            <li> Five years ago, I paid $40 for sharper image&#x27;s nose hair trimmer, recently I dropped it on the floor and the plastic shaft that the blade rode on snapped...instant junk. I bought this one for less than half the price, and the new blade lacked the \\&quot;tug and yank\\&quot; feature that I had been accustomed to...for the price this is a great unit.</li>
            <li> The first one was DOA the 2nd one sent worked for about 2 weeks. this product is worth about .50 cents.   Amazon does a good job on returns, Thank you.</li>
            <li> It works well and is erogomically correct!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this happens to everyone, but as soon as you hit middle age you start growing long hairs in odd places. They grow out of your ears. Your nose. On the ears. You get bushy eyebrows like Andy Rooney. Finally you get hair growth in oddball places I would rather not mention. Needless to say, whether you are vain or not this aberrant growth can lead to some difficulty with your interpersonal relationships.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  This is where this Panasonic Vortex hair trimmer comes in. It is small, portable, battery operated, and gets rid of those oddball hairs, wherever they may be. If you have a close contact with people job like me and do a lot of travelling, this unit is for you. It quickly and efficiently cuts off that unwanted hair with no problems. It is safe. It makes you look younger. It is easy to stuff in your bag. It is durable. It is a great adjunct to a shaver and gets places a shaver won&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Although not a permanent solution, it is a lot cheaper and safer than a visit to the dermatologist for laser therapy and safer and more comfortable than electrolysis or plucking. I give this little gadget five stars. It saves a little aggravation and only needs to be used weekly or as needed. And it is easy on batteries so you will not go broke maintaining it.</li>
            <li> Ok, I&#x27;ll see how long the battery lasts</li>
            <li> thanks for good and nice product</li>
            <li> I got this because at age 63, I was getting hair in unwanted places.. Removing it with tweezers is not all that easy,,, While traveling, I saw a buddy use a device like this.. He asked if I used one. I said no, never tried one... Said he liked his!!! So, when I returned from y travels, I went to Amazon, searched out the best model I could find and ordered it.. The model I got was this one, and so far, it has been great... If it continues at this rate, I will be very happy.... So far, so good.. Yes, I would do it again, if I screwed this one up....</li>
            <li> ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Inexpensive and does the job great.  I use it for nose and ear hair... dare I say it makes cutting these fun?  Cuts the hair without cutting your skin.  You are supposed to clean it with every use, but this only takes a few seconds.  Love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This trimmer is not well made.  Have had two of them, and each time I dropped the trimmer ONCE in the bathroom, and it stopped working properly after that.  A personal appliance like this that is meant to be frequently handled (especially in a wet environment) should be made to withstand a single drop.  Will be purchasing a different brand.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have experience with nose hair trimmers to compare it to. It gets the job done and its a good price.</li>
            <li> I love this little device--I&#x27;ve had it about 2 or 3 weeks and it is working great! My nose has been cleanly trimmed ever since it arrived two or three weeks ago. I&#x27;ve washed it once or twice after use and it still looks brand-new.    Con: the image on Amazon shows different places you can use the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex, but I would disagree with the mustache area. You can&#x27;t get a close enough shave with this thing to warrant using it on your face really.. Reading over some of the mediocre reviews reveals that people have had it snag on their facial hair, so this reinforces what I just said.     However, look at the thing and realize it was made for the finer hairs of your nose and ears!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Not cheap junk.  Functional and cleanable.  No problems.  I stick it in my nose and *poof*, no more nose afro.</li>
            <li> Product arrived within the estimated time.  This is one of the best trimmers I have ever used and love the easy way to clean with water.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to use. it&#x27;s good so far</li>
            <li> Great trimmer. Was afraid of it hurting but it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Just feels strange.</li>
            <li> I just received my product and I found it very efficient, safe, comfortable and easy to use. My only complaint is about Panasonic&#x27;s packaging - I don&#x27;t know why they, or just anyone, use that kind of plastic package, which is awfully hard to open and can easily hurt your fingers.</li>
            <li> The head/cutting internals broke after three uses (and a few days past the return period). Before that, it sported a weak motor even with an excellent battery. I also experienced quite a bit of tug and pull. Even if it had not broken, I would have purchased something else.</li>
            <li> Was one of the best trimmers I&#x27;ve used yet. I bought it because Amazon listed it as one of their best sellers. I loved the flushing feature of it. Unfortunately it stopped working after 10 months. It sputtered to a stop for a few weeks and required a firm tap to get started. I&#x27;ll be looking for a different brand soon.</li>
            <li> Works great and quality seems just right</li>
            <li> Purchased as a replacement trimmer.  Works like a charm. Glad I purchased this particular trimmer. Thanks amazon a lot. Will buy again</li>
            <li> Works as intended.  Well made.  Good product. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Works very nice.  Love it!  Great price too.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Had it for over a year and it is still getting rid of my nose hairs for me.</li>
            <li> No problems so far except the double A battery doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.</li>
            <li> So far so good! Have used it 4 times and it works as it should. Seems a tad more sturdy than ones we have had in the past.</li>
            <li> Works great at getting at those odd places where hair wants to grow, but you don&#x27;t want it to be there. I had another trimmer that was ok, but had just didn&#x27;t seem to have the power this one has. I am pleased with the way this works.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for our son for Christmas. He is only in his 30&#x27;s but in last year or so   developed nose and ear hair much to his dismay! He was very happy to receive the product to take care of his  unwanted hairy problem :) The product works great and the added bonus is the hair trimmer removes hair painlessly.  He is very satisfied! Over all I continue to be very happy with products I buy from Amazon at prices I can afford.</li>
            <li> After my last two cheap nose/ear hair trimmers died I decided to give this fancier one a shot. It was worth ever penny and in case you didn&#x27;t notice it has a 2 year guarantee. What more could you want from a product and I think it looks attractive.</li>
            <li> Very good product. It works well and I had no problem with it.</li>
            <li> I used this for less than 6 months, probably less than 20 times.  I was never impressed with the cutting tool, it is no different from the cheap trimmers you can get anywhere; it doesn&#x27;t trim very completely and pulls sometimes.  Then it quit.  Tried a new battery and found a bit of rust in the battery compartment, which was completely closed.  Never used it in the shower, just rinsed it after use.</li>
            <li> worked fine at first, now it keeps shutting off like the battery is dying but ive tried numerous new batterys</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer - noise level is very low so it won&#x27;t blow out my aging eardrums. Absolutely no painful pulling and it&#x27;s quite easy to clean. Definitely better than the crappy discount store models I&#x27;ve bought in the past.</li>
            <li> Does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. It just use one battery. I am quite satisfied with it.</li>
            <li> Works well but to be honest seems kinda cheap</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer - highly recommended especially for its price.</li>
            <li> Best personal trimmer I found.</li>
            <li> Great for my husband&#x27;s ear and nose hair trims! Barbers just don&#x27;t get it all. This is easy to clean, relatively quiet and small to store. It also holds ats battery life very well. I GREAT grooming tool.</li>
            <li> I had another one before, I was used to the noise and roughness of the machine, but then I found this one and it is surprisingly quiet and effective and on top of that, very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Works great, excellent buy.</li>
            <li> Does the job right... cleaning system is a great feature</li>
            <li> I was encouraged by the good reviews that this trimmer received and bought it, and I have been generally happy with it although it takes much more time to trim than a similar Remington model that I used to have. It also feels a little less comfortable than previous trimmers I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: it does was it is supposed to do&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I think there are some trimmers that trim more effectively and comfortably</li>
            <li> I have had a few of the so called universal trimmers that have the nose hair attachments, and they are mostly uselss... and I tried a few others, and they did an awful job, left hair long enough to still see, while being mostly ineffecteve.  Admittedly I do not have much nose hair, so I would use tweezers instaed.  But if you have ever done that... it SUCKS.  I saw this and figured I would try it because it was inexpensive... but WOW, this is amazing.  In mere seconds, its all gone, and not just shorter, but still there... but actually gone.  Great product, quick and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Pretty good, doesn&#x27;t pull hair or anything.  Upsate I&#x27;ve bought three of these since first time.  They seem to last 5-6 uses and issues start.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  In fact with the wet dry feature, more than I was looking for.  Priced  right and arrived in two days.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do pretty well (actually better than I expected).  Instructions on how to take it apart for cleaning could have been clearer, but not really a problem.  Too soon to tell if merits 5 starts: if  the blades hold their sharpness for a reasonable period of time, I might boost my rating.</li>
            <li> Great price work fine</li>
            <li> Keeps my noise garden in check!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty self explanatory. it does exactly what the product description says it will do. i have absolutely no complaints.</li>
            <li> Easy painless effective</li>
            <li> Works great for nose hairs as long as you use it quickly. After a few minutes the end heats up and can be a little uncomfortable.  I tried to use it on my 5 year old&#x27;s overly extensive eyebrows but it ended up pulling out a eyebrow hair which hurt her and there was a pinpoint spot of blood there so I haven&#x27;t tried that again.  I&#x27;m wondering if that happened because the hair was too long???</li>
            <li> very good, except for the fact that it gets warmer but does a really good job</li>
            <li> Arrived very fast and the product does work as advertised, I would purchase again...</li>
            <li> Had been struggling with a different trimmer for a few years...you could say it just couldn&#x27;t cut it.  So I read all the reviews and decided to try this one.  Put the battery in (battery not included), and this one fired right up.  Very close, comfortable and fast trim. Easy clean up too. Only had it a week, but I would recommend.</li>
            <li> good trimmer for men and women - easy to use, small enough to carry with you or pack for a trip.</li>
            <li> My husband used it and he is rather succinct so here&#x27;s his review:  works well, easy to use, made removing nose hair easy and not painful. No problem cleaning it--takes up small space for storage.  He had one of those kits before that had all these different attachments but really only used the nose trimmer. So for him, having this one product works great!</li>
            <li> I have another Panasonic hair trimmer and it works great so we got two of these for my wife&#x27;s brothers in Ukraine.  Before they got this they used small scissors and there were occasionally &amp;#34;accidents&amp;#34; that resulted in pain and blood (as you can imagine).  They love these trimmers.  Like all Panasonic trimmers, they do not seem to catch and grab skin - I&#x27;ve had that issue with another brand trimmer in the past and it hurts!  I push my trimmer right up against the skin to get at difficult hairs and in over 2 years never had it once catch my skin or cause any pain.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> love it. works well and cuts hair around with ease.  I would buy it again for sure.  great product. well made.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used this item 3 or 4 times but it works as advertised.  Much better than less expensive models; the motor seems stronger.  Well built.</li>
            <li> Does a reasonable job, no complaints.  Haven&#x27;t had it catch/pull any hairs yet.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical but perfect for nose</li>
            <li> Works great and does what it is suppose.  Cleans easily and makes cutting the hard spots around nose and ears easy.</li>
            <li> Just what I needed. Very nice to travel with.</li>
            <li> does what it claims.  no complaints.</li>
            <li> Best nose hair trimmer! It runs on one AA battery, you can replace the battery very easy. When cut the hair it doesn&#x27;t feel pain or any unconfort.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very good product&lt;br /&gt;I have been using well&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> Top quality . Worth the money!</li>
            <li> Murdered the nose hair.  That is for sure.</li>
            <li> I mainly purchased this product as a way of getting a close trip on my mustache around the nose area. The item works great on nose and ear hair issues, but when it comes to visible touch-up work, it falls short. It leaves quite a large amount of stubble which still must be dealt with using another kid of blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a safe and easy item to use for nose and ear hair, quite safe and easy. I&#x27;m not sure how it would be used for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> Simple device and does the job.</li>
            <li> Well this is one product I wish I would have purchased years ago.  I am 50+ years old and have hair growing places now that I never had problems with before.  This little unit does exactly what it say&#x27;s it will do and does not pinch or hurt.  Excellent value and you have to try it to appreciate it.  I bet you kick yourself in the rear for not getting one of these a long time ago.  Good quality, fair price and fast delivery.  Buy this thing and you will love it.</li>
            <li> Works great for nose hair and very slight beard trimming. Does tend to choke pretty easily so you have to clean it out every 10 seconds. I don&#x27;t like how it is so low power, but it does small jobs well.</li>
            <li> Great device, makes trimming a piece of cake. Very convenient design and easy to handle/clean.</li>
            <li> I bought this for the obvious reasons and after 2 weeks of use, I can say it has it&#x27;s ups and downs. The first time you use this, is slightly unnerving putting a spinning blade into your nose even knowing it can&#x27;t really hurt you. However, after the first few seconds, you realize it&#x27;s not that bad. The blades come fairly sharp already and more or less cut the hair easily. Sometimes with a thicker follicle, it can tug on the hair as the blade struggles to cut it. I think so far it has done this maybe 3 or 4 times with me. My biggest complaint is the device leaves stubble maybe 1mm high in your nose and if you squeeze your nose to stop a sneeze or when you&#x27;re swimming, the stubble can be quiet painful believe it or not. After all, human hair is stronger than copper of the same diameter. As a result, you could have dozens of little hairs stabbing the inside of your nose. Other than that, the device could be a little stronger but what can you expect from a single AA battery power source. I&#x27;m a little hesitant to use this in the shower as it advertises but when I do, I will update this review. So far for the price though, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> this is made in china,it&#x27;s ok for me to using every day,thx</li>
            <li> It works great. Cleans up nicely</li>
            <li> A completely average nose trimmer. Nothing special. Still pulled the hairs a little... right out of the box &#x27;sharp&#x27;. I expected it to have a more powerful motor or sharper blades or something for all the rave reviews, but it&#x27;s entirely average.</li>
            <li> Works great. It has kept my nose and ear hair from looking terrible. It is smooth and does not hurt when it pulls out the little hairs inside of you. Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great, I had others, but like cordless phones I&#x27;m sticking with Panasonic stuff. They just work.</li>
            <li> This is a great nose hair trimmer. It runs off batteries so be aware of when you need to change them. It works great and this style works so much better than the flat blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;06/16/2014 - Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been just over a year and it&#x27;s dead. At first I just thought it was dead batt. but changed and still no go. Dead! I initially gave it 5 Stars, but no more. Only a year. That just sucks.</li>
            <li> I gave these as a gift to a friend and at first they were offended, but then they got over it, but anyway, friend loves it--great product end of story.</li>
            <li> Love it ,is it really nice , small, easy to use.  ....thank so mush .....Panasonic er gn30 k vortex wet</li>
            <li> This is one of several that I&#x27;ve had over the years. Nothing to write home about, but it works as good as the others.</li>
            <li> These are great little trimmers so I bought one for myself and my husband.  The case is slim and comfortable and has a storage unit.&lt;br /&gt;Very happy!</li>
            <li> Made like a disposable, the battery&#x27;s of better quality....but it works painfully slow at the slowest speed imaginable for two weeks till the the Japanese steel loses it&#x27;s edge.</li>
            <li> When I thought of buying one, I was not I would use it. I like it more than I would have thought.and use it about once per week.  I would select this one again.</li>
            <li> Really that machine helps me less embarrassing about my nostril hair ;). Even more breath. Thanks to it. Love it.</li>
            <li> Been looking for this configuration in a nose trimmer for some time. I had one like it many years ago and could not find one exactly like my old one until I found on Amazon. I highly recommend this one, it&#x27;s for your nose not general use?</li>
            <li> This is the third trimmer I have owned and by far the best . Works great in the ears,nose, and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> After repeatedly trying the cheap Remington trash nose hair clippers  sold @ Wal-Mart that worked 15-20% I guardedly tried this Panasonic from Amazon.  And, it works!  It actually cuts 90% of all hair.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product a few times. But, so far, it does do a good job in all aspects touted.</li>
            <li> motor burned out in one month.  Could not return.  Not happy with this product.  I used it a few times and it gave up.  While the design is good, it is not made well. Poor quality control from a foreign-made product.</li>
            <li> The 2 I ordered not too long ago only lasted 3 months at best. If dropped, the blades get off kilter and no matter what I did to try and make it work again failed. They initially worked fine, I&#x27;m not sure if the 2 I received were faulty or if they are just bad overall.</li>
            <li> Works great...no vibration that makes you sneeze</li>
            <li> Just used this for first time on nose.&lt;br /&gt;No pinching.  Thorough hair removal&lt;br /&gt;without nasal passage soreness at all.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as their previous models. It simply won&#x27;t shave close enough.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly, easy to clean  very close shave and NO PAIN</li>
            <li> Broke in less than 2 month, use once then stop working very disappointed, 😠</li>
            <li> I never realized how much nose hair I had since purchasing this product. It&#x27;s incredible to use. I would recommend to this every man on Earth as well as women who want to keep their noses on fleek.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband last Christmas. He still uses it to this day &amp; it holds up to being thrown in a drawer with shave cream etc. Husband says he likes it. Last one was pulling &amp; he says this one doesn&#x27;t hurt like that. The price is great &amp; this is a durable product.</li>
            <li> Works as it should - not a problem - battery last for quite some time - I have had over 2 years - replaced battery once I think.  Feels great.  Takes care of those pesky nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. Waste of plastic. Trimmed neither my nose or ear hair.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very fast</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cute, I can not deny it.&lt;br /&gt;It has a good system for cleaning with water and does not spoil.&lt;br /&gt;Only if you want to clean the blades that becomes complicated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neither too short, you have to make a few passes to get results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it is very safe and does not produce unintended cuts.</li>
            <li> Have tried several kinds and brands. This is the only one that has lasted for years. I highly recommend this to all.</li>
            <li> Product broke within 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> This thing is awesome. Has plenty of power and is simple to clean.  I use it for nose, eyebrow and around mouth trimming.  Would highly suggest.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good shaving. Only when I shave, it&#x27;s tickling in the nose.</li>
            <li> This trimmer really seems to work well; not like the last 3 that I&#x27;ve tried and been disappointed with.  Hope that it keeps on performing to my expectations!</li>
            <li> I have used several brands before and they have ever not been too effective or just quit running. This is the best I have ever used.</li>
            <li> A very good product at a reasonable price, it should provide many months of service provided it is properly used.</li>
            <li> Good nose trimmer. Good quality at a good price.</li>
            <li> So far so good!  I have used this several times, and it works great.  I&#x27;ll see, on down the road, how it holds up.</li>
            <li> GAVE TO MY DAD AS A GIFT!</li>
            <li> By far the best product of its type.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of brands.</li>
            <li> Its not the best one ive ever used, cheap for sure. Feels like its ripping nose hair out instead of trimming.</li>
            <li> Impressed with how powerful and good the cutting mechanism is. I would definitely recommend this product. And the price is fair.</li>
            <li> works well.  easy to clean</li>
            <li> Wish it worked a little better - it doesnt seem to last more than a year.  Also it doesn&#x27;t grab enough nose hairs without pressure</li>
            <li> This prodcut is not as good for me as the reviews indicate it is for other reviewers.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> As a man ages, the hair that resides in various orifices tends to grow at an alarming rate. It&#x27;s as if the hair from the head has been rerouted to the nose and ears. To combat this, a man needs a good trimmer. This Panasonic trimmer fits the bill nicely. It can be rinsed when needed ( always clean with soap and water after using it in your nose) and has long battery life. It&#x27;s also aggressive enough and sharp enough to tackle the toughest nasal forest without tugging (OUCH!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if your wife doesn&#x27;t dig braided nose hair, or you look like you&#x27;re trying to smuggle a hamster in your ear, then this trimmer is for you.</li>
            <li> not much to say. it works.does the job..as expected..wish it had a light..did not come with a battery.&lt;br /&gt;it works fine</li>
            <li> As I expected, not so excellent nor not too bad. Just worth the price. No regrets. Andyway, I like it.</li>
            <li> this is a pretty good product but i wish the strength of the trimmer was better</li>
            <li> I have had a few different brands, this is the best one.  I actually have bought for two of my friends</li>
            <li> Great product and really cleans you up nicely.  Waterproof works for easy clean up.  Very happy with this purchase and now I can breath again</li>
            <li> It trims my nose hairs very good! It get&#x27;s basically all of the hair in my nose, very close to skin without it cutting me or really even feeling it.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t yank or pull hairs out. Works great and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as advertised.  Being able to rinse it out is really helpful.</li>
            <li> Love this thing!!! This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought. (My first one was dropped on the floor tip first and broke it)&lt;br /&gt;It beer pulls and does a great job!</li>
            <li> husband says best gift ever lol!! been a year almost and still works great!</li>
            <li> This works ok. It is definitely cheap and not long lasting. But it gets the job done so far without any painful catches.</li>
            <li> works well and the initial battery life has been excellent.</li>
            <li> I bought this and after 9 months it quit working on us! When it worked it did the job. But I&#x27;m done with this brand. Moving on to something better... maybe a Wahl.</li>
            <li> I have had sevearl and this one works the best. Does have some \\&quot;metallicky\\&quot; smell at first, but worth it to have one that works.</li>
            <li> Trash. Used this trimmer a handful of times and the motor no longer works. Never once has this trimmer been exposed to water. It was cleaned using either the included brush or an air blower. I purchased this mid-July 2013 and it barely made it to the end of November 2013. Put your money towards another product.</li>
            <li> Really not much to say except that it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it well.  Battery life seems pretty good and cleanup is quick and easy.  For those who say it pulls hair or seems to stop cutting, I&#x27;d suggest changing the battery.  It will seem to &amp;#34;work&amp;#34; with a low battery, but it really isn&#x27;t working at full speed.</li>
            <li> After his reluctance to use this....he loves it... NO HAIR PULLING - he can use it wet or dry... it&#x27;s small and easy to use...enough said!</li>
            <li> My husband was looking to replace a nose trimmer that consistently pulled his nose hairs and made him miserable and I took a chance on this one after reading the reviews and when the price was right ($14.99).  He loves this Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer and says it does not pull his nose hairs and works very well.</li>
            <li> I own two.  Tried the fancy titanium, non-powered one and it just pulled my hairs and made me cry.  I&#x27;ve never had a problem with this little guy.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It cuts nose hair. Nothing to dislike about it, comes apart easily to clean and has worked well so far.</li>
            <li> Excellent, I bought one for my son and he loved it so much I got one for me. It works great.</li>
            <li> Ladies, Gents, pay a few dollars more for the Brookstone. Your nose and ears will be happier. The Panasonic ER-GN30-K is weak and the head gets hot.  I keep it around as a spare, but it can&#x27;t compare to my Brookstone Ear and Nose Trimmer that cost me a whopping $34.99.  You can immediately hear the difference in power and feel the difference in comfort. Needless to say, the Brookstone trims hairs to the base as where the Panasonic trimmer struggles and is time consuming nonsense. Sorry Panasonic for the bad review. I expected something a little better than this.</li>
            <li> comfortable shave action, very little pulling</li>
            <li> Failed after a month.</li>
            <li> This is very easy to use and trims damn well. It&#x27;s the best one I have used so far and I would highly recommend it to any male specie out there under the same torment of having unwanted hair in really, really, blunt areas.</li>
            <li> Finally, a hair trimmer that really works.  My husband finds it easy to use, and it really clips away all the unwanted hairs without pulling or tugging.  Have not used it wet.  Great product, so much better than the last couple of trimmers we tried.</li>
            <li> I had a similar device a number of years ago, but it finally died.  When I saw this one listed at Amazon I purchased it immediately.  It does a much better job than the previous one I had. It appears to be a quality product.</li>
            <li> Works great. Completely pain free. seems very high quality for such a reasonable price. recommended.</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> Awesome.  Best clippers out there ..... And I have tried them all !</li>
            <li> Serves it&#x27;s purpose and works well.</li>
            <li> No complaints. The battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Works well.  No pulling.  Easy to clean. Small.  Fits on the one shelf (out of 9) that my wife lets me use.  :o)</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent, excellent, excellent! This puts my old Remington to shame. Very strong motor, cuts like like a weed eater, the angle is a great addition, and the blades are washable. Worth the money and recommend by hairy old men.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  Far and away the best one I have ever tried.  It handles both coarse and fine hair extremely well.  And it is washable!</li>
            <li> i got it for my brother nose and ear hairs it works great...</li>
            <li> AMAZING!  I used it once and my nose is BARE!  It gets everywhere.  I just wanted to cut out some.  But I won&#x27;t have to worry for a while.  As smooth as my wifes legs when she remembers to shave!</li>
            <li> Works the way it is supposed to work. A rotating cylinder inside clips off the hair. Small slits on the outside allow the hair to enter.</li>
            <li> best nose hair remover ever!  after buying the first one I bought a second just in case it is not longer sold when the first one wears out.. it trims down to the skin - does not pull hair and is easy to clean.  I&#x27;ve had several expensive / cheap versions and this one is the best in my book.</li>
            <li> I have had a couple of others over the years and they have all been way more effective than this model. Unfortunately all of these groomers have problems with being dropped onto tiled bathroom floors so I have had to replace them every now and then. This groomer is way under-powered, even with fresh batteries.</li>
            <li> My brother had this on his Christmas list.  I bought it for him.  He absolutely loves it!!  He&#x27;s wanting dad to get one too.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband.  Works great.</li>
            <li> No accidental cuts with scissors - a bonus if you have shaky hands.  My husband loved this gift - if only I had known sooner what pleasure small things can make in one&#x27;s life.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery and the product is a lot better at removing nose hair than the final touch hair remover. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I had an older Panasonic trimmer and thought that my nose hairs were getting too thick to cut. WRONG! The thing was old and the blades were not good. Bring in the new. This baby is sharp and cuts with the greatest of ease. Buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> Was a little unsure about this product because of the blade type. I have used a similar looking device in the past and it was not very good. I was pleasantly surprised with this one. Does a great job, cuts close, and doesn&#x27;t cut you. Not much more you could ask for. Takes one AA battery that is not included. Nose hair hanging out of your nose is gross...this fixes that problem quickly and easily. :)</li>
            <li> Does a great job at getting nose hairs near the opening of the nose.  If you have those stiffies way back in the nostril that have been bothering you, this isn&#x27;t meant to be stuffed deep and has a pretty short barrel tip which causes your nose opening to distort and move the hairs if you do try to reach them.  Ok on any superficial hair you can pick up with the tip of this item.  not meant for flat grooming like side burns.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just barely ok. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> No hair trimmer I have ever bought in this style actually worked as stated. This model was not an exception. These &amp;#34;round top&amp;#34; models just can&#x27;t do the job of the flat &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; type trimmers (which are generally half the price).</li>
            <li> Works great, no pulling of nose hair. Well worth the money</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to clean, close trim and quiet. No complaints at all, much better than ones I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to purchase due to the battery power. My husband&#x27;s battery powered one never lasted and he really did not want another. But they don&#x27;t make any plug ins I could find. So I got this. He loves it. Thanks for helping him look a bit less hairy!!!!</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed for just trimming my nose hair. Works very nicely.  Great trimmer for the price!</li>
            <li> It worked well, while it worked, but ended up breaking after a few uses.  How did it break?  The motor just stopped and despite replacing the battery (with a few different ones I knew worked), it never came back to life.  I never got it wet, so I can&#x27;t figure out what the problem was other than it was just a complete piece of junk to begin with.  One star for you!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my son.  He&#x27;s very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is a classic example of you get what you pay for.  After reading the reviews it seemed like a nice buy, although I did notice 5-10% of the negative reviews indicated that it quit working soon after arrival.  Count mine in that 5-10%.  The thing worked well.....when it worked.  But I used mine 2X and it just stopped working. I changed the battery.  I checked the cutting head closely.  I washed it out thoroughly.  But I couldn&#x27;t get it to work.  There was absolutely no sign of life.  I only had it about 2 months and when I went to return it, the Amazon website wouldn&#x27;t let me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So buyer beware!!  The quality control is shoddy and the warranty period is short.</li>
            <li> Soumds slow but does the job.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Excellent price. Love this.&lt;br /&gt;Money well spent!</li>
            <li> Excellent product and works as advertised!</li>
            <li> Purchased 3 so far as gifts. Every one loves it and uses it regularly.  It is waterproof.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just ok.  It doesn&#x27;t seem very powerful or effective but it&#x27;s ok.  Takes probably twice as long as the trimmer I used to use.  The pro is that it doesn&#x27;t pull hair, especially necessary for the nose hairs!</li>
            <li> So gross but necessary for my husband.  Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Motor went out after three uses and was very weak any ways.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean and does exactly what is needed. I highly recommend it. Would this thing again.</li>
            <li> I received the trimmer in the mail in fine condition. However, the part where the battery goes carries a pungent scent. Most of the time, it&#x27;s covered, but when I put the battery in, it suddenly smells horrible. But, it works fine, so I can&#x27;t complain too much.</li>
            <li> Trimming nose hairs went from annoying / painful to quick and painless. Takes maybe 6 seconds. I use it to keep my ears trimmed too. I&#x27;d have scoffed at the need for something like this when I was younger... but if you&#x27;re like me and hit a certain age when hair starts growing where you&#x27;d prefer it didn&#x27;t, here&#x27;s your solution.</li>
            <li> It works exactly as described! It took care of my husbands ear and nose hair with ease, I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This thing really bogs down when I try to trim my nose hairs, even with a fresh battery. It gets the job done but I have to be careful to not go full bore into my nostrils with it, or I have to pull it apart and rinse it out before it will run back up to speed. But for the price I am going to live with it, just wish it had some more strength.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull or tickle badly like some trimmers I&#x27;ve used. The rinse out feature is very nice as well. Great price for what it is.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m at the barber &amp; they say &amp;#34;would you like me to trim your ear hair?&amp;#34; I say &amp;#34;you know I like it close cropped around the ear.&amp;#34; They say &amp;#34;no, the hair in your ear.&amp;#34; What??? I purchased one based on reviews. Now I don&#x27;t look like a hobbit. Easy use, easy to clean &amp; it must be efficient as the battery hasn&#x27;t been changed &amp; it&#x27;s been buzzing along cutting down the geezer hairs.</li>
            <li> In 1 month I used this about 4 times. It worked fine. Then it quit working. It&#x27;s not the battery. Can&#x27;t return it. What a waste!</li>
            <li> Man did I need this.  It works great and so far I&#x27;ve had no issues with it...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. It came super fast and he loves it. He has had several, but this is the first one that compares to the first one he had which was his favorite.</li>
            <li> My last trimmer was manual and it was okay, but I dropped it once and it didn&#x27;t work any more, it was also slow. This one will buzzz that hair away fast and short. I LIKE IT.</li>
            <li> I feel quite silly using it, but I can&#x27;t deny that it works.  Smells a little odd... sort of &amp;#34;burn-y&amp;#34;, but given the proximity to the olfactory senses while in use, I suppose any oddities like that would be pretty apparent.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item strictly for use as a nose trimmer and it pleasantly meets that expectation. For something that is so inexpensive, I can&#x27;t believe how well it works. This is a nose trimmer and so it does not remove the hair completely, but it cuts it down until it is barely visible. This is great if you&#x27;re trying to get rid of those unsightly nose hairs that you don&#x27;t want being exposed. The process itself is painless, effortless, and requires so little time. A lot of hair removing can become such a process, but with this product, it&#x27;s so easy. Washing it is easy as well as well and taking it apart to wash the blade is even easier (you can really see how much hair it picks up when the blade is exposed). What&#x27;s also a plus is that the device is portable and discreet. This is definitely a good value.</li>
            <li> I liked the video for this because it really shows what it can do. I bought this for a Birthday present for two people (bought two of them) and that was all they wanted to play with! They are 22 years old! They say they love them and how it doesn&#x27;t pull like tweezers, it just cuts off the hair!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Travels with me everywhere.  Wife is happy that she doesn&#x27;t have to remind me to&lt;br /&gt;trim my nose hairs!!</li>
            <li> Does the job well,  remember to put the cover back on the top, too bad it does not come with a power cord to support a rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> I have been very impressed with this trimmer. I used a trimmer attachment that was part of a beard trimmer set for years but this is far better quality and does a far better job. The price is also very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I tried mine for the first time last night. It works. But it&#x27;s obviously very poorly made and doesn&#x27;t seem likely to last very long. Also, the tip gets very hot after just a minute or two of use. Hard to complain too much about something that is so cheap, though.</li>
            <li> I liked it till I dropped it. Apparently nothing broke but it started malfunctioning and then soon not working at all.</li>
            <li> Not much to say here, except it does as it&#x27;s advertised. Cleaning is a bit tricky, as the entire blade needs to come out of its housing it seems.</li>
            <li> Easily gets turned on in your travel bag. Remove the battery before packing.  Other than that a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Out of the box it works great. My only complaint has to do with cleaning the cone blade. Once removed...have to be very careful . Blade inside cone is delicate and can fall out. Once that happens..it will be difficult to align and will not as before. My advice is to try and use the water rinse method  .</li>
            <li> Best I have bought! Does a great job</li>
            <li> Cleans out your nose hair and gunk. I use it daily. Runs a bit warm. Uses AA Battery.</li>
            <li> GREAT SERVICE &amp; GREAT PRODUCT, THANKS</li>
            <li> Works and didn&#x27;t break in half the first time it was turned on like my old one.</li>
            <li> Works great. Have had for about 2 months so hopefully it will continue to do so. I had read a few reviews that said it stopped working after a short while. So far OK.</li>
            <li> can break like a champ now</li>
            <li> Every guy needs one of these.</li>
            <li> Nothing says Aqua Lung like nose hairs.  This little tunnel borer takes care of that without bleeding or lawsuits</li>
            <li> I see why its the best seller. It does what it does. ITs lightweight. Single battery a big plus. Some might want a rechargeable one, but that would limit its portability in my pinion since you&#x27;ll need to bring a charger where ever you go. Also for 10 dollars I would not expect anything more. One of the products where I pay for what I need and nothing more. Perfect</li>
            <li> What a great little gadget.  My son uses this for his nose.  It is very thorough with the trimming.  I like that you can clean it easily.  I use it to clean up around my eyebrows.  My only complaint, it does get hot quickly.</li>
            <li> Works great. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> I have an older Panasonic clipper that still works well after several years use. The new one runs quieter.</li>
            <li> cutting my nose hair perfectly lol</li>
            <li> Worked well as advertized.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic Nose hair trimmer is so nice. I had another one in the past and it pull and I was scared to use it anymore. But this one doesn&#x27;t pull at all. Thank you! Highly recomended.</li>
            <li> $10 for a single task item. What more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> ITS OKAY, CANT HARDLY HEAR IT RUN</li>
            <li> I have always been impressed with Panasonic products and the trimmer is no exception.  It wasn&#x27;t expensive as compared to&lt;br /&gt;other brands and the ability to clean the tip should keep the unit from clogging up over time.  It feels a little weird at first due to&lt;br /&gt;the rotating head especially if you are accustomed to a trimmer that only goes back and forth but it a does a much quicker/better&lt;br /&gt;job.  Spend a few minutes with the owners manual rather than automatically tossing it.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer after my barber started asking me if I wanted my ear hair trimmed.  He wasn&#x27;t joking around, he was actually offering it as a service.  I hadn&#x27;t noticed my ear hair because it was light in color, but more recently it&#x27;s been growing more and more.  I always used scissors, which is foolish and a waste of time.  I was doing it all wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For everyone else who is doing it all wrong, STOP.  Go out and buy this trimmer.  Someone else has made this product so that you no longer have to stick scissors up your nose and into your years.  Throw your scissors away, and buy this trimmer.  It costs the same as two bottles of hipster microbrew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.  I was actually surprised to see a brand name trimmer being sold at this price so I jumped on it.  The trimmer itself is nothing fancy, but I was quite impressed by the build quality and how everything snapped together nicely.  The battery compartment has a nice tight seal with a rubber o-ring to prevent water from getting inside.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about a splash of water causing the trimmer to rust or otherwise malfunction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the functionality; it does what it says, at a brilliant price, with respectable efficiency.  My only worry was that a trimmer would yank/pull hairs out of my nose, but I am glad to say that there is no pulling, and there is no yanking of hairs.  The hairs are cut without the slightest hint of pulling.  You basically feel nothing.  You only know it is working because you can hair the offending hairs being sliced with the utmost efficiency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I have this thing, I&#x27;d like to use it on other people.  Hard to avoid the temptation.  I see people on the subway and bus, and I want to stick this trimmer into their ears.  You will too.</li>
            <li> Nice for the price.  I bought this for my husband and he loves it.  It cleans up that unwanted hair quickly, easily and with no pain.</li>
            <li> It is made of cheap plastic and breaks down easily. I only used it less than 10 times before it stopped working. Can I return it for full refund?</li>
            <li> Easy to use, effective, very quiet.  We&#x27;ve had other trimmers before but this one is much quieter and more efficient than others.</li>
            <li> Admittedly I only used this product once; 5 minutes after I got it. My allergies make a little nose hair feel like a log in my nasal passage; how many hours did I waste with a little clipper trying to precisely cut one little hair. This thing is like the terminator; painless, efficient and thorough. Maybe they are all good but I really like the potential of this little product.</li>
            <li> I very much like this nose/ear hair trimmer. The only issue is that it tickles me when I use it to trim my nose hair.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well. It is not overly powerful as it only requires one AA battery. However, it does the job. It also has a nice cleaning feature where you can flush water through it. I have had it for approximately one year, and it is still working very good.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it, but I bought this for my boyfriend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His first time using it to trim his mustache it caught on a hair and kept spinning without cutting the hair!  It was pulling and pulling the hair and not cutting it.  He had to turn it off, find scissors, and trim the hair in order to disconnect the trimmer from his face.  It was a really painful experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needless to say, after that experience, he&#x27;s terrified to try it in his nose.... or rather, anywhere else, again.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, and does exactly what you need it to.</li>
            <li> This ear &amp; nose trimmer is much smaller &amp; less powerful than I thought. It only does a minimum job cutting ear &amp; nose hair.</li>
            <li> great product but didnt last long enough.</li>
            <li> I have very curly hair.  This is the only product, that of it&#x27;s kind , thatcan cut the hair on my ears.</li>
            <li> Works Great well Delivered  on time</li>
            <li> Does not do a good job.  Not very powerful.</li>
            <li> Great ergonomic design. Powerful but quiet. Does the job right! Easy to use. Great option of cleaning under running water.</li>
            <li> So ya I&#x27;m a Wookie, what of it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a nose trimmer this thing works a lot better than the flat bladed ones.  Does my ears pretty good too.  Great purchase and would recommend to my fellow Wookies.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this is the number one selling trimmer on Amazon. I have tried multiple trimmers and they don&#x27;t always last or hold up. After using this for over a year I can honestly say that it works well and holds up. Clean up is super each as the parts are removable and the blade continues to stay sharp. It comes with brush for cleaning out the head too. The grip is also very comfortable and molds well to your hand. Overall its a great product that I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> What more can I say.  If he likes it, then I give it 5 stars and would definately recommend it.</li>
            <li> It was just O.K. Not any better tnen the old one I replaced.</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: This is the first of it&#x27;s type I have purchased, but it works really well, painless, easy to use and clean, and effective.  I&#x27;ve had mine for five months now (maybe used it 6-7 times) and am just about to change the batteries for the first time.  Received high rating on other sites.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t have a good connection and have to remove the batteries to get it to work properly</li>
            <li> This trimmer does the job quite well. Cleaning it  is a breeze.</li>
            <li> works great.  good price</li>
            <li> At $13 its a great buy. Its light, but looks well made and is water-washable and has a hole in it that you can open to flush out the hair which is nice. Its much quieter then my cheap junk conair trimmer. It will not remove your hair clean, but it trims very well. Sometimes it will catch your nose and hurt a bit. Requires just one battery. I love the curvy design. It makes it easier to trim the hairs.</li>
            <li> Quick and clean. Never owned a nose hair trimmer (never thought I would need one). But this model fits the bill just fine. Actually more than fine. I am really satisfied with the product quality as well as overall operation. Love the fact that it is easy to clean and maintain. And, bonus...now my nose hairs are confined to my nose! Trimmer doesn&#x27;t grab hairs - simply awesome. I just hope I don&#x27;t have to use it too often!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is really nice. The only problem I have is that it&#x27;s not that easy to navigate through the nose. But it works well after a couple of run throughs..</li>
            <li> Not fun to clean, but it is really easy! Does not pull hair or hurt. Lithium battery would be great but I may be asking too much because AA&#x27;s are so standardized.</li>
            <li> Worked well for about a year, then it just died.  Got relatively minimal use.  I checked the battery and even replaced it -- still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> I love it-does the job removal of all the hair on your body</li>
            <li> Unit worked very well for one year, then started making a grinding noise and promptly died.  Due to how well it&lt;br /&gt;functioned (while it was actually working) and the low price, I decided to buy a new one hoping the first was just&lt;br /&gt;a &amp;#34;dud.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> We got this very quickly and used it right away. It&#x27;s the perfect tool and the bend in the shaver works sooo much better than the old one he had. I was very pleased and would buy this again . You definitely get your money&#x27;s worth with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great for ear trimming for men who are whiners!</li>
            <li> Works very well. Be careful not to push it into your skin or it can cut you.</li>
            <li> great job.  exactly what i needed for.</li>
            <li> does a decent job but sometimes it catches your noise hair and what can I said pinches.  maybe the internal is not sharp enough.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is great at this price, would recommend!</li>
            <li> It catches and pulls out hair. Would not buy again. But it does make the hair go away it just pulls it from time to time</li>
            <li> This nose trimmer works perfectly without pulling hairs. The low price is amazing.</li>
            <li> This item is well built but it has a short life span... it worked great at beginning but went off after a few times of using. I have tried putting new batteries and whatnot but still doesn&#x27;t work. Will be trying a different brand.</li>
            <li> Cheap and works as expected</li>
            <li> Works well, does not cause pain when cutting. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Works well. Overall happy with this product.</li>
            <li> This is BY FAR the best nose hair trimmer I have used!  Sleek and a perfect size for home or travel, easy to take apart and clean, and does a THOROUGH job of getting those tough to reach hairs.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> super little trimmer. can be cleaned in a jiffy in sink.</li>
            <li> When it worked, it worked great. It probably lasted 2-3 weeks before it stopped working. I wish I could get my money back....</li>
            <li> SINCE THESE ITEMS ARE SO FRAGILE/WEAK IN REGARDS TO OPERATION, I&#x27;M GOING TO KEEP MY FINGERS CROSSED AND&lt;br /&gt;PERHAPS I&#x27;LL REACH THE 2016 WITH IT STILL WORKING ... QUITE A TASK !!!</li>
            <li> It works better than my old one</li>
            <li> So let me tell you a quick story.  Apparently I have spider legs that like to hang out of my big nose. And when I breath out, they do a little dance in the wind.  I got tired of hearing the wife complain of tickle kisses and dingle-berries hanging from my face so I got this bad boy.  Works well and now everyone is very happy.</li>
            <li> After years of tweezing, plucking and scissoring, I broke down and bought one of these new fangled nose hair clippers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So much more pleasant than even one pluck. Be careful when taking off the top for cleaning  - the blade looks pretty flimsy, although I did not appear to cause any damage, take it easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does take more than time than I anticipated to get all those pesky hairs (2 minutes), and I cannot speak to the battery longevity  - yet.  It also did an ok job on mustache, eyebrows (light touch needed there) and that hairline behind my ear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it does fail after a year (twice a month - 24 uses, pro rated at $1 per use,) I say it is well worth the tears of joy I had plucking those errant nose hairs and I will consider it a toss and replace item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros - not expensive, can be used with one hand, easily replaceable&lt;br /&gt;Cons -  careful with that cleaning -  actual blade looks fragile, may not last forever</li>
            <li> no bells or whistles... it does what you expect and has the feel of a solid and stable piece of work. For the price it is unbeatable in my experience.</li>
            <li> works great more than I expected!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t trim that close so you have to use it regularly. Other than that it does its job. bring your own battery.</li>
            <li> I have had a few others and this is the best.  Trims very nicely.  Easy to clean.  I highly recommend this Panasonic Trimmer.</li>
            <li> It work the first two times, but then it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, and when it finally did, it did not trim.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a decent job.  I feel like the blades get a little warm but maybe that just because I am trimming my nose and I don&#x27;t want anything warm stuck up there.  Other than that it cuts well and isn&#x27;t too loud.  I got this for a great price and even at normal I&#x27;d recommend it.  I replaced a much older off-brand one and this out performs it by a long shot.</li>
            <li> It worked great until I dropped it. Then it didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;  I know I dropped it. But you would think it would be a bit more rugged.</li>
            <li> When we bought the product it worked for the first 2 weeks, then it started to randomly stop or it didn&#x27;t turn on in the first place. We replaced the batterie but nothing changed. Now it doesn&#x27;t work anymore at all. Just a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Well constructed, works well</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any more nose hairs. FYI guys, don&#x27;t use it on other parts of your body that are hard to reach.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, gets the job done amazingly.</li>
            <li> Well I used it once. It was okay.  But I thought I had bought something that could recharge itself.  Been really sick, so it&#x27;s hard to always answer.</li>
            <li> Works ok, its as advertised. Would buy it again, Use it weekly to keep nose hair trimmed. Price was good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for awhile now; it works well and the price was right.  I would recommend it for home or travel use.</li>
            <li> Good product! It is well-made, the battery was easy to install, and the trimmer trims well.</li>
            <li> This works great! other trimmers I&#x27;ve used have pulled the hairs. no more watery eyes!!!</li>
            <li> smooth operation, no nicking, fairly quiet, easy to wash&lt;br /&gt;only issue is upgright posture, which tends to make it fall over if the cabinet door is opened quickly</li>
            <li> This worked one time before it died, and I&#x27;m out of the return time. I tried everything to get it to work again.... changed the batteries, making sure the pieces were on correctly, and nothing. Must have been a malfunction in the mechanism.</li>
            <li> Works great. Got to be careful around the starfish it does bite the soft skin like a rabbid dog. Plumbs the ear and blow holes good. It doesn&#x27;t break a sweat eather.</li>
            <li> I have a very hairy nose! and this product makes my life so much better.</li>
            <li> works great already owned it for several months and have not replaced the battery</li>
            <li> Good Product.  Fast shipping</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but better than most others that have been tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it is supposed to. I have used different trimmers through the years and this to me is the best-so far anyway. I hope it last though.</li>
            <li> Durable and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Great little tool. Tends to pull hairs a bit when the battery runs low. I only wish they had a version with a charger so I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep buying batteries.</li>
            <li> It died after 9 months of using it once per week.  So, about 36 uses and it no longer runs. It&#x27;s not the battery.  It&#x27;s just a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Awesome. No pulling or pinching. Very comfortable. Love it</li>
            <li> I bought this item 1 year ago, when I bought it I was so happy because it worked &amp;#34;well&amp;#34;. Then, I saw many review about it I read that the trimmer wasted much battery. My first month worked with one pill of battery but next, it wasted 5 per shave. It&#x27;s very horrible because it wasted more battery than it did work.</li>
            <li> It gets hot some reason.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer was a Wahl brand it was okay.  This Panasonic is fantastic compared to my previous Wahl.  The blades cut better with no pulling and I don&#x27;t spend as much time trimming my nose hairs because it cuts better.  I highly recommend this product.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer works reasonably well for an inexpensive single AA battery powered device.  It disassembles for cleaning will get the job done with a little patience.  Have had other similar trimmers that didn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I had used a Sharper Image brand before purchasing the Panisonic. This model is very aggressive and gets the job done fast.</li>
            <li> I have wanted something like this for years and finally bought it for myself for Christmas. It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t figure out how you clean this thing out with water. It also doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would for the money. I have better luck with the skinny kind with the blade on the side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing is way too complicated and heavy. Wish I didn&#x27;t get it.</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t use this thing as much as I thought I would.  It heats up pretty quickly when you start using it, takes quite a while to actually trim all the hair, and so far has proven fairly difficult to clean very well.  Not a purchase I&#x27;m super happy I made, but I suppose it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> Get the job done with minimum fuss.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy...</li>
            <li> Works for what was needed. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Broke during 2nd or 3rd use.</li>
            <li> Stick it up your nose (or in your ear)...  Really works.</li>
            <li> It does what it was supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I thought all these trimmers were the same so when my old Panasonic died I bought this one.  I was wrong.  This one can&#x27;t even cut a feather.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have had and it does what I want it to.  Great for those unwanted nose hairs and would probably work on the hair that grows in ears, too.</li>
            <li> It worked okay.  I had this for a little over two years.  With a fresh battery, it worked well.  Once in a while, it would grab a hair instead of cutting, which hurts pretty good.  With the battery going lower and lower, it will grab instead of cutting causing more pain.  After a year or so, it wasn&#x27;t working as well as it did when it was new.  Can&#x27;t complain too much as it was cheap.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is simple to operate, and trims very well.  The ability to clean the head with running water is a great feature.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well as intended. Unit feels to be of better quality than most competitors I have handled. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> IT IS REALLY GOOD PRODUCTS.&lt;br /&gt;ATFER BUYING THIS ONE, I DON&#x27;T HAVE TO PULL DOWN MY the hairs of the nostril.&lt;br /&gt;IT IS VERY USEFUL. YOU CAN CUT ANYTIME.&lt;br /&gt;IF YOU ARE PREPARING BLIND DATE, YOU MUST HAVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies hate the hairs of the nostril.&lt;br /&gt;Gentleman must have this one.&lt;br /&gt;I strongly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasoic ER-GN30-K Vortex trimmer to replace a Remington trimmer that finally-and mercifully--bit the dust.  I absolutely HATED the Remington, from it&#x27;s design to it&#x27;s performance.  The Panasonic, by contrast, is very nicely designed and surprisingly well-built for the price.  Most importantly, it simply works great on both my nose-hair and ear hair, which, at my age, are a constant issue. In addition, Amazon was great, as it almost always is, in getting this delivered to me in 2 days time.  The only negative I can think of was in getting the product out of it&#x27;s damnable packaging.  Bear in mind that the AA battery needed to operate the trimmer is not included.  This did not either surprise me or present any problems to me personally, but just thought I&#x27;d pass that along.  I highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a very well-made and highly effective trimmer at a good price.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt, as the blades aren&#x27;t exposed. Super for nose, ears, and it never hurts! This is the best one I have ever tried, and I have about 5!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband recently.  He used it once and said it worked well.  However, while putting it away he dropped it, and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> its not the greastest thing ever invented but it works pretty good and I like it . The flat small trimer works better but I am happy with it I would buy it again. As I said the flat close trimer that everybody sells probly works better but they don&#x27;t last very long. So in all is good.</li>
            <li> I used the item once. It functioned correctly during the first use, but will no longer operate. Replacing the batteries did not resolve the issue.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer.  I have not used it in the shower, just dry environments.  It is great for trimming nose hair, wandering eyebrows, and the occasional \\&quot;where did that hair come from\\&quot; while looking in the mirror.  I have not had to replace the batteries; still original that came with the unit several months ago.  I really like the angle of the handle.  It seems to be more efficient that the straight handles - easier grip.  Since the trimmer is my own, no sharing, I clean it with a few swipes of my blow dryer and a cotton swab with alcohol.    This unit is also very lightweight and quiet.  I recommend this unit - the best I have had in years!    [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]]</li>
            <li> I got this item 2 years ago and it has been getting progressively weaker (as if a battery was getting weaker, even though I placed fresh batteries inside constantly). It doesn&#x27;t work any more. Also, I always have to sneeze when I use this thing - although this would probably happen with any model/brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and does its job getting all those pesky hairs in pesky places.  It is easy to use; very simple.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer ever put on the market. I&#x27;ve bought several before, but always had to augment their performance with scissors, since none of them cut close enough and always left hair behind in those sensitive places. Not so with this trimmer. It gets all ear and nose hair the first time and painlessly. Thank you, Panasonic!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is quiet, comfortable and very efficient. My only complaint is that the price dropped before I received it. However, it is not a big deal. The trimmer itself is almost perfect.</li>
            <li> Very good product and great value. I am extremely pleased with the way the trimmer operates...close cut, no skin irritation in nose or ears, no hair pulling at all. Very effective product. I did my research on this on the web and based on previous reviews I bought the trimmer with no regrets. Thanks for making a product that works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well, and is not fancy, which is good. It doesn&#x27;t have a useless light to wear down the battery (think Panasonic ER421KC). The body also has a little angle to keep it from rolling out of the medicine cabinet. All in all, it&#x27;s a simple trimmer that works as it should.</li>
            <li> It has been working great and battery seems to last at least a couple of months.  Price is great, one of lowest but one of the best quality.</li>
            <li> ...and this thing does the trick. It works a lot better that the &amp;#34;as seen on TV&amp;#34; model I had previously.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a trimmer and I love it. Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect, whether it would hurt or if I would be sneezing all day. None of that happened. The trimmer is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- very easy to set up&lt;br /&gt;- requires a AA battery (not included)&lt;br /&gt;- washable&lt;br /&gt;- operates at an acceptable noise level (low humming sound)&lt;br /&gt;- gets rid of hair with no pull or tuck feeling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this for my nose and ears and it worked great. The rounded cap on top has a blade on the inside, the blade is placed slightly lower than the tip of the cap. This helps avoid any skin tucks, making it completely safe to use. There is a small opening in the top cap that can be exposed by rotating the head of the trimmer. The opening here is what makes the trimmer washable, it lets water in to wash the blade and also drains it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Haven&#x27;t tried other trimmers so I can&#x27;t really compare but this one worked just fine and I&#x27;m sticking to it.</li>
            <li> Pulls nose hair with pain and quit working after a year, dropped it once and died, would not recommend it</li>
            <li> this thing works so well. cleans out hair easily and quickly. my nose hairs were tickling the hell out of me and i couldnt stand it anymore. this thing trimmed everything down within seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;can&#x27;t believe it was this cheap..</li>
            <li> This cutter is nice and quiet, does a great job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing to great at all.  It works.  Sounds like it&#x27;s going to die any second.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works well and is easy to use.  Recommended</li>
            <li> Hubby just loves it!!  Says it works great and is easy to clean.  I love it because there are no more stray hairs coming out of his nose and ears (lol).</li>
            <li> The fact that you can clean it out with water is great and all, however the motor always sounds like it&#x27;s on its last leg. Straining and grinding. I have used this thing maybe four times now and I guess it works okay. Not sure why anybody would want to use it on their eyebrows though as the packaging directs.</li>
            <li> I saw this had good reviews and I got it on sale for $10. I gave it a shot and I am glad I did. This trimmer does a great job. No &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; feeling. Highly recommended. Previously, I had bought 2 nose hair trimmers from off brand companies. It felt like they were ripping the hair out, rather than cutting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;08/22/2015 Update: After 4 months and maybe a dozen uses, the unit stopped working. Like most warranties, the user is responsible for shipping to get it fixed/replacement. Least expensive shipping option was $3.50 (about 30% of what I paid for the trimmer). I really like the trimmer, but I had to drop the review due to the poor longevity and poor warranty. If the replacement breaks down again, I will not be replacing it.</li>
            <li> Good product. easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It works like I expected it to.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I had a Panasonic trimmer years ago that worked great.  Got it back around 1990. Sometime around the year 2000 I was given a gift of one for Christmas from Norelco.  I thought the Norelco would be better, so I made the mistake of tossing the Panasonic unit.  Big mistake.  The Norelco trimmer never worked as well as the old Panasonic.  Finally, the Norelco got to the point where it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge, and happily replaced it with this nice little unit from Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works well.  It&#x27;s waterproof, and easy to clean.  Blades never grab or pinch.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people are saying this trimmer has a short lifespan.  Perhaps there was a bad lot of them.  All I know is I&#x27;ve had mine for a few months now and it&#x27;s still working great.  If I have any gripe about it, it&#x27;s that I wish it cut the hair closer to the skin.  It handles the big stuff fine but I still have a fuzzy feeling on my outer  ears after multiple passes.  That&#x27;s the only thing keeping me from giving it a full five stars.  It&#x27;s super simple to clean. Just rotate the collar to the well marked faucet simple on the trimmer and run it under water with the power on.  I have not had a single problem with it and I use it on average once a week to get rid of my &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; hairs lol.  Particularly on and in my ears and nose hair.  You can&#x27;t use this trimmer for your eyebrows but hey, my barber handles that task.  You can&#x27;t go wrong for the money.</li>
            <li> This item replaces an older Panasonic nose and ear hair trimmer. It works as well as the older one and am happy with my purchase. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> Very handy, solid and heavy. Even washable! Works great!</li>
            <li> This one works great. I had an older Panasonic unit that had occasional issues with the battery connection. I often had to loosen and re-tighten the base to get it to power on. Because of that, I was reluctant to try another Panasonic, but Amazon had it on special at a great price so I decided to chance it. Happy to say I&#x27;ve had no trouble with this newer design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it uses normal AA batteries. So many things are powered by rechargeable lithium batteries now. I understand that lithium based batteries have higher power density, but the rechargeables wear out quickly and are expensive (if not impossible) to replace.</li>
            <li> Works great, no issues, clean up is easy. Love it.</li>
            <li> For $ 9.99, it&#x27;s well worth it.!</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer.  I am glad my Conair broke down.  It gets hair my other trimmer missed.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this and said it was the best he has used.</li>
            <li> Works great, it does what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li> This worked great until it simply died after about 3 mos of occasional use.  These devices seem to be inherently problematic.  I wish that some manufacturer would simply build one that stayed sharp, where they offered reasonably priced replacement parts, and one that will last more than a few months.  I can&#x27;t recommend this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had at least 5-6 nose hair trimmers and they all have had issues. I&#x27;ve found that the blades inside dulled quickly and/or never repositioned correctly after cleaning and reassembling. This is the first nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased that has lasted more than six months and works well wet or dry. Based on my experience with various brands and styles of trimmers, this is the best I&#x27;ve used, so far. I would recommend picking one up. Although this product costs a bit more than others, it works and in my opinion, is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to get this baby so I could use it on my un-wanted hairs.  It works nicely!  I have ashima and currently been having trouble taking out my nose hairs but after tryign this baby out I am breathing much better thanks to this gizmo! :]</li>
            <li> Got this to do some minor trimming ,and it really does the trick. needed something cheap and simple and easy to clean this does all that, at a great price.</li>
            <li> My dided within 5 months of use.</li>
            <li> Bought this item in 2013.  It worked great for a while...but suddenly stopped working today during mid-use. Replacing the battery did not help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read several critical reviews. Short lifespan seems to be a common failing of this device.</li>
            <li> Plain and simple--the product didn&#x27;t work.  I read the directions and configured properly, but I wasn&#x27;t able to get the product to work.  I had to end up using my facial trimmer on the inside of my nose.  Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to a soul.</li>
            <li> Other reviews touted the quiet aspect and I agree.  I had been using an inexpensive old noisy thing , and this is a vast improvement.  Plus it trims just fine.</li>
            <li> Its a pretty basic man-scaping tool, and for the price, you cant beat it.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is also a breeze.</li>
            <li> Comfortable to use, easy to set up, and the price was right. I&#x27;ll update the review if it breaks down, but as of today, I&#x27;m pretty pleased.</li>
            <li> It easily and painlessly removes nose and ear hair.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell how well it will hold up over time.</li>
            <li> This thing kinda sucks, in the age of the rechargeable battery why get a AA operated  when there are better products out there. just invest this thing dont even really work that good</li>
            <li> This works great at first, does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do. They seem to die easily, though. I&#x27;ve bought three of these; the first stopped working after 3 months of use; the second stopped after a month of use; and after less then a month of use, I can hear the third starting to break down.  None of them were dropped or hit on anything; they just no longer turned on one day and new batteries made no difference. It&#x27;s a cheap product and works well, but understand that it may not last very long.</li>
            <li> It works, but not cleanly or efficiently. Off and on power surges.  Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> works well for nose and ear unwanted hair ... we are so pretentious, almost embarrassing. it works as described. yes i use it.</li>
            <li> Worked well while it lasted. The cutting head stopped working after about six months.</li>
            <li> works amazing, you can use it in your nose and it does not feel weird or like it&#x27;s going to cut you. Stores wanted too much for this product. I&#x27;m happy i found it online.</li>
            <li> This thing does not do a very good job. After the first use I took the cutting head off to clean it and everything came apart. After washing and re-assembling the thing I was astounded at how loud the thing was. Took it apart again to see if I had something in the wrong place but everything was where it was suppose to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the thing to cut ear hair is like having a small jet engine in your ear. Four or five seconds and of use could possibly cause hearing loose. I don&#x27;t recommmend this product.</li>
            <li> Love this, doesn&#x27;t pull hair like the other one do.</li>
            <li> awesome...simply awesome, no complaints!</li>
            <li> this  is a god as you can get very close and dose not cut you and you do not need to have a dry face</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, but does not live up to the reviews I read before purchasing.  Not a lot of power, bogs down too easily, and battery life is so-so with this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s O.K. I wish it were sharper</li>
            <li> My first nose hair trimmer. Very good. I love it. At first I was worried about butchering the insides of my nose, but after doing it for over a week, It&#x27;s very safe. Also I find myself not plucking my nose hairs anymore. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> It seems like a cruel joke played by God upon mankind that as you get older and your vision fades somewhat, that hair starts to sprout from places where it never sprouted before while at the same time the hair on top of your head begins to thin and vanish.  This product cannot help with the latter issue, but it is great at trimming hair from ears, noses, and other unwanted places.  The blades are sharp and it does not pull the hairs as it cuts and it makes short work of cleaning up those unwanted hairs.  It is easy to clean, uses a AA battery which seems to last forever.  The product seems to have a life span of 1-2 years, after that the unit seems to slow down and the cutter is not as sharp as it once was, so it is time to replace and buy a new one.  At this price, that is not a problem.</li>
            <li> best trimmer for the price&lt;br /&gt;solid construction , unlike many which are not&lt;br /&gt;good handle, ease of use&lt;br /&gt;travel use</li>
            <li> Decided to purchase this when I saw the reviews. I didn&#x27;t want to stick something that had whirling blades up my nose, but I had no choice in this situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The metal tip gets warm, but not so warm that it is uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a snap, wash under water and you&#x27;re done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was deathly afraid that this thing would pull a really thick nose hair and cause me to scream, but I was surprised that it didn&#x27;t. The standard stuff happened though; eyes watering, sneezing. It was way better than sticking a pair of scissors up your nose and then hoping for the best.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. It works well and does a nice job removing hairs. Easy to clean. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works better than others that I&#x27;ve tried, and it&#x27;s inexpensive too.  Gets rid of nose and ear hair in seconds, it&#x27;s fairly quiet, and it&#x27;s easy to clean...does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do (well, I haven&#x27;t tried it for trimming facial hair) so I couldn&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li> Thankfully, my husband is still young enough not to have ear hair, but his nose hair is another story. I attack it with this contraption on a regular basis and it really clears out all the foliage. He says I poke his brain, but I know that&#x27;s not true. He also says he can breathe better once I&#x27;m done and I know that&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> Works out for my husband. Can&#x27;t imagine buying a $200 one like this.  Skip the high price tag and go with this one!</li>
            <li> NOT the best item out there. It&#x27;s very cheaply made, and the battery does not last that long. It doesn&#x27;t cut nose hair that well. I would steer clear of this item. It doesn&#x27;t do much other than look good on your counter. Even then, I wouldn&#x27;t put it on the counter...</li>
            <li> Well I thought this was a five star product but as others have concluded the blade fail after the first battery change and it makes a grinding noise and now it does not work at all. Basically this trimmer is disposable. I can&#x27;t find replacement blades. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Used it today. Its working great. Be sure to read the manual before using it. Undoing and doing those small parts is not so easy for everyone.!! But its fairly simple. It doesn&#x27;t hurt my nose at all. Cleaning is simple as well. only thing is if the product came with a  small cloth, it would have been easy to dry it off immediately, instead keeping it outside for 10 mins or so. But its not a deal breaker. Great product.</li>
            <li> great little machine, sure  beats scissors, should&#x27;ve bought it long ago</li>
            <li> Well, Im not ashamed to say that past 40, I got hairs that Im not proud of.  I had another shaver that did ok, but when I first used this on my nose hairs, I realizied what a piece of junk my old one was.  This also has a nice cleaning feature that allows to to open a channel in the shaver to run water completely through.  And its cheap!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product.  It doesn&#x27;t pull and does the job quickly and painlessly.</li>
            <li> Works well. Is quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I like very very good!</li>
            <li> Work great so far, not sure if it will last long, but anyway it was cheap so will see how long it will last. :)</li>
            <li> Never pinches!  Wish I would have bought it long ago.</li>
            <li> Does what I expect it to do. Showed up on time. Does not come with a battery. Looks nice.</li>
            <li> I bought it because of the positive reviews, but after I used it several times I am not sure why this product is rated so high. It just does not trim the nose hair very well. I am very disappointed in the purchase because I threw away my old one which I used over 15 years without any issue. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the sleek design.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk.  So much for it being waterproof.</li>
            <li> This is my second trimmer as I needed one at my other house. Trimmer works well and is simple.</li>
            <li> I like this little personal hygiene device.  It work great for ear and nose hair.  It cleans up very easily, and is easy to handle.  The quality of workmanship and finish is very nice.</li>
            <li> Works well. Nice product</li>
            <li> huaband uses it about twice a week</li>
            <li> Tends to wear down battery fairly quickly - and cutting is just &#x27;OK&#x27;</li>
            <li> Great for price. Effective for removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> it is not the closest shave but definitely worth it! I would definitely recommend it for the price given !</li>
            <li> Gret trimmer. vacs the trimmings away and you can clean it without taking it apart.</li>
            <li> Good qulity, easy to use. Mine needs a new battery every time to use.</li>
            <li> Great product. Sturdy, and easy to set up and use. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Whats more remarkable than the very short 6 week life span is that I only used this thing about 4 times.  STAY AWAY!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Had trouble with hair root getting irritated/infected.  Keeping them very short should help.  Needs good battery.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t want your nose hairs reaching out and grabbing someone do you? This thing obliterates nose hairs no problemo. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I use it for my nose hairs and to trim my eyebrow lines. Worth the money, still working fine. I look much more civilized.</li>
            <li> Solid construction and works perfectly. Much better than the one I bought from Marshalls. I strongly recommend this trimmer to everyone.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY HUSBAND... HE HAS HAD A COUPLE IN THE PAST THAT HE HAS NOT BEEN PLEASE WITH...THIS IS THE BEST NOSE TRIMMER WE&#x27;VE EVER PURCHASED...IT&#x27;S EASY TO USE...ISN&#x27;T PAINFUL..AND HE IS A HAPPY MAN....</li>
            <li> For years I have used a manual twist type nose hair clipper that worked well albeit pulled the hair from time which is not an enjoyable experience. I decided to upgrade to a faster and easier unit and after looking at several, decided on this product. After using it for several months I can say that I am very pleased with my purchase. The unit appears well built and has performed well for removing nose and other undesirable hair easily and painlessly. It is easy to use and clean and comes with a cleaning tool that is helpful. I recommend this unit for anyone needing an easy to use, trouble free product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works good so far and the price can&#x27;t be beat. The battery life seems to be good and its easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very great price for something that does such a great job.</li>
            <li> While it does the job, I find it to be overly bulky and the ergonomic design doesn&#x27;t make it any more easy to use than a &#x27;stick&#x27; model.  It comes with a small brush to clean the head--a plus.</li>
            <li> Clean, need, fast, good battery life, solid construction. I dropped my first one and it failed but that is gravity&#x27;s fault!</li>
            <li> Not a lot of horse power.&lt;br /&gt;Does the job advertised but very slow compared with other models I have owned.</li>
            <li> I used this product once and it quit working!!!! I really expected more maybe like using it twice!!! I will never buy another panasonic product .</li>
            <li> Got two of this. One for my husband and one for my dad. They both love the fact that it&#x27;s very easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li> Battery lasts well. Compact pleasing design. Not bulky like others. Does the job well for ear and nose and some touch ups. Price is&lt;br /&gt;okay.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of this model - both worked well for awhile, but both had the same problem:  The battery holder is way too flimsy, and after using it awhile, the motor starts slowing down and intermittently stopping due to poor battery contact - and new batteries don&#x27;t help.  It&#x27;s possible to get it to run faster sometimes by &amp;#34;tweaking&amp;#34; the battery cover or holder, but it just keeps getting worse over time. Unlike a decent flashlight, there is little pressure on the battery contacts nor any way to improve it.  The worst lasted a few months, the best one lasted less than a year.</li>
            <li> How did is go so long without this thing? I can not stand nose hair and now I don&#x27;t have to. Guys, the world is better with one of these things.</li>
            <li> Very nicely made.  Easy maintenance with the jet clean port.  As good as you can get for the money so far.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap little device and worked well enough and suited my purposes just fine, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t last for a full year.  Bought in June and dead in March.</li>
            <li> works very well only used it once since I bought it don&#x27;t have any hairs peeking out my nose yet</li>
            <li> Pretty format. Very precise and cutting. The only problem is the battery. I believe that it is better to make it rechargeable with any battery of more quality. For years, this format keeps on. Will it be the best?</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price. Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Okay, so &#x27;take&#x27; off the protective shell blade covering and note that the insertable dimensions are VERY large for a regular nose... the idea is to trim nose hair which protrudes from the sides of your nasal cavity... not to leave a &#x27;bush&#x27; of partially trimmed hair that is cut off at half it&#x27;s length and just populates so you have that &amp;#34;old person&amp;#34; hairy nostril look! This is, most devices like it made in &amp;#34;China&amp;#34;, are, a cheap product but does get good reviews... however the idea of trying to trim about one&#x27;s ears, well this won&#x27;t fit in the folds of an &#x27;ear&#x27; any easier than along the sides of a nasal cavity and you get a &#x27;weedy&#x27; look of partially trimmed ear hair... unless you want to braid &#x27;em I would suggest a product that &#x27;protrudes&#x27; and has &#x27;an edge&#x27; with which you can carefully trim hair far more deeply recessed or in ear crevasses. I won&#x27;t send it back but we are going to use it as a &#x27;gag&#x27; gift...</li>
            <li> Ive only used this once... but my goodness this is SOO much better than the small trimmer I have been using... I thought it might pull the hairs and hurt a bit... but NOTHING... maybe a little ticklish, but WOW it worked really well... I just hope it holds out for some time and not break down in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Looks, feels cheap. Broke when I dropped it from 2 feet (not really the manufacturer&#x27;s fault that I dropped it, but I still don&#x27;t like the product very much).</li>
            <li> My ears itched &amp; I didn&#x27;t know why.  I&#x27;d tried about every other cure, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a chance too.  It worked!</li>
            <li> Working for he reason I purchased it,  the product has a nice look to it,I would purchase another one if I needed to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought at least half a dozen of the cheap trimmers found at Walgreens and they always ended up jamming or pulling the hairs.  This is totally waterproof and has never jammed or pulled hair.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to like?  Easy to clean, efficient and just plain works.</li>
            <li> This product started out working just great. It was safe and effective.  Then after the third use, the top broke off and I have not been able to fix it.  So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the third type of trimmer I have purchased and by far the best.</li>
            <li> Tried it a few times so far, and works well. I like that it has a small curve which actually complements its design</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other trimmers in the past and they all seem to work the same. The thing that sets this one apart is the battery life. It takes 1AA battery and lasts through many uses. The blades seem to be pretty good as well because it hasn&#x27;t dulled on me after almost 2 years of use.</li>
            <li> its great have had 1 before but quit working in short time even with new battery hope this one lasts longer</li>
            <li> I had a previous trimmer that was just total garbage. When I trimmed my nose it would leave me sneezing for hours after. This thing is like a weed whacker! It doesn&#x27;t leave any hairs in your nose or ears, and it cleans up very well!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer ! Very easy to clean and use. Using a AA battery is awesome.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Conair trimmer I had been using for almost a year. I&#x27;m not gonna lie, once I took this trimmer out of the box and put a battery in, I couldn&#x27;t wait to stick this in my nose! This trimmer works much better than others I&#x27;ve used in the past. It is powerful enough that it doesn&#x27;t pull any hairs. It&#x27;s also quiet and very easy to clean. I have owned several different trimmers, (Conair, Wahl, Sharper Image &amp; Remington) and I would definitely recommend this trimmer over any of the others.</li>
            <li> Trims nose hair as expected</li>
            <li> before i had to use scissors and it was hard to reach all the hairs.this trimmer is magic and easy to clean with water rinse</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of electronic and old school scissor methods to trim hair and more sensitve skin areas.  When it comes to trimming your nose and ears this is what you want to use.  Those areas are more sensitive and take it from someone that takes blood thinners, you do not want to cut yourself there.  One such scissor cut incident ended up in the Emergency Room for me.  These trimmers won&#x27;t cut you or nick you.  They use just one AA battery and it lasts for a long time.  It is easy to turn a bezel around the top to open a slot to run water through and clean it.  It can be used wet or dry and makes a great gift for any occasion.  I highly recommend it for men or ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CA Luster</li>
            <li> Worked great for a 10 months but the blade lost form and basically started clipping the side of the chamber. Pretty much won&#x27;t run now.  Like other buyers said, at the price its not worth taking up their warranty to pay for the shipping cost to their facility in Texas. 2 year warranty doesnt really help.  Will try a different product</li>
            <li> I bought this because I keep growing hairs I don&#x27;t want.  Apparently my body hates me.  Panasonic&#x27;s Vortex works very easily for nose, ear, eyebrow, etc.  Cleans easily too.</li>
            <li> Long story short, I had a nose trimmer that pulled hair and took forever to use.  I was shocked by how close of a trim this product offered and how quickly it trimmed the hair.  Order it and you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Works better than any other nose trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased for my husband.  Would recommend to anyone with that pesky nose hair issue</li>
            <li> Very practical item, well known brand name Panasonic. Has that \\&quot;cool\\&quot; look and it only uses one AA battery. It can be washed with water with a special switch right below the blade. Superb packaging, fast shipping, and catalogue included! It arrived right before Xmas! Thank You! 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I purchased both the Panasonic ER-GN30-k and the Wahl 5546-200. I had high hopes for the Wahl, but it didn&#x27;t cut hair as close as the Panasonic did. There were some hairs that it just wouldn&#x27;t touch (even though they&#x27;re right there!). The Panasonic didn&#x27;t have any problems.    The difference might be related to the design of the end of the blade guard, as the Wahl is wide open, where the Panasonic blade guard kind of wraps around the top or tip of the blade.     I would recommend the Panasonic over the Wahl by a mile.</li>
            <li> it has a cap for the cutting end and the battery is purported to last about a million years (really only two or three). In addition, it is fairly quiet. This is a nice feature for something one wants to stuff into their ears. The only reported drawback was a bit of a bite when pressing against his lips but holding it at a slight angle relieved this problem. All in all, a nice tool for taming a balding Wookie - and much cheaper than a light saber.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, and clean.  lightweight and great for travel.  I am always impressed with Panasonic quality and durability.  Definitely recommend to friends and family</li>
            <li> Broke down after 3 uses for 5 seconds each, now I have to spend time with Panasonic support to replace it?</li>
            <li> Well, my husband needs it and the price was great so I love it too.Great gift for those with hairy noses and ears.</li>
            <li> best on the market,works better than expected. very easy to clean. i would recommend it to all men. found best price on amazon.com</li>
            <li> my bf loves it. he said this is what he needs and really useful to him. thank you for offer such a good stuff and cheap on this site.</li>
            <li> UPDATE: JAN 20, 2014&lt;br /&gt;It has now been exactly 2 months since I submitted my contact information to Panasonic for warranty service.  No one has contacted me from their company.  This trimmer has a 2 year warranty period, I consider this to be consumer fraud.  Absolutely appalling customer service.  That being said, this is a really cheap trimmer.  I went to the dollar store and bought a trimmer that was three dollars.  It is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I first got this trimmer it worked exceptionally well.  In fact, the first couple of times were amazing.  That&#x27;s when things started going downhill.  After a couple of months the trimmer started performing really poorly.  My nose hair would get trapped in the trimmer and the only way to get it out was to pull the trimmer really hard and to rip out the hair.  This is an EXTREMELY painful process.  I thought that perhaps the batters were low and there wasn&#x27;t enough power for the blades to cut the hair.  But even after replacing the batteries it would still trap my hair.  I can no long use this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve contacted Panasonic customer support through their website over a week ago and no one has responded to me yet.  I ordered this product about 6 months ago and I&#x27;m still within my 2 year warranty period.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer. I&#x27;ve tried several others and none have done as well of a job on both nose hair and ear hair as this one. I would certainly reccommend this item.</li>
            <li> My husband loves the hair trimmer. He used it the first day we received it, and it cut excellently. Would recommend the product to others.</li>
            <li> Breaks absurdly quickly. The design makes the rotating cutters much too ineffective. I bought it to remove nose hair - it&#x27;s terrible at that!</li>
            <li> I used it once, seemed to do the job. The next time it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, and of course I&#x27;m just a few days past the 30 day return policy. Based on other negative reviews I am going to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer! I can&#x27;t speak much for it being used as a trimmer for the ear, but for the nose it&#x27;s working really well. As I have gotten older, I find myself having to trim my nose hair much more often, about once a month. With the old blade style of electric trimmer I would always dread it because because I had to stick the blades all the way up to the offending hairs in my nose. Often it wouldn&#x27;t get those long hairs were sticking out the most. Yuck! And I had to remove these hairs the old fashioned way, using my fingernails. Never a very pleasing thing to have to do! With this one you just slip in and run it around a little, and it does the job. It&#x27;s much faster, too. I give it five stars!</li>
            <li> This thing works better than most.  it uses batteries FAST.  But, I bought 2 of them and it is really hard to find one that works this well.  Once in a while, you will get a pulled hair but it is light and compact and it is just better than any others I have tried.  The battery life and strength is the only concern with this.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works excellent, I am pleased with surprise, that is smooth cut, no suffering. Also is quiet. It feel my needs and expectations. Panasonic as always is good name with products.</li>
            <li> This item works great and is very easy to clean.  I especially like that you can run it under water for cleaning.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. Had to buy a well at an affordable price.</li>
            <li> Being that this product cost me $20, I was happily surprised. This trimmer really works; I use it to &#x27;edge&#x27; my eyebrows, trim my nose hair, and &#x27;edge&#x27; around my face in areas that are hard to reach with a razor. It is a tickles a little, but no pain. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is the one you want. Excellent function. Quick clean. Built so that you won&#x27;t need to replace it</li>
            <li> Make sure you use a fresh battery.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of Panasonic&#x27;s nose trimmers over many years and this is the best yet. They seem to refine the features and construction quality as time goes on. Impressive progression. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Very nice and easy to use. I no longer have to use the stupid mini scissors to trim my nose hair. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d tried a manual trimmer before and didn&#x27;t like it.  This is GREAT!  And the wet cleaning is VERY easy.  But watch out for stubble when you blow your nose!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think it could be very effective with those small slots in the end, but it actually is, I&#x27;m very happy with this choice.  It tickles a little, but very effective in quickly and easily trimming those hairs.</li>
            <li> It is light quiet and performs its job flawlessly.  Although it is made of plastic, it is obviously of good quality. No pinching, just a quick removal of hair.  I used one rechargeable AA battery and the motor spins freely and easily. A must have...</li>
            <li> This has been husband approved. It is non evasive and doesn&#x27;t pull. It gets a good clean cut in seconds. Battery lasts a very long time. He has been using this for over a year. very durable. Good gift!</li>
            <li> My ears and nostrils are dope!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now I&#x27;ve got a wife!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I implore you to think about the possibilities.</li>
            <li> After trying a few different brands and models, this is the best one around. No hair pulling is the key factor in this product.</li>
            <li> For such a low price this thing is great! It does the job without getting hot or needing a new blade every year</li>
            <li> Easy to use, very effective and no hair pulling. This is a very convenient to trim nose and ear hair. No pain or excessive noise. One AA battery and the trimmer cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> I have bought several nose and ear hair trimmers and this is definitely the best one so far.  It arrived on time and I would recommend it,</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t sweat it; this thing is easy to use, clean, and didn&#x27;t pull any hairs out. I feel bad for all the dentists who had to deal with looking at my face at weird angles before I had this thing.</li>
            <li> Trimmer does what is supposed to and a whole lot safer than scissors. Very easy to clean and shape of the trimmer makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> A++++SELLER WOULD PURCHASE AGAIN!!!!....5 STARS</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT WORKS WELL, I WOULD RECOMMEND IT.  OTHER SIMILAR DEVICES DID NOT WORK AS WELL. IT IS ALSO A GOOD BUY</li>
            <li> Never tested the water clean out feature. Don&#x27;t need to. My nose hair isn&#x27;t filled with boogers when I use it. Great gift for those people who are unaware of their gigantic nose hair forest.</li>
            <li> I am been struggling with buying a lot of different nose trimmers but this one is BY FAR THE BEST.  IT WORKS WELL!!!  It doesn&#x27;t just work but it works well and I love it.  I am so happy I bought it and it was well worth the money.</li>
            <li> It did its job very well. no pain or irratation after the it was over. Would recommend it to people with forrest growing in there nose.</li>
            <li> I was worried it would be hard to use and would &amp;#34;hurt&amp;#34; by snagging or clipping skin.  Boy, was I wrong.  Intuitively easy to use.  One really big complaint:  it tickles my nose!  ;-)</li>
            <li> Did not even cut hair.  The cutters are to far off the surface of the skin to allow a clean smooth cut.</li>
            <li> Does a great job of trimming hair that tends to grow where it shouldn&#x27;t!</li>
            <li> Works well.....a little skimpier than I expected, but functional.</li>
            <li> easy to use, trims well</li>
            <li> Works great, good price</li>
            <li> This works well, not only for nose hair, but for trimming around the nose and mouth, and ears, after shaving. I know some reviews says it breaks, but mine did not answer it is very powerful.  Can&#x27;t be used for sideburns.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best nose trimmer</li>
            <li> This little device might pass as a cheap version of other similar devices with a greater price tag, but it works just wonders.&lt;br /&gt;It works by softly removing the hair, it doesn&#x27;t pull them as others, it doesn&#x27;t get stuck, and there&#x27;s no chance of getting blood anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for 4 weeks now, twice a week, and the battery and motor doesn&#x27;t show any signs of getting slow or losing power.&lt;br /&gt;Disassembling it is easy and unencumbered, with easy to handle parts and easy reassembly.&lt;br /&gt;The auto cleaning (vortex) system is quite nice and effective, I have never had to clean the parts manually.&lt;br /&gt;Also, as it stores the removed heir pieces inside the blade piece, makes for a very clean result.</li>
            <li> It seems nice a friend recommended it to me. Unfortunately I am missing the little back blade that fits at the top.</li>
            <li> This clipper met my expectations. If you have nose hairs in need of trimming, this Panasonic is capable of the task.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  I had never tried to trim unwanted hairs before, but this product made it easy for me to do just that.  Moreover, I like that it allows for easy cleaning of the Panasonic trimmer.</li>
            <li> Best Nose &amp; ear tool I have tried so far.</li>
            <li> Had this over a year - performs well, sometimes has a strange smell but works well. Batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most affordable trimmers and it gets the job done!  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d use it for facial hair grooming, as it&#x27;s not precise enough... but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason in the first place!  It easily snips out those pesky little hairs in the ear and nostrils without pulling or pinching.  Super easy to clean by turning the knob to the little &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; icon, and running it under the faucet!</li>
            <li> Feels very cheaply made. Doesn&#x27;t do a great job, and it has small, easy to lose parts.</li>
            <li> very powerful but gentle...</li>
            <li> nice and excellent product</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it works well.</li>
            <li> I waited a few months before reviewing.  Used about 5 times so far. Works excellent for my intended purpose (removing nose hair).  Also works great for ear hair and the hair right under the nose that the razor might not reach.  Does not pull on hair, kinda tickles.  Easy to clean.  Still using the battery that came with unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the remington clipper and small scissors for the nose hair with mixed results.  The Remington had a tendancy to pull on the hair.  The scissors didnt seem to be very effective compared to this Panasonic.  I see that Panasonic offers several models, even one with a vacuum feature.  There is another model with a light, but not sure that feature is worth the extra cost.  For just over 10 dollars and free shipping with a $35 purchase, this was just right for me.</li>
            <li> Does a good job of removing unwanted nasal, ear, and facial hair.  Make sure you turn the knob to the appropriate setting when using in the shower.  One time I did not, and I thought the product was no longer good as it would not turn on.  Evidently, it just needed to dry out as within a few days, it was working again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product as described quality seller!!</li>
            <li> Just because I don&#x27;t write a comprehensive review doesn&#x27;t mean my rating is less important.</li>
            <li> Decent product. Written up as sounding a lot more functional than it is.  The whole wet/dry part seems a bit of a farce because all it is is a well/chamber that traps hair which can be flushed out with water.  A good powerful burst of air serves the same function.  Unit looks a lot bigger in the picture than it is, which from my perspective is actually preferable.  My previous unit was a Conair product.  This Panasonic one seems an improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the purchase and would not hesitate to recommend.</li>
            <li> So far so good. I have only used it a few times but so far it works great.</li>
            <li> Died after 5 uses, or 2 months of having.</li>
            <li> This item doesn&#x27;t really do anything except buzz when you turn it on.  I really wish I hadn&#x27;t purchased it.</li>
            <li> Really really great. Quiet, painless, and more effective than any other I have tried.</li>
            <li> Like many of the other one star reviews, I had the same problem. After a little over a month ( 3 total uses, 2 minutes total) it simply would not turn on. New batteries did not help, this thing was just plain defective. Had I used it more, it would have died within the 30 day return period. My sparse nose hair growth appears to be a blessing and a curse.</li>
            <li> My last nose hair trimmer was a piece of cheap junk. This thing is just superb. Solidly built. It feels like it&#x27;ll be my trimmer till the day I die.</li>
            <li> Broken. Wasnt&#x27; worth to send back</li>
            <li> I used the nose hair trimmer quite a lot.  It did a good job and cleaned up quite well with water.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing more romantic than when your partner looks longingly at you and says, &amp;#34;can I pull that nose hair?&amp;#34;  So I went online and bought this.  It works.</li>
            <li> Does not work well at all. And it is not washable as it is impossible to dry so it rusts.</li>
            <li> Liked it so much I bought another.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with this item. It&#x27;s a painless way of getting rid of unwanted hair in your nose and ear.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this little present that I ordered as a last minute gift to go with his electric razor. He says they work very well and I&#x27;m definitely very happy with the price!</li>
            <li> works great and very inexpensive</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t complain for the price. Does a good job trimming nose and ear hair. And not too loud, like some others.</li>
            <li> Works well. It is smooth and doesn&#x27;t cut or leave burns after done.&lt;br /&gt;Cool part is that it is washable with water.</li>
            <li> Works so much better than other brands that I have used. Easy to clean it and very easy to use as well</li>
            <li> Works well ,priced right. Not too heavy, not too light .So trim your nose  hairs, every night.The ladies will think your outta&#x27; sight !</li>
            <li> After owning this for about three months, the product works well and does what it says. I have been very happy with it. And it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> wonderful small appliance for man</li>
            <li> This is so cheaply maufactured it&#x27;s unreal. I wish I had never bought it. It&#x27;s been 36 days since i purchased it so Amazon won&#x27;t accpet a return. This is one of many reasons I plan to do all of my business with Best Buy.</li>
            <li> At just over $10, this is an unbelievably effective and versatile little tool. Yeah, it&#x27;s kind of gross to think about, but my ears and nose have never been cleaner.</li>
            <li> Well done ear and nose hair trimmer.  If looks and feels like it should last a long time and it does a good job clipping hairs.</li>
            <li> So far so good, just as described and looks the same. Nice little feature is the wash feature which allows you to clean easily.</li>
            <li> This thing works like a charm. I&#x27;ve had this for a year now, and it still works. The machine actually cuts the hair. I use it on my eyebrows, nose, and ear hairs. I&#x27;ve never had an issue with this thing at all.</li>
            <li> It works very well I like it</li>
            <li> Annoying, noising, itching, and doesn&#x27;t work well.. Had to expend minutes to finish one nostril.. Hate and don&#x27;t use anymore.</li>
            <li> These are really neat , I&#x27;ve owned some in the past but these are nicer ,as anything else I think they always improve products</li>
            <li> Very sharp. I think I got a little cut in the nose from being too aggressive. I only use for nose hair trimming so can&#x27;t comment on the other uses.</li>
            <li> Best one my husband has ever had!</li>
            <li> motor is very weak, it gets caught on my hair which is very painful.  I tried replacing battery mulitple times.  It seems to be a wiring issue, sometimes it has good power/speed, other times the motor is slow and weak.  very disappointed since i spent more on this one than my last one that lasted 7 years</li>
            <li> it does work, and doesn&#x27;t pull nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk.  The batter cover and materials are incredibly flimsy.</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer and i just imagined that it would do alot better. It does get some of the stuff, just not enough for me to rate it any higher.</li>
            <li> Ergonomic design, easy to clean, and really does the job on nose and ears.</li>
            <li> Does a good job for the nose and brows but can&#x27;t really get a close shave for shaping beard. Great for the price!</li>
            <li> Despite several (non verified) customers complaining about various things I went ahead and purchased this, as number of positive reviews outweighs the negative ones. I&#x27;m so happy I did! This is the most ingenious neat product I own. What you get for the price is excellent performing product with great design, lightweight and with easy operation. Cleaning is hassle free and trimming is pain and/or tickle free. Does the job very quick and safe, no need to worry about touching your inner skin. It just works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I regret I didn&#x27;t get it earlier. Playing with scissors against the mirror and being frustrated about the itchy result is long gone.</li>
            <li> It is the best nose trimmer I’ve ever used.  I liked it so much, I threw out my old one.  No more sore nose for me resulting from pulling those d*** hairs out.</li>
            <li> I have had 2 of these items in one year.  Both have died after a short time.  I wish there was a better alternative.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after the first time I used it.  Still powers on but the blades don&#x27;t cut at all.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm on those awful nose hairs</li>
            <li> The best nose trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned!</li>
            <li> Not quite as good as the one I had previous to this, but serves it&#x27;s function fairly well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy another of this type, and will try something else out when I decide to get a new one.</li>
            <li> Works great &amp; good product</li>
            <li> Purchased two for husband and son. They both think it works great. Can&#x27;t imagine going back to scissors. LOL</li>
            <li> better than my previous trimmer. wish there was a powerful model. this is very good given what is available today.</li>
            <li> Only used it one time but it works perfectly</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at first. Had to bang it in the palm of my hand then it started to run. It has real fragile and crappy battery contacts. They almost seem to be &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34; metal. I&#x27;ll use it till it craps out again and then I&#x27;ll toss it in a dumpster. Look for something else!!</li>
            <li> Works but it&#x27;s very weak.</li>
            <li> I love this thing. At 34 the hair on my face nose ears.... is growing in the strangest places. I use this to trim everything on my face. Not my beard of course but everything else.</li>
            <li> It works and my nose hairs are gone. It doesn&#x27;t pull, at least yet, and is pretty easy to clean.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li> KEEPS NICKING MY NOSE AND MAKING IT BLEED, AND GIVES ME INGROWN HAIRS</li>
            <li> Easy using, easy cleaning, safety trimming! I like it. I used to looking for something like this before! It works well!</li>
            <li> serves the purpose perfectly. Easy to use,clean and store. Is more like a fatter parker pen. Good battery life. Should be careful when dismantling and assembling the parts before n after cleaning, as the parts in the nib are delicate and small.</li>
            <li> Product works as it should. Setting it up was slightly confusing but I didn&#x27;t bother to look at the directions clearly. No pain caused when using this product.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas in 2012; he loves it. It had gotten great reviews and now we know why. Unlike some similar devices, this doesn&#x27;t end up pulling hairs and does a great job trimming them.  Compact, looks nice, and is good quality. My husband uses it a lot, and it&#x27;s still going strong.    Update 1/24/15:  This is still going strong --- my husband uses it regularly and it has been over 2 years with no problems.</li>
            <li> Another top performer from Panasonic.  I have purchased the &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; models in the past.  I was hesitant to try a different model but I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> This unit is much better than my other one from Brookstone. It is compact, light weight, and very well-built.  I used Tia&#x27;s soon as it arrived. Works well.</li>
            <li> For the price, this little hair trimmer does a pretty good job.  Must be very careful with the small plastic parts</li>
            <li> worked good for 2 weeks then just completely stopped working&lt;br /&gt;///no pull...good nose hair cutter but..&lt;br /&gt;stopped working after 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after reading the good reviews. I used it once and it was great and purchased an additional one for my dad. However after using it a few times it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I MADE THE MISTAKE AND THOUGHT I DIDN&#x27;T USE IT CORRECTLY. BOUGHT 2 TIMES AND BOTH OT WORK 2 MONTH AND DIED...</li>
            <li> I got this based on other reviews.  It is far superior to my older trimmer - much better cutter that doesn&#x27;t pull, quiet operation, and easy cleaning.  My older one had a led light but that is a feature I didn&#x27;t need or use.  For an older guy&#x27;s trimmer, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> I have tried several types of nose hair trimmers over the past few years and all of them worked pretty much the same. Battery operated with a spinning shielded blade. This one is no better or worse than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> This is a very good nose shaver does not cut your skin&lt;br /&gt;It also cuts nose hairs very close and gently</li>
            <li> First nose trimmer I have owned that actually worked...this thing is excellent.  This is a grooming must have.  Shop no further this is what you want to buy.</li>
            <li> Very nice Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer - worked as I expected - Very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Nisar Ahmad</li>
            <li> My husband is very pleased with the quality and the features of this nose hair trimmer. Good quality; good value.</li>
            <li> I tried two different AA batteries of different brands and neither made this item turn on (yes, I actually read the owner&#x27;s manual which should not have even been necessary for a simple item, checked all settings 8x, and checked orientation of battery several times). Of course this was a stocking stuffer I purchased early and the return period had expired before we ever opened it, so I am SOL I guess. Why doesn&#x27;t anything work properly anymore. Ugh.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad after his last trimmer broke (not the same brand). I have the same one so went with it and he loves it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> I have fast growing nose hairs for some reason...I got tired of trying to trim them the best I could with my regular electric shaver. This things works great and so far has not given me any problems. My only complaint is not necessarily with this particular model, but may be with all types. When I use the trimmer it tickles my hair and I have to stop using it. I can only use it for a second or two at a time and give my self a chance to relax before I go at it again.</li>
            <li> I have had other trimmers that looked similar but this one does do a far better job. I am finally spared comments from my wife and done grossing out my dental hygentist.</li>
            <li> Works great! Easy to clean and has metal cutting blades not those plastic ones that never last.</li>
            <li> Nice design, reaches into nooks and crannies and does a nice trim job. It would have been nice to have an LED light on the end to see progress in the dark places. I received this from my wife as a present and she never complains about my hairs now!</li>
            <li> Great ear and nose hair trimmer and even great to even out the mustache part of my beard so I wont have to taste breakfast all day. The batteries that came with it sure didnt last long but the product itself is GREAT. I no longer have to have &amp;#34;Wookie&amp;#34; ears and dont have to risk using scissors for other hair that is begginning to grow in strange places where nothing used to appear. Good Mustache (or however you spell it) trimmer as well. A decent set of batteries makes it a much better tool.</li>
            <li> Motor in this unit is too noisy to use trimming my ear. Wasn&#x27;t noisy initially but after using it a few times it became that. Had to buy a different trimmer. Couldn&#x27;t return this one due to time limit ran out.</li>
            <li> Long-lasting battery, ultra-handy! I&#x27;m so glad I got this thing- everyone should have one (they&#x27;re not really for sharing). Perfect for eyebrow-trimming.</li>
            <li> It works but always feels like it will give out at any moment.... not strong.</li>
            <li> Great device, but after only about 20 uses, the top came loose and rattles when I use the thing, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to trim as well anymore.</li>
            <li> It worked fine the first couple of times.  Bought it the last day of January and now the first day of June it is dead. There has to be something better. Additional:  This is the response I got from the Panasonic personnel: SUCKS  Jessica: Hello! I’m a Panasonic Product Specialist. Do you have any questions I can help you with today? You: Yes Jessica: Thank you for visiting Panasonic! How may I help you today? Jessica: Just checking in, how are things coming along? You: I purchased a ER-GN30-K the last day of Jan on Amazon. Went to use it on Jun 1st it won&#x27;t work. Not a happy customer. Jessica: I apologize for the inconvenience caused. Jessica: May I ask if it is under warranty? You: Hell, I don&#x27;t know. I would think you would know that? You: I would think it would be good for more than 4 monjths? You: months Jessica: I understand but I apologize, our warranties differ from our retailers. Jessica: Should you have any questions in the future, please feel free to chat with us again. Jessica: Thank you for visiting Panasonic.com today! You: That is all you can say? Jessica: Please contact Amazon for they will be the ones who can help you.  Then she just signed off, with NO help.</li>
            <li> So glad I got one of these, takes less time and it works so well....I get groomed so fast now.</li>
            <li> I had this nose hair trimmer for about 4 months before it broke. It was the best trimmer I ever had until it broke.</li>
            <li> No complaints about this product. It is effective and reasonably priced. Occasionally pulls a hair, not a huge problem unless you&#x27;re a drama queen. Put in extensive research before buying this product and would buy it again if I could go back</li>
            <li> This is a fine gadget. Thankfully it does great job and is gentle.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I had a single AA battery powered small plastic Panasonic nose trimmer that lasted 30 years.  When it finally gave out I searched Amazon I settled on this one based on my previous Panasonic and the reviews.  This trimmer does not work well at all.  Out of the box it pulled the hairs but would not cut them.  I could even look in the mirror and aim it at one specific hair and it would not cut it after several tries</li>
            <li> Very good value.  Had the same AA battery in it for 2 months.  Use it every day on my&lt;br /&gt;ears and nose.  Works perfectly and very easy to clean, just run under the tap and twist&lt;br /&gt;off the top for drying.  Very easy.</li>
            <li> Broke within a week. Thought the batteries had died, but turns out the entire thing crapped out. I should have bought some scissors instead... less chance of those things being a paper weight a week later.</li>
            <li> these things smell like metal and will give you a nose infections!!</li>
            <li> Does its job and very easy to use. My nose skin was a bit irritated after using it but I think it is not relevant to the product. :)</li>
            <li> Died in no time.  Piece of junk.  Cheap in every way. Should be considered disposable, I suppose, at this price.</li>
            <li> Delivered as expected and woks well</li>
            <li> I love the way this product trims my nose hair without any irritation. It also works great on ears and eyebrows! The blade is easy to take apart and clean. As of right now, I can not find anything negative to say. It&#x27;s a big improvement from the last trimmer I had. Don&#x27;t know how long the blade will last, but I guess time will tell.</li>
            <li> Works as intended. Cuts nose and eat hairs painlessly. A necessity for aging men.</li>
            <li> The old on was worn out and it was time to replace it!  This one trims so much better.</li>
            <li> works great...good value for the money..no issues whatsoever</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading reviews on here and from other sites as well. I&#x27;m very cautious as to not knick the inside of my nose and I like the rotating head vs the side-to-side of my Braun that I had been using. It makes a lot of clicking sounds which I assume to be the hairs, but now I wish I had opted for a model that has the L.E.D. lighting because while it looks like I&#x27;ve got the job done, I still see a few strays when I&#x27;m looking in a mirror in my car in daylight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a really hairy guy, but I do need this from time to time for my nose. I used to have a Wahl and another Wal-Mart brand and I found them to die after a year or so. This has an excellent life to it, and works much better. Cleanup is really easy, and the price is great! I&#x27;d highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it ,and My Dad now has one too.. Great seller. Would Definitely recommend..</li>
            <li> Great nose and ear hair removal.  Unlike a few other hair removers for the nose this one doesn&#x27;t make me sneeze.  Doesn&#x27;t pull any of my hair when cutting and even though I press pretty hard , no cuts.</li>
            <li> I got maybe one hour of use out of it before it started making a loud noise.  So loud it hurt my ears when trimming ear hair.  It was great for a short while though, quiet with no hair pulling.</li>
            <li> My husband and I each have a trimmer. Have used other trimmers of different brands in the past. Panasonic got this one right and it&#x27;s definitely a keeper. I can hear the nose hairs as they&#x27;re being cut so I know it&#x27;s working. Use it every two or three days. Had it for a few months with the original battery and it still works like a charm. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this purchase. I have no problems with the item or the purchasing process. I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much you can say about a nose hair trimmer. Don&#x27;t go expecting it to bake you a cake or something. It cuts my nose hair without any discomfort or pain whatsoever. I even use it to touch up my eyebrows and it does a pretty good job getting close to the skin without cutting me. I also like that you can wash it under water to quickly clean it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was super straightforward to open. I didn&#x27;t have any problems getting to the product itself, so a win there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- not very loud outside of the room it&#x27;s being used in&lt;br /&gt;- trims hair without any pain&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s a touch heavier than I expected, but not overwhelmingly so&lt;br /&gt;- you pretty much have to take it apart to clean the hair out properly. The little slot for running water through does a decent job if you&#x27;re in a hurry, but it&#x27;s better to open it up and use the brush to clean it, then rinse it, then leave the parts out to dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;- the tip does get a bit warm as you use it, but it says in the included documentation that&#x27;s normal&lt;br /&gt;- when I move the trimmer close to the middle of my nose, it tickles a little bit (but it doesn&#x27;t hurt)</li>
            <li> My hubby says it&#x27;s the best one he&#x27;s had!</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have owned.  I&#x27;ve owned this for a few months and wish I had purchased it long before.  Never will I miss the ripping of hairs and tears in my eyes when I used my previous trimmer.</li>
            <li> It was a fine trimmer, but I guess I had a lemon. It died after two uses -- changed the batteries, checked the contacts, took apart and put back together 17 times, but no luck. I hate to post this, because it sounds like when they work they work well, but I think it&#x27;s worth knowing that there may be some quality issues.</li>
            <li> There is absolutely no pulling on the hair at all which i like but it doesn&#x27;t seem to cut a lot of the hair so set aside some time if you intend on getting it all</li>
            <li> Nice product.&lt;br /&gt;Not great but good enough.&lt;br /&gt;Very quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;Very good price.</li>
            <li> No nose hairs are safe from this trimmer</li>
            <li> Got this as a gag gift for my husband.  Little did I know that this was going to be his favorite gift.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said it works great until you drop it.  Even the smallest drop puts it out of service...I was expecting tougher products from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> This is my second one.. both lasted about 1.5 years. roughly 18 uses. It does work well but I clearly experienced the same issues as all the other 1 star posters... the thing just does not last. Motor burns out or somehow it gets jammed.  Anyone try something else that won&#x27;t need to be replaced next year?</li>
            <li> This is just what I needed to get the nose hair out. This works great and it&#x27;s not expensive at all.</li>
            <li> No one will see this, as there are like a thousand positive reviews... but they are all right!! I went through 3 crappy trimmers before I bought this one... each wore out in a week! I was feeling bad, like my nose hair was indestructible!!! But this one has already lasted 3+ months!!! The complaints about noise when you stick it in your ear? ITS A MOTOR IN YOUR EAR!!! of course it makes noise!!! Don&#x27;t listen to the whiners, this thing is awesome!!!</li>
            <li> THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT AS IT REMOVES EXCESS HAIRS IN AREAS WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO GET TO!&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDED</li>
            <li> I cant imagine a more perfect design. I don&#x27;t have an ear hair issue but like my dad the hairs in my nose grow like a thick viney jungle. I have purchased other trimmers over the years getting mediocre results. I&#x27;ve often had to use my mini-sissors to clip that errant hair or two. This trimmer was perfect. Easy to install battery and use. After a few moments in each nostril my schnoz was painlessly clipped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I know what to get dad for Xmas.</li>
            <li> This is a simple trimmer that works very well at a very good price.  Bought it after reading the positive reviews on amazon.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Hardly any power.  Would stop if it snags a long nose hair. Not happy.</li>
            <li> I have nose hairs. Yes they are kinda thick. This trimmer jammed, wouldn&#x27;t run, then randomly unjammed and yanked the hairs out with some skin. Torture. I immediately returned the trimmer. Unfortunately one star gives the impression that this trimmer has some redeeming quality. It does not.</li>
            <li> Performed as promised. Very Happy</li>
            <li> Super product! Does the job really well! Highly recommend it. A few friends have bought this on my recommendation! Awesome!!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a lot more solid than any other similar product I&#x27;ve had. It has a very clean and strong motor in it and it is largely water/rustproof as long as you maintain it well. Learn how to remove the blades or replace them, I accidentally dropped this on the first day and it I thought it stopped working, you just have to reseat it correctly, it spins freely.</li>
            <li> perfect! Compact, smooth, quiet, reasonable durable, easy to clean, battery lasts long.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after reading somewhere where plucking your nose hair can cause fatal infection in a very rare cases. This little thing works wonders but first timers should use caution not to over cut your nose hair. I&#x27;ve made a mistake of cutting mine too much and breathing through my nose felt uncomfortable for a while.</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do.  I can&#x27;t complain.  I&#x27;m not sure how durable it will be long term though...the only concern.</li>
            <li> The size was 2 Pack, how come I only received one item?</li>
            <li> Works great.  Exactly what the marketing promised.</li>
            <li> Good construction and quality. Works. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Be careful this says it&#x27;s a 2 pack. But is NOT. I only got one.</li>
            <li> good ear and facial hair trimmer. it&#x27;s just what my nostrils feared coming.</li>
            <li> Strong spin / cut and works great. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price. Best trimmer for nose/ear that I have tried, and I have tried four different ones.</li>
            <li> The run of nose/ear clippers are cereal box prizes that fall apart after a few months. This is a workman like product like a salon tool that needs to work day by day for years. You may feel a tug once in a while but the hairs will disappear as they should.</li>
            <li> Nice precision trimmer</li>
            <li> It worked great. I give it 4 stars because its blade cannot be replaced</li>
            <li> Turn it on, jam it up your nostril a few times, and no more nasty long nose hairs. Do it. Your spouse will appreciate it.</li>
            <li> It does a much better job than the previous models.  It has met all of my expectations and gives me 100% confidence that I haven&#x27;t missed any unsightly nose or ear hairs.</li>
            <li> Good news.  This trimmer does what it is supposed to do.  I used to use a flat edged trimmer but the angles required to operate made it difficult to do a complete job.  The difference is the rotating blades.</li>
            <li> Works great. Gets in places you can not get to with a small scissors. Easy to clean. I love the water setting.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price</li>
            <li> Before I bought this guy I was using my beard trimmer to shave my nose hairs. I&#x27;d have to awkwardly tilt the clippers to get them in my nose, flaring my nostrils the whole time. This guy goes up there without any issues. It&#x27;s round, so you don&#x27;t have to doing any funny maneuvers. There&#x27;s a covering over the blades, so it doesn&#x27;t pinch, and it works great. Definitely recommend. For 10 bucks, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I will admit, I was a little nervous about getting this and actually using it. but after reading the reviews, I went ahead and dove in. Trying to trim unwanted hair with scissors doesn&#x27;t work so well in certain small places like the nose or ears!! This Hair Trimmer works great and now all my fears are over! Great little helper!!!</li>
            <li> I have about 3 nose hair trimmers and all of them suck so I decided to buy one on Amazon that had good reviews and this was the one I got. It really does work great and it is easy to clean since you can run it under water. The thing that makes this trimmer better that the rest is that it actually cuts on the end and not just on the sides. I am really happy with these clippers.</li>
            <li> A strange thing happened as I creeped over the 30 year mark...little curly cues started emerging from my nostrils.  I guess that they were just waiting for the right time to pop out and greet the world.  Unfortunately for them, I cut them down before they ever had the chance.  This trimmer is not particularly substantial.  It is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t feel like much, especially without the battery.  Once you put the battery in, it feels more natural and it does a decent job of trimming those unsightly nose hairs (and I&#x27;m sure other hairs as well, but I haven&#x27;t tried).  The best thing about this item is that I bought it on a lightning deal for $10.  At that price point, it has already paid for itself in grooming and I can definitely recommend it.  I wouldn&#x27;t pay upwards of $15-20 for it, but if you can get a good deal this is a safe bet.</li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but I need to blame someone or something for hitting that age group where you start to have overgrown ear and nostril hair; not Panasonic&#x27;s fault, but hey, I didn&#x27;t ask for it either.</li>
            <li> I was super aprehensive about the first time of using this, but this thing seems to just trim the hairs instead of ripping them out like some other products. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched a long time for a nose &amp; ear trimmer that was both effective and effectively painless,&lt;br /&gt;and this fits the bill.  My only complaint is, that, while a battery seems to run the thing for a long time,&lt;br /&gt;it really only runs it at an impressive, optimal speed for a dozen or so uses, so, somewhat hard on batteries.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really enjoying using this. It&#x27;s excellent for nose hair, or those tiny little hairs you always manage to miss with the razor. Batteries last a while and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used anything like this before.  I figured it would hurt or get all tangled up in my nose but it really is painless and trims great!  It&#x27;s well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Easy to use . Love the fact that you can keep it clean. Would and will tell friends about it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is used only on my ears and performs very well in that capacity.  I have no complaints with this product.</li>
            <li> Does what it suppose to do.  Battery last long time.  It does not pull hair out.  First time I use one of these and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works well. I have used several other brands of nose trimmers and while this one is not perfect, it is one of the betteer ones that I have used.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best trimmers that I have bought. I recommend it to anyone that needs a trimmer.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend for a replacement. Likes how you can turn it and clean it out with water. Works great!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is sturdy without any loose parts and I would consider buying it again, but at the end of the day... It&#x27;s an average trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like it&#x27;s lost a bit of power / sharpness since I first bought it but the thing is still good for minor touch-ups and was worth the purchase given its cheap price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3-4 stars.</li>
            <li> I just love this Panasonic trimmer. The unit is sturdy &amp; easy to use. It trims the hairs in my nose, ears &amp; eyebrows very well!</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, works flawlessly, no pain at all!!  Would recommend this to anybody!  Very nice!  Priced right, couldn&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> I use this for nose and ear hair...works well. The instructions and control are unnecessarily complicated for such a simple device. Overall good product thought.</li>
            <li> I have tried three different trimmers, and this one gets the job done quickly and effectively.  Works well in ear area too. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I wanted trimmer for nose and ear hair which is a problem for us old guys. Worked perfect for this. I am not sure how well it would work for facial hair.</li>
            <li> Ok nose clipper. Better at getting hair outside the nose than inside, I&#x27;m not sure why. Maybe the hairs inside the nose are curled away from the cutting mechanism.</li>
            <li> Wish I could find a trimmer that worked for a period of time.  This one was rated  highly and it lasted eight months.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well - used it once and did a great job.  Takes one AA battery and that&#x27;s about it!  Feels good in the hand, easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is my first experience owning an electric nose hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is lightweight and handles well.  It feels like it is well built.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to have appropriate power and sharp blades.  The trimming was easy and painless.  I was very hesitant to stick something electric with blades up my nose but it worked perfectly.  The design seems great for nose hairs.  I have done some trimming around the eyebrows and mustache.  It works but it will take some getting used to.  However, it should work fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving 4 stars right now because I want to see how long the unit and batteries last.  It could be a 5.</li>
            <li> I have both a circular type and a straight edge type cutting blade.  I find this circular type much easier to use and more effective.</li>
            <li> Just received my Panasonic personal trimmer. I have a couple different brands of the &amp;#34;other&amp;#34; style personal trimmer (not rotary a blade, but the kind that vibrate back and forth like a barber&#x27;s clippers). The Panasonic rotary trimmer does as good a job, but is SO much more comfortable. No nicks or &amp;#34;razor burns&amp;#34; with this one. Gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;ve only just received it and have only used it once. I will update that score if more use results in different information. So far I would recommend this product. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the one with the LED light... the trimmer barrel is so fat you wouldn&#x27;t be able to see anything anyway. Not worth the extra few bucks.</li>
            <li> Nice that it&#x27;s wet dry so it can be cleaned. Easy to use. Expected to get an inferior product for such a low price.</li>
            <li> This trimmed has worked well for me for many months.  It does exactly what I want it to do and trims the nose hairs well.  I&#x27;ve owned it for months and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d own such a product.  Use it for my nostrils and now for my eye brows and an occasional stubborn chin hair.  Panasonic knows how to do it.  And it stands on its own!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the third time I bought it  for my family. They are all happy with it. Good quality and result. Recommend it to anyone needs it.</li>
            <li> I love it!  No pain and really works!</li>
            <li> It just works perfect,  great for trimming my mustache and all the other facial places a razor doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I am saying this but I was totally blown away by this product.  I have used several of these kinds of trimmers but none of them were actually any good at what you bought them for.  The first time I used this trimmer I was shocked at how well it trimmed and on just 1 AA battery.  I do wish this was rechargeable but it&#x27;s not that big of a deal.</li>
            <li> Worked fine... until it didn&#x27;t. Bought it in August 2014, it quit working in February 2015.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this hair trimmer.  My previous one pulled my nose hairs and did a so so job.  This one is completely painless and works like a charm.  Gets all of the nose hairs clean as a whistle with no muss or fuss.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to replace one from another manufacturer.  The previous unit seemed to never have enough power and batteries seemed to go dead quickly.  This unit seems to have more power and doesn&#x27;t drain the batteries nearly as quickly.  Overall, it seems to be more efficient.  It&#x27;s also easy to rinse and clean.</li>
            <li> 5 stars until it broke.  Never dropped, never wet. Will buy something else more reliable.  Only 30 day return window with Amazon and Panasonic, so a total loss.</li>
            <li> The product is as advertised and works well. All in all, I&#x27;m pleased with it. I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Although this little battery operated nose trimmer seems cheap, it works. It cuts the nose hairs down easily. i bought two of them, and dropped one on the floor the first week. There was no way to fix it, so if you buy one, put it some place where it won&#x27;t fall on the floor.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a Remington trimmer that was becoming a nuisance due to frequent jamming. I love this Panasonic item. Never jams or catches hair, actually enjoyable to use, as it makes very rapid, gentle clicking noise (low and not loud) when it&#x27;s cutting, giving you audio feedback that it&#x27;s in the right spot. Alkaline battery lasts a long time, but I&#x27;d recommend a rechargeable battery to cut waste. It doesn&#x27;t trim eyebrows, like the Remington could, but I find this a minor inconvenience, considering the great job it does otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;Bonus: Trimmed hair is contained within the cutter housing, doesn&#x27;t get all over your nostrils etc., so you feel/are clean after using. Cleaning the instrument is simple, and need not be done each time it is used.</li>
            <li> Had an old Panasonic nose trimmer which after years of fine service - gave out. So. why not buy the updated product.&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer is quieter and smoother and a finer product. Trims really well. No trimmer is perfect but this one is pretty close. You might have to go over the same area a few times, but in 1-2 minutes, your nose and ears are clean. Great value for the price. Just buy it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nose trimmer and it does its intended job very well.  I had a cheaper on that I think I paid a couple dollars for from HF and it did work but nothing like this one.  This one seems like the motor is very strong in it and does not every lose power like the other one did.  This one is a wet/dry model so you can get it wet and not have to worry about it.  I don&#x27;t use it much but it is a great little tool when you need to use it.</li>
            <li> I admit it. I have nose and ear hair. I hate it.  I&#x27;ve purchased quite a few different brands and models of nose hair trimmers.  They all have a similar design and similarly, don&#x27;t cut nose and ear hair ... Until this one.  The Panasonic ER-GN30-K again has a similar design to all the other models but for some reason, this one cuts hair.  On my first use, I popped a AA battery into the unit, went into the bathroom, turned it on, stuck it up my nose and expected nothing.  But, alas, when I looked into my nostril, nicely trimmed nose hairs!!!  And it was a forest brother!  FIVE STARS on this one.  I think I&#x27;ll order another as a backup.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer.  Quiet motor, helps a lot if you have to trim a lot of hair around your ears.  No worries on cutting yourself with the blades.  Nice stainless steel covering.  Another good one from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> As described in other reviews ... sturdy build, painless &amp; effective!  All @ a reasonable price point ... you will not be disappointed!</li>
            <li> was a birthday gift and works better than any other previously tried thank you for making it affordable and the quick shipping</li>
            <li> Do exactly what it is designed to do for a great price.  It would be even better if the battery is included.</li>
            <li> Very please with performance. No tugging on hairs. Requires much less dexterity than scissors. Provides clean cuts flush with the skin.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;The best nose hair trimmer&amp;#34; is how one retailer advertises this product. And that it is, from the few I have tried. It trims nose hair without pain. It cuts well, nose as well as ear,etc. hair. It fits the hand ergonomically, comfortably.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 89 year old dad to use.  It works pretty well.  He is happy with it although it does pull the hair somewhat but I think they all do.</li>
            <li> Nothing better than my 5-year old ER-409 which I plan to get rid off soon, this one is cheaply made, that matching the cheaper price.</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer does what it purports to do.  It does a nice job of catching the hairs regardless of their length and clips them close to th surface. It also has a handy wash out feature which allows one to run water through the cutting head saving time in cleaning the devise.</li>
            <li> Love this product cause it does what is suppose to!  TRIM!!! Don&#x27;t buy the $5-6 dollar ones that will break in a few weeks, get the best for twice the price.  Panasonic also offer a 2yr. warrenty so no worries bout it breaking!  Very easy to use and runs on only one AA battery.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever seen. He loves it, easy clean up and is extremely quite.</li>
            <li> Worked as advertised for a few months. After maybe 4 months it just stopped working completely. The razor part just broke so it became completely useless. No amount of care you take with this product can keep it alive when it is just made to be as cheap as possible. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased my unit in May 2012. I love the way it trims, but after a couple of uses, it started falling apart, showing all the symptoms customers mention in the 1-star rating section. The \\&quot;rocket shaped\\&quot; part with the blades attached becomes loose and starts to bounce around. It always takes me a few minutes to get it back on just the right way in order to continue to trim. Well, today I did something different. I took a flashlight and noticed a tiny spring inside the \\&quot;rocket\\&quot; part. I removed it by using the wire of a paperclip and then put the blade part back on the unit. If you push it too far down, it won&#x27;t rotate due to the built-in \\&quot;stopper\\&quot;. However, if you place it about half way down, it will rotate just fine. So far, it&#x27;s working like a charm, no more bouncing off or around! Let&#x27;s see, how long it lasts :)</li>
            <li> I have hair every place on my head except were it should be. When I got the trimmer I tried out right away. My old one had seen better days. This trimmer worked great on the nose hairs, no pulling or anything. Than I went for my ears - again perfect. The next attack I would wage would be on the hair growing unwanted out of the tops of my ears. Again the trimmer totally did it&#x27;s job. I have no complaints. For the price I think this is a great little trimmer!</li>
            <li> This really works well for nose-hair trimming and when it comes to cleaning the cutting chamber it is almost too easy. Just turn the outer plastic ring that opens the drain and run some water through it while it is running, it&#x27;s clean in less than 10 seconds. The cover is ventilated so it will dry before the next use.</li>
            <li> I like this product but I think it is more complicated than it needs to be.  I really just needed a product that I could turn on and use.  I really did not need a wet/dry trimmer any way.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a trimmer that actually works as advertised, and although this one has received stellar reviews, in my opinion it&#x27;s a piece of junk. It does a lousy job of cutting hairs, that is unless you want to stand in front of the mirror and spend 20 minutes doing so. The second time I used it, the motor starting slowing down. I replaced the battery, but it still doesn&#x27;t work properly. I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars instead of 1 only because there seems to be nothing else on the market that works any better.</li>
            <li> Excellent product that gets the job done.  It was a snap right out of the box, and it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> This product was a great buy.  Seems to be much better made than my previous con-air.  Drop a battery in and you&#x27;re ready to go.  Granted, it&#x27;s only been used once, but it did the job quickly, efficiently and I wasn&#x27;t bleeding when I was done - So, all in all, a success.  I think it&#x27;s worth the money and a good buy.  Arrived a day before promised.</li>
            <li> i have bought many trimmers in the past and finally got something for the job. every time i used it i feel like new</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t last.  I usually trust Panasonic to make good quality electronics, but this item fell apart after only a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> This little puppy was awesome while it worked, but it burned out after three months of use. I never used it in wet conditions; just blew out the container with compressed air and kept a AA battery in it. For the same amount of money, I picked up a full-on grooming kit with addons that works much, much better than this little thing. Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> I was shopping for a new nose hair trimmer after my trimmer from The Sharper Image stopped working.  I found this Panasonic model with very good reviews but was skeptical because my Sharper Image model was 3 times more expensive when I purchased it 5 years ago.  I ordered the Panasonic anyway and have been very pleased with its performance.  I rate it better than the Sharper Image product for several reasons:  it is MUCH quieter, it has less vibration and which leads to less tickling, it is smaller in overall size and more portable, and it has better \\&quot;first pass\\&quot; hair cutting performance.  The only gripe I have is that the included cleaning brush can&#x27;t be attached to the trimmer.  It is small and could be easy to lose, so you have to keep up with it.  This is a great trimmer!</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for nose hair and ears, though I usually use it only for those annoying nose hairs. Does a great job and doesn&#x27;t hurt my sensitive nostrils.  I gave my other trimmer to my parents and bought this one. It&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> What a superb little trimmer. I&#x27;ve used it on nose hairs and eyebrows with great success. It&#x27;s easy to clean - just wash it under the tap. It comes in just two parts, the trimmer and a little brush for the occasional deep clean (hardly seems necessary), so there isn&#x27;t anything to lose and you know it&#x27;ll last you for years. It&#x27;s very light, perfectly sized for your hand, and takes just one AA battery.</li>
            <li> This product does a fantastic job of trimming unwanted hair from various areas. Easy to clean and works well for trimming.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but does a great job. First battery did not seem to last very long though. Thats the one and only minor complaint.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I found. So far has been working flawlessly for several months, same batteries and trims much closer than a previous trimmer I had.</li>
            <li> Worked decently when it would actually turn on. Now it&#x27;s inexplicably broken after about four uses. Maybe water got in where it wasn&#x27;t supposed to when I was cleaning it.</li>
            <li> Great nose hair trimmer. I&#x27;ve tried others and they just don&#x27;t cut easily. This Panasonic works !!</li>
            <li> I like this. Very good quality.</li>
            <li> I had a different Nose hair remover which was totally unsatisfactory. I really like the Panasoni machine. It is easy to clean and does the job quick and  with no fuss.</li>
            <li> This is one of those things you didn&#x27;t realize is a great quality-of-life item until you actually have it.  I tend to have longer nose hairs and have frequently picked at them for my entire life.  Took a random shot at this trimmer and it&#x27;s been amazing! I can breathe again!</li>
            <li> I like it, It works well. I just think the &amp;#34; Vortex Cleaning&amp;#34; claim is a little ridiculous. It just means you can rinse it with water.</li>
            <li> Great price, product received was as described. No issues.</li>
            <li> Fantastic. Works wonderfully and painlessly.</li>
            <li> Excellent price and works great.  Battery lasts a while, and is easy to clean.  No issues here.</li>
            <li> Great product!  This has helped me in ways my ordinary razer couldn&#x27;t. I use it for my nose, and trimming my brow and tuning up places my shaver didn&#x27;t get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very easy to clean.  Just twist the cap and take out the metal part inside, and wash that.  There&#x27;s a knob to twist to clean with water which is the option I use to clean it.  It runs on battery so it&#x27;s easy to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!  And very helpful and useful!</li>
            <li> have been using it every week since i got it. love it</li>
            <li> Bought for my dad who has a little bit of the nose and ear hair starting to come in..this knocks it out</li>
            <li> Bought this since the last thing like it pooped out. It does just what it is advertised to do...and my wife likes that so right now I couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> Gets those annoying nose and ear hairs.  Not old enough for ear hairs?  Your day is coming.  Some reviewers mentioned the battery life.  This item takes one AA battery so I would like the battery to last longer, but it works well so no issue for me.</li>
            <li> Wow.. Easy to use and does a great job just by a nose. thank you.  Panasonic makes a great  product.</li>
            <li> This is a well designed product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  I previously owned some cheap trimmer and, while it worked, it tickled like crazy when inserted into the nose.  This one does a much quicker, better cutting job and there&#x27;s no tickling.  In addition, I hit a stray eyebrow with it and it removed easily without tugging.  I expect this product to last for years, but even if it only makes it to the two year warranty, I&#x27;d be satisfied with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This trimmer gets the job done and can find its way to tight spaces.  A go-to for nose and ear trimming.  I like Panasonic vs. Wahl - the trimmer head tines are turned-in so the rotating blades can trim closer to the surface.  This replaced an older model that lasted 5 years.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected. Is not too loud. So far it has been pretty easy to clean. The switch is sturdy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this.  It works well.</li>
            <li> The clipper makes a humming sound and the tip warms but it only clips a minimum amount of hair. Almost totally ineffective!</li>
            <li> It work great...I like it...it does a great job and if it stop working...I will let anyone know</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift for my husband. He loves it. It&#x27;s easy to clean, the battery seems to last forever, and it does a nice job of trimming all those sensitive facial areas. Would recommend this to anyone and everyone. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!!</li>
            <li> Good quality and does the job for a great price.  Easy to clean and store.  I recommend this one for anyone needing one.</li>
            <li> pretty decent tool for trimming unwanted hairs</li>
            <li> Husband loves it.  Doesn&#x27;t hurt to use on ears or nose.  I think he&#x27;s actually grooming more often now that he has something that is doing such an easy and great job for him.</li>
            <li> work grate not under powered like a lot of the other ones. it doesn&#x27;t pinch like other nose hair trimmers</li>
            <li> My wife wants me to buy another one... just in case.  Easy to use and gets the hair off your ears, in your ears where ever that old age hair starts to grow next.</li>
            <li> Great gadjet.  Just what I wanted.  Easy to use and especially to clean up!</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer works well on eyebrows and nose hairs. Sharp and easy to use. Works in water as well as dry.</li>
            <li> This thing works great. If I had hair in my ears and nose this would be the device I would use to get rid of that stuff. Obviously, that&#x27;s not an issue for me but if it was I&#x27;d tell you how well it works, how small it is, that it only needs 1 AA battery, and that it cleans up in a second.</li>
            <li> This is a piece of junk. Broke after only a few uses. Not sure how they get away with selling crap like this.</li>
            <li> Works as it&#x27;s supposed to.  A lot lighter than I was expecting.  Burnt hair smell a bit strong.  But I assume that is the case with any that cuts hair inside your nose.</li>
            <li> As a guy that easily grows ear/nose hair this has been a really great. I have had no issues so far and have been using it for around a year now</li>
            <li> FINALLY! AT LONG LAST! I have been looking for a device like this that really works and this device really works! No complaints.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, portable, and I do like the cleaning feature, which is easy.  Don&#x27;t plan on using this for anything other than your nose.  Even with a new alkaline battery, the chopping power falls off fast.  Would be nice to have an optional power cord/supply feature.</li>
            <li> I wish the cutting surface were bigger or had an alternative cutting area for larger areas. all in all very nice</li>
            <li> Works great.  Very seldom if ever does it YANK a hair.</li>
            <li> Is holding up better than the previous one (don&#x27;t recall the brand), but it eats batteries.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find a solution for hair removal that was not painful or expensive and this product was the answer. it does heat up a little during use but it in no way compares to the pain from waxing.</li>
            <li> Excellent product in a minefield of bad versions of this type of thing. Best in its class as far as I&#x60;m concerned and washes under water with a special twist seal!  Easy,good value</li>
            <li> This product works great - no problem ... until you drop it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit works great, but there is a quality issue - these things should be designed to be dropped. The following is true - I kid you not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- First Unit - The first I had for a few weeks and it dropped on the floor - ONE time - and it was dead, no longer worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Second Unit - Thought the first time was an unfortunate fluke so got a second one. Dropped it ONCE on the tile. Dead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Certainly you could argue that I should not be dropping these things. But to drop it once and have it dead indicates to me that there is some sort of fragile connection inside. I will go with a different brand model moving forward.</li>
            <li> This works without pulling or tugging, very simple, very effective, not very expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might even start carving some cool new hairdos in my nostrils.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer, for a hard rough,adamant hair in my nose and ears...does the job.</li>
            <li> Does the job as advertised. Very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> My husband hated his last trimmer and we replaced it with this one. He LOVES IT! It works well, fast and lasts for a long time between trims!</li>
            <li> Does a good job with both ears and nose.  Much better to use, with better results than the Wahl model I had before.</li>
            <li> I chose this trimmer because of the favorable reviews it recieved from product testers. I like this trimmer because it cuts clean without pulling.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice for the price.</li>
            <li> my wife purchased this for me and I&#x27;m glad she did it works very well and it has very good reviews</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer for my husband for Christmas.  He had bought 2 other brands and neither did a good job of trimming.  He is so happy with his new trimmer.  It does actually work.</li>
            <li> This little item keeps unwanted hair out of many places, and travels really well. Also, has a feature to use while wet, which is pretty handy for grooming and cleaning.</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t make it a 5 star is because I don&#x27;t want to use it.  I always think of men needing this for nose trimmer but I need it because cancer meds make my nose hair grow long and wiry.  I was afraid to use it at first because my skin is so sensitive anyway, but it works great.  Does not hurt and easy to clean.  It has other uses but I don&#x27;t have sideburns or mustache, at least for now. Lol  I was surprised at how sturdy it was considering the cost.  I think it was a great investment.</li>
            <li> Great product. I got it for my husband and he loves it. This item has good price and great performance.</li>
            <li> This is a nice trimmer.  It works well and the cap and the ability to rinse it under water are nice features my old trimmer didn&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li> I resisted as long as possible, but finally admitted to myself that I needed to trim my nose hair.  This works and does a good job.  No pulling or tugging, just clean cuts.  It&#x27;s easy to rinse clean and doesn&#x27;t take up much room in the drawer.  I have also used this to trim around a beard that I have grown out for a special event.  It works really well for that too.</li>
            <li> just love it. no complaints</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through many trimmers in my day and this is by far the best and most reasonably priced. Very gentle and quiet, yet it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I had a nose hair problem. Once it started growing out of my nose, I had to do something. After about five minutes with this little thing, I can now flare my nostrils with no shame! It&#x27;s easier to breathe through my nose now, too.</li>
            <li> I use this for nose and ear hair, it trims very close without cutting or pinching. The best I have ever had, great value.</li>
            <li> The whole product is great. I anticipated paying more for decent quality but this thing delivers. It works just as described and I had no problems whatsoever. I even gave it one of those classic accidental drops upon opening and it was unscathed. That outcome doesn&#x27;t happen too often with modern products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade is sharp enough that I can&#x27;t feel any snagging or pinches, however it is on the thin side and I won&#x27;t be surprised if it wears out sooner than later. But who cares? They sell replacement blades and the whole thing only costs a little less than $13. Sure beats using those little scissors you get in dopp kits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: definite upgrade!</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband, to replace another brand.  Loves it.</li>
            <li> This was one of the least expensive models available, so it made it a little hard to accept the reviews that were so much better than other models.  I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  It really does do a great job, wet or dry.  My decades-long search for a way to take care of nose hair is finally ended.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Just need a rechargeable AA battery. Be careful that your battery is not low. If the blade is not spinning fast enough it can snag your skin if your not careful. (Yes it did happen... and yes it was painful ;P)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE*&lt;br /&gt;Stopped using it a few months after purchasing. Even with a battery with a full charge, it ripped hair out instead of trimming. Not worth it!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever used.  Be careful though:  if the battery gets low, it will pull out hair.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Perfect for grooming. Light weight but seems durable. I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> The product is not bad but for real it is a waste of money, I do not use it any more.</li>
            <li> Works like it should, Excellent price.</li>
            <li> It works okay, nothing special. I have had better trimmers in the past that were cheaper. I kind of expected more in this trimmer. The actual trimmer does not trim that well.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and pain free if you go nice and slow.  Clean-up was also quick and the fact you can disassemble the cutting head makes thorough cleaning a breeze (I&#x27;ve used some that didn&#x27;t allow this).  Add the fact that it uses plain old batteries and not built-in ones and it&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> yes, I use it on my face.  Thanks for getting my noise/ears/whatever else that needs trimming.  Does what it is supposed to do and I have no compaints.</li>
            <li> Every man needs this. Toss the scissors and get this now, you won&#x27;t regret it. Doesn&#x27;t pull or yank, works perfectly. I should have picked this up years ago.</li>
            <li> Like this nose hair trimmer.  Always wanted one.  The tip gets warm when you use it, but it will not burn you.  Very neat gadget to have.  It rinses clean.  Very cool.</li>
            <li> Not phenomenal, but it seems to work just fine.  It does the job.  I&#x27;ve owned two of these, from two different manufacturers, and they both seem to work just as well as the other.  I was hoping, based on the ratings of this item, that this would out perform my previous one.</li>
            <li> This item works very well for trimming nasal hairs.  It is easy to use and easy to clean - which is a plus!  It is relatively small and light weight.  The batteries are lasting well, up to now (one year?).  Both my husband and I use it - he uses it a lot more though.  :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why men grow hair in their ears when it falls off their head, but this little tool takes care of, at least, the ear problem.</li>
            <li> UPDATE:Recent one lasted two and a half years. Still the best, but you have to take good care of it and gently take apart,put together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this trimmer to be (by far) the easiest to use with the closest cut. The design is the key--the rounded top allows the blades to get really close and to safely and easily navigate ears and nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, i have now gone through three of these. The internal motor mechanism is really glitchy, and will sometimes just stop working. (To be clear, even when the blade head is removed, the shaft will not spin.) When this has happened, i have coaxed more life out of them by (carefully) striking against my palm (or harder surface, damn it) with the unit ON, which seems to shake away the glitch for awhile, months even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic had a model number previous to this one, which was otherwise the exact same (on the outside). That first one lasted me almost a year before stopping. I had it replaced, and the second one lasted about six months. When i returned the second one, Hammacher replaced it with a Wahl; likely because of the stated issue. Unfortunately, the Wahl (and other non-rounded head models) cut no closer than my beard trimmer. Not it.  I have also tried the thin reciprocating linear blade trimmers, but found myself chasing after each individual hair and that just didn&#x27;t cut it for me either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, i found this Panasonic newer model number on Amazon; still glitchy, still the best trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the motor glitch could and should be repaired means no more than 3 stars. However, i don&#x27;t want it discontinued, so i promise to give it 4 stars when Panasonic repairs this issue. (I would only give it 5 stars after years of use.) Until then, i will continue to return/replace these as needed.</li>
            <li> OH MY GOD!  I&#x27;ve torn-up the inside of my nostrils way more times than I care to recall.  Whoever engineered this device needs to be awarded a Nobel Peace Prize!  When I first looked at it I laughed.  I thought, how in HELL is this thing going to trim my nose hair without pulling it out.  So, with some skepticism, I went at it and it performed flawlessly without pulling one single hair.  I&#x27;m pissed I didn&#x27;t find it earlier.  If you are reading this, don&#x27;t hesitate, buy it.</li>
            <li> All the reviewers are right and you won&#x27;t go wrong using these hair clippers.  The best way to clip ear and nose hair!</li>
            <li> Nice quite and works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using it for 2 months now, no issue so far.</li>
            <li> This thing feels very solidly built. Way better than anything I have had before. Works great!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended. Great trimmer.</li>
            <li> BUYING THIS TRIMMER WAS A WASTE OF MONEY FOR ME. DOES VERY POOR JOB. GETS HOT QUICKLY. AVOID THIS TRIMMER.</li>
            <li> Actually, really good. Easy to manage and clean or change the battery. The instructions are good and simple. It does a good job.</li>
            <li> Feels great in your hand. not &#x27;plastic&#x27; light helps a lot! very happy with this trimmer. my second purchase, This one is for ME!</li>
            <li> Does the job efficiently.</li>
            <li> It trims nose hair just fine.,and those ugly ear hairs men get on their ears when they get older are gone now.</li>
            <li> Works great. Gift recipient liked it.</li>
            <li> Not enough power to be totally effective.</li>
            <li> Not something I use every day but when I do, it works very well. Trims nasal hairs, no muss, no fuss.</li>
            <li> This thing works, but you need to be careful not to be too liberal with it because it can really be aggressive on its taking hair out.</li>
            <li> 3 things make me rate this item highly&lt;br /&gt;-No pain&lt;br /&gt;-No Awkward Looks at my nose anymore&lt;br /&gt;-and because I can Breathe!</li>
            <li> Comparing this trimmer to the other three I&#x27;ve owned I would say this is by far the best.  I&#x27;ve owned this a month and use it once per week.  I have not used this product enough times to fully evaluate it but considering I paid less than $13 I can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Nose hair?  If you use this, you&#x27;ll still have it.  Well, but, I mean, less strandy-like.  Sometimes words just can&#x27;t explain the way a tool can use a surprising amount of power to slice unwanted pieces of your body off so that you don&#x27;t look ridiculous when viewed from below by a shorter person, or perhaps a really judgmental cat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh wait, guess I was wrong.  Words can explain!</li>
            <li> It works.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what I&#x27;m expecting, but this doesn&#x27;t thrill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It trims hair in places you don&#x27;t want think about think about, and it does it without nicking, so thats good. But it&#x27;s not super efficient. Maybe that&#x27;s the trade off.</li>
            <li> Way cool facial hair trimmer.  I use it to  trim nose and eye brow hair. Trims close.  Makes a confirming sound when hair is cut.  Tickles a bit.</li>
            <li> If your looking for a excellent nose trimmer than definitely get this! I don&#x27;t use it for anything else, I don&#x27;t think in my opinion that it would be a good eyebrow trimmer or moustache trimmer, in fact if you wanted to use it for anything else besides trimming your nose hair,I think it would suck. But excellent nose trimmer and easy to clean! I used Amazon Prime shipping and got it in 2 days and on time as usual. 5 outta 5 Stars!</li>
            <li> I am over 40 and I noticed that my nose hairs were growing a bit too long. I needed a way to trim them and rather than using a pair of scissors, I decided to buy this. It works perfectly. It does what it is designed to do and it also works great for those ear hairs that seem to grow long as you age.</li>
            <li> I have had several nose hair trimmers in the past that either pulled my hairs or didn&#x27;t work very well.  I gave this Panasonic a try and it performs very well!  I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of facial hair trimmers over the years, but this one is a keeper.It fits nicely in the palm of your hand and is lightweight. Best of all it trims close without nicking.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent gadget, as described in almost every review that I read before buying it. 100% satisfied so far. Works great. Delivered on-time.</li>
            <li> I bought this because over the years my nose hair has really started to grow longer for some reason.  Works well and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> What can I say? I am a woman, not a hairy nosed man, but this product is great for nasal hair and facial hair too difficult to tweeze. I cannot say more, because I don&#x27;t have ear hairs. Thank you very much and I recommend this appliance.</li>
            <li> Great item. I love it very much. It has great helpful.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would like a nose trimmer so much. Works awesome!!!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic nose and facial hair trimmer is a very nice product, It is very reliable and easy to use and care for.</li>
            <li> have about ten nose trimmers now, none worth 5 cents.  very low power no matter how many batteries i try in it.</li>
            <li> The best nose and ear hair clipper i have ever owned.  It actually cuts the hairs with one swipe and cuts them extremely closely.</li>
            <li> Very quiet  works very well !!!</li>
            <li> I bought one for my husband and one for my dad. It&#x27;s a great gift when they actually need this. And it&#x27;s not an expensive stuff. It works well and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have been fussing with small scissors for years to trim nose hairs and it always took way too much time and ever got everything. I finally bit the bullet and this thing is great! No snags and gets any hairs it touches. I can&#x27;t speak to it&#x27;s longevity as I&#x27;ve only had it about a month.</li>
            <li> Safe product. Allows for cleaning with water. Also includes a small cleaning brush.&lt;br /&gt;Takes time to trim - hence rated one star below.</li>
            <li> the best one I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I agree with the other 5-star ratings.  It really works great, doesn&#x27;t pull hair, and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The product feels a little cheap and the features feel a little gimmicky but it works so I have no complaints yet. It&#x27;s made of light plastic so it feels cheap.</li>
            <li> works as intended, happy with purchase</li>
            <li> This is a great alternative to the crappy Walgreen&#x27;s variety of nose/ear hair trimmers. You must keep it clean, else it would stop working. Don&#x27;t lose any of the small parts in the head, it is easy to do so. Overall works great.</li>
            <li> So cheap and I can&#x27;t believe how quiet and great it works. Read reviews from all over internet and they all gave super high praise for this. I Think it&#x27;s great and will buy one for my grandfather(96 yrs young)!!!</li>
            <li> My husband loves it.  It does the job and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> It does the trick!  No complaints.</li>
            <li> My husband is happy with it.  It does a good job of trimming nasal hairs.  It is one of the trimmers that he has had.</li>
            <li> This works much better than any similar trimmer I have tried. It seems well built and durable. It is still running on the original AA battery. The ability to rinse it in flowing water while it is running keeps it really clean. I have yet to need the little cleaning brush that comes with it.</li>
            <li> This is the second nose hair trimmer that I have purchased.  The first one worked but mostly by yanking the hair out of my nose.  This one actually cuts the hairs.  I&#x27;m a man and all so I don&#x27;t openly weep when my nose hairs get pulled out, but honestly, it isn&#x27;t fun.  This one, by comparison, is pain free.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I just received my trimmer and tried it tonight. Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase. These trimmers are quiet and efficient. Able to trim nose and ear hair very close with no hint of nicking the delicate skin inside. The ability to wash and rinse it after use is a great feature, considering its use. For the price, I am surprised at the quality of the build and the fact you can buy replacement parts. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
            <li> a++ Will trim again. cause English. I oft sit on my patio with a delightful summer beer and handle my ordeal and this thing is just a delight.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I keep growing hairs I don&#x27;t want. Apparently my body hates me. Panasonic&#x27;s Vortex works very easily for nose, ear, eyebrow, etc. Cleans easily too.</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and as described. I&#x27;ve spent lots of time in the past plucking nose hairs gone wild and the odd ear hairs as well, it was a delicate process and I could never seem to get them all especially the ears. This works like a dream it&#x27;s lightweight and it gets rid of those little wild buggers like a dream. I don&#x27;t know how I survived for so long without this. A few grains in the ear are the worst as it irritates and sometimes makes me feel that something is crawling in my ear, this has solved that problem. It seems well built and the battery does not seem to want to die so I gather that it&#x27;s great on battery life. If somehow it dies I will most definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> As advertised. Great little accessory.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different types of these trimmers through the years and hated them all.  This one just works quickly and easily and then cleans up and lubricates using soap and water.</li>
            <li> This works as advertised.  It is very compact and easy to pack for travel.  Also very light but powerful enough to do the job.  Wet dry is nice feature.  Great value.</li>
            <li> Worthless product; stopped working  after 4 months. I threw it away!</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research before purchasing this product and  it turned out to be a smart buy,  compact and easy to use, easy to clean</li>
            <li> I bought this on the review of others and it hasn&#x27;t disappointed.  Good battery life.  Doesn&#x27;t catch the hair like some other trimmers do.</li>
            <li> Does the job, and you can&#x27;t beat the price. Good product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He used it about every 2 weeks. It worked great for 6 months then stopped working. Disappointing. I am in the process of trying to return it to Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Very handy! Effective, easy to use and clean up is a snap. I would have given five stars if it were not for the slight tug I experience while trimming. It might be solved by higher rim or sharper blades. Otherwise a great purchase.</li>
            <li> excellent, all as expected, no complaints, overall satisfaction</li>
            <li> Love it.  Keeps everthing trimmed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well built and durable. Likely need to use this in combination but it is good on initially clearing of nose hair. Not great for precise hair trimming or in tough to reach spots.</li>
            <li> Does an awesome job for maintaining hair from nose, eyebrows, and ears.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, really love it and great price.</li>
            <li> The product was everything that I expected based on the product description.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a Panasonic nose hair trimmer since 1990 and it still works, but requires a bit of coaxing to initially get going. I saw this trimmer on sale and decided that maybe it was time to retire my old one. I was a little put off by the size, as my old nose hair trimmer is not much bigger than a 2&amp;#34; x 2&amp;#34; Post-It note pad. This new unit is about 2.5 times the height, but all is well. It works great, cuts cleanly and, even more importantly, is super easy to clean after use. It can even be cleaned under the faucet with running water, although I opted to just brush it clean with the included cleaning brush. It&#x27;s a bigger unit, sure, but am looking forward to another 15 years of service with this one!</li>
            <li> By far the best I have tried. Good balance between power and quality</li>
            <li> It works, and it works well.</li>
            <li> On time.  As expected.  Would recommend.  Would order again.</li>
            <li> As usual, Amazon delivered on time. This product seems to be working well and as advertised, although I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to rate endurance.</li>
            <li> ordered one and it wasn&#x27;t cutting the hair well, felt like it was just pulling, then amazon sent a replacement and the new one worked perfectly. i use if with a rechargable battery and works well. powerful and doesnt pull the hair.</li>
            <li> I love it....it&#x27;s simple and convenient. It is a good buy for the money. I do recommend it very much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually like these trimmers, but this one surpasses all expectations.  Does not pull the hairs; never makes me wince in pain.  Don&#x27;t even think about another nose hair trimmer....this is THE ONE!</li>
            <li> I bought one because I have messing with little nose scissors and it also works wonders or the hard-to-shake area under my nose, ears etc. I bought 2 more for my family. Uses 1 AA and simple to use.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, strong motor so it cuts hair and doesn&#x27;t tangle and pull like other products I&#x27;ve tried. The jet rinse feature is nice, good to know all that gunk is being flushed out and not becoming residue inside the blade.</li>
            <li> solid product. works as expected</li>
            <li> THIS THING IS AWESOME, YOU CAN USE IT IN THE SHOWER OR IN THE RAIN, QUALITY CONSRTUCTED, YOU WILL NOT BE MAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is something I ordered for my husband - I do not use it.  You should know more about what you are doing than to ask questions of persons who simply purchase goods.</li>
            <li> Poor quality, I dropped it and it didn&#x27;t work until I open and closed the head, but guess what, the trimmer gets hot after running for 10 second. This is because the metal blade touches the housing.  The quality is poor, be careful if you drop it, going to burn your nose!</li>
            <li> This little gadget is perfect for getting rid of that pesky nose hair, and it does it without causing pain or tickling your nose in a way that has you sneezing like 20 times.  It&#x27;s well built, easy to clean, and is a good value.  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> This is the fourth one I have owned. And the fourth one that stopped working. When they work they are great. But this one didn&#x27;t even last 2 months!!!  I read somewhere that there are a significant amount of lemons and if you get one, it will stop working within a year. I have tried others, and none of them have worked well, but I can&#x27;t afford to buy one of these every 2 months. And now it is past Amazon&#x27;s time limit to return this, so I am stuck with it. So buyer beware- maybe you will get lucky and get one that lasts. SO far, I am four for four on getting lemons.</li>
            <li> Husband likes it, thank goodness b/c he needed it!</li>
            <li> It does the job.  Recommend!!  I see I have to write 15 more words.  I turn the trimmer on, I swish out my nose hairs and life is good.  No more stranglers to worry about.</li>
            <li> Works just as I had wanted it to.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly w/ no tugging of those oh-so-sensitive hairs.  Very good value on this unit as well, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy this product. It does what it says. It&#x27;s easy to clean. There is no mess, no fuss, no pain.  I would recommend this product to men and women who want to have a clean appearance.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does a good job of trimming but just about every time I want to use it (which isn’t often) the battery is nearly or completely dead. So I have given up on it and just got a Philips Norelco rechargeable. Too bad.</li>
            <li> First of all, I&#x27;ve been seeing ads for rotary nose hair trimmers all my life and when I was young I thought - how ridiculous. How hairy can someone&#x27;s nose or ears get? Well, at 50 I am beginning to get a glimpse of why you want these things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always tried to find a little private time several times a week to yank both ear and nose bush, but as time has marched on, I began to realize I was losing the war. My barber made some light hearted cracks about how men when reaching a certain age just start sprouting the uglies. Of course, the eyebrows overgrow a little too, but that problem isn&#x27;t as bad - yet. Lucky I&#x27;ll have these trimmers around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know any other men who own a trimmer like this - the men in my family seem to just consider tufts of wayward hair coming out their head holes to enhance character or something - so I was on my own. My only personal experience trying one once - well, it was awful. Many years ago I gently raised one into a nostril where it set about yanking out every nostril hair it could grab. Very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after reading reviews and seeing this as a top seller for an affordable price, I went for it. Two days later, with some trepidation, I put it to the test. It gently and quietly went to work civilizing and youth-ifying my nose and ears. Perfect. Easy to operate, easy to clean, and totally painless. And quiet, too, which was something I hadn&#x27;t thought about but I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time, but at its extremely affordable price, I won&#x27;t mind too much if it konks out in 18 months or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, gentlemen, if you&#x27;re 50 or over I suggest you look in the mirror - really look and be honest - and if you think your situation is beyond tweezing, buy this thing. It&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Kudos to Amazon for very quick delivery :) Would buy again.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic is what&#x27;s up. I had some old piece of crap dollar store nose hair trimmer and then I ordered this bad boy due to all the reviews and its awesome. Powerful and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Might try to edge my lawn with it...</li>
            <li> Clean cutting, easy to use, easy to clean; great unit.  Bought due to online reviews and thankful I did; blows away old unit.</li>
            <li> Not to bad. Seems to do the trick.</li>
            <li> good. very comfortable and fast</li>
            <li> Great product and not loud.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly. Great price. Matches the picture/description exactly. Does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Only down side was battery not included.</li>
            <li> Never thought that I would need one of these until I took over grooming dutiies for my father.  We used several other trimmers with either limited or no success in terms of dealing with wiry eyebrows or harder than metal ear hairs.  I chose this by reading the reviews of other users and am in agreement.  This trimmer is easy to use, tackles those hard to reach/hard to trim hairs and does the job for a great price.</li>
            <li> Got this. Instantly took my scraggly and squiggly ear and nose hairs and shredded them to pieces and suddenly I look 10 years younger. Industrial strength because one of the hairs was long and gnarly and very resistant to other methods. It stood no chance against the vortex of this thing. Plus, you can hear it munching on the hairs when you use it and I like that aspect. It makes me feel like it is really getting the job done! Plus a 2 year warranty. Nobody does that. You are lucky if you get a 1 year warranty on stuff these days. The sad part is that I know I have now reached middle aged, as if the bifocals weren&#x27;t the first sign. I cannot believe I resisted this product for so long. A real problem solver and tweezing out the hairs sucks and can hurt. Get this! It&#x27;s like a zap gun, but for those nasty hairs that drive you (and your spouse) crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like thousands of other Amazon customers, I am very happy with this product. I ordered it recently when the price was $11.99 + tax. It recently went up in price due to demand created by Father&#x27;s day, but should hopefully come down again, so if you aren&#x27;t in a hurry you could wait for it to drop.</li>
            <li> I really liked it until it stopped working after a few months. I cannot get it to work at all!</li>
            <li> This product lasted me less than 6 months before it died. I think I should get a full rebate.</li>
            <li> Used a panasonic years ago and loved it. It died. Bought another brand and was not as happy. Though it worked fine, it was noisy and did pull a little. When it died (happy it did), I went back to panasonic with this model. This is quieter than the previous two I had. Does not pull, and cleans easy under water. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product it just happens to have its own personality and works only when it wants to</li>
            <li> It was great for the first 3 months (only used it occasionally during that time).  After that it was simply dead.  Avoid and get something a little more durable.</li>
            <li> Absolutely Awesome...This product has been engineered to make it perfect for what it is to be used for, quiet, heavy duty, grip makes it easy to handle and it&#x27;s easy to clean.  Shocked how low the price was for the quality.  Those looking for what this does better get it while they can.i</li>
            <li> I am not happy with this project at all. After a few seconds of use it gets too hot for my nostrils. I have to stop using it.Additionally, it&#x27;s poorly built. Pieces fell apart and I could not even properly use the part for facial hair. I guess you can&#x27;t expect much for $10.</li>
            <li> Takes a few passes and different angles but get the job done, good value. Like the size and battery seems to last.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer while it&#x27;s working. But, it stopped working after several months.</li>
            <li> Good ítem, works well</li>
            <li> Best thing i ever purchased.so easy to use and clean and it does work amazing.Now i have no worry about going with hair inside my nose.lol.Seriously,i feel disgusted seeing people who&#x27;s hair sticking out of their ears and nose in stuff.</li>
            <li> this takes a single AA battery and does it&#x27;s job perfectly. Haven&#x27;t had any problems with the unit yet.</li>
            <li> It was great until I dropped it less than a foot into the sink. Now it sounds awful and won&#x27;t cut properly. Not the usual Panasonic toughness that I&#x27;m used too.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Works for more than nose hair</li>
            <li> We really like these and have ordered a second one so everyone has their own trimmer.  For the price I feel I couldn&#x27;t have done any better.  I like the fact you can wash the trimmer.  Will purchase again if one ever breaks.</li>
            <li> Excellent! But bear in mind there is no battery light so you may not know when it&#x27;s functioning less than usual</li>
            <li> So I turned 30 and now my hair is getting out of control - including my nose hair... gross. So I needed to get that under control, my nose was going crazy and tweezers are actually way more painful than I expected! That said, this is super easy to use and a wonderful little trimmer, and all I do is rinse it quickly and it&#x27;s good to go. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Jesus, this thing gets hot! I actually lightly burnt the inside of my nostril (one side, I&#x27;m no fool) because the damn metal gets way too hot. I&#x27;ve used it once and I&#x27;m not that interested in going through that $%^# again.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Woks better than other similar devices I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Thank God, this was reasonably priced and works great. Just be careful when you clean it. It has a small part that can go down the drain.</li>
            <li> Consumes the battery very quickly</li>
            <li> The device works decently when it first arrived, however after it&#x27;s second or third use it&#x27;s barely working. The battery runs down without use, and needs to be replaced after every use. There are better products out there.</li>
            <li> This one is a lot better than my old one.  And at about half the cost too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMR</li>
            <li> My girlfriend casually told me that I have &amp;#34;old man ears&amp;#34;..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently, my lobes had begun to sprout long, unsightly hairs that I had neglected to notice until she informed me. Not wanting to put a razor to such sensitive skin, I looked for a solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device not only trims up the fine, white hairs that cover my ears, but also works for my nose and any other hard to reach place. It cleans easily and does not take up much space.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> nose hair well clipped, ear hairs trimmed&lt;br /&gt;round tip could be tapered to be more affective&lt;br /&gt;works well for the price</li>
            <li> works as promised  which is very well</li>
            <li> It was a great gift. My nephew loved it. Takes one battery. Be sure to pick up an extra just in case</li>
            <li> Great product! Lightweight! Very powerful and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> Loved this.....shaves your nose and ear....a,great feeling.....no irritations</li>
            <li> Even with a new battery it fails to cut off a lone hair, and instead gets jammed.  When I remove the top cover and the blade, it spins well and vigorously, but as soon as I put the pieces back in place it gets stuck when I try to use it.  I think the blade angle must be wrong and that it is not well designed.  I am replacing it with another brand and hope that that works properly and as advertised.</li>
            <li> My nose is now the porcelain smooth palace it was meant to be. And I must say (because this has to have 5 more words before I can submit it) that the women have been flocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CINCO ESTRELLAS!!</li>
            <li> Finally needed to replace my old Wahl ear and nose trimmer, was surprised how mediocre reviews are for most models these days. So I finally just went with the most popular. Meh. Motor is weaker than it should be, and it shouldn&#x27;t need any of the twist settings that require directions -- stop trying to pretend it&#x27;s fancy. I&#x27;m going to keep it because it ultimately gets the job done and none of the others get better reviews, but it&#x27;s not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reminds me of my beard trimmers: each time I need new one, the latest models are worse than the one before. If manufacturers would concentrate on mechanical quality over extra useless marketing settings, I&#x27;d be willing to pay much more $. You&#x27;d think with today&#x27;s trend of (faux) authenticity and history (hipsters, safety razors, old-timey beards, small batch rye, etc), some manufacturers would get that there&#x27;s a lot of $ to be made in quality construction. Alas not.</li>
            <li> This one seems to be a keeper, others we have tried were too loud and pulled hair.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is amazing. Especially for such a cheap price. I highly recommend this trimmer. Quality is superb. You won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Thank you people that create the so advanced algorithms that create search results for \\&quot;gifts for 50 year old women\\&quot;.  I&#x27;m sure THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT SHOULD BE THE SECOND!!!!! SEARCH RESULT FOR THIS QUERY!!!!!!  I&#x27;m sure my mother will be so proud to finally own this piece of s***!</li>
            <li> Has met my needs perfectly.</li>
            <li> Poorly made, weak power, woul not reccoment to any one. no goog no good no good no good no good</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it should.</li>
            <li> Excellent! all as expected..</li>
            <li> Worked great for the 3 months or so it lasted.. Replacing the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to work so it is useless. you get what you pay for I guess.</li>
            <li> Stopped working.  Used it maybe 20 times and it was always jammed up and had to soak it and shake the heck out of it to get it to come on.  Now it&#x27;s in the garbage.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a great little trimmer! And – in the age of Amazon – it&#x27;s especially good because of the price and no effort to get your hands on one. I use this for far more than my nose, and I love it. I read that you could, but that never dawned on me. I do ears, eyebrows, nose, and other precise areas of thinner hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the results. It&#x27;s small, quiet, and simple to use. Wish it was rechargeable, but it only takes a single AA battery, so I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> My old one was 15 years old and I just wanted a new one.  I am glad they were still making the same one.</li>
            <li> My nose hairs don&#x27;t know what hit em! Awesome product!</li>
            <li> This is a excellent product and works to cut my nose hair without any pulling and pain.  I&#x27;ve been using a older panasonic for over 10 years but it was hurting me and not working that right.  I didn&#x27;t know they only last 1-2 years and have to be replaced or the blades get bad.</li>
            <li> So glad I got this. It replaces an old one that has done its time.&lt;br /&gt;Very light in weight, and easy to handle. Very quiet too.&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure you have a decent battery with plenty of juice in it.&lt;br /&gt;It did the job getting rid of the werewolf hair and I don&#x27;t look like a walrus now!&lt;br /&gt;Totally recommend</li>
            <li> Works great.  Much better than the Wahl I had before.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do quickly and easily. Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> I love these! Perfect for what I need them to do, and they don&#x27;t hurt and is not dangerous.</li>
            <li> It broke after just a few weeks.  Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Several times it has not worked, and had to bang it around a bit to get it started.  Guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I owned another Panasonic trimmer previously, but lost the blade while cleaning it.  Instead of just buying another Panasonic, I tried 2 other brands that just weren&#x27;t as good and now have come back to Panasonic.  It&#x27;s not that I didn&#x27;t think Panasonic trimmers weren&#x27;t good, but I bought multi-purpose trimmers that were just mediocre nose-hair trimmers.  One of them just plain didn&#x27;t work 50% of the time.  This trimmer is inexpensive and does one thing only, but it does it VERY well.  It&#x27;s easier to clean than my previous model as well.</li>
            <li> this trimmer has the power to mow through even the toughest nose hair, wet or dry this will do the job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for a friend as a gift and the friend has informed me that after a few uses, it is no longer turning on. He has tried to replace the batteries thinking it was the lack of battery power but even with new batteries it is no longer turning on or working. This is a huge disappointment since it was a gift and had such positive reviews! Unfortunately the replacement window has expired so I can no longer exchange it. I believe it was a defective unit since it broke down so quickly.</li>
            <li> Works good. Update- purchased in January 2014, worked well up to now but it quit today. I don&#x27;t expect a $12 appliance to last forever but I thought a Panasonic would go longer. It loses one star.</li>
            <li> Small and efficient and does what is claimed...but it takes a while to adequately trim.  I have only used it dry and have yet to try it wet.</li>
            <li> Got mine three years ago. Still running as good as day one.&lt;br /&gt;Bought four other for family members as gift.</li>
            <li> So far so good. No issues at all. Thnx.</li>
            <li> great trimmer, feels sturdy and gets all the hairs easily.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer is a perfect choice for a good function and low price.&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer is very nice. I used to only have tweezing my nose hairs as an option and it was highly painful. This trimmer is fairly quiet, easy to handle, and pain free. It requires a double A battery which is not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it for a second in my ear and that was loud, I could see it making users uncomfortable. That said, I only put it in my ear to see how loud it would be and hopefully won&#x27;t need it for that functionality for some time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is unbeatable. If you are tired of pesky long nose hair, get it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer Lasted for around 8 months, after which the motor died. I used the trimmer once/twice a month only, until it stopped working. I contacted Panasonic as it was under 2 year warranty period. They asked me to ship the item at my own cost. Why would I pay $6 postage fee for an item that cost $12 ? On top of that Panasonic &#x27;guaranteed&#x27; mea &#x27;similar&#x27; item as replacement or a &#x27;refurbished&#x27; one. I figured it is better to trash the item rather than dealing with this and buy another trimmer (not panasonic ).</li>
            <li> After hating all the time you spend in front of the mirror with razor sharp scissors in your nose, I figured it was time to get a devoted nose trimmer.  I was baffled by the price of this trimmer, as it almost seems hard to believe they can make something this nice for this cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works great or nose, ear and facial hair.  I have had one occurance where it seemed to have almost yanked a hair out of my nose instead of cutting it, thus leaving me in a bit of pain.  However, it has been an isolated incident, and I&#x27;ve yet to have any other issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It runs off a single AAA battery, and one of my favorite features is the ease of cleaning.  Simply turn the blue cuff around the neck of the trimmer, run it under some water, and presto...clean as a whistle.  It&#x27;s near whisper quiet, and doesn&#x27;t seem to use my charge at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You simply can&#x27;t lose.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as high RPM as my prior Panasonic (purchased in Japan) trimmer.  Works but, just OK.  Was expecting more.</li>
            <li> Worked great in the beginning, However, at some point it started to make a grinding sound and tip started heating up. I think the springs are messed up in side. It doesn&#x27;t work nearly as well and it goes through batteries much faster. This seems to be a flaw in the design as a lot of other people are having the same problem.  I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. Go for better quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned many, it seems, Nose Hair Trimmers, over the years and this is the first one to consistently work well. It seems more powerful than the earlier ones. It has had no intermittent failures to work. It either works or it doesn&#x27;t. If it doesn&#x27;t, you change the battery and that&#x27;s it. Really good and very reasonable.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my husband and a second for our son.  Both men are very pleased with this product.  They look great too.</li>
            <li> great for ear hair, nose hair. Trimming long hairs in my beard</li>
            <li> Good value and very easy to use. Very efficient trimmer that provides trouble-free efficiency. Well-designed and performs better than expected.</li>
            <li> I use it for ears, nose and eyebrows. Works really well.</li>
            <li> Works OK.  Better than the others I tried.</li>
            <li> they sell them at sallys for a lot more expensive forget it buy here.&lt;br /&gt;use rechargeable batteries I use rayovac</li>
            <li> Works great and is pretty quiet. Great unit for the price.</li>
            <li> Does not work well... deteriorates quickly.</li>
            <li> A very good price. Working very well.  Well satisfied.</li>
            <li> Goes through batteries quickly. Does an okay job on ear and nasal hair.</li>
            <li> Gave this in my husbands stocking (how romantic) but it works great. He is happy!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work very well, painfully pulled instead of trimmed, and fell apart the second time my husband tried to use it.</li>
            <li> Did not think this product was going to be as good as it is because of how the tip was shaped.  Surpassed all my expectations.  I love it!</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re tired of having your nostrils torn up by the old fashioned type of trimmer. It&#x27;s painless and very good at what it does.</li>
            <li> I used this trimmer no more than 15 times,and for how long you can use it to trim your nose or ears? well this thing did not work as the rest of people say,for me it was another useless solution!</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband. I end up using it all the time for myself. It has a sleek looking and provides a very comfortable grip. Like it so much.</li>
            <li> I ordered this based off the many positive reviews.  While the trimming function worked fine the operation of the unit failed after only a few months.  The battery compartment seems to frequently lose connectivity with the inserted battery resulting in the trimmer failing to turn on.  Happened numerous times where I&#x27;d have to play with the battery compartment, opening and readjusting the battery and reattaching and eventually it would turn on.  Eventually the entire device went dead and it no longer is functional.  For the low price I can&#x27;t complain but it certainly did not live up to the numerous 5 star reviews.  Also, the angled design of the trimmer caused it to frequently fall over on my medicine cabinet shelf.</li>
            <li> Worked great, here&#x27;s a serious word of caution though... When it says &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t insert the trimmer past the hairs lining the outer most part of the nostril&amp;#34;... they mean it!</li>
            <li> I like the design, this is a great product.  It is small, it works well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Finally a nose clipper that does the job. No more walrus</li>
            <li> It does the job, so in that way I can&#x27;t complain - yet. Not very sturdy or powerful. Because of that, also quiet. For $8 not a bad deal.</li>
            <li> The product worked fairly well, however, after a handful of uses, it started having a delayed start (turn on the switch and it takes a couple of seconds before it turns on). Then, after owning it for less than 6 months and using it maybe a dozen times at most, it never turned on at all. We tried replacing the batteries to no avail. I contacted Panasonic who said they will replace it if I mail in the defective unit. They do not pay for return shipping so I would have to pay to get it to them. For a $12 product, it&#x27;s not worth it. I just purchased another trimmer from a different manufacturer.</li>
            <li> Researched nose trimmers extensively.  Bought this based on other reviews.  It is great!  Works very well and I have never nicked myself with it.  Easy to clean, easy to use.</li>
            <li> this little thing rocks...had one for like 3yrs and still going strong...Just purchased one for my dad</li>
            <li> I like the rinse feature after use. Have not owned long enough to comment on battery life. Product seems to trim with the best of them. Pleased with purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few weeks, now and it is better than I expected. Easy to use and super results.</li>
            <li> It was everything that I wanted and was the perfect match! It arrived quickly and surpassed all my needs. It was perfect!</li>
            <li> Wish I got this trimmer years back. It was always a pain for me to get rid of hair on my ears. Now this tool makes it a lot easier.</li>
            <li> Works very well. Easy to hold. Cuts the hair well. I haven&#x27;t used it much yet, but so far, vary happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought quite a few different nose and facial trimmers, spend far too much money over the years trying to find something that works well on these stubborn nose hairs. I&#x27;ve finally found the product that works great for me. It&#x27;s very easy to use and very easy to clean. It&#x27;s quick and easy to get ride of those pesky nose hairs in less than a minute, I can see myself buying a few more as christmas gifts for the clueless uncles and friends I know that have full on bushes growing out of their nose.</li>
            <li> I have owned several nose hair trimmers and this is my favorite so far.  It gets the job done quickly and with minimal pulling.  Also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Not quite as effective as I was hoping for, but then again it wasn&#x27;t terribly expensive. Will see how long it works.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a great and smooth one to use. It is smooth and easy to trim and reach hard areas.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because he started plucking his nose hairs in bed (you can&#x27;t make this up, folks), and after a second of seeing that, I immediately went in search to find something to remedy that problem. This product is gentle on the skin, but it gives off heat when it&#x27;s used which doesn&#x27;t feel great on my arm, where I tested it out, so I can&#x27;t imagine it feels wonderful in the nostril either. However, my husband has no complaints, and now he&#x27;s using this in bed instead of the tweezers. One problem fixed at a time, I suppose.</li>
            <li> Ok item. Does what it should. Wish it felt a little better made but it does the job.</li>
            <li> pretty cheaply made, but then again its not that expensive.. works for a little bit but then the battery part broke i believe.</li>
            <li> works great, no pain, wish I didn&#x27;t need it</li>
            <li> thank, great trimmer, just fine for me !</li>
            <li> Works well - keep groomed!</li>
            <li> This thing works great. Makes NO noise, never bites or snaps at me. I use it for my nose and ears. It works great for both applications.</li>
            <li> Like this alot. use it all the time. Does the job as stated. Battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> it sucks it pulls the hair. Its ok for nose hair but not for your face save your money and get something eles</li>
            <li> Liked it so much, I got my significant other one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value for the price and I like the ease of cleaning. Better than other units I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 of these in less than 8 months. I barely have need to use these once every 3 weeks or so.&lt;br /&gt;When I got each new - they were very effective, never pinching, relatively quiet, functioning quite well.&lt;br /&gt;The first one, I made the mistake of knocking over, from the basin edge into the basin where it landed on the silver tip. (This is not a deep basin)&lt;br /&gt;It completely stopped working, when I managed to jiggle it, to get it to run - it just made a loud noise and did not cut at all. So chalking that up to my own fault, and promising myself to be more careful, I went ahead and ordered another new one. - If you purchase a replacement tip (set), the cost is about the same as just buying a new trimmer. The warranty does not apply to the tip.&lt;br /&gt;So this time, was very careful about keeping it back from the edge of the sink. But while cleaning it (running water through it), I shook off the water (quite lightly mind you) and the tip happened to touch the ceramic basin bottom. That&#x27;s it, it now makes a noise reminiscent of a freight train (when in my ear). Though it still seems to work, the noise almost makes it most painful to use.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Tis a wondrous thing!</li>
            <li> I find this trimmer ergonomic and efficient. i have used it a few times and though i was new to this, it never hurt me</li>
            <li> My husband is pretty young. 30 years old, half italian. So he&#x27;s got the darker, mildly coarse hair to deal with. I got him this mostly to handle his nose hairs, which he wasn&#x27;t aware was just barely peeking at the world (only a wife would notice). When it arrived we took it right out and set it up and he was using it within 2 minutes. And very happy with it. He has a sensitive nose that reacts with a lot of sneezing to a lot of stuff, but this did not prompt a sinus attack as I feared.. it didn&#x27;t tickle and set off his mucus membranes either.&lt;br /&gt;He used it the next day also, to clean up a lil bit more he had missed. And my husband is NOT the kind of guy who cares about maintaining a healthy glow or the right look, so it&#x27;s pretty darn handy and easy if he&#x27;s willing to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Would purchase again, what better compliment is there than that?</li>
            <li> No complaints. It may have cut me a little bit, which was irritating for a few weeks. Other than that a solid product thus far.</li>
            <li> After getting tired of grooming unsightly hair in different methods I finally broke down and got this trimmer.  The trimmer works very well on a single AA battery.  It doesn&#x27;t make much noise at all.  There is no pain involved with trimming nose hair only a tickling that luckily hasn&#x27;t caused me to sneeze... yet.</li>
            <li> The best nose hair clippers</li>
            <li> Cheap and easy to use. Cuts much better than most nose hair trimmers you find along discount stores and drug stores(which cost more). This product is easy to clean and hasn&#x27;t broken down yet. Had it for a couple months and I&#x27;m loving it so far. I don&#x27;t expect this product to last for so long, but when it breaks down (hopefully after a year) I wouldn&#x27;t mind buying another unit.</li>
            <li> I hate nose hair aka human body barb wire. I&#x27;m glad someone finally invented a super effective weapon for the war on nasal tendrils.This thing is a close shave.</li>
            <li> I have used scissors and my regular clippers for trimming my nose hair for years - and first time I used these - I was cringing.  Just felt like I was about to get &amp;#34;zapped&amp;#34; but guess what - that never happened.  These little trimmers do a great, safe job and are highly recommended.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a bit of a gimmicky feature where you twist a ring, turn on the unit and run the tip under the water.  It supposedly helps the cleaning process.  Seems to work, but never really felt the need.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the unit works great and does what it is supposed to do...</li>
            <li> My husband loved it so much, we bought another for my father in-law!</li>
            <li> Everything as promised.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works okay.  Price is right.  It doesn&#x27;t burn through batteries.  I would probably buy a more expensive version next time.</li>
            <li> When I first received this trimmer, I liked it very much and rated it high. But after several months of use, I am very dissatisfied with it. It acts very weak like the battery is low, but even with a new battery it won&#x27;t cut hair. The blade is rubbing on the guard causing this problem.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, worked great.  Before I could use it a second time, I drooped it a few inches while cleaning and it busted.  Not very durable.</li>
            <li> It does everything it&#x27;s support to do I have nothing bad to say about it .i think it&#x27;s well made.</li>
            <li> I wish I hadn&#x27;t waited as long as I did to try a nose hair trimmer. This little trimmer is comfortable to use (minimal tugging and vibrating) and makes quick work of maintenance. As an added benefit, it is extremely easy to clean. The brush cleans the blades in seconds and an alcohol-soaked Q-Tip fits neatly into the metal guard to sanatize and clean.</li>
            <li> Happy with the price and product! I like that it&#x27;s battery operated, good size for taking with me to travel.</li>
            <li> Very please so far with this purchase! I have used it several times and it works great! It is easy to use and keep clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for 3 months now.The item trims well, however the tip is a bit bulky / wide, so if your nostrils are narrow this presents a problem. Otherwise it&#x27;s easy to use and clean. In addition, I use a rechargeable battery and the charge holds for a long period. Of course this depends  how often you use it. The grip/handle is comfortable and feels solid.</li>
            <li> Same experience as others. Low quality product. Left a lot of stubble and died after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you buy an $11 groomer you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY THIS! I read these same reviews, took the risk and bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make the same mistake. Shop around for a better one and spend a little more on your personal grooming.</li>
            <li> Hard to find a product specifically for nose hair.  Works beautifully (NO pain) and the price was great.  Easy to clean.  Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This is SOOOOOOOOO USEFUL !!!! I was afraid there would be pain but its absolutely painless !!! Don&#x27;t hesitate, try it out.</li>
            <li> Works great, fairly quiet and does not drain the batteries fast. I like that this requires no cord or plugging in since the power cords always seem to go missing when you need them. Good addition to anyone&#x27;s grooming collection.</li>
            <li> I have had many of these in the past from Panasonic, Sharper Image, etc.. but this new Panasonic is the by far the best I have ever had of this type of machine... Buy it... You will be very happy.</li>
            <li> Works fine, but some tendency to trim nasal hair a little too close, leading to ingrown hairs. Not a happy thing. Just be careful.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for obvious nose hair on myself or others.  This devices quickly and easily removes it, best method I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> Overall the tool is nice. I really like how fast it is and the multiple ways to clean the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about cleaning is the way they want you to clean it using running water really isn&#x27;t the best and leaves alot of hair behind inside the chamber. A good idea but doesn&#x27;t really work well in practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery seems to last quite awhile too. Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Essential grooming tool. Painless and efficient.  Use on a weekly basis to maintain appearance.  Consider as gift item.</li>
            <li> Quiet and works well. Much more effective than ear and nose trimmers I have tried in the past, including older Panasonic models.</li>
            <li> This thing is great! Impressively trims nose and ear hair down to the skin without any pulling whatsoever. I use it every few days and the battery life seems to be amazing. I&#x27;ve tried a few other trimmers, even more expensive ones by this same brand, and this model is by far the most effective for me.</li>
            <li> Though for $12 what do you really get anymore?  Ordered this July 2012 and it finally just died....April 2014.  Just dead.  No spark.  No nothing.  If you view this purchase as a short term throw away then rate it higher.  I guess I am a little old school and expected more.  Will probably purchase another though now that I know its useful life expectancy and cost per use is about $0.50 per month.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer and very dependable. Def reliable and I would recommend this to anyone who needed one. Lives up the advertisements.</li>
            <li> Trimmer quality was very good and trimmer was easy to wash and clean. The slight curve was excellent as it was easy for gripping.</li>
            <li> Quiet and gentle.  Works perfectly.  Keeps me from looking like a disheveled old man with a bush of nose hair coming out!</li>
            <li> After a short use of once or twice, the haircut starts to get sloppy. Very loud and nothing like the reviews I read. Waste of money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very well-made, solid in the hand and very smooth and quiet. I also like the tapered handle. Get one.</li>
            <li> Have used several models of hair removal tools and this ranks up there with the best..Prrice was very good.. Easy to clean..</li>
            <li> Not sure why but this does not work as well as I thought it would. Power is weak, sometimes winds down to barely working, even with new batteries. Easy to clean and maintain. Would not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and have only changed the batteries 3 times. The unit is very easy to clean and still quite sharp. I&#x27;ve noticed no pulling or issues with discomfort, and its very easy to clean. I like to leave the removable pieces in a glass of 91% alcohoI before I give them a scrub with an old toothbrush to keep them looking new and clean. The whole unit seems to be waterproof, although I&#x27;ve never submerged it. Cheap and effective.</li>
            <li> I have tried a number of differ trimmers, but this one does the job with out cutting or pulling the hairs.</li>
            <li> This is a great nose hair trimmer (I have only used it for that so far).  It trims nose hair very well and is easy to clean.  I upgraded from my old nose hair trimmer and the difference was dramatic.  I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Ordered in September, but by the end of November it had crapped out. No longer functioned no matter what. Amazon would only replace until October. When I called Panasonic, they wanted me to pay $11 in shipping and they *might* replacement if they deem it was a flawed unit. For a $13 trimmer, it&#x27;s not worth the $11 in shipping to &amp;#34;maybe&amp;#34; get a replacement. What a hassle. What terrible quality. I&#x27;ll purchase next time something from a brand that will stand behind their product, even if it costs more.</li>
            <li> For the price it does everything as advertised. I would recommend this product to anyone. The price from Amazon was the best I found.</li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer several times now, and have yet to have an issue.  It trims nose hair close and clean, with no pulling.  The motor runs very smooth and makes it easy to get the job done without the &amp;#34;brain vibration&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any issues yet and have been using it for months. It leaves my nose trimmed as expected and has held up just fine.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a nose hair trimmer since I have sinus allergies and am constantly sniffling. It was recommended by a friend and it works great.</li>
            <li> Waste of money - died after a month and a couple of weeks, and three uses total. And of course it worked just long enough so I can no longer get it replaced as defective, which is what this product is.</li>
            <li> very good&lt;br /&gt;I like it&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so good&lt;br /&gt;this&#x27;s a perfect gift&lt;br /&gt;my husbuand  very like it&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for some six months or more.  Still on the first battery.  No problems at all.  Based on my experience I can&#x27;t understand why anyone would prefer the manual trimmers which have similar cutting head designs.  I am very pleased with this device.</li>
            <li> Does everything it is supposed to and does it well. Excellent for nose hair and handy for facial trimming. A great product.</li>
            <li> This product broke after four or five uses spread out over two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I should have bought something a bit more expensive.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as tool to keep my appearance up.  I have been ecstatic with the unit and the only thing from keeping it rated to 5 is that it is battery operated versus a rechargeable device</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little obsessed when it comes to this type of grooming &amp; I&#x27;m happy I got this.  It&#x27;s quiet, doesn&#x27;t pull or yank any hairs and does the job effortlessly.  I also love the option to use in the shower.  But I don&#x27;t.  I do rinse it under water to make sure nothing gets clogged.  Don&#x27;t doubt this purchase!</li>
            <li> I am NOT one of the paid testers that are talked about. I bought this. It&#x27;s the 4th type of trimmer like this I have had, and I love it! It trims the places that us older guys want to trim, ears, nose, eyebrows.. and it does a great job! It cleaned VERY well with the &#x27;turbo&#x27; clean feature. Open it up, turn it on and run the water through it.. I opened it up after to check it out and NO HAIR was left inside, spotless clean! I am VERY happy with this purchase, it works better than the other 3 I have had over the years and wore out. I wish I had one like this before.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this to anyone! Very nice.</li>
            <li> I have never used a trimmer like this before, but have been pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit odd the first time using it - personally I was skittish thinking I might do something wrong and end up cutting the inside of my nose. After having used it several times however, I have had no issues, never any pain or discomfort, the vibrating sensation can be a bit odd though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device seems to clean easily and lasts a long time before needing to change batteries. I have found this device also works very well for trimming stray hairs (like the 2 or three that grow between my eyebrows). It is easy to precisely control which hairs you get and which you leave in these situations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only slight complaint is the awkward vibrating feeling when using this in more sensitive areas (the nose people!). That is likely something that is unavoidable with devices such as this, but I cant help feeling kind of weird using this. Even with this complaint, I&#x27;d still buy it again without hesitation.</li>
            <li> I had an older model Panasonic hair trimmer similar to this one. This one works a lot better. I do not have any issues with hair pulling or with the unit stalling. It is easy to operate and simple to clean. This is a must have if you are tired of pulling nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I have used this for about a year now...........works better than anything else on the market, worth the amount it cost.  One battery last a long time.</li>
            <li> As a man getting old sux, items like this become a necessity. Serves it purpose, does it well, but goes thru batteries quickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother trying any other style of trimmer. I dropped this one and bent the tip, which made it not trim anymore. So I tried another brand, and I couldn&#x27;t even get it in my nose because the tip was to big and the end was open making it a bit scary. I returned that one and bought another one of these fantastic panasonic trimmers and love it as much as the one I broke.</li>
            <li> got what I wanted. works great. quick shipment. good quality and simple to use works just like it says it does. worthy choice and investment. god bless</li>
            <li> FAST BLADE CUTS CLEANLY AND THOROUGHLY. Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer . I LIKE IT GOOD!</li>
            <li> Typical of these nose trimmers (which as I&#x27;ve moved into my 40s have become an necessity) is that they are cheaply manufactured to start out working well and work like crap--tugging dully, painfully at the larger nose hairs--after a few months. The Panasonic name doesn&#x27;t at all symbolize product excellence like it once did. (Maybe they should have stuck with music and TVs?) I don&#x27;t have any suggestions. I buy one of these pieces of s*** ever two or three months, since there isn&#x27;t a monetarily viable option for purchasing replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d like to add that this one now buzzes when fully battery charged really fast when I hold it at one angle and really slow and grinding with a sound like a rusty electric can opener when I move it around. Sound like cheap Chinese-manufactured crap? Yep, that&#x27;s exactly what this product is.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product but doesn&#x27;t give a really close shave. You can still see some stubble.</li>
            <li> Will rip out hairs and gets too hot for my liking. Weak motor.</li>
            <li> So lets not pretend that I intent to use this for other than trimming nose hair.  The packaging goes on to include eye brows, ears, &amp; mustache hair.  Ergonomically comfortable, it uses a single AA battery.  The water cleaning feature is a plus!  As to trimming, it does an excellent job cleaning up with no pulling or nicking.  It took a fraction of the time as using a scissors.</li>
            <li> Improves breathing and keeps the nose clean and I don&#x27;t know what else to say to fill the words on this sheet</li>
            <li> Bought this on February 25, 2015, and as of May 27, 2015, it is completely dead. That is a total of three months in which I barely used the item and never got it wet. My recommendation is to buy something else with better reliability.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  It&#x27;s a cruel curse to be growing hair in the place that require this product and not on my head.  The ability to wash it out is a nice addition.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this for my sweetheart, because I didn&#x27;t  like his nose &amp; ear hair.  Now, every thing is nice and trim.  He says it doesn&#x27;t pull the hair out, but cuts is fine.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my husband who has some nose hair. I read some reviews that it quit working but ours is working fine since last so many months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used it once to trim one stubborn hair from chin. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This broke after less than 6 months of use.  I feel like I barely used it so pretty bummed out that I have to pay for another one so soon.</li>
            <li> Perfect for any nose, any face, any ear... Wet/dry trimmer is what men everywhere have been hoping for.  Panasonic vortex!</li>
            <li> Solid device. If I hadn&#x27;t tried a brand I liked a bit better while on vacation in Florida in April, I would rate it five stars. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, and the value (price) if phenomenal.</li>
            <li> My husband has always wanted one of these trimmers, and this one is great. He uses it periodically to trim his nose hair and ear hair and has no complaints. It made a great stocking stuffer for him!</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it says.  Comfortable and easy to use.  Works well.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Gets hot a bit too quick imo.</li>
            <li> Only regret with this unit is I waited so long to pull the trigger and purchase it.  Sharp, QUIET, nik-free trimming in all those non-beard places.  Does a great job at a great price!</li>
            <li> Lasted 3 months, not very happy</li>
            <li> Does the job, money well spend</li>
            <li> This seemingly oversized trimmer really does work, without the pain of rusty old scissors!  In a few moments all the unwanted hair is gone; no drama, no wincing, and no holding your hands in preposterous positions.  This one&#x27;s a keeper.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> This is my third personal trimmer for nose and ear hair. The first was a Panasonic as well, but a cheaper model. This one is so nice that I would not go back to the cheaper model. It cuts without pulling.</li>
            <li> Does a great job...  Light weight, easy to clean, I would recommend this product.  Dependable and NO problems to date.</li>
            <li> Bought this so I could stop trying to pluck nose/ear hairs with tweezers because let&#x27;s be honest, that hurts. 1 AA battery and it was off to the races with this bad boy. It trimmed all my nose/ear hairs in a 1/10 the time it takes to do it with tweezers. I didn&#x27;t get nicked by it nor did I experience any of the hairs being pulled out like some of the other reviews had mentioned. After you are all done just open some cover and run this thing through some water and it will rinse itself clean. Overall I am very happy I made this purchase and if you are looking for such a device to trim those difficult areas I would suggest this one.</li>
            <li> Works well, but broke after 2 years. Still, we liked it enough to buy another.</li>
            <li> This device works really well. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Nose hairs are a thing of the past without yanking hairs (ouch!) and clogging with, ahem, goo.  Cleans up easily too!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give feedback in some thing that I used just once.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s small, and you have to purchase your own AA batteries</li>
            <li> First set of nose and hair trimmers I have ever owned, so I don&#x27;t have anything to really compare them against. They work as described and I have less nose hair for my girlfriend to complain about so they are doing their job so far. They are quiet, easily washable, powered by a single AA battery which is not included, no tugging or pulling sensation when using them.</li>
            <li> VERY QUIET. PREFORMS WELL.</li>
            <li> Works great! It was quiet and didn&#x27;t vibrate like my last one so I thought it was defective but after using it this is just a better build. Does not come with any attachments like in the pics I seen.</li>
            <li> New to trimming nose hair, so I don&#x27;t have much to compare this to.  However, it has worked just as I expected.  Tickles a little bit, but not horrible.  If anything goes wrong with it I&#x27;ll come back and edit this review.</li>
            <li> After using one for 6 years that conked out my husband needed a new one and this fits the bill.</li>
            <li> Works very well and meets all my needs</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer. It&#x27;s built well and trims cleanly. Not good for neck trimming, but it does everything else quite well.</li>
            <li> It works, but the cutting head has only a small opening, so it takes multiple passes to get everything.  Otherwise, it does function as described.</li>
            <li> I bought another manual cutter from Amazon. I thought it was good cause it was once the top seller. I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing out on until I bought this bad boy Panasonic. Panny cuts clean and clear on first attempt. No worries of cutting skin. Its a great simple product, and simple to clean too.</li>
            <li> I got tired of using my razor to cut my ear hairs and bleeding all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;I use this to trim those pesky nose hairs and the hair in my ears. No more blood!</li>
            <li> Great product, assuming it doesn&#x27;t break in a few months. Easy to clean, performs as expected, and low price.</li>
            <li> I have bought numerous nose trimmers in the past, some expensive, but was never completely satisfied with any of them.  When I received the ER-GN30 I thought it was just another trimmer like the ones I had bought in the past.  To my surprise it worked great and in half the time as my old trimmers.  And after 4-5 months it is still going strong on the same battery.  It has a strong little motor that puts out more rpms.  Although the design looks about the same as the other models there must be a slight change in the design to make it work better.  Whatever the secret is I can highly recommend this nose trimmer.  Also, it works great on the hair in my ears.  Thanks Panasonic for developing this trimmer at a very reasonable cost.  LP in Iowa</li>
            <li> When I read reviews of this product before purchasing, there was one written by a witty lady.  I have had the trimmer for about a month and think it&#x27;s perfect.  I also think the other review was perfect too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the opening lines from her review, &amp;#34;Nature has a funny way of tormenting the male species as they age. It can be referred to as the &amp;#34;migrating hair&amp;#34; phenomena. This is when hair moves from where men want it - oh, say on their head - to where they don&#x27;t really want it - say tufting out of their nose and ears. Consequently, as men age, they must groom certain areas to avoid looking like a bald Wookie.  Plucking is certainly one solution. But, watching a mature man tear up with every nose hair extracted is a pitiful site. Enter the Panasonic personal groomer. Trimming was never easier. This groomer is a powerful accessory to any mans trimming options.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Cuts well. Quiet. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I initially really liked this product, but after a few uses it was as if the razor became blunted and it went downhill from there to the point that I rarely used it anymore. About a year later, it no longer works after battery replacement. I will try a different product next.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot more than my old trimmer. Gets close without discomfort.  It also works in the water. Would only recommend using this for nose/ ear hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband as a gift, as per his request. What can I say except it works and he is happy with it. Therefore I can recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> Very good and easy to use! It is small and well manufactured. Happy with the buy. Easy to clean. I recommend it</li>
            <li> i have had several trimmers and this one is by far the best. i do wish it was rechargeable. No problem though it works great</li>
            <li> Soo nice,  easy, love it&lt;br /&gt;Very fast delivery</li>
            <li> First one failed, the send me a new one and no issues</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my hubby...it did not take long for him to put a battery in this and get it working...he love&#x27;s it...no more &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; outbursts when trying to clean his nose or ears!!! greatest little gadget!</li>
            <li> After only using this product once, seems to work well.  Ergonomically designed. I like the fact that it can be rinsed.  Seemed to tolerate the rinsing well.  I left it out on the counter to air dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to clean! I recommend this product to have in the bathroom.  Oh and the price was great also</li>
            <li> I had read some bad reviews but I think this is great! Removes the little nose hairs with no pain</li>
            <li> It works!!  It replaced one that lasted for one use, then came apart. Quality product. I would certainly buy another one.</li>
            <li> He really likes it. Thanks!</li>
            <li> It worked as expected for about 3 months and then for no apparent reason, it just died.</li>
            <li> i did it, took the plunge to proper grooming.&lt;br /&gt;now people will not look at the hairs from my nose.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s quite a distracting thing when your date keeps staring.&lt;br /&gt;i finally told her to just pull it out with her finger.&lt;br /&gt;needless to say, there was no second date.</li>
            <li> Way better than all the other cheapo imposters!  I&#x27;m a convert.  Perfect for nose and ears.  Really really cuts close but is safe.</li>
            <li> 4 stars given tge price, it works just fine but feels kinda cheap like it might break soon.  Otherwise gets the job done!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that it sometimes doesn&#x27;t start. When this happens I have to hit it a few times then it usually kicks in. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s clogged (I do clean it) or if the switch/battery contact isn&#x27;t very good, bit it&#x27;s annoying. Other than that, it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different trimmers but this beats them all hands down. Sorry I didn&#x27;t get it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Fours stars only because saying I &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; my nose hair trimmer is awkward, and diminishes my Thoreauian attitudes in other aspects of my life.  And, three stars or lower would be downright dishonest.</li>
            <li> Well the battery life is very limited.  This trimmer was bought new, I put the battery in, used it for about six minutes total. The next day when I went yo use it, battery was running too low to use it.&lt;br /&gt;The product worked very well and on the note I would recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE&lt;br /&gt;10/23/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still using it. The batteries need to be changed very often, but it&#x27;s still going!</li>
            <li> This little trimmer works great. I&#x27;ve tried a couple others over the years and this one is the best I&#x27;ve found. Does not pull hair, trims very close the rinse/clean feature is a nice touch. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Great of getting all those hairs.  As I get older the more my hair grows from places other than my head.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington one and it stopped working after about 4 yrs (I guess it died!). So, ordered this one; easy to use and seems to be working fine. Instructions are, however, another matter, resulting in the 4 star.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Only gave it 4 stars as I took it apart to clean the inside and it seemed impossible to reassemble--had to buy another and will just&lt;br /&gt;wash with antiseptic instead of trying to take it apart to clean.</li>
            <li> really convenient and make my hair clean. feel more confident and make everything look right!&lt;br /&gt;i love it love it</li>
            <li> Working for now! Need to work more with it to see how does it last! Will update if something happened!</li>
            <li> Nose hairs used to bother me.  Used to.</li>
            <li> 2ne on I&#x27;ve bought. Definitely recommend!! Will buy again...</li>
            <li> I bought this for the hairy man in my life. My husband was starting to grow a garden out of his nose and ears until we got this. He says it doesn&#x27;t pull like some other trimmers- it actually cuts.</li>
            <li> I probably only use it once a month and it only takes a minute to take care of business, but I don&#x27;t think that I have even changed the battery in the year and a half that I have had it.  It&#x27;s also easy to twist the cap on and off and clean it all out.</li>
            <li> Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. I swore it was broken for the first 3 months I had it but then just as I went to throw it away it started working again? I wouldn&#x27;t really suggest giving this a try.</li>
            <li> I use it quite often to groom myself. I don&#x27;t know how I functioned with out it. Clean.Quiet. Compact. Fits in my nose. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> I had an inexpensive Panasonic trimmer 15 years ago which was excellent and dropped it in the toilet.  Never got one that came close until I stumbled on this one.  You can hear it doing it&#x27;s job effortlessly.  This puppy will give you a crew cut for your nose/ear hairs!  Cleaning is a breeze too.</li>
            <li> I bought this to break free from trimming the nasty nostril hair with the tiny pair of scissors found in male grooming kits.  After getting past my fear of ripping sensitive nose hair out and causing an out-of-control nose bleed, I used this product and was pleasantly surprised at how well it worked.  It cleaned out all the nostril tentacles without pain!  It is also insanely easy to clean and is about as loud as a whisper.  I haven&#x27;t used it on my ears (I don&#x27;t need to) so I can&#x27;t attest to how it operates next to the ear drum, but as far as cleaning out nose hair it is awesome!  Definitely worth the money.</li>
            <li> Quiet and very efficient</li>
            <li> This works like a charm.  I suggested that my mom get my dad one for Christmas.  Cheap and useful product.</li>
            <li> Hubby likes everything about it. Accurate, neat and quiet. He feels safe using it and it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I chose this one.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is just ok. Would get more stars but it eats batteries.  I may need to bur rechargeable batteries</li>
            <li> I received my trimmer and it was easy to put the batter in and start working.  So far it works great.  For the price if it lasts a year that will be great.</li>
            <li> This trimmer trims my nose hair just fine. it doesn&#x27;t pull or yank hairs out either. its easy to clean too</li>
            <li> Not as great as people said hair still in ears blade works better just seems like antother gimmick I hate gimmicks that dont work.</li>
            <li> It works. It does what it does, and it does it well. The only reason its not five stars is when you take it apart it has little pieces you can easily drop down the sink. Not that it ever happened to me. No, not at all.</li>
            <li> This worked so good. In the nose and also it worked really good in the ears. No pinching or pulling.</li>
            <li> Very well made and easy to use. First one I ever purchased and it works great. It was just what I had expected.</li>
            <li> Love the close shave that it brings to my nose and ear hairs because of the dual blade system https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;tmT8qlWThQo</li>
            <li> Works very good on noise and ear hear. Not loud and seem to run great. Cleanup is a snap.</li>
            <li> pretty good.  first nose trimmer so I&#x27;m not sure if there is better but its better than using a blade</li>
            <li> I purchased this because I like this type over the straight blade type.  It worked great when it worked...it did not last very long.  I changed the batteries and it still does not work.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok but no big deal... no better than the older similar Panasonic device that is already 7 years old</li>
            <li> Crap. It worked for two days and then it was gone. It&#x27;s so cheap that the cost of shipping was not worth the return. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He says that he likes it OK but still&lt;br /&gt;prefers going to the barber-shop for these services.</li>
            <li> Yep, put new battery in it, but the trimmer is totally dead and cannot be returned. This is just sad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used these things before and good lord sometimes instead of cutting the hair it just pulls it.  This one doesn&#x27;t do that at all, it cuts the hair nice and smooth.  Unlike other ones you are also able to wash it and use it in the shower.  It is a great little trimmer that I recommend getting.</li>
            <li> Its been a few years and this trimmer is still going strong.  I&#x27;ve replaced the battery a few times thus far, and no issues with the device. I would purchase this product again if it needed replacing.</li>
            <li> It actually works as advertised. Great for ear &amp; nose trimming. The markings for blade &amp; battery removal&lt;br /&gt;are very hard to find, but it is well built &amp; works like a charm. I hope it will last as other reviews have indicated.</li>
            <li> The cutter is just the right size and it is easy to use and trim the hair efficiently. A helpful tool for long nose hair.</li>
            <li> Same as other reviewers- thing worked great initially, but after the first few uses I went to clean it, took the top apart to clean it and put it back together and I started getting this grinding noise from the blade. It does still work somewhat but it heats up and is loud as hell. I tried reassembling it per the instruction manual and then cleaning it but no dice... looks like a design flaw. I bought it due to the crazy number of good reviews on it but it looks like there must be a lot of either fake or just kneejerk reviews.</li>
            <li> I used this a few times and then it got harder to start.  After a few months it just stopped working altogether.</li>
            <li> Have been using ... too easy ...</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see here-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The very first thing I did when I received this trimmer and installed the battery was to insert it too hard into my nasal cavity. YOUCH... that hurt! While this electric Panasonic nose hair trimmer does a good job at cutting man-hairs from my face, it stinks as a drink blender. I wish it used two AA batteries instead of one so they would last longer and the motor wouldn&#x27;t bog down so much under heavy loads. This Panasonic is way better made and better functioning than the cheap eBay nose trimmer I was using, which only cut well in the first few uses. We&#x27;ll see what father time brings. I&#x27;ll keep ya posted.</li>
            <li> I love this and it works so good. It taks care of business and I use it all the time</li>
            <li> last one I had of these pulled the hair as it cut...these are painless becuase they do what they are intended to do.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done but the battery does not last long in this thing.  I would recommend but keep some AA batteries on hand.</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend who complained that trimming nose hairs was difficult- plus it freaked me out that he would just yank them when they poked out.. since he got this, he uses it regularly (in and out of the shower) and also trims his eyebrows (judging from his grandfather, maybe someday, his ears..lol.. ) I may get him another one to keep in his travel bag so he doesn&#x27;t have to worry about remembering it when we go out of town.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value for the price.</li>
            <li> I have tried this type of trimmer before as an attachment to other electric razor/trimmers I have used in the past. They didn&#x27;t work well, pulled hair instead of cutting it. This is smooth, quiet, and cuts the hair like it is intended to. Very satisfied with the product and Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Just purchase it. Seriously. There are no Cons with this trimmer at all. Worth the money. BUY IT. You will be happy.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts at first, Had other type/brands that were ok but this one trims great, only had a few months so far hope it is reliable. I would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nothing to write home about, but it works well enough.</li>
            <li> This is well worth the money as well!  Sharp an easy to use.  Does not pull the hair, cuts clean</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer works great.  My husband loves the tilted design and the wash out feature which allows the hair to come out easily when rinsing it out.  It also was quiet and painless, something he HAS to have in a trimmer.  We have not had it long but it seems to be durable and hopefully will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Great system, no pull or nicks, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a disappointment like most I have tried. I got about 3 uses of it and then it stopped working well. It barely works now and has to be held at strange angles to get it to work at all. When it works its barely functional and isnt effective. This is not a good purchase and I would never buy one again.</li>
            <li> love this thing! ears, nose, eye brows any where you need a small trimmer, this is the tool to use! and the cleaning feature works excellently.</li>
            <li> I have used the product and found it to be excellent. I don&#x27;t know what else to say about the product.</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Takes 1 aa battery.</li>
            <li> Although it says like you can clean it, I have been unable to figure out how.</li>
            <li> something wrong with this, and it cut my skin... probably the alignment of the blades inside went wrong that led to this.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend anywhere, and who knows, probably I might be the one who got this faulty product..</li>
            <li> I use this thing twice a week and it works great!  I recommend for any military people who stand inspections regularly or for people who just want to keep hair neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li> I honestly didn&#x27;t think this trimmer would work so well or be comfortable.  I&#x27;ve tried other electric trimmers that pulled and grabbed and obviously weren&#x27;t fun to use.  This trimmer works :)&lt;br /&gt;The price is great and amazon sent it prime ;)</li>
            <li> first one that actually worked right and is durable!</li>
            <li> This has been with me for a few years now, and works like I need it to.  Pretty straightforward - it does what it needs to do and does it well.  Easy to clean, easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Really does a great job and cuts the nose hairs without any pulling. Wife uses it also and she too likes it.</li>
            <li> finally found something that would take care of them nose hairs.</li>
            <li> With all the great reviews on this product I thought this will be the miracle I need to get away from my wife and her tweezers. Boy was I wrong.  This device mearly just trims and not very close.  I have dark hair so it can still be seem.  I guess this works for those on the go that don&#x27;t have a wife chasing them with tweezers.  If you just need a quick trim before the full work up, these are for you. But if you want to substitute one for the other that will not happen with these.</li>
            <li> These work great!  They don&#x27;t pull your hair and they have a setting to clean them under a faucet.</li>
            <li> Bought it after going through some of the reviews and I was amazed how this worked. Hassle free and works perfectly for Nose.</li>
            <li> Its works. Seems solid and not cheap plastic like others trimmers I have had.  It seems like it will last but time will tell.</li>
            <li> Ordered in May of 2014 and used very sparingly and now just over a year later the product will not turn on.  Stay away from this product.</li>
            <li> Bought this trimmer on Feb 2014 but it failed to operate in 3 months.  Usage was minimal may be once every 2 weeks.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, great battery life.</li>
            <li> this product is priced at the right level, however, its functionality could be better: not fast and sharp enough, and requires a fair amount of &amp;#34;rotation&amp;#34; inside the nostrils to cut what needs cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased a few different trimmers over the last couple of years but they&#x27;re all junk compared this one.  This product works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Nothing to write home about in terms of panache, but it does the job well it was made to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only own this trimmer for a couple days, so I&#x27;m interested in seeing how it stands up to repeated uses, consider the poor reviews regarding longevity from other confirmed owners. -1 star for what I would say is light or cheap construction.  It doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; in your hands.  Performance is very good.  Close trim and very quiet.  Cleaning feature is nice, but as others have written, I hope it doesn&#x27;t lead to the trimmer breaking.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a clipper I used for years that was a third the size of this Panasonic yet twice as good. The old one would do the job in a 5-10 seconds. This Panasonic seems to require a lot of time and moving around inside the nostril to find the cutting edge. The issue is likely due to the small cutting slots (both units have a similar head design, which is why I ordered this one).  Pity. I don&#x27;t want to return it at this point, but maybe I should. (Return something you&#x27;ve put inside your nose???)</li>
            <li> Actually this trimmer is the &amp;#34;Cadillac of trimmers&amp;#34;  (with apologies to the John Travolta movie).  It has worked as well as others I have had, BUT the difference is that it always works - unlike others I have had</li>
            <li> EASY TO USE&lt;br /&gt;EASY TO CLEAN&lt;br /&gt;GETS THE JOB DONE&lt;br /&gt;PRETTY MUCH NOT BAD AT ALL&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL WORTH EVERY PENNY</li>
            <li> This was a gift and the recipient said &amp;#34;so far so good&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> i used this about once every 2 weeks or so and it works great. After a few months it would studder and stop a need a quick take apart and put back together to keep going. By the year mark this would be very frequent making me think the battery was dead but new batteries revealed that the unit was grasping for life. Maybe my nose hairs are too boss for this?</li>
            <li> product  fits the use for removing nose and ear hair as needed. Just be careful in how you  use product&lt;br /&gt;so as not to cut either cavity.</li>
            <li> I like this product! It is very easy to use and good quality. I am still using it. Tips for new buyers: do not wash or put under the water to clean it, if you do so, then you should dry it very well and leave it open, otherwise it will smell so bad! Lol Just get a cotton swab and clean it when you need... Great product!</li>
            <li> This trimmer works good as a nose trimmer and all around face trimmer, I&#x27;ve only used it on a dry face though.</li>
            <li> Poorly made, very weak motor. I recommend you all to avoid this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;The newer one by Norelco with a different design works much better.</li>
            <li> Works great for nose and ears. Love that you can run it under the water.</li>
            <li> Most of these nose hair trimmers are cheaply made and only work minimally. I have not found a good one yet</li>
            <li> I gave these as part of my Father&#x27;s day presents to family members.&lt;br /&gt;My husband used this immendiately .  Everyone loved this product. excellent and priced reasonably!</li>
            <li> I still have not found a trimmer that works extremely well. This one does an OK job and doesn&#x27;t pinch or grab. However, the motor is very weak and takes a long time when trimming nose hair. And, even though it doesn&#x27;t pinch or grab, it tickles to point where it almost makes your eyes water. I still think there is a lot of room for improvement. How about a 1/4 HP motor? :)</li>
            <li> Work great. Just don&#x27;t let the small piece inside fall down the sink. lol Had to order two. Easier.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and wash, make your face tidy and clean.</li>
            <li> Definitely better than sticking a pair of scissors up your nose; however, on occasion takes a few pass-throughs to achieve the job.</li>
            <li> Seems much more powerful than other trimmers I&#x27;ve used with the same battery.  Nice design.  The curve is an asset.  Well made and the travel cover is very helpful.  If you need one of these, this is an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> Works as expected used twice so far. Solid build for price. I like the slight curve design it  has, much better than my previous one</li>
            <li> works great , cheap, whats not to love?  only thing is it works so good you should only cut a bit away at first, ,dont try to cut to remove every single hair the first time.  I did and having absolutely no nose hair is almost as annoying as having too much.  You sneeze more often</li>
            <li> This for its price did an amazing job. First off it doesn&#x27;t cause any pain so no plucking or anything, its very easy to clean and it does what it is intended to do with ease.</li>
            <li> Motivated by the fact that not using this trimmer will mean manual hair pulling by a fellow human, the owner of this (let&#x27;s say he is a man) uses it regularly now.  It works really well, and the cost was appropriate.</li>
            <li> Like many guys who have been lots of years breathing in and out--I&#x27;m &amp;#34;older&amp;#34;--hair is going away where I want it to stay and growing in places that I don&#x27;t want it to be. Those &amp;#34;shouldn&#x27;t be there&amp;#34; hairy spots include my nostrils and virtually everywhere around and inside my ears. I don&#x27;t want to look like a hobbit. Razors leave unsightly slice marks (and blood stains on my t-shirt). Straight clippers work in some areas but not inside my nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;This little clipper is great. It clips hair to 1/64&amp;#34; while preventing cuts in the process. One AA battery powers the sucker instead of an internal battery that dies after a year or so and isn&#x27;t replaceable. It&#x27;s blade is titanium, cleans easily with water and is replaceable. The price is unbeatable, particularly considering I paid almost this much for a manual device that didn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;Now, instead of looking like an old hobbit, I look like an old elf.</li>
            <li> Not the best quality.  Works OK, but it made pretty cheap and sounds noisy in a way that its unlikely to last very long.</li>
            <li> Received in two days with Prime shipping and was delivered by Lasership on a Sunday!  Packaging was in great shape.  Opened and read clear instructions.  Inserted a new, fully charged Eneloop AA battery.  Proceeded to trim in nose and ears as per instructions on how to turn unit on and use.  Went to it and in just a few minutes the job was finished.  Then,  &amp;#34;jet&amp;#34; washed trimmer, again, per instructions . I shook and blew out excess water and dried it with towel.  Never, in my life, and with several different trimmers over the years, have I done this little annoying trim job so fast and easy, as well as totally painlessly.  You don&#x27;t even need to use a mirror.  You can hear the cutting action.  When it&#x27;s quiet - your done.  Get one...you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
            <li> After finding my last nose hair trimmer destroyed when somebody knocked it out of the cabinet I came on Amazon and found one that is just perfect for getting them hairs that bug me. Easy to clean and easy use. This time though I&#x27;ll keep this out of the dish cabinet and in the medicine cabinet. Hopefully it won&#x27;t get destroyed.</li>
            <li> Works great. Painless and quiet. I cannot comment on longevity because I have not had it for more than a few weeks.</li>
            <li> the trimmer did not trim close enough for nose hairs - the &#x27;trimmer&#x27; part too short. it did not cut well</li>
            <li> lasted a week, doesn&#x27;t even shoot the water out the side properly its just a mess don&#x27;t bother buying it</li>
            <li> This product is right on target, has the twist head wash out. The designed is outstanding and works great&lt;br /&gt;on nose hair, cuts it just right. the cutting blade design makes the difference.&lt;br /&gt;Now would I recommend it ? the answer is YES!&lt;br /&gt;The BULLDOG</li>
            <li> As I age my hair seems to grow in my nose more than my head. My wife told me to get this and it seems to work great with no pulling of any hairs. I use to use scissors but this is much quicker and does a way better job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had it for a few days but it is so superior to a different one that I threw in the trash.  Here&#x27;s the difference.  The first one looked like cheap plastic junk from the second I saw it.  Actually, that&#x27;s what it was.  It had some attachments, a brush and a light, etc.  Oh, and it was a pretty green!  It kinda had a head like a mascara brush.  It did work okay, once.  After that the only thing that came on was the little light.  Not exactly sure what that was for anyway.  I ordered the Panasonic and it came right away.  Immediately the difference was obvious.  This one appears to be well made, does a nice job and has actually worked more than once. The only thing I would say, but I knew when I bought it, this would be nice with an eyebrow trimmer, etc.  Yes, I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> It does as good as I expected it to.  Hair is trimmed fairly close when using tool vertically and a little closer when down flat.  Noise is less than the one I had before and is really not very loud anyway.  I have experienced no hair pull; maybe those who have are moving tool too fast.  You do have be careful when taking tool apart to clean it because the blades will bend very easily.  I would recommend this item.</li>
            <li> I think it is enough for you using is very easy and also cleaning. it is worth for this prize</li>
            <li> And surprisingly, this one works much better than the last two Brookstone versions. For a much lower price AND this one is significantly quieter. I have only used for a few weeks so cannot comment on life expectancy but so far, so good.</li>
            <li> Works great and the quality of the tool is much better than others that I&#x27;ve seen.  It&#x27;s also very easy to keep which is a big plus</li>
            <li> Works great, although i have only tested it for a short period.  Good purchasing experience.  I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> well i&#x27;ve only used it once, but this is working out good. not so much a &amp;#34;facial hair trimmer&amp;#34; but great for nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Heard this was a great cutter.  Heard right.  It&#x27;s the best electric small trimmer ever.  Weighty in hand so it never feels flimsy.  Cuts beautifully, accurately with ease.  Great price, but truly can&#x27;t believe how well this works being electric.  My favorite.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my other half and it does the trick easily and painlessly.  Would buy again if need be.</li>
            <li> I like it fine.  provider did a good job.  the product does what I expected.  l;k;lkj ;lkj ;lkj ;lkj ;lkj ;lkj</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband and it really works well. I don&#x27;t think it really is meant for hair trimming other than your nose or ear as it is a little harder to trim eye brows due to the shape of the tip. I do like that you can rinse it off with water to keep it clean :) We liked it enough to buy a second one for grandpa!</li>
            <li> I got the item quickly and it was exactly as described. It&#x27;s always great getting what was advertised at a great price.</li>
            <li> Product qlty and transaction as advertised. Works fine but seems important to give a thorough cleaning of the blades assembly after each use. I would still recommend the product as a good value.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer for nose hair, doesn&#x27;t get as close as I&#x27;d like and I&#x27;m afraid to apply pressure for fear of nicks. I did get nicked once, and it was not comfortable. So I stick with light pressure and numerous repetition, and still end up with some dark stubble and a few stubborn hairs that won&#x27;t stand up where they can be cut. But it&#x27;s far better than the mechanical, twisting one that I used to use!</li>
            <li> This seems to be a powerful enough trimmer for me. I get a few snags that are very quick. It works well and I can get lots of nose hair with it. It works with ear hair also but the design is kind of awkward for me. I use it just for my nose and that what it seems most designed for.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband as a gag gift in his stocking.  He actually used it though and was pleasantly surprised.  It is fairly quiet and works great.  He even trimmed his eyebrows too.</li>
            <li> Probably should rinse this before using it otherwise it smells like oil/lubrication during first use. Other then that, it&#x27;s FANTASTIC!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DOES NOT come with the AA Battery that you need for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was insanely fast and got the product quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband was really looking forward to this device. He has been asking me for a while to buy him a trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I made my research and decided to give this one a try, since it had so many reviews.&lt;br /&gt;We also went and bought batteries especially for it. But it never worked.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m exchanging it for a new one, hopefully, it&#x27;ll work, but I have a little trust in it now!</li>
            <li> Not just for nose hair either.  I&#x27;ve used this on my ears, chest hair, nasal, eyebrows, etc.  Never clogged, easy to clean, cuts clean, does not pinch or pull the hairs.  Just an all around good clipper.</li>
            <li> This product works ok.  I thought that it would work better though.  I don&#x27;t know what other products are like, so maybe this is the best one on the market.</li>
            <li> Two hands are needed to use and clean this.  I have one.  Two hands are needed to use and clean this.  I have one.  Two hands are needed to use and clean this.  I have one.</li>
            <li> I have purchased less expensive trimmers in the past and they do not last.&lt;br /&gt;This unit is worth the few extra dollars</li>
            <li> This product does not really do a satisfactory job. Previous competitive models have done a better job of trimming. That&#x27;s all.</li>
            <li> High powered clippers,I have owned brookstone and sharper image trimmers costing $40 each.  This works every bit as well or better and costs much less!</li>
            <li> Works just as it should! Get those unsightly nose hairs and other areas out of there! Look clean and presentable again.</li>
            <li> Works great and disassembly to clean is easy.  I have purchased others before but this is the best product yet.  I would recommend to others</li>
            <li> This works great and is easy to clean. Very good price and helps keep all the pesky nose hairs away!</li>
            <li> We love this. My husband says it hurts a tiny bit but it&#x27;s way better than anything else we&#x27;ve used on his nose hairs.</li>
            <li> This works well at cutting, The battery life lasts forever. I have never cut myself in months of use. Recommended</li>
            <li> My husband likes that he can trim both his nose hair and ear hair with the same product.  He said it felt a little funny to use, but worked well.</li>
            <li> This worked very well although I have never used it in the shower or in the wet I guess it&#x27;s nice if I wanted to.</li>
            <li> This gets the nose hairs where it counts.  Love this trimmer and all of its features.  I definitely recommend this to other men who have facial hair problems.</li>
            <li> It works really good and is reliable.  Tickles, but then all of the do.  It is very well made and should last a long time.</li>
            <li> What can I say? He needed one of these. I bought it. He likes it - quick, no pain, inexpensive. Problem solved. Arrived on time and intact.</li>
            <li> I have a serious problem in those areas. It handles well and does the job quickly...before the device begins to heat up..which was the problem with others...</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 25 year old son and he loves it. He said it works great. He wanted it mainly for nose hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my fiancé and it seems like he likes it. Seemed like a really good price too.</li>

            <li> I know that most people looking for a nose trimmer care about looking their best. Well what better way to really look truly your best by trimming that disgusting nose hair sticking out of your nose! Yeah I am talking about you with that fraction of an inch nose hair sticking out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bonus! It can also trim that pesky unibrow that you have been wanting to split apart for so long but were too lazy to trim until you looked in the mirror one day and realized how bad you look with your nose hair sticking out and unibrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You deserve better and this will help you look better. Simple.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer for those pesky nose and ear hairs.  It is also waterproof in case your trimming in the shower.</li>
            <li> OK, it sort of looks like a sleek dildo at first, but it is really a quite practical and necessary grooming aide!. Especially for those of us older males who consider hairs sprouting from one&#x27;s nostrils or ears sort of gross. It is, to be sure, somewhat anxiety-inducing to use at first, as the idea of putting a little twirling razor in one&#x27;s nose sounds alarming and potentially treacherous, but it works like a dream in actuality. (You would have to recklessly jam the thing up your nose like a miniature chain saw to injure yourself !). It in fact makes a mild little bumble-beeish  sound and tickles a bit as it trims those nasty hair follicles out of your nose. (&amp;#34;Follicles&amp;#34; is surely one of the ickier words in the English language!) Whatever the case, I find this little baby indispensable. Not to mention it is fun to play around with friends who exit my bathroom asking me &amp;#34;WHAT is that strange thing in your bathroom?!&amp;#34; I tell them it is neither an instrument of pleasure nor torture, only a most practical item to get me out of hairy situations. It&#x27;s worth it to see the puzzled expression in their eyes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had my share of nose hair trimmers and this one is by far the best.  Nice ergonomics and shape, easy to use.  This is not some fake review, it&#x27;s just hard to come up with original accolades for a nose hair trimmer.  Basically, glad I got it.  I&#x27;ve had it for about 6 months and all is well.</li>
            <li> Started working intermittently just after the return policy ended. Now completely dead. It worked well when it was functional, but a shame it lasted for only a few months.</li>
            <li> It works enough said.</li>
            <li> its good not bad.. i like it. thats why i wil give 4 stare.&lt;br /&gt;hope u like too.&lt;br /&gt;thank u all.</li>
            <li> Perfect for ears and nose, just why I bought it!</li>
            <li> I have purchased nose, ear &amp; hair trimmers in the past, but this is the best model I have used. It actually gets all the hair in my ears and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It requires a AA battery to operate. There is no electric charging option on this model. It does work very well in those small spots where a trimmer cannot reach.</li>
            <li> Fits hand nicely and does the job.  Have not tried it in the shower, yet.  Good item for the money.</li>
            <li> They claim the secret is the double-edged blade. This little guy gets really close to the skin and reaches the hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> First time buyer of this type of trimmer and got it on special 9$.  As for my first week of review, without an included triple A battery, I had to use an older one I had with limited power.  With that said, it trimmed rather well.  It took longer than I would imagine of poking around to get all the hair trimmed. I don&#x27;t know how normal that would be or any other to compare it to. It does feel a bit cheap with regards to plasticy, but I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it too.  I used it dry.  You can also use this wet.  I suppose I will try wet at some point.  It doesn&#x27;t get super close, you can still feel a little fuzz.  But so far, at the price point I paid, no problems and would buy again.  I may edit this review at some point for and update down the road.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews and blogs.  Took a chance and ordered two because the price was right.  This works the best of any I ever purchased for him and he said it is easy to use and has the no hurt factor.  Great price and great product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t last long when they get wet as the blade rusts, but for the price they are great</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get carried away with it because it will grab onto any loose skin and give you a nice bloody slice.  At the $10 price point, it&#x27;s hard not to recommend this for all you unkempt men out there.</li>
            <li> It was broken after less 10 uses.</li>
            <li> I am not a person that cares much about physical appearance, but I have to admit that sometimes things go out of control and growing facial hair makes me feel I am turning into a ware wolf. Therefore I have used items like this in the past. Amongst the 3-4 similar devices I have gone through, this is the absolute best. Here is why:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- A strong brand name (Panasonic) with a high reputation of quality items.&lt;br /&gt;2- Very affordable: At the time I bought it I paid $12.5 (with free prime shipping)and this is even less than many cheap plastic toys. To me it is a real good deal&lt;br /&gt;3-Very simple but effective design: All you need is an AA battery , no cords, no adapters are needed...&lt;br /&gt;4-Does the job well. I use it to trim my ear and nose hair and it does it perfect in less than a minute with no pain.&lt;br /&gt;5- Very easy to clean. It is an electrical device but those compartments are well sealed inside. All you need is to switch it to wet mode (shown with a water tap sign) and put it under the water. It gets rid of all trimmed hair instantly.&lt;br /&gt;6- It is a good quality item that has worked great after 18 months of weekly use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I like mentioning about the negative aspects of the items I review as well. However I can not find a good one in this case. May be one thing to mention is that it comes without protective casing or bags which I can not complain for the price. Besides, it can stand upright so can be put in a bathroom cabinet easily so it is not a big deal at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final words go to the price fluctuations on amazon website... I have seen its price skyrocketed to $23+shipping since I bought it. At the time of writing the review it is only available from third party vendors and that is probably the reason behind this unfair price increase. I think it will eventually fall down to the original price of $12-13 whenever it becomes available directly through amazon. so I suggest keeping an eye on the price before ordering it.</li>
            <li> Great for grooming my hairy nose</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical, but my old Brookstone trimmer was just too bad at trimming hair, so I decided to five this one a try.  Wow, what a difference.  It works very quickly, and very well.  I actually had my wife stick her finger up my nose - this thing was that damn good.  We&#x27;re both impressed, hehe.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older and hairy where I don&#x27;t want to be.  Plus I can&#x27;t see as well close up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ram this up the snout and give it a whirl and the nose hair gets plucked into the center and your sensitive nose will get a vibration that tickles like crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update after 5 uses!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, this tickling trouble is fixed, and wow does this tool do the job.  I found out it was tickling because I was going too easy on it, worried it would dig into my skin or even worse bog down in my nose and get trapped in the hair.  Getting this caught in a bunch of nose hair has obvious drawbacks.  Big mistake being worried about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The secret to using this wonder-tool in the nose is to jam it in there  - hard - and ream it around.  You can hear the hairs make noise as they are whacked off.  Dig for the noise, and when you can&#x27;t  find any more noise doing a good 360-degree sweep of the perimeter, you are getting the job done, but good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After figuring out this secret, I could actually breathe easier, just like after porting the intake runners on a 70 Olds.  Or installing a bigger foam cone filter on a restrictive factory air intake on an e36 BMW M3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clean fresh,  feeling of being able to feet a few more cubic feet of air per minute through the nose is worth more than the price of admission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should bundle this with those one-the-nose strips that some athletes (used to??) use.  A real power-combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only suggestion is to take it apart and clean it out.  Each time.  This is not a tool that good hygiene principles allow for occasional cleaning.  But that&#x27;s my OCD coming through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are hairy where you don&#x27;t want to be -- above the neck, that is -- get it.</li>
            <li> This is a nice compact device and it works well.</li>
            <li> Great product, but I wanted to shed light on some of the issues others have had with the trimmer. Some are claiming that the device simply &amp;#34;stops working&amp;#34; after some amount of uses. I ran into the same scenario; it stopped working after I went to clean it one time. I noticed the motor would still spin without the blade in place and cap on, but wouldn&#x27;t spin with those two pieces assembled. Took it apart again and noticed a curved piece of plastic in the chamber that holds the hair that was blocking the blade from moving freely. After struggling with it for a while trying to push it out of the chamber and back into it&#x27;s slot on the side (where it looked like it should have gone), I tried installing the blade this time without putting it fully into the chamber, but resting the black plastic legs of the blade on top of this curved plastic piece, and reinstalling the cap. The product now works just fine again. As an engineer, I know an intuitive design, and this is not one of them. You must insert the blade into the cap, not the housing, before installing the cap back onto the body of the device. I hope this clears up confusion for some people who have had this problem.</li>
            <li> My husband loves it and so do I.</li>
            <li> Nice device, easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness for technology used pluck em out now no more. Im good for two weeks then need to do it again. I dont think they look thicker look about the same. First time using it, it had a metallic smell to it, also it feels real cold and naked first time after that it feels like a usual shave. Battery lasting good time now almost one year and a half.</li>
            <li> It works well enough, but the first one broke within 4 months (not because of the user - just poorly made).</li>
            <li> MUCH better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried! The cleaning features is especially nice.</li>
            <li> Its OK Ive found better in the stores for less money</li>
            <li> Decent.  Not great. Seems to run with hesitations.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so cheap, but don&#x27;t let that fool you. This thing is great for trimming those unruly hairs.</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer works well for both my wife and myself.  Neither of us has managed to cut ourselves with it, and we now both have nice hairless nostrils!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One warning, when my wife used it she giggled historically for the entire use because of the vibrations tickling her brain!  ;)</li>
            <li> Works as described, doesn&#x27;t hurt to use, can easily be cleaned.</li>
            <li> works well, haven&#x27;t tried it in wet conditions but I mainly use it for nose hairs. I was concerned about the blade, it was a tough sell believing that it wouldn&#x27;t nick me, so I shoved it as far up my nose as possible just to test it out - I didn&#x27;t get cut and even though you feel a slight tug when it cuts, it doesn&#x27;t painfully pluck. I also ended up with a nose with no nose-hairs, spent a week sneezing - so be conservative in your trimming. My only real complaint is bits of hair it can leave in your nostril - I think their is a model with a vacuum on it, but it will cost you more for that feature. Yeah, people are going to stare at you wondering why you&#x27;re shoving what looks and sounds like a vibe up your nose - but honestly, it&#x27;s just as cheap as a pair of decent blunt nose scissors and it quells the masochist desire in me to painfully pluck those distracting hairs.</li>
            <li> Best buy I&#x27;ve ever made for grooming. Goodbye cuticle scissors and goodbye manual rotary clippers. This device works very well and is very solidly built. For the money, you can&#x27;t go wrong. Just ignore the other comments about cheap plastic; they are wrong.</li>
            <li> Works great. Keep it clean.</li>
            <li> This is absolutely the best ear trimmer.  I didn&#x27;t want hairs coming out of my nose looking like an old man.  In less than one minute I can clean out my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> It is more powerful and does a pretty good job on nose and OK on ears. Just have to be patient and go over are 1-3 times</li>
            <li> Stopped working well after a few months.</li>
            <li> I had to replace my current trimmer as the blades were worn out.  I have tried several units and most just don&#x27;t perform that well.  That&#x27;s not the story with this unit.  It is the best trimmer I have every purchased.  I even bought  a backup in case this one gets phased out.</li>
            <li> I use this for my crazy nose hair and it works perfectly.  My wife is not so scared of my nose anymore. lol</li>
            <li> I have had a full beard for a very long time and I can say without doubt this is the &amp;#34;Best&amp;#34; battery operated Nose and Ear trimmer I have ever used! Over the years I have gone through a lot of trimmers, they typically don&#x27;t last too many years. This Panasonic trimmer cuts very easily and very short. It is a breeze to clean and it has made the job of trimming easier and faster! I am very pleased with this product and certainly look at Panasonic trimming products through new eyes now. I can recommend this trimmer if you want a battery powered one. Very Excellent Trimmer!</li>
            <li> Does not trim all of the hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;stopped working despite a new battery. A review of the internet reveals&lt;br /&gt;this is a common problem and related to poor quality control.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised...at great price-point!</li>
            <li> Yes, I agree with most of the reviews--it&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer for the money.  But there&#x27;s a catch.  See, Panasonic says to replace the head on their nose-and-ear trimmers (i.e., the top part which houses the blade and can screw off) every 3 years.  Ok, fine, you say--only they don&#x27;t sell replacements!  (Or at least if they do, I didn&#x27;t make it past page 10 of their site&#x27;s ridiculous 100+ pages of search results to find it.)  Other sites sell replacement heads, but they generally cost more than even the fancy ER430 vacuum-model (which, thankfully, uses the same head as this one, so at least I can cannabilize this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, lesson learned:  If you ever DROP a Panny trimmer on anything harder than a giant pile of Charmin, you might as well throw it away.  You probably bent the metal part at the top ever so slightly, and that will make the blade rattle, and you will never be able to align it again, and you will never find replacement blades at a fair price.  Boo...</li>
            <li> This is a good tool.  It works extremely well, but it will also cut the inside of your nose if you&#x27;re not very careful.  This has an actual blade that spins around, not a little wire, so if you happen to push it into your skin a little too hard by accident, that blade will slice you open with ease.  I&#x27;ve cut myself twice in 4 uses....so half the time I use it, I end up cutting myself........not very good.  If they could make it safer, then I would give it 5 stars but anything that can cut you that easy, can&#x27;t get more than 1 star, although it does work very well when it&#x27;s not slicing me open.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, safe, and work very good. You can use it in nose or ear canal, don&#x27;t worry, it will trim everything you want.</li>
            <li> This unit is very easy to use and is very portable when traveling. However,  the speed varies a lot and is very slow at times. Rotating the battery helps to speed it up again a times.</li>
            <li> This seems like a good trimmer.  Especially considering the price.</li>
            <li> bought a ton of these for father&#x27;s day at church.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to use and is pretty quiet to boot.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to drain the battery too quickly.</li>
            <li> Works well while the blade lasts.  But replacement blades are not made available by Panasonic.</li>
            <li> While rather inexpensive, didn&#x27;t expect it would last less than 2 years under light use.  Rarely used, never under wet conditions, and cleaned after each use.  It just stopped working.  Then again, glad it didn&#x27;t cost much.</li>
            <li> Have purchased many different types of Nose trimmers over the years and finest be the most satisfying for this purchase</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Performs the same as my first Panasonic noise/ear remover purchased  in 2000.........still sold and a few dollars cheaper/simpler straight design. Both models not only remove hair similarly, but battery life is the same, despite the claimed superior specs of the ER GN30K model.</li>
            <li> Never really cut well inside nostril trimmer.  Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.  ONLY cut the longer hairs near the front of your nose.  Replaced with a superior nose hair trimmer I also go on Amazon.  See my review of it.</li>
            <li> Intermittently stops working and then you have to fiddle with it to get it going again. When it does work, it&#x27;s a great unit</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a while now.. and I love it. I have tried a few others in the past but nothing comes close. Highly recommended !!!</li>
            <li> Despite getting quite warm after 60 seconds of use, this is a great deal for what it does. Removes hair fairly well after a few quick passes. I will not be going back to manual trimmers.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. Cuts nice and it&#x27;s small and light and pretty quite. Very effective and affordable. I recommend</li>
            <li> You could have steel wire growing out your nose and this would take care of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, it works very well. Very easy to take apart and clean.</li>
            <li> Has worked as advertised. Very easy and comfortable to use.  Much better than the old cheap one I had. Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Does its job but make sure to use fresh batteries. When battery runs low, thick nose hair can (sort of) jam the cutter and cause some discomfort.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer.  Just what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> This is my new favorite trimmer.  My old one was more expensive and used a rechargeable internal battery. It finally would not hold a charge.  This uses a replaceable battery so I won&#x27;t have that problem.  It does an excellent job trimming, too.</li>
            <li> I have had these now for some time and use them regularly and they work just as advertised. It is easy to clean for it has a knob you rotate to wash out with tap water. I highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> Works great, can&#x27;t even feel it while you&#x27;re using it. Looks very sleek also, and cleans very easily. Small too so takes up no room.</li>
            <li> For my first trimmer I find this very easy to use. I like that it handles both wet and dry environments</li>
            <li> It fits the purpose. But the idea that I have to use a certain amount of words in my review is stupid.</li>
            <li> I love this clipper... easy to use and clean. Doesn&#x27;t pull the hair like others I have tried. This seems to cut it without the &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34; I get from other trimmers. A must have for the well groomed man. Nothing worse then long nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer because of its excellent reviews, but unfortunately, I can&#x27;t recommend it based on my own experiences.  The trimmer worked great right out of the box -- it operates quickly, efficiently, and surprisingly silently.  There&#x27;s no pain when the hair is cut, and it was easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the blade on mine stopped cutting after about 4 1/2 months.  I contacted customer service, and I was offered a replacement part at a cost that was more than what I spent on the trimmer itself.  After consulting the other reviews, I would bet that the problem wasn&#x27;t actually the blade -- those are expected to last for a few years -- but rather the motor wearing out (due to the failure of internal springs that operate the blades).  However, even though the trimmer is under warranty, I&#x27;m not willing to spent the cost of shipping (which is more than half of the cost of the trimmer itself) to find out whether my hunch is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is basically a disposable product.  I wouldn&#x27;t mind having one on-hand to stuff into a travel bag in case of emergencies, but I&#x27;d never want to pay for another one.  I&#x27;ll be upgrading to a different brand next time.</li>
            <li> this trimmer MISSES more than it trims. The hair has to be RIGHT on in order for it to be cut. My advice- do NOT buy one</li>
            <li> Easy to use, no muss, no fuss and extremely easy to clean and maintain.  I highly recommend this given its cost.</li>
            <li> No complaints, does it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Does the job! Very easy and safe to use. I&#x27;m not concerned about cutting my nose when using it.</li>
            <li> Very convenient and effective.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> it works well until now. comfortable to hold</li>
            <li> A sad fact of being well over 40 is that you find hair growing in places that you didn&#x27;t have a problem with in your 20s or 30s.  I don&#x27;t know what evolutionary benefit that hair growing out of my ears or nose might have once had for my ancestors, but those days are long over.  Thankfully, this Panasonic device makes quick work of this evolutionary dead-end.  Battery life, so far, has been several months.  It&#x27;s good for both the occasional prune and, when necessary, massive deforestation.  Definitely recommended for those of us who have follicles where we don&#x27;t want them.</li>
            <li> I purchased a MicroTouch Max a long time ago from one of those infomercials and it didn&#x27;t last long at all but it was good for the time I used it.  It seemed no matter how new a batter I put in it the motor was weak UNTIL I found this on Amazon and took a dive.  So far, it has a decent motor and does a good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish was it has another attachment to trim other hair besides just nose hair.</li>
            <li> Worked great, for 2 months then broke..... Another cheap product from China....</li>
            <li> I have tried many many nose trimmers over the years but nothing comes close to this one. This is an amazingly good trimmer. It does not make much noise and trims close and true. No need to make multiple passes over the same areas hoping that the trimmer will get those pesky hairs eventually -- this trimmers needs just a single pass. And the price is quite low for such a stand out product. Rarely have I been more pleased with a purchase.</li>
            <li> What a great grooming tool, easy to clean, batteries last and last and a great feel.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and does not pull hair like other models. Plus the price is competitive. All in all the search for a nose and ear hair trimmer should start and stop here.</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to maintain.  It also stands up so it takes up less space sitting in the medicine cabinet.</li>
            <li> These things are fairly generic, but the thing that always breaks is the cutter blade and housing.  The Panasonic device is a big step ahead in allowing you to purchase replacement a cutter blade and housing without buying a complete new unit.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Works great on unwanted nose hair.  Does not pull hair out, its nice and sharp.</li>
            <li> Died within 1 month of ownership during which I used it about 4 times.  Seemed to work well until it quit entirely.  Probably just a lemon, but I can&#x27;t recommend this product.    UPDATE: I sent my original product back to Panasonic (at my own expense) for a warranty replacement. The replacement worked for about 3 weeks - I used it no more than twice - and has now also died entirely. It&#x27;s bizarre - other than the two times I briefly used it, the product has sat dormant in a bathroom drawer. The strangest thing is the inside of the product (i.e., around the battery compartment) now has a fishy odor.      Bottom line: will never buy another product from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> IT WORKS, BUT NOT THE BEST</li>
            <li> It broke after a few uses</li>
            <li> This works great so far however wish it had a little more power.  I do like how it does not pull and doesn&#x27;t leave me crying for momma by the time I&#x27;m done trimming the amazon rain forest from my nose...</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband who seems to like it. Works great.</li>
            <li> Got this for my dad for his birthday and he loves it! He says it works really well and has had no issues with it so far. He has had it about 7 months now.</li>
            <li> I can now trim my nose hairs without dying of pain. The cleaning is very easy too.</li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and it provides a comfortable trim.  It&#x27;s pretty quiet and easy to clean too.  Best nose trimmer I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Saved my marriage.. Lol</li>
            <li> Works great....keep in car...use when nose itches..laws against texting and driving..but ok to use nose hair remover..</li>
            <li> Nice.  Works as expected.  Easy to insert battery.  Comes with cover for tip.</li>
            <li> Over 1000 review can&#x27;t be wrong. It is powerful and well made. Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Seems like it worked a few times , then not so much after that. hard to clean. A scissors is still doing a better jobs.</li>
            <li> Sturdy and easy to use.  Got this for my husband - he really likes this one.</li>
            <li> Works great and I like the design of this because it allows you to use water to flush out cut hair.</li>
            <li> Part of me hates this product. Not because it works poorly or broke fast, but mostly because I have to admit that I&#x27;m old enough to need a nose hair trimmer. Once I got past that rude awakening, I saw the product as the great little device it is. Look, it&#x27;s made of plastic and uses a somewhat underpowered battery, but what do you want for less money than a movie ticket? When it comes to cutting hairs in your nose and ears, this thing kicks ass. The blade does a good job of cutting through hairs without snagging. You can hear the motor bog down a bit but it recovers fast. The blades are close enough to the foil to get the hairs nice and short without catching the skin inside your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not crazy about the cleaning function, as it honestly doesn&#x27;t work too well, and I considered dropping the review to five stars as a result, but for the price I can&#x27;t bring myself to. I just twist open the top and rinse out the blades that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There may be better trimmers with better construction and more power, but I honestly wouldn&#x27;t pay an additional penny for them, because this one does everything I want it to. Also, when the day comes that it eventually breaks, I won&#x27;t hesitate to buy another at the amazingly low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy with confidence, this is one of those products you can save money on without sacrificing anything. If you have any questions, please ask in the comments. Cheers!</li>
            <li> This unit is head and shoulders better than the cheep ones that come in kits. I&#x27;ve used it about 6 times and have had no problems with the blade set up. It trims very well both my nose hair and my ear hairs. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Bought it for my dad and he really liked it. Not much else I can say about it since I never used it.</li>
            <li> This product worked great for about 1.5 years before it conked out.  I just purchased another off of Amazon for around $10.00.</li>
            <li> Nice piece, works very well...</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s unruly nose and eat hairs has been my biggest pet peeve. Needless to say, since receiving this the same day we ordered it, I have had no complaints. As it turns out, he wasn&#x27;t just bring lazy; rather it was incompetent devices prior to his one.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I had one designed for women and it did a good job but this is much better!</li>
            <li> Not sure what to say but it works, it doesn&#x27;t hurt using it and I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this.  He had a cheaper model that I purchased at a drug store - not worth it because it fell apart in no time.  This Panasonic works much better and the cost was affordable.  Recommend this one!!</li>
            <li> before i got this this, i use small scissors. it was dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;but this one is easy and safe, and easy to clean</li>
            <li> I had a very old hair trimmer that worked not so well, so decided to buy a new one. SO far I am satisfied with this product. The noise level is low and it cuts neatly and smoothly without any tugs. I don&#x27;t have any negative thing about this product and I hope it last as long as I expect.</li>
            <li> I got this for my fiance for Christmas because he really needed one and he has no complaints so far!</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer at a great price. It&#x27;s perfect for nose and ear hair and trimming some stray hairs here and there. It&#x27;s small, quiet, and very easy to clean. You can also clean it under running water and I find that great for washing out small hairs. Not sure where they came up with the wet/dry in the product label since I imagine that it would only be used dry but can be cleaned wet. I also can&#x27;t see myself using it for eyebrows. All in all I think it&#x27;s a great buy</li>
            <li> This trimmer is OK - and not anything more.  For the money it does what it should but certainly nothing more.  It can grab and pull hairs and it can do that little annoying game where that one giant hair just seems to jump out of the way, no matter what you do (I think this is due to the wide bars on the guard around the cutters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to not go too long before new batteries are needed and I can&#x27;t comment on durability yet as I have not owned it long enough.  I really don&#x27;t think there is what I would call the cream of the crop in nose hair trimmers so maybe this one is better to people with more experience using other brands.  I have only used a couple in the last decade and this one is no better and no worse than those.</li>
            <li> I was dubious of this product.  So often in the past similar products were a letdown.  This device, however, delivered as promised.  I was amazed!</li>
            <li> Good product. No problems so far after many months of use.</li>
            <li> No problems! cuts nose hair really good. Would recommend to any one with lots of nose hair to keep trimmed!</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Panasonic trimmer. It trims more closely than the ones I purchased years ago and is painless. I like that it can be washed. I would only use it for nose and ear hair. I am not sure why they are calling it a facial hair trimmer. I haven&#x27;t owned it long enough to comment on the battery life.</li>
            <li> This is an elegant way to trim nasal and ear hair.  I use it every week and it never snags, only tickles.  It is also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Best nose and ear hair clipper I&#x27;ve ever used.  The top and blades are removable and easy to clean.  Powerful cutting action means fewer passes are necessary than with other clippers I&#x27;ve used.  I recommend this clipper over any other.</li>
            <li> Panasonic&#x27;s Vortex Trimmer is a joy to use, and effective in what it is intended to do.  The cleaning instructions and methodology are less than clear, and certainly more complex than most of us expected.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great!  And it never pulls on your nose hairs or skin.  Highly recommended.  A good buy overall.</li>
            <li> Product is working fine. No issues after 3 uses</li>
            <li> Check this out everyone. Hammacher Schlemmer is listing this exact trimmer as being the \\&quot;best\\&quot; and then after wiping off the Panasonic label, they&#x27;re jacking up the price to $19.95  - not sure if amazon lets me list links, so if not, simply go on their website and you&#x27;ll see for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> Just like ones that I have previously used.  Nothing like familiarity to make a product liked.  I tried to get along without one of these things, but scissors just don&#x27;t do the trick!</li>
            <li> Really like this item.  Cuts nasal hairs nicely and doesn&#x27;t hurt to use this product.  You can even wash the cavity to keep it clean/free from germs.  Would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose trimmer I have used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero pain, it never pulls and it takes a min to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Perfect size, design, operation, and price.  BUY ONE!</li>
            <li> I broke an older model after dropping it to many times. This one does the job just fine like the other one did.</li>
            <li> I LOOOOOOOOOOVVVVVE it so much. You know what?&lt;br /&gt;When I use it for cutting my nosie hair, it makes me laughing. This thing might tickle, but feels divine.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great for nose and ear hair.  It performs just as I expected, does the job without pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent device!  Trims the entire nose, unlike nose trimmers of a different design.  Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this is a great trimmer.  I have had others that don&#x27;t work, but this one is great and for a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It works good.  It can do what it is supposed to do.  It cuts hair deep and cuts side hair when you properly position.</li>
            <li> It does well what it suppose to do...  Note it is battery operated.  It uses AA battery which is not included</li>
            <li> I recently had the need to replace my nose hair trimmer after 16 years of use. I shopped for a new one quite a bit. I ended up purchasing this item approx two months ago. So far, so good. Seems to be an excellent value.</li>
            <li> Everything is what I expected and it does it&#x27;s job. The single battery doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as something requiring two batteries but, I keep batteries around anyway.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s okay... but doesn&#x27;t cut the hairs as well as other units i have owned, including some past panasonic units.</li>
            <li> I purchased this rotary model Panasonic Nose hair trimmer concerned that this style of trimmer might cause me pain...NOPE!  This machine works as advertised!  Impressed and glad I purchased!</li>
            <li> I have been through a lot of nose trimmers.  Most have pulled the hair, causing pain.  This is by far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve owned and if this one dies, will buy another just like it.  Keep up the good work Panasonic, you have a winner.</li>
            <li> works well, easy to use.</li>
            <li> it hurts when this thing is wet...</li>
            <li> FANTASTIC!!! Finally, a unit that doesn&#x27;t rip the hairs out by their roots. It is very tickly when you use it for the first time but, it&#x27;s a joy to use.</li>
            <li> My BF love it! it does his nose, ear and the places it&#x27;s hard to reach through razor. great product.</li>
            <li> Used it about 3 times so far and very satisfied. The motor is very strong. The product seems durable and solid. I had the Wahl but the battery connection was not consistent so I had to jiggle it many times to get it to work. When it finally did the motor was not strong despite using a new battery. I recommend the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Bought for the hubby and he loves it. Does a great job and doesn&#x27;t pull. Quick and easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> I like that this trimmer is washable without having to take it apart.  It&#x27;s very powerful which means less nose hair getting caught *ouch.</li>
            <li> Stopped working the first time I used it - changed battery - still didn&#x27;t work.  I never take the trouble to return things so it&#x27;s probably going into the trash.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is much gentler on the inside of my nose than my last one and very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This device goes downhill very fast. I used it for about 9 months and it just died completely, under very normal use. I&#x27;d suspect that the majority of reviews here are from folks who&#x27;ve only had it for a few weeks - and I would have probably given it 5 stars at that time as well.</li>
            <li> It is the best nose, etc. hair trimmer that I had ever used. Cuts cleanly and never pulls. The delivery of the product was also prompt.</li>
            <li> One of the best trimmers for ear and nose hairs I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As one get old, hair does one of two things . . . one, it leaves en-mass from your head, and two, it starts growing like weeds out of facial orifices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m long past caring about my looks, but hair coming out of one&#x27;s ears and nose is something that, left unchecked, will make it difficult to swim, sky-dive, and can, in extreme cases, interfere with eating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the ER-GN30-K Vortex. It&#x27;s a saviour, I tell you.  Were I a swimmer, I would improve my lap time by 0.003 seconds.  If I sky-dived I would be more streamlined, and I can tell you that while I was not quite at the point of my nose and ear hair interfering with my meals, I do eat a little better knowing I am not threatened by hair growing willy-nilly all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and get a jump on future problems . . . trim that hair!</li>
            <li> Every man needs this one. It takes years off a mans looks when he has a clean nose with out all the nasty hair showing,  Uck.  It only takes a few seconds----  a must have believe me.</li>
            <li> Danger - if you use it to trim your private parts it will slice and dice you like a tomato!</li>
            <li> Seems to work pretty well.  It also appears to be easy to clean.  The device itself calls for a specialized AA battery, but I was able to get it to work with a regular Duracell.  I hope that doesn&#x27;t cut the life of it.</li>
            <li> It worked very well and it continues to work. Most nose trimmers are crap(walmart/costco) but this one gets the hair in my nose without pulling it out. Had it for 6 months or so without issue.</li>
            <li> good product, good service</li>
            <li> One of the many fun things about getting older, you start to lose hair on top of your head and it start to grow faster out your nose and ears. My barber would often trim the hairs with scissors, now I can keep up with the little buggers, not boogers, on my own. Quiet and easy to clean, love it.</li>
            <li> small parts to manipulate to &#x27;center&#x27; and seat when cleaning the device are the only challenges. Great for the price. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> love this nose trimming these are the best</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband - he uses it often and says it &#x27;gets the job done&#x27;.  It&#x27;s easy to use, no complaints from him!</li>
            <li> I bought this several months back.  I use it at least once every 1-2 weeks just on my nasal passages.  It appears to be decently built and is easy to clean.  I&#x27;m running some Energizer Ultimate Lithiums.  My only minus, in my experience, was I nicked the inside of my nasal passage unexpectedly on two occasions.  So be careful.  This particular unit can in fact nick you if you&#x27;re pushing the unit&#x27;s rotary blades too hard against the upper corners of your nasal passage.  It could be just my fault...but then again, maybe not because I&#x27;ve had a Conair nasal trimmer that I used for almost 10yrs and I never nicked my nasal passage even once with that unit.  This is my reason to minus one star.  My Conair had to be retired only due to the metal spring contact, for the AA battery, corroding and breaking off as a result.  I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement battery cover for my Conair online which also explains my purchase of this Panasonic unit.  So overall, this Panasonic unit is working fine for me, but I&#x27;m just much more careful now when I use it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a girl and I bought this to groom my brows. Works great. Because of how the read of the trimmer looks, it doesn&#x27;t appear like anything&#x27;s being trimmed. But you can feel it working (not at all painfully though) and it does the trick. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product while using it. The delivery was fast and everything was working great till a month ago, it decided not to switch on. I tried changing the battery and cleaned it. Nothing worked. I got this product about 5 months ago and now it&#x27;s just collecting dust coz it doesn&#x27;t work anymore. Felt like such a waste of money. I got it because of all the great reviews but i&#x27;m left very disappointed. I so wanted to like this product but it should last more than 5 months. I&#x27;m not trimming a monkey, it&#x27;s just little bits of nose and facial hair.</li>
            <li> Works well and then stops. I&#x27;ve gone through 4 of these, after a few months they stop working, I finally switched to another brand and have been very happy.</li>
            <li> My new Panasonic nose and facial hair trimmer works great.  The battery replacement is easy and efficient, and the trimmer is&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean by holding it under a running faucet.  Great!</li>
            <li> This just works.. It creeped me out a little bit after I cut all the hair away and could see clear up my nose all the way to parts i didn&#x27;t wanna see. This things really works. I&#x27;ve tried several others and they sucked.</li>
            <li> When will someone make one that works like it should.&lt;br /&gt;I would gladly pay twice what I did for this for one that works better.&lt;br /&gt;This works but just bairly and battery life is short.&lt;br /&gt;Just slightly better that a manual powered one.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer died.  It was the green and grey Panasonic one and was terrible for most things.  When I tried to trim the nose hairs, I had to hold them in place for it to cut through them which was awkward and took for ever.  This one, you just stick up there and it zaps everything quickly and easily.  The only thing it doesn&#x27;t do better than the old one is get stray neck hairs as well.  It can get them, but takes a few times passing through where as the old one was immediate and covered a wider area per attempt.  reduced to 4 starts because it just quit with no warning, not a battery issue.  Will increase the rating if I can get it to work.  Lasted about 15 months.  Only trouble was getting the most elusive nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my partner and he said the trimmer is perfect and have done well for him!  It trims his nose and ear hairs  very well with no problems.  He recommends this product for anyone especially someone who has a lot of hair in his nose and ears.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after seeing so many positive reviews.  But at first use, my tears started rolling down uncontrollably because instead of cutting my nose hairs, this little device was yanking and pulling on the hair instead.  I had to stop and hold the device still with one hand to keep the hair relaxed and to seek a pair of scissors with the other.  It was such relief after the single hair was cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this device is either not sharp enough or it doesn&#x27;t have enough cutting power.  My wife tried it and it had the same effect on her --- rolling tears.  The battery is brand new.  The tip was dissembled and re-assembled several times but the result was no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will not use the device again!</li>
            <li> I used to be a crude repulsive hairy man with few social skills. I lived off the kindness of strangers &amp; the scraps of society... why? Well my ears for one thing, I mean ... 2 things. Hair started growing out of them one day &amp; it has never stopped! Then the nostrils! Why I asked, why?&lt;br /&gt;I still don&#x27;t know the answers to a lot of things in this life but this here Panasonic hair trimmer has been a good first step in my comeback: clean, bare, downy earlobes &amp; the nostrils of a George Clooney in a close-up. You betcha I&#x27;m feeling good &amp; ready for anything now. Girls one at a time please!&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer cuts &amp; doesn&#x27;t pull on the follicles. There also a slight curve to the unit, why settle for a straight one?&lt;br /&gt;And of course it has a Vortex Cleaning System... a Vortex!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
            <li> My only  complaint is battery operated and when the battery is low the spinning is slow and catches the hair at times,  Pther than that is great</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. I tried it out to see for myself. It&#x27;s a little intimidating at first, but it works quickly with no pulling and no pain.</li>
            <li> The middle name of this product should be value, because that is what you get. It doesn&#x27;t really trim eyebrow or facial hair like they say, but who cares? This is a nose and ear trimmer, and it excels. The price for the quality makes this a worthwhile buy. The wirecutter rated this their top pick for a nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> There’s a trade-off involved with this trimmer. My previous trimmer, which broke, had a straight blade with a comb-like blade guard, which left exposed nose hair stubble and irritated tender skin inside my nostrils. This trimmer, with its rotating blade and circular guard, doesn’t irritate, and leaves no visible hair remnants inside my nose. My nostrils haven’t looked this good since before I started growing facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the round surface makes this trimmer sketchier for edging my mustache. I had difficulty making it travel a straight line along my upper lip, and accidentally cut a notch over my philtrum, which will have to grow back out. Methinks I’ll have to go back to maintaining my mustache with a razor and the little scissors, which is a pain in the kiester, but at least works right, consistently, the first time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer’s curved design and rubberized grip make it easy to use, and the narrow, rounded head reaches into nostrils with minimum irritation. (I’ve been fortunate enough to avoid ear hair so far, so I can’t speak to that. Yet.) The Panasonic people apparently designed this device with ergonomic principles in mind. I appreciate both the ease of use, and the clean, professional look it gives my admittedly hairy nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On balance, I prefer this trimmer over my last one. As much as I liked how that one simplified mustache gardening, it left my nose tender, inflamed, and unacceptably hairy. With this one, my face looks spit-shined and ready for anything. Men interested in looking upwardly mobile and competent should seriously consider this well-designed, effective trimmer to keep natural hair in check.</li>
            <li> I thought these were only for men, but I gave it a shot anyway, and it works wonders when you&#x27;re in a pinch. When you are short of time or in a rush, use it! When you don&#x27;t have time to clean up eyebrows, or bleach your top lip, this does the job in a very small amount of time. Anywhere you have hair on your face, this I&#x27;ll take care of it for you. I highly recommend this for women AND men!</li>
            <li> Purchased this one after seeing all the good reviews. After a couple months of sporadic use, the inner blade started grinding against the inside of the protective cap.  After contacting Panasonic support to see about getting it fixed, I was told the replacement blade would cost 13 dollars.....I paid 12 for the entire product.  I might have given it 2 stars but I didn&#x27;t think it trimmed hairs very well anyway.  Cannot recommend to others.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Provides a good trim with no pain.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Dies after 4 uses.&lt;br /&gt;- Never turns on again.&lt;br /&gt;- Unable to trim after 4 uses.</li>
            <li> Works great work or dry!! Battery life is great as well!! Just a good item that has proven itself very reliable.</li>
            <li> Very effective and practical device.  Drainage port comes in handy for cleaning.  Does very well on ears and nose for this hirsute old man.  Balanced too for a longer device than my old one.  Highly recommend this Panasonic.  But, experience has shown, handle the unit gingerly.  I happened to reach for it the other day, while looking the other way, and, fumbled it causing it to hit the tile floor, head first.  Turns out, in my stupidity, and, carelessness, I managed to bend a couple of the teeth on the housing into the way of the blade.  A number of attempts failed to straighten out the blade guards (but, then again, I&#x27;m not really a handy guy).  When I called up the manufacturers&#x27; parts department to order another head, they wanted as much for the replacement head as I paid for the unit.  I passed.  I found out, fortunately for me, that the Wahl beard trimmer that I had ordered actually came with a nose/ear hair trimmer accessory.  Lucky me.  It works fine, but, is still substantially heavier than the Panasonic.  Wish I&#x27;d been more careful.</li>
            <li> I ordered one of these not really sure it would do the job. Tried it today on ears and nose and was pleasantly surprised. It did a good job in both areas with no discomfort. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Best nose trimmer I&#x27;ve used. Careful when taking the bottom off to put t he battery in. I think that some people who said it was DOA manhandled it.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband. It works fine. He doesn&#x27;t use it often, so don&#x27;t know how it would do if you had too. But all in all good purchase</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, I wondered about the performance of such a light small device.  It works very well-the first trimmer I&#x27;ve seen that does!  Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t that he hasn&#x27;t tried a few but this is the only one that actually does the job he desires in nose. And ears.</li>
            <li> I use this couple of times a month and have been using it for almost 2 years. It works well and i still haven&#x27;t had the need to replace the battery (battery was not included). I do take extra care while cleaning that water doesn&#x27;t enter the battery case (not sure if it will, just being cautious). It&#x27;s easy to clean and does it&#x27;s job well.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby.  He said he likes them better than the last one I bought that lasted for several years.  They cut good and he likes the wet &amp; dry option as well.</li>
            <li> I looked all over the web and decided on this Panasonic shaver based on the price and its power source.  I originally really wanted an electric nose shaver just in case the battery ever went dead I could at least continue to use the product as long as I could plug it in like my old face shavers.  However, with all the new battery technology and companies making products that consumers will have to continuously replace I decided that the best replacement would be this one as you can load your own batteries in it (just make sure to take your battery out of the product when not in use as to prolong the life of the battery and to reduce corrosion so that the product lasts as long as possible.  I looked at a lot of different models and this one even works when wet (so for shower shaving), and it truly does the job.  It cuts the hair painlessly close and is very easy to clean.  I highly recommend this product as it feels durable and it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> It tickles if you start it before you insert it into you nose. Insert it then start it. It still causes a little discomfort but it works&lt;br /&gt;extremely well. Five star item.</li>
            <li> This works very well especially for the price.  I do miss getting the giggles with my husband over his flyaway nostril hairs.  When he first showed this to me, I was worried he had bought something from sharper image or a store of that sort and spent $$.  So, I am really happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Just ordered and opened.  It is so cheap.  Head falls off when trying to use it.  Cannot get the blades to operate.</li>
            <li> Had this for awhile now and it is still working as good as the day I first got it. (Changed out batteries a time or two of course). Anyway, I&#x27;ve never used it with water and just use if the the nose but it is pretty painless. Definitely worth the purchase.</li>
            <li> For years men have been willing to show off their Nose Hair Anemones.  The pain involved in taming the snot-beasts is just too much for our delicate sensitives to handle.  The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer helps pull men one more step up the evolutionary ladder by painlessly chopping up our unruly sniffer tentacles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And for those who think that manscaping the facial caverns might squelch your BroPowers, ask yourselves what could be more manly than sticking a power-tool up your nose?  Nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this, slay your Nostril Symbiote, and stop smelling your own boogers.</li>
            <li> My first one just wore out after 7 years.  One doesn&#x27;t sharpen the little blades inside.  The next brand just didn&#x27;t trim worth a darn.  Reading the other reviews on-line convinced me to buy this one.  I have used it for several months now and work great right out of the box.</li>
            <li> A little cheap feeling.&lt;br /&gt;We shall see if it holds up over time.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t hurt a bit! Light and nice shape</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for the price.  My boyfriend wanted one and we found this. Shipped quickly and have had no problems.</li>
            <li> I had kids and got grey hair. At some point in time I started to need a weed whacker for my nose and ear hair at only 38!&lt;br /&gt;I may age gracefully, but I have a [personal Jihad against nose and ear hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this and it works great. The clipper guards make it safe and you can&#x27;t cut too close. It rinses well, and the ergonomics at the handle actually make this easy to use at odd angles. It&#x27;s not fancy, but works great.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s face it guys, as you get older more hair crops up where it isn&#x27;t wanted.  This trimmer works well in both nose and ears and is easy to clean and not too noisy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a quiet, efficient cutter.  So quiet, in fact, that you wonder if it is strong enough.  It only uses one AA battery, The switch has failed to turn on the trimmer once or twice but repeated trials have succeeded.  I just wonder how durable it is going to prove.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to use and does the job.  Haven&#x27;t tried it on brows yet but sure it will work fine.</li>
            <li> Much better than the crap I&#x27;ve purchased previously at the drug store.  This trimmer is well built and works fine!</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband...used it straight away and it works like a charm. removed hair clean and smoothly. i did it for him and i was not gentle at all and he said it felt great. so happy with this purchase. I like his nose and ears perfectly groomed and this worked perfect for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband so he could stop using scissors.  He says it works really well but cleaning it isn&#x27;t very user-friendly since they suggest taking the top portion apart to dry.  Overall, it was a purchase that I&#x27;d make again.</li>
            <li> The day my five year old charge told me I have fuzz in my ears was the day I decided I needed a new tool for my collection. Works great and no more fuzz! You gotta do what ya gotta do.</li>
            <li> This one of the better nose/ear hair trimmers that I have used.  It is powerful, and does not tug the hair.  I really like that it has a built in drain so that you can clean it easily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried out a few different trimmers before this one that just didn&#x27;t do the job. The engineering and design are great. It gets every stray hair and I love being able to wash it out for obvious reasons.</li>
            <li> this is so easy to use, works just perfect, and fast result, i cant ask for better, good stuff. also the battery last a long time</li>
            <li> Just purchased this, but I really like it. The best feature is that you can wash the blades to clean them.</li>
            <li> I see a lot of people have had good results with this trimmer but if you look you&#x27;ll see quite a few that have had issue with it quitting on them after a short time.  I ignored those reviews because it was a top selling item and had tons of 5 star reviews.  Unfortunately I am one of them that got a bad unit.  Unit just quit working.  It has a short in it because if you tap it against your palm and it will sometimes start working again.  I am not a stickler, I know some electronics are going to be bad out of the millions that are produced.  But I was kind of annoyed that it isn&#x27;t even a year old and I have to pay to ship it back myself, no prepaid label provided by Panasonic.  It worked quite well when it did work, was very happy with it.  Just disappointed that Panasonic didn&#x27;t stand behind their product (I just bought it less than 4 months ago) and provide a prepaid shipping label so I didn&#x27;t have to deal with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Went ahead and paid 3-4 dollars to ship it to Panasonic, figured I might as well since a new one of any brand would cost more than that and I really liked it when it did work.  Took about two months to get the replacement back from Panasonic and guess what?  Yep, it worked a few times and is now dead (it was brand new in retail packaging).  While I was waiting for this one to get back I bought a cheapo China no-name brand trimmer for under $4 shipped and it&#x27;s still working.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband.  It works as expected.  It worked so well, I ordered one for my dad : )</li>
            <li> This one really works, unlike so many others that look identical, but do nothing.</li>
            <li> These are good trimmers so I&#x27;m glad I have them but they use up the battery too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy them again because I do not use them very often. If you use this sort of item very frequently the battery usage is a consideration.</li>
            <li> You get what you pay for, this is my second one and they break after a few uses. The blades on the inside get loose and end up breaking. I wont buy this brand again!</li>
            <li> Good product. I wish I knew this before</li>
            <li> Excellent product, works well.</li>
            <li> Does the job very well, I like it so far!</li>
            <li> arrghhh&lt;br /&gt;first off, the way this was described (at least the way I read it) it was designed for use in the shower (waterproof)... not so.&lt;br /&gt;Second off, the blades aren&#x27;t sharp enough and instead of cutting the forest in my nose, it pulled out the trees.... ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the drawing board to find something that works and is relatively painless.</li>
            <li> broke in a few weeks.  sorry i bought it.  it broke just days beyond the limited 30 day return policy.  don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Delivered perfectly.  Works great</li>
            <li> Tried this for 18 months.  Works poorly, not very effective.  Does not pinch or hurt, but doesn&#x27;t do the single job it was made to do.  Disappointed in it.  Can&#x27;t recommend this model.</li>
            <li> Just what it says.. Tried many types but finally got the one that does the job</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic a few years back that I loved.  I dropped it and broke it, and replaced it with the Remington.  The Remington was a complete disappointment and seemed really dull.  I could spend several minutes just trying to get one hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally relented and bought this.  Wish I had not wasted so much time with the Remington. This thing is perfect, and will take only seconds to clean up the nose, ears, and eye brows.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for cleaning out the hair in my nose. I have tried using it about 3 or 4 times and I have gotten the same result each and every time. It doesn&#x27;t work....unless you have so much nose hair that it is hanging two inches out of your nose. This is a bad purchase....back to small scissors I will go</li>
            <li> Very nice.  Good balance, lightweight, easy on batteries . . . must have to maintain professional appearance.</li>
            <li> works great on nose hairs. Pubic... lets just say ouch. No more tickly nose hair.</li>
            <li> Works well, good value, and convenient</li>
            <li> Excellent with the money!</li>
            <li> This thing works good</li>
            <li> This works pretty well. Great on ear hair. Decent on nose hair but doesn&#x27;t get everything. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair and doesn&#x27;t snag. Battery life is descent. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Mid life crisis. No Porsche for me, but no more unsightly ear and nose hair. Perfect !</li>
            <li> This is my third one.  It works great for trimming hairs in the nose and ear.  However, motors do not last more than about a year with occasional use.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  No issues.  I will always own one!</li>
            <li> Seems to work well and have a decent battery life.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer on a whim, and I love it. It painlessly removes hair from sensitive areas such as the ears and nose. Additionally cleanup is a breeze, you just run water through it and no worries.</li>
            <li> It seems that the only complaint people have with this product is the build quality - so it&#x27;s hit or miss.  If the trimmer works, it&#x27;s great!  Mine just pooped out after 3 uses...  I would not recommend this trimmer as a result.  Based on the average of the comments it seems you have a 1 in 10 or 2 in 10 chance of getting a poorly built trimmer.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the risk, but that&#x27;s up to you.</li>
            <li> Works quite well. Does what it is intended to do. I am satisfied&lt;br /&gt;Francis</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for my nose. Details. eewwww&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Privacy please. hahahaha</li>
            <li> Ranked as the top...it is okay...</li>
            <li> The best one works Great thanks</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and works well.</li>
            <li> gets the job done. does what it says. cant be the price. easy to clean. small and easy to carry around for travel</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of my wayward nose hair. I&#x27;m giving it three stars because it doesn&#x27;t have a lot of power. Also, the battery which was supposed to last ran out after about three uses. It does do the job. If you are expecting something more powerful look elsewhere. But if you want something affordable that will take care of your nose and ears...go for it!  Update - I&#x27;ve had this product for a year now and it still works. The price has just dropped and I may just get another one.</li>
            <li> It worked one time!  It&#x27;s just not worth the cost of the item plus shipping!  I just got to Walmart or Target &amp; pick-up another trimmer!!</li>
            <li> Light weight and easy to handle. Does what it&#x27;s supposto, works great.</li>
            <li> Usually these types of trimmers yank a few hairs bringing a tear or two to my eyes. This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve had that did not. I did get some gentle pulling at times, but no yanking. That alone is makes it worth twice the price. Good job Panasonic.</li>
            <li> A real disappointment.  We purchased this as a replacement for the Panasonic trimmer we loved.  The new one is slow and dull. I can&#x27;t imagine why they would change a winner, but it must involve money.</li>
            <li> Worked ok for first month or so. Then it just stopped cutting hair. I think something fell out of the cutting end...maybe the cutter or part of it. I just know with new batteries, it still didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> Nose hair trimmers are everywhere.  I admit that I purchased this &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; remover because it was a Panasonic, not just an &amp;#34;As Seen on TV&amp;#34;.  Mostly, I wanted something that wouldn&#x27;t cut my nose.  This trimmer has worked just fine for a number of years and seems easy on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, and a minor one at that, is that it tends to &amp;#34;fall over&amp;#34; on your counter.  Of course, more discrete users wouldn&#x27;t have it on their bathroom counters at all.  I really don&#x27;t have to use it that much, so, I could just leave it in a drawer along with my other old age toys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m not good at cleaning things, so I was happy that I didn&#x27;t have to clean it very often.  You can also use it to trim your eyebrows, but I have to pluck those that grow between my eyes.  Couldn&#x27;t our Cro-Magnon ancestors have figured out that just because you have eyebrows, they don&#x27;t have to grow together?  But, thanks to my Cro-Magnon buddies for me being alive!</li>
            <li> Still works but doesn&#x27;t get the longer hairs well. Good design and appears well built.</li>
            <li> exceeded my expectations</li>
            <li> Best nose trimmer we&#x27;ve owned so far, and this is the fourth one.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer.  No pulling, quick, quiet. Works great.  Would recommend and buy again, if needed.</li>
            <li> This is one of the trimmers that does close trimming. The original Panasonics provided a close trim but then there was a generation or two that left to much stubble. I oft wondered why they screwed that up, perhaps the trim was too close for some. However, that generation left everyone bidding for the older versions on Ebay. But no more. With this version we once again have a trimmer that cuts the whole hair right down to the skin level. And it&#x27;s cheap, no bidding on Ebay.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Gets in the areas where a razor can not go!</li>
            <li> This product is a HUGE time saver and works so much better than using scissors.  Just stick it in your nose and twirl it around a few times and you are done.  Cleaning the trimmer is pretty easy as well.  As a warning, make sure you have new batteries, using old ones can tug on the nose hairs rather than cutting them.</li>
            <li> I used this for my nose and ears and it worked great.</li>
            <li> My husband  live it .</li>
            <li> A gift... assume he liked it... having heard no complaints.</li>
            <li> Have bought two, each failed within a few months.  They sat on a shelf and were used lightly every two weeks.  Sorry, failure!  At least they&#x27;re cheap.</li>
            <li> Got this as a Cyber Monday stocking stuffer for my husband. He laughed and said he had a nose trimmer already. I told him this one has all the bells and whistles. He didn&#x27;t open it until July when his old one broke, and he&#x27;s been kicking himself for not opening it sooner because it really is a nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> Does what it should. Great product. Cuts hairs without pulling.</li>
            <li> An outstanding product.  Works as advertised.  Cuts nose hairs with absolutely no pain.  Contrast that with this piece of rubbish sold on Amazon.com:&lt;br /&gt;Groom Mate Platinum XL PLUS - Nose Hair Trimmer -w/Leather Pouch &amp; Brush - Lifetime Warranty - Made in the USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet, easy to clean, great!</li>
            <li> Very quiet and comfortable to hold when using..&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t pinch skin and cuts hair close to skin.&lt;br /&gt;Very strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> It is better than the 30 something dollars worth of hair remover. I just hope it keeps working. I have been using it since more than two months now.</li>
            <li> I have had the trimmer for a while now and it&#x27;s excellent. It&#x27;s much more convenient to use it instead of scissors or having to wait for waxing. It&#x27;s a great way for women on the go to stay well groomed without spending too much time. Also love that it&#x27;s waterproof.</li>
            <li> Worked fine 3 or 4 times, then NADA!  Changed batteries, NADA!  Don&#x27;t wast your money.  Though it did not cost much to begin with, it only worked a few months - using it only once or twice a month at most.  I noticed, when changing the battery, that it had an odd metallic smell along with a greasy black film on the battery - New Duracell Battery used;  Not that it made any difference one way or the other.</li>
            <li> Best product I have used for nose and ear hairs.  I am very happy about this product.</li>
            <li> I am very unhappy with it, it doesn&#x27;t do anything , i tried it 5 times it does not cut anything , please refund my money!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately there are hairy men in this world and unless you want hair dangling out of your nose you&#x27;re going to have to trim them off. I&#x27;ve used a few different trimmers over the years but they&#x27;ve either failed by design or simply not well made. I prefer units that do not have built in batteries because they always lose their charge over time and then it&#x27;s pretty much chuck in the garbage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit has a removable blade-top so you can clean or replace it (not sure if they sell replacements), takes a single AA battery, and is waterproof. The blades cut nicely and don&#x27;t snag at your nose hairs. It also has a function where you can let water run through the blades as they are on to clean it but I always prefer to disassemble it and clean it that way.</li>
            <li> The product works as advertised and as others reviews would indicate. It isn&#x27;t a game changer of nose hair trimming or anything, So far battery life is sound. The rinse out feature seems to work and is a nice addition over other trimmers I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> It is a little underpowered, but it works well and cleaning it is a breeze. Just turn the blue ring to the faucet icon and place under a running faucet.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer.The trimmer is very easy to set up, and requires a AA battery (not included), and washable.last but not least, gets rid of hair with no pull or tuck feeling</li>
            <li> It works ok, with no pain.  I have to go over the areas a couple / few times get everything.  The real problem is that it eats through batteries fast, draining a new AA battery after a just a handful of uses!  What&#x27;s up with that?</li>
            <li> Works beautifully and easily.</li>
            <li> It trims my nose hair well, though to be fair this was the first such device I have used.  I&#x27;m not really sure how they call it a facial hair trimmer though.  For one, the hair has to get in there a ways, so it won&#x27;t get close or accurate.  Second, you just had this thing in your nose dude....</li>
            <li> easy to use and easy to wash - I love it</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t figured out the instructions. Small pieces, really complicated sounding--for a first timer like me.  I&#x27;m afraid it will cut my nose if I get one little piece wrong.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband.  He seems very happy with it.  I dont have any nose hairs to try it on....</li>
            <li> Finally replaced my old one for this new one.  It only lasted 3 short runs when it stopped - changed the battery and it still didn&#x27;t work!  Amazon will not take it back because I&#x27;m past the return policy!  Maybe the manufacturer will back the product up but it&#x27;s probably not worth the time and money to go through them to get one that works!!</li>
            <li> Waste of money, Worked several times and then died the death. It may be washable but it just doesn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
            <li> I have used Remington trimmer before and this one by far is the better of the two.&lt;br /&gt;The speed of the trimmer blades is very much dependent on the batteries, so make sure to use new or charged batteries before using.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works well for both dry and wet conditions and trims without causing pain.&lt;br /&gt;Recommended highly</li>
            <li> Awesome nose trimmer. Husband calls it turbo powered. And no pain or pinching like some of the others. Nice design and feel too.</li>
            <li> This is the best little trimmer I have ever owned.  It is very quiet and it clips closely without pulling on the hair.</li>
            <li> This trimmer seems ok, after several weeks of use. I like that it is more sturdy and higher quality than my old Andis trimmer, but it doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful. The blade speed is lower and the trimming efficiency is also less. The closeness of trimming is also less than the Andis. But given that the Andis self-destructed for no reason, I&#x27;ll stick with the Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Good item. Very silent and effective and also very confortable to use. Considering the quality, the price is really nice.</li>
            <li> After I put the required AA battery into this device, I went to work.  Within a few minutes I went from looking like a hobbit to looking like a well groomed business tycoon.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t buy this product. It doesn&#x27;t work at all! The blade is so buried inside the protective cover it doesn&#x27;t reach any of the hairs in your nose.</li>
            <li> It healthy to cut or shave hair where it make you more handsome or comfortable. I constantly use these things.</li>
            <li> Great quality, very easy to clean, easy to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great buy! Would recommend it to anyone. I have tried others before and this one is by far the best!</li>
            <li> I once had one of these panasonic nose and facial hair trimmer and it was just ok, (earlier model).  This one works about 35% more efficiently and am happier with this one.</li>
            <li> I have only had this device for a few weeks...used only three times, But it seems to do as advertised.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is designed to do. Fast, easy to use. Consider it a weed whacker for your nose.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about this nose trimmer but it proved me wrong. I&#x27;m very picky about electronics and gadgets that I buy and spent hours looking at reviews for nose and facial hair trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, it&#x27;s an awesome bang for your buck, does the job VERY VERY well, and last but certainly not least, its a wet/dry trimmer. Helps keep the blades and blade chamber clean when running it under the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a great trimmer, this is the one.</li>
            <li> Well made and it works. Does what its supposed to do and does it well. Cleans up easily too. If I lost it, I&#x27;d order another one. Best of its type I&#x27;ve run across.</li>
            <li> Such a good device and can be so usefull for so many areas. I eould recomend it fir sure .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered hundreds of things off of Amazon, yet I&#x27;ve never been more excited for a package to come in the mail. I&#x27;ve had friends (including girlfriend) mention my nose hair, and it&#x27;s been awfully embarrassing each time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried scissors, but its just so difficult...and so bloody.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great. It took 5 minutes to completely trim all the hair in my nose so that it was no longer noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huge self-confidence boost.</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming ear and nose hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a few of these over the years, but this is my favorite. It works well, doesn&#x27;t cut or pull, and stays sharp. Terrific product.</li>
            <li> I have yet to find a great one of these.</li>
            <li> Nose hair became a problem for me recently so I decided to purchase this product to help me with that. Turns it does its job and the quality of the build is great!</li>
            <li> Great product, buy it!</li>
            <li> It is low noise and low energy cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And It is very convenient for you to carry when you go out.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints so all is well. Arrived as expected within promised shipping time frame.</li>
            <li> arrived as described and works like a charm.  no complaints here.</li>
            <li> Trims my nose hairs without any issues.  It actually tickles the inside of my nose!</li>
            <li> Worst nose hair trimmer ever! Barely has enough power to trim any hair it&#x27;s noisy and fragile. I took the nose cone off to rinse it off after use and since it has made a funny noise and is dull as ever! I am not that hairy or have bushes growing out of my nose and ears but I would have thought it could have cut the mustard? No luck so I am in the market for a new one already I used it only three or four times and it is falling apart.</li>
            <li> For many of us men, advancing age brings out new body features like more hair in the nose and ears.  Its fine until someone speaks to you up close and winces at all the stubby hair they&#x27;re looking at.  Panasonic makes a number of trimmers that do the hair-trimming job nicely, and many of them are about the same price.  I&#x27;ve owned a few over the years, and this is my favorite.  It easy to handle, it rinses and cleans easily, and you can get it as wet as you want when you use or clean it.  Its an inexpensive device and a good one.  Recommended!</li>
            <li> I have generally been very pleased with Panasonic personal care products.  This however is the exception.  It seems surprisingly fragile in the way it&#x27;s constructed.  I accidentally dropped it once, but that was enough to deform the cutting unit so that it no longer works.  I spoke with Panasonic, but they were unhelpful.  Back to trimming hair the old fashioned way, I guess.</li>
            <li> recommend for anyone who have problems with hair in nose and ears</li>
            <li> It works.  I seem to have more hair in my ears and nose than on my head anymore.  This little deal has helped even the odds. Simple and effective.  Inexpensive.  Easy to clean.  It does one thing very well.</li>
            <li> Why can&#x27;t anyone make one of these trimmers that is a quality product?  It eats batteries and with no real results.  Barely gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  I dont think it does any better or worse than any other nose hair trimmer that I have used.</li>
            <li> It was as expected  Came in late but doesn&#x27;t pull nose hairs</li>
            <li> Not water resistant at all like it says.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping... Great price.</li>
            <li> This sort of works.  It gets pretty hot after about a minute.  Considering you&#x27;re using it on sensitive areas, makes me nervous.  If you have a little hair, it should work fine for you though.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer a couple of times so far since my purchase and it works great.  It&#x27;s quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Best I ever purchased.</li>
            <li> Got to have and works great</li>
            <li> This product works great for nose, and ear trimming.  I like the angle of the design - it helps get where you need to get</li>
            <li> great product although i cant speak of its durability since it is new. The tip gets a little warm but nothing uncomforable</li>
            <li> I got this to use for upper lip hair and it does a good job, not great but good enough. Waxing or creams eliminates hair but causes me a lot if irritation. I found this will diminish hair but not get rid of it completely.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well for my intended purpose.</li>
            <li> Washable unit (after 1/4 turn adjustment) put the fifth star on this unit. Prior purchases have been cheaper, but so had the design and housing. This unit looks and feels like it will be around for a while. Maybe it&#x27;s just design psychology, but the slightly bent body seems to fit my hand better and make trimming accuracy easier.</li>
            <li> I love this thing.  I especially like the functionality of being able to run it under water to give it a good cleaning.  Works very well.  Would highly recommend it to anyone with whisker issues. . . wherever they may be on your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  I&#x27;ve had this trimmer now for several years and use it weekly.  Still one of my best purchases.  I&#x27;ve used it for my eyebrows and nose.  No complaints.  It&#x27;s on sale and I&#x27;m going to pick up another one for travel.</li>
            <li> Got this on a sale, very handy tool.</li>
            <li> It does the job needed and more.  Keeps user well groomed without complaints.  Was better priced than in-store models and I received free shipping.</li>
            <li> It has not broken, this works great. It has no broken, which is surprising since every single one out there has. It smells like burn after using it for a while.</li>
            <li> Works great. I use it about 2-3 times a month to keep my little spiders from crawling out and it works great.  It&#x27;s quiet, doesn&#x27;t pull, and does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And considering the price....  Great deal.</li>
            <li> Nice design...wish it had more power.</li>
            <li> Very easy to operate and gets the job done well.  I will be using this handy tool a lot and my husband likes it too.</li>
            <li> Works well and does exactly what it is intended to do.  Haven&#x27;t tried it &amp;#34;wet,&amp;#34; as I always use it with a mirror.  Great price, too!  The batteries are still strong after two months, but I only use it weekly.</li>
            <li> Yep, it will cut your nose hair.  Every now and then, it will &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; one out rather than cutting it... so brace yourself!!!  Easy to clean, pretty decent quality.</li>
            <li> Broke after about 6 months. the little blades don&#x27;t cut, they just pull my nose hairs. which is terribly painful to say the least. for $12 it isn&#x27;t worth sending back or complaining. I&#x27;ll just try something else.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer now for over a year and have had no problems at all. No pulling or painful trimming that some have mentioned. My only complaint is that it goes thru batteries pretty quickly. I replace mine about once a month and use the trimmer every 4-5 days for about 30 seconds. It works well and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> This was a great gift to myself.  Trims hair easily.  Little maintanance and doesn&#x27;t feel &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34;.  Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do but nothing extraordinary.  I would recommend it over others I have tried.</li>
            <li> IT TAKES A WHILE  FOR THE DEVICE TO GET ALL OF THE HAIRS FROM  EARS AND NOSE; BUT, IT IS ADEQUATE</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby who is a casual guy when it comes to grooming. He reports no problems, finds it easy to use and clean.  All I know is that he&#x27;s now hairless in places he should be. :-)  Yay.</li>
            <li> Superior to the less expensive Panasonic model I used previously; although both use a single AA battery, this model has better speed and perhaps sharper blades so it doesn&#x27;t pull your hairs.</li>
            <li> This broke after using it a few times. The front tip is very delicate. The tine bent and the cutter wouldn&#x27;t move.</li>
            <li> Compact, easy to access targets, safety tip.  Really cleans hairs up.&lt;br /&gt;Best I have had in decades.  Highly recommended.  Best buy.</li>
            <li> Works fine, easy to clean, gets rid of the hair in my ears and nose. (why is it as I grow older, I get less hair on my head and more in those places?)  Arrived on time, package in good shape but if I had a gripe, it&#x27;s the product packaging - I gave some consideration to getting my hatchet out to open it.</li>
            <li> Got a great deal and worked great as well</li>
            <li> Works really well for my nose as well as my ears. And I like that its cordless.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean and the batteries last.</li>
            <li> The first one broke with 3 weeks. I suspect there is quality issue with the blades. I opened up the blades to clean with the included brush and put it back. It started making a loud buzzing sound and it wouldn&#x27;t cut anymore. After several attempts and online research, I concluded that the blades are spring loaded and these springs wear down fast due to quality issues. When the trimmer is used, the edges of the blades brush against the cover and make the loud buzzing sound.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon sent me another one and this one is working good so far. I will probably try not to use the brush to clean the blades with this one.&lt;br /&gt;The panasonic website lists the replacement blades at a higher cost than the amazon price for the trimmer. The Panasonic warranty claim isn&#x27;t the best since they expect the broken unit to be mailed at our cost to them for them to honor their warranty. On a $13 trimmer, that doesn&#x27;t much sense.</li>
            <li> I only use this for nose hair trimming, but in that regard, of the many trimmers I&#x27;ve owned, this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> I love the zapping sound that it makes.  Unfortunately, it doesn&#x27;t do very well at trimming.  I should have sent it back.</li>
            <li> No sneezing when using this trimmer.  Will be getting the same one when current one eventually breaks.</li>
            <li> Priced right and does a great job. The round end is superior to the flat end trimmer I previously owned.</li>
            <li> So far working good but it injured my inner nose so be careful while using!</li>
            <li> Lasted bout a year, which is probably the best you can expect.</li>
            <li> the packaging is good enough, instructions, even the motor and assembly are not and issue. On first use it&#x27;s really nice, quiet and it works. After 4 uses.. USES not months, the blades somehow make really horrible noise and I am not sure if it cuts anymore. The instructions say it&#x27;s dirty.. I cleaned them.. there are 3 springs that somehow are now either too weak or something else I can&#x27;t tell. I&#x27;ve tried multiple ways and finally red so many of the other reviewers on here, I agree with them DO NOT BUY THIS product.</li>
            <li> I ordered a second trimmer and got a different tip. The first one had a side-opening and the second one had notched edges around the tip. These are different. I hope Amazon can figure it out for us before we order.</li>
            <li> This thing is AWESOME! I had a trimmer that cuts the same way from some no-name brand before and trimming my nose and ears hurt. I just thought that was part of the joys of aging that I&#x27;d need to deal with as long as I don&#x27;t want hair. When I first used this, I clenched my teeth expecting the familiar feel of yanking nose hairs out, but felt almost nothing. NO PAIN! You can hardly even hear it running. Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I got this to replace an ER415 that I have. The ER415 cap no longer stays on well, but still cuts well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ER-GN30 has a great design for the cap, but it simply doesn&#x27;t cut well. I think the difference is that the shield is smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine is in perfect working order... and yet I need to go buy another one.</li>
            <li> We really like this trimmer. We never realized how much hair we had until it was gone! The only complaint we have is that it could be a little sharper. You have to go over the hair a few times to really get it out. Overall, though, it works well and the price is good.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my first use, then I went to tap it on the sink to get the loose hairs out, and the top fell apart and the blade went down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it wasn&#x27;t a big deal since I could take the U-pipe out and retrieve the blade, but after removing the pipe, a plethora of something resembling the girl&#x27;s hair from the Ring fell out and I dry heaved for a couple minutes.  Once I mustered up the courage to return, I grabbed the U-pipe and turned it over only to find black gunk coming out. The blade was so light it just kept going with the flow of water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheaply made product</li>
            <li> Like a mini-weedwacker for your head holes. Mowing down wide swaths of unsightly nose and ear hairs has never been easier. Or more fun. I get so many compliments on my nostrils and ear canals now! Thanks Panasonic!</li>
            <li> I got this as a gift for my dad last Christmas and it still works fine. My dad seems to like it so I gave it a good rating.</li>
            <li> Excellent gift for self and others.  It does the work!</li>
            <li> It was nice when it worked, but after 3 months it doesn&#x27;t do anything anymore.  The blades just don&#x27;t spin.  I&#x27;ve taken it apart, cleaned it, and nothing helped.  Either my nose hair is like Superman&#x27;s and is too strong for this thing or it&#x27;s a shoddy piece of equipment.</li>
            <li> This works really well and is very portable. On thing I would like tonsee like my old one is a little light thatnshines in area you are trimming. Otherwise easy to use and functions perfectly.</li>
            <li> This product is great, convenient, easy to clean and makes trimming a lot easier. Highly recommended for people who hate wasting in front of the mirror.</li>
            <li> This is working and doing the job it is supposed to do</li>
            <li> It definitely Does the job ! It is quick, easy and painless!&lt;br /&gt;Better than cutting the nose hairs with scissors</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t think this thing was going to work very well. It does. It gets all the hairs and it doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt. GREAT! UPDATE: Yes I bought this awhile back, but after a short amount of time, it wouldn&#x27;t work on a regular basis. Would die out very quickly. I checked the battery with a battery tester, changed batteries, same thing. I also cleaned the contacts for the battery with Deoxit. Shuts off, slows down etc. I hadn&#x27;t used it in a long time for that reason and just came across it in the closet and threw it out.  Was great while it lasted which was only a couple of months before it acted up.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very easy to use!  Add 1 AA battery and works like a charm.  I haven&#x27;t used it with water yet, but I can&#x27;t imagine that it would have any trouble.  As far as nose trimmers go, you can&#x27;t lose.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I&#x27;ve yet to pluck hairs.... you know the pain.</li>
            <li> Wonderful grooming tool! Powerful, sharp blades, easy to use and does work well when wet or dry. Seller shipped fast and was easy to deal with I highly recommend this product and this Seller.</li>
            <li> Bought for my boyfriend.. He loves it works beautifully</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, better then my last one.</li>
            <li> seems more complicated than it should to clean.</li>
            <li> After reading a number of reviews about this trimmer, I was expecting a cheap, but decent product and I must say, I wasn&#x27;t disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Provides a close trim.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to hold and manuever.&lt;br /&gt;Very simple to take apart and clean, and then reassemble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes requires a number of passes and spins of the trimmer to get all of those pesky hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Gets a little warm around the metal tip, which is normal, but slightly uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with this trimmer given the price I paid for it.</li>
            <li> I enjoying using this nose trimmer its very powerful and gets the job done very fast. The battery last a very long time.</li>
            <li> Everything was ok. Thanks</li>
            <li> Best I have ever used and you can wash it without worry!</li>
            <li> Well-made, quiet, and very effective.  Lightweight.</li>
            <li> When it worked it was a pretty good trimmer.  However, after about six or seven uses it slowed down as if the battery was dying.  Replaced the battery and the same problem occurred after about eight more uses.  Replaced battery again, and nothing.  Very disappointed in the quality.  BTW, the batteries were still good as I put them in other devices.  I would recommend buying a different trimmer.</li>
            <li> It works well for the low price! I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I use this for my hairy nose and ears.  Works great, doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull my hair, and so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I suffer from Irish nose bushes which occasionally need substantial cutting. When the weed whacker isn&#x27;t working properly, I grab my Panasonic ER-GN30 and hair starts wishing it never grew in the first place. My wife wanted me to get one but turned out I ended up liking a motorized razor in my nose every once and a while. Nice having a friend around to reach in there and get out all that stuff that really serves no purpose anyway.</li>
            <li> Awesome product, use it everyday. Highly recommend this trimmer!</li>
            <li> Super useful for nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Works well, no hassel, not sure why i didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars; probably because.... I don&#x27;t like trimming nose hair period.. but this helps, and is actually a really good product.</li>
            <li> All time best product for its class and price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
            <li> Does the job for my husband! The head has flown off in use a couple of times but may have been his fault for not tightening enough after cleaning.</li>
            <li> Works very well indeed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice to buy something inexpensive that does what it says it will do and lasts. No complaints on this at all! I&#x27;ve owned this for about 9 months and works as well now as I did the day I received it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the second one I have purchased. They work better than anything I have found. You will need to replace it in a year or two since the blades get dull and pull the hair (ouch)! At the price, replacing It after a year or two is not a big deal in mu opinion.</li>
            <li> Actually works, and since it is easily and completely cleanable, it doesn&#x27;t stop working after 10 uses because it is jammed with snot and hair. What a concept!</li>
            <li> Works as expected, does a great job and cleans out great.</li>
            <li> had one from a beard trimming kit before this that just didn&#x27;t work...was pleasantly surprised with this one</li>
            <li> I know, I know ladies have this unsightly problem too. The packaging for this handy little tool only shows men, but we all know ladies struggle with those ugly little black hairs sticking out of their nostrils as well!! After hating 2 different drug store models that only resulted in shorter ugly little black hairs, I resorted to using scissors OUCH!! So I decided to give the battery operated option one more try and SUCCESS!!!! This trimmer really works, quickly and painlessly! No stubble, totally clean nostrils, every girls dream come true!!!</li>
            <li> Very nice. Love it A++++++++++</li>
            <li> It worked for about a year and a half and then just quit one day.  I expected it to last longer than that.</li>
            <li> This nose, ear n facial hair removal tool, arrived on time and was as described.  Very good value.</li>
            <li> Only had it for a couple of months and now it doesn&#x27;t work. Only used it one time. Should have gone with Andis.</li>
            <li> this is not a cheap made idem, works very good, easy to clean, can get new blades, i can not say enough. thanks deliver time was great too.</li>
            <li> I had this product before and it used to work great. I lost that. I bought a new one and it is horrible. Doesn&#x27;t cut well and hurts too. Not sure if they degraded the quality of this product. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> If you have the problem of &amp;#34;spruce trees&amp;#34; trying to emerge from your nose you&#x27;re like me.  This is the best one of these I&#x27;ve ever used and only $13!  I had the $40 Brookstone one and it was LAME and did not last.  I don&#x27;t know yet how durable this trimmer is but it works great and the flow through cleaning is an excellent feature.</li>
            <li> Cuts through nose bush with ease...</li>
            <li> I have purchased two other brands and they just did not work.  This one actually works!!!</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer, would highly recommend. Seems like it&#x27;s more well made than most and will last longer than these trimmers usually do.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that I can rinse it under the water to clean it.</li>
            <li> Probably the best product of this type I have ever used. Sharp, does not pull, just cuts.  Really top quality, and runs on 2 AA batteries, which you can take out for traveling.</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD indeed. Fantastic. Works great and does the job well. Clean and simple.</li>
            <li> Great price and works well</li>
            <li> Maybe I am using it wrong, but doesn&#x27;t see to do a good job.</li>
            <li> I use it to cut nose hair and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> After years using small scissors which was not satisfactory due to small nips/cuts, I found the Panasonic ear and nose trimmer to be the ideal tool. Never would go back to old method. Now the results are fantastic. Best of all I don&#x27;t cut myself as this trimmer safely, efficiently and comfortably trims. Cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li> My husband really like this.</li>
            <li> I like it very much. Nice and reliable trimmer, works fine so far.</li>
            <li> Nice and sleeky design, easy to use, silent and good handling.</li>
            <li> Every thing perfect with this order and product.</li>
            <li> This trimmer doesn&#x27;t last very long per battery.  90 minutes?  No way!  Maybe like 20.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> This is the best of a group of groomers I&#x27;ve owned.  The product does what it is supposed to do.  Cleaning is easy and the wet/dry feature is good.  I decided on this model after reading customer reviews, and this is the only product that scored no lower than 3 stars in those reviews.</li>
            <li> that has unwanted hair. Don&#x27;t really know how the razor people can improve on these products but this one seems to be better than my last one.  The barrel is slightly curved towards you so that is a plus and makes the shaver easier to use. The blades are sharp and seem to cut the hairs in no time at all. I haven&#x27;t used it under water or washed it under water but the dry use is great.</li>
            <li> I hesitated to buy this product because of some negative reviews.  I now am glad I took the chance. This trimmer works as advertised; cutting ear and nose hair off close to the skin without pulling. I have used several other trimmers - this one is by far the best!!</li>
            <li> My man has very coarse nose hair and swore that no trimmer has ever done any good until I bought this! He loves it! It works really well.</li>
            <li> Well...this does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  It goes up your nose and cuts nose hair...it does it without any pain or pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> Very simple tool, of course and it works as you would like.  Took a couple of times using it to feel comfortable (was concerned about nipping and snipping) but found it to work smoothly and comfortably.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good thing, very comfortable and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Worked for a few months and then it died.  Replaced the battery, no dice.  Cleaned the head unit, no dice.  Buy another Panasonic?  No dice.</li>
            <li> I use it in the shower.  Works great!  The battery life seems to last fairly long.  I do wish it was rechargable.</li>
            <li> Great. No pain at all.</li>
            <li> Works great and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs.  No pain, your gain.</li>
            <li> I use it for mostly for nose. It does exactly what it should do and leave my nose hairless</li>
            <li> love this product best gift i ever bought for my boyfreind ...</li>
            <li> The first thing I said to this thing when I took it out of the box was &amp;#34;I hope you&#x27;re hungry!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The aging male. What a disaster. Slowed down metabolism. Decreased sexual stamina. Hair everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the Panasonic ER-GN30-K at least I can deal with the jungles that have developed in my nose and ears. Works like a charm!</li>
            <li> This item was completely inoperable, not even the tiniest buzz. Apparently quality control was skipped for the trimmer I received.</li>
            <li> I remember the days when these things PULLED hairs so it took me years to get the &amp;#34;nerve&amp;#34; to get one.  I am glad I did!  This thing removes hair with NO pulling, NO pain. NO sneezing. NO tears.  No more hairs hanging out of our nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other day I noticed all the fine hair on the sides of my face (if I were a man I would probably have a full beard!). Just for the heck of it I ran this thing over my whole face ... it was quick and now all those fine hairs all over my face are gone with no rough stubble (like when using a razor, which I will never do again!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $12.48 (including shipping) and we are quite pleased with this purchase.  Fits nicely in either hand, not at all heavy. Just &amp;#34;aim&amp;#34; the holes at your hairs and they are gone.  We&#x27;ve only had it for just over a month, so I don&#x27;t know about longevity, but I will update my review when/if something changes.</li>
            <li> Device overheats easily. Trims very poorly. Difficult to clean. The device does fit the hand well. It is better than some I have tried</li>
            <li> Simple: It works. A little practice was necessary, but I&#x27;ve got the hang of it. Also convenient to travel with.</li>
            <li> WOW It Really Does Work, and close too!  I have 7 nose trimmer, I have the manual, the vacuum panasonic, and every other brand.  This is the first to truly work without using a razor with the cutter on it thats is a 1/4 wide.  I have only used once, so we will se the longevity, I am using the water method, and brush, so we shall see...So far so good, and I can breath, and no mucus in nose hairs, cause there are none!!!</li>
            <li> Great nose trimmer for a very affordable price. This trimmer is extremely easy to clean thanks to the water diverting channel that allows water to flow out of it when you are washing it. The mechanism is very simple, just turn the dial to the cleaning setting and an opening will appear that channels out water from the trimming head. When done cleaning, just close the dial and you are good to go.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it. He said it works well.</li>
            <li> Got a second one for a gift.</li>
            <li> Have tried multiple trimmers before but the reach and ability to get stubborn hairs that dont get caught by other trimmers is incredible. I used to think that there nose hairs that were untouchable unless you plucked them but this baby is great at getting them and for the price this is a steal of a product</li>
            <li> Hubbie loved this!  Did a great job.  He lost it a hotel and I replaced it with one I quickly bought at the store.  He said he could tell a difference so as soon as it bites the dust I&#x27;ll be buying another one of the panasonic.</li>
            <li> This worked well for me with my occasional nose hair problem.  It worked well wet or dry.  I have not used it on my face, however.</li>
            <li> It gets a little warm at the tip and tickles my nose to the point of making me cry a bit, but it does the job haha.</li>
            <li> You know what this is for. Old guys. Having hairy nostrils sure beats the alternative (not living long enough to experience hairy nostrils) and this certainly works for that. The best part is that it can cut a bit from the side as well as from the end. You don&#x27;t have to make sure hairs only hit the cutter from certain angles like the old trimmer I had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the flat base lets you set it on the end and it takes up less space than the last one I had that had to be stored on it&#x27;s side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And finally, it&#x27;s &amp;#34;waterproof&amp;#34; so you can rinse it off while running it.</li>
            <li> Very weak motor even with a new battery.  Doesn&#x27;t cut as well as my old one.  Battery doesn&#x27;t last long even though it sits in a drawer most of the time.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer for the price! Hubby says it&#x27;s been working great and does a nice job on the ear and nose hair!  Says it&#x27;s efficient and well made and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love it, so easy to use and the original battery is still working for over 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definatly recommend to anyone looking for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that you can clean this after using it.  Now my man doesn&#x27;t have a hairy nose or ears anymore!</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  Happy with the purchase.  I would recommend this to others looking for a good trimmer.  Quickly shipped.</li>
            <li> Very simple to use. Great at trimming my &amp;#34;nose foliage.&amp;#34; Easy to clean and feels good to know I am well groomed</li>
            <li> So, I got this for my husband to not just trim the occasional nose hair, but also for him to use on his unibrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It trims hairs.  It seems to run fairly well.  Hasn&#x27;t broken.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If needed for trimming eyebrow hairs, it doesn&#x27;t really get the close &amp;#34;trim&amp;#34; or close &amp;#34;shave&amp;#34; or tweezed look.  So I can see brow stubble left behind.  (Might I add, there ARE trimmers - not shavers - that DO trim the hair close to the skin.  But they are for women and too large for the eyebrow area.)  This one just doesn&#x27;t do it.  While using for maybe a minute or two to get the eyebrows groomed, the metal tip starts getting warm, as if it may start burning up more.  Not too sure if this is potentially dangerous or a defective product or if this is supposed to happen.  Probably defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess if you want something cheap and works decently for your nose hairs, this does the job.  But seriously, it might burn your face if it starts getting hotter.</li>
            <li> Only hair trimmer I have owned so I cant compare to other makes/models. With the clipped coupon this was ~$10, Takes one &#x27;AA&#x27; battery. Works, did not take long to use, happy with the results. Easy to clean and take apart. Seems built well enough to get more than my moneys worth on a periodically used item. I can not comment on using this wet, I have only used it dry.</li>
            <li> I use it but it could use more power.  I wish it plugged in.  The single AA battery gets tired fast and isn&#x27;t really powerful enough to demolish ear and nose hair.  But it does work and I do continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews and decided the negatives ones didn’t apply so I purchased.&lt;br /&gt;Product is great!</li>
            <li> I never thought a nostril hair trimmer could be so awesome, but this one is. Until I can get a nostril trimming app on my iPhone, I&#x27;ll be using this. Disclaimer: although iPhones can be used in many social situations unobtrusively, I would discourage anyone from using nostril hair trimmer while dining, at a social function, or flying. Although it looks cool in the bathroom, that&#x27;s where it should stay.</li>
            <li> Replaced an older style Panasonic trimer with this one and what a difference. This unit is quiet, sleek, well designed and superbly performing.</li>
            <li> I use this primarily to trim nose hair and it is great. It does not pull or irritate your nose when you are trimming and doesn&#x27;t leave a bunch of small hairs in your nose for you to sneeze out. This is the ideal nose trimmer. It is also easy to clean since the head is detachable and you can run water through it (read the manual for details). My only very minor complaint is that it doesn&#x27;t trim facial (non-nasal) hair short enough or at an uniform length. I think using it as a facial hair trimmer as it is advertised would be less than ideal.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, comfortable device for the trimming of nasty nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT A TRIMMER FROM CVS A WHILE AGO FOR 89 DOLLARS AND LITERALLY DIDNT DO ANYTHING BUT THIS ONE WORK PERFECTLY AND THE PRICE IS AMAZING FOR THE WAY IT WORKS&lt;br /&gt;GOOD LUCK GUYS BY THE WAY ALL THE HAIR ON MY NOSE IS GONE :))))))))))</li>
            <li> excellent article of good quality and good price I&#x27;ve tested and very good so far they recommend</li>
            <li> Used it couple of times. It seems to work. Nose hair gone. If it takes you more than a minute of continuous use you&#x27;ll notice the tip gets a little warm in your nose.</li>
            <li> sold a defective unit.  It broke first use. Waited to long to try, and couldn&#x27;t return waste of $20. GARBAGE product with Garbage return policy  If i bought it local would of had thirty days to return if not 90 like some stores</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be impressed with the smooth, quiet operation and by the way you can access where you need to with this most efficient trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;You can spend more, but the better value is right here !</li>
            <li> Worked at first, but didn&#x27;t last. After removing the screw-on top to clean the blades under running sink water only, I put the top back on and the tiny blades never worked again. It is made to be removed to get all the hairs out, but it is another piece of junk made to be tossed in the garbage, so the consumer has to buy another unit. I had one from Sharper Image for 15 years and cleaned it the same way. This only lasted a few months. Yes I did try new batteries to no avail. (My daughter&#x27;s review)</li>
            <li> Powered by 1 AA battery.  When I tried it out of the box, it didn&#x27;t work.  I figured out that the blade mechanism was stuck.  When I did get it working and tried it out, it cut most hairs, but the blades would get jammed and pull my nosehairs out.  This thing sucks.</li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant to purchase this type of trimmer, was not sure how it could trim anything without exposed blades.&lt;br /&gt;It was highly rated and I see why it works great, easy to clean. It trims hair from the end of blade not just the sides, time will tell about battery life and quality of the trimmer but so far it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Like with anything, as long as you maintain this and regularly clean it, it works very well. The only downside is the interior when placing the battery in it smelled like sulfur or something dead. Very odd. Great product though.</li>
            <li> Rarely works, have to take out battery and twist the bottom back on just right for it to start. I&#x27;m sure I got a bad one, but damn, this things sucks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had one like this before, but it works great! super easy to clean and work on. i would recommend this to anyone!</li>
            <li> Does a great job! Just make sure you have a rechargeable battery as it looses its effectiveness if its not at full power.</li>
            <li> This is awesome the best I have ever purchased!! Highly recommend this product.  I have bought many trimmers in my past.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband because his nose hairs are always so long. He always complained about other nose and facial trimmers I have purchased. Once he received this one he did not stop raving about it.</li>
            <li> Painless and simple. It is everything it is advertised too be. Had older kind that I replaced.  Nice new technology.</li>
            <li> The panasonic vortex nose hair trimmer works well and cleans easily. I&#x27;m impressed with the thoroughness in which it trims those little hairs. After a good rinsing it also seems to work well for trimming other stray facial hairs.</li>
            <li> Have only used mine 3 times so far but it works as described.  Great value, easy to use and decent battery life.</li>
            <li> Owned this for 5 months and used it twice.  Today it stopped working despite a new battery.  A review of the internet reveals&lt;br /&gt;this is a common problem and related to poor quality control.  DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT.</li>
            <li> This looks like the one rated # one by Hammacher Schlemmer, so I bought it.  It is much better than the one I had before.  This one cuts the hairs quickly and easily, and doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> This is a great tool for those of us that now have unwanted hair now growing out of many wrong places.</li>
            <li> ...it simply failed. I had two purchased and the other is still working, and offers a fine comfortable cut of hair that my nose seems more anxious to grow hair than on the top of my head, but given the other one failed with such little use, I was disappointed given I normally have always been a Panasonic brand fan. Well, no one&#x27;s perfect...</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all. I put the batteries I tried everything but it wouldn&#x27;t turn on. I never got the chance to use it. Was not happy at all</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever used in my life.  I was a bit skeptical about it at first but I am so happy that I bought it.  It trims with no pain at all and when I say trim, it TRIMS.  I am definitely buying this again if I need to.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t yank your hair out, which is hard to find in any electric razor or trimmer. Totally painless and easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Exactly as described and perfect at a great price. It is always a pleasure shopping on Amazon.com! Thank you kindly.</li>
            <li> My husband tells me that this does not pull his nose hairs at all like other trimmers do. Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I really liked the design of this hair trimmer. However, the first one that I bought did not work out of the box. I bought a second and it worked great for 2 months and then stopped working.</li>
            <li> Excellent goods&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for good dealings&lt;br /&gt;I hope that I deal with you again&lt;br /&gt;Deserve five-star&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you agin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a different brand for about 7 years and was never really happy with it. Just didn&#x27;t do the job. I finally broke down and decided to get this Panasonic and it works great! Clips a lot more hair than my old unit. No discomfort. Cleans easy under the faucet. Good grip. Well worth it.</li>
            <li> One of the pains of growing older is hair sprouting out of the most unflattering places.  This trimmer is the best I have tried to tame the hairs in your nose simply and completely.  The angled body design makes it easy to hold at the correct angle and the trimmer is quick and painless.  I wish it was easier to use on the eyebrows.  Yes, it cuts effectively but I don&#x27;t feel that I have full control and worry that i might trim off to much.  If it had this I would give it 5 stars.  But perhaps its just me.  Overall a great little unit a a reasonable price...you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
            <li> works as expected...trims the nose hair what else can I say//good product for the price and does the job! YES</li>
            <li> Replacing an older panasonic trimmer that seemed to cut better than this one. It&#x27;s not bad, just doesn&#x27;t seem as good.</li>
            <li> Somehow I expected more flash or power to the operation.  It doesn&#x27;t suck up all hair in one giant woosh.  It quietly cuts any hairs that are long enough to go into the cutting cavity of the top end of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;This is really what you would want the trimmer to do!  I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried others. This is the best so far. Hope the blade stays sharp.</li>
            <li> Works as designed, having no problems price was great</li>
            <li> Works great. I&#x27;ve Used it to trim nose and ear hairs for the first time. No pulling hair and is nice and quiet.</li>
            <li> Better than most others I have tried, but I haven&#x27;t found one yet that cuts nose hair cleanly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> Excellent for the ears and nose. Haven&#x27;t tried it yet while wet. Simple and easy to use. No setting up required, just add battery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. Not the best.</li>
            <li> Everyone in my immediate vicinity loves this thing and they don&#x27;t even know it.  Thanks Panasonic for my new friends.</li>
            <li> Excellent, does just what it says...seems like no chance of pulling or scratching, very smooth.</li>
            <li> He only used it once,  but it worked really well! I was concerned because of some of the negative comments it has.</li>
            <li> Works Great, Love it!</li>
            <li> Misses a lot of hair.  Ended up returning it for a better one.</li>
            <li> This is great to keep you from looking like an old man whose given up on life.</li>
            <li> Well made, quiet, does not pull or tug on hairs in sensitive areas - does the job it was intended to do.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This thing is great, the best I have ever used. It&#x27;s quick, painless, and so satisfying to hear it grind way at all that hair. Twist the cap as instructed when you are done, and everything rinses clean away. Does the trick and best of all, NO PAIN. Definitely get this if you are looking to turn the chore of nose (and ear) hair trimming into something you actually look forward to.</li>
            <li> Used it for a long time and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Worked OK for about a month. Then started getting a little loud and grindy. Now has quit completely, which is disappointing since It&#x27;s not what I would call a high use item.</li>
            <li> This panasonic nose trimmer is very well made. It is so good that I bought second one for my dad.</li>
            <li> Portable, well built, and nice cutting. Does a great job trimming mustache and beard edges.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and functional, what more can I say.</li>
            <li> Works good, not great, but good.  Had another Braun nose mower that worked better.  This one you kind of have to keep running it around the inside of your nose to get rid of the hair. ... takes longer.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully. Battery lasts, easy to clean, perfect product.</li>
            <li> This thing is fantastic. I&#x27;ve had it several years now and it&#x27;s still going strong. Easy on batteries too. I actually shape up my eyebrows between waxing with this thing. Saves money. Facial hair is gently removed and heavier hair such as around hair line is not problem either. Great product!</li>
            <li> Terrible product.  We returned it as it didn&#x27;t work- didn&#x27;t cut and just pulled on hairs.</li>
            <li> It does what it says. All I feel is a tickle in my nose, but other than that painless. I would recommend if you have lots of hairs in your noise and are scared of using sharp objects to get in there. I recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is small, and needs one AA battery, were the device it self is water proof. I recommend using it on a dry nose, since it works best with hairs that are up and not stuck on their side on the nose for better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it the first time, I even feel like my noise has a different airflow, didn&#x27;t know how much difference it would make.</li>
            <li> No more eating nose hairs 👍</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for almost 2 years and it still works fine. This is the only nose clipper I&#x27;ve ever used so I can&#x27;t compare it to others. Just know it&#x27;s reliable and cleans out those pesky hairs.</li>
            <li> I owned a few trimmers before and I would say this one works the best so far.  It does not pull your nose hair. Chop chop chop.</li>
            <li> Like how easy it is to use.</li>
            <li> This was in working order and more than satisfactory.</li>
            <li> Nice nose, ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer. I normally use for nose hair. You can wash this by running water directly from faucet.</li>
            <li> Great price, great quality.</li>
            <li> Key thing - remove battery before packing this thing for travel. I had a brand new one not just go dead, but apparently the motor burned out or something in transit, because even with a new battery, it wouldn&#x27;t work again.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not too strong but it&#x27;s usable temporarily.</li>
            <li> absolutely a keeper this is the best tool ever.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer it is sharp and does not pull hair or cut skin, i just wish it was rechargeable.</li>
            <li> It has worked fairly well.  This is my first trimmer so I don&#x27;t have much to compare it to, but I think I would like the trim to be a little closer.  Other than that, it is a good product so far.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a while. Works ok. Great if you use it as more disposable than anything. Now it barely turns on, and i need to tweak the metal connector to make it work.</li>
            <li> Works as it should...no com[plaints.</li>
            <li> Used only once and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Your getting older when you need one of these lol&lt;br /&gt;I wanted something cheap to put in my suitcase to take on trips that I wouldn&#x27;t care as much if tsa stole.&lt;br /&gt;Works great just don&#x27;t forget to put in new battery before leaving for trip if last trip it was starting to get weak, but that&#x27;s what Siri is for :P</li>
            <li> This was second such item I purchased.  As with first, it worked for about 1 month and then stopped.  I replaced batteries to no avail.  Product is grossly defective.</li>
            <li> It worked one time.  Now it makes a frightening buzzing sound and is ineffective.  I feel a bit like my money was stolen.</li>
            <li> Poorly made. Fell apart.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but it broke after 3 months. Frankly, I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. I would rather pay double the money and get something that works then this thing that broke for me. I&#x27;m not a tough reviewed but I do expect things to work.</li>
            <li> Nobody asks to braid my nose hair any longer.  THANK GOD.  Easy.  Hassle free.  PAIN FREE.  Great way to keep the nose from looking disgusting.</li>
            <li> Work well, batteries last</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and easy to use.  Fits nicely in the hand.  I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Works well for the three months that I have used it.  The tip does get a little warm during use but other that that I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it.</li>
            <li> Seems to do a descent job but battery life is fairly short lived.</li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> it does what it supposed to do, trim my nose hair.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most affordable trimmers and it gets the job done! I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d use it for facial hair grooming, as it&#x27;s not precise enough but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason in the first place! It easily snips out those pesky little hairs in the ear and nostrils without pulling or pinching. Super easy to clean by turning the knob to the little &amp;#34;water&amp;#34; icon, and running it under the faucet!</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It works very well. It is very comfortable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I have nose hairs that stick out and are always tickling me and this thing does a decent job of getting rid of them.</li>
            <li> excellent experience, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Simple to use and easy to clean. This is a good product! The only problem is that it uses batteries which are not included.</li>
            <li> Works well enough, but I liked the older model better.</li>
            <li> Pros: Works well, quiet operation, long battery life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: none so far</li>
            <li> The best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Old age, where the hair on your head stops growing out, but instead grows &amp;#34;in&amp;#34; and then comes out other places, like your ears.(heard a comedian say that once)  Anyway, this solves that little problem, and simultaneously grosses out anyone sitting near you when you use it while watching TV. Hey, but it works!</li>
            <li> This works well, better than the mangroomer one I had before. That lasted only a couple weeks, and was problematic from day one. This one is a little more solid. Easy to disassemble for cleaning, but as with most of these, doesn&#x27;t really seem to spin very quickly. I kept half expecting a sharp stab of pain as a hair was ripped out painfully, but it did a good job of cutting. Other than a little tickling it did the job well and quickly.&lt;br /&gt;Little noise, great price, and comes with a cap to top it off. Good deal.</li>
            <li> Pretty decent, waterproof as described and work good</li>
            <li> love it, really works!</li>
            <li> Simple to use, cheap. effective. No more nose hair.</li>
            <li> very lightweight and handy</li>
            <li> It leaves stubble, very itchy.  I went back to nail scissors.</li>
            <li> Followed the directions and the Unit WILL NOT TURN ON!! Not a happy customer!!  And now I have to go through the hassel of repackaging it and shipping it back! What a joke! How about you seller&#x27;s out there make sure the damn product works BEFORE you ship it?</li>
            <li> I had one break after 3 years of usage. Bought another one. For the price its a good value.</li>
            <li> Still catches nose hairs pretty frequently</li>
            <li> Great while it worked but it Stopped working after a few months.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It&#x27;s not magical, but it does the job. It takes some time to get the hang of it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but can pull the hairs at times.</li>
            <li> I put in a battery and it failed to work so I re-charged that battery and I tried again and it still didn&#x27;t work! I finally decided to put in a battery I knew to be functioning from my TV remote and it still didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this was when I got the trimmer fresh out of the box too.</li>
            <li> Does the job well for the price</li>
            <li> Everthing as promised.&lt;br /&gt;this Is the best one that I have ever owned</li>
            <li> My nose hair is removed without hassle, easy cleaning great product</li>
            <li> this product worked well for 31 days - just long enough to go past the allowable return period.  Now it does NOTHING.  I guess I&#x27;ll buy something, but it won&#x27;t be this product.</li>
            <li> By far the best nose hair trimmer I have purchased. This product is easy to use and clean. Gets the shorter hairs as well.</li>
            <li> I bought it primarily to trim my nose hair and it worked just fine, I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> Does the job it was advertised for, trimming nose ear and eye brows. Easy clean-up using the wet feature for cleaning out the hair using tap water. Price is right. I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Used it a couple times, seems really great! Does not tickle or anything.</li>
            <li> This thing rocks. It actually works. I&#x27;ve tried so many of these damn things. Go with this one. You will not regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if it breaks in a couple of months its cheap as dirt, I don&#x27;t care as long as I keep getting results like I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great trimmer.</li>
            <li> This works exactly as described.  Good purchase.  Strong motor.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull  like a lot of others do.</li>
            <li> perfect，but battery cover not easy to open</li>
            <li> This worked once. Literally. Then it died. Then my fiance lost it so we never returned it. Just found it. Still doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> In use this crap twice,  and died today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motor too weak.</li>
            <li> You might have to go over an area a few times to get everything, but this thing is super nice for the price.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I expected</li>
            <li> love it.  works great.</li>
            <li> Either i got a bad pack of 2AAs at Costco or this thing drains power like a maniac.  don&#x27;t chance it.</li>
            <li> This is a great buy. Good price and works like a dream. You can&#x27;t go wrong with it.</li>
            <li> very fragile , dropped once and no longer works.</li>
            <li> Quite weak,  not much good</li>
            <li> Love it. Works great for those pesky nose and ear hairs that grow faster among we members of the senior citizen ilk.</li>
            <li> This works well and is cheap, however the blade assembly is pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;Due to that, it might be that yours stop working like mine did. It looks like it doesn&#x27;t turn on anymore, and there is no motor noise even with a fresh battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If that happens, it means the blade is stuck (when this happens it makes absolutely no noise so its hard to figure out its in fact stuck).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can unstuck it by unscrewing the head (the whole black area is the head and can be unscrewed by hand, counter clockwise. its easy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful not to lose the blade assembly (its a plastic piece with a double tiny blade mounted on it).&lt;br /&gt;Blow in the head, blades, etc to clean it up.&lt;br /&gt;With the blade outside the device, turn the device on and make sure it makes noise/the motor turns on.&lt;br /&gt;Reassemble, enjoy ;)</li>
            <li> As advertised. Good product.</li>
            <li> I finally have a trimmer that works great and that is well built, durable, and not the kind of junk they sell at dollar stores, marshalls, or tjmaxxs for the same price. Get it, this is going to do the work and last you for years. Thanks!</li>
            <li> My husband was very pleased with the way it worked. There was no pull or pain. He would recommend it to anybody.</li>
            <li> Seems to be quiet and easy to operate. If you read the instructions in the language of choice you can even igure out how to keep it clean. Might try to find replacement blade before the unit is off the market.</li>
            <li> First trimmer I have used. Worked out great. Can trim those difficult to get to areas. Easy to clean after. Pretty quiet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have to add this. The first unit I ordered worked for a month or two, and then started draining batteries. A few other reviewers complain of the same. But because there are so many positive reviews, took my chances and ordered a second one. Been 6-7 months now, and haven&#x27;t had to change batteries on this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice - use it more often in the first month, to be sure you didn&#x27;t get a bum unit.</li>
            <li> Just isn&#x27;t as good as the older model I have, its about 10 years old or so. They don&#x27;t make them like they us too.</li>
            <li> This was a little stocking stuffer for Christmas for my husband. It was really more of a joke, but he actually likes it and it works really well!</li>
            <li> After an extensive review, I decided for this product and it really worked as promised. I was surprised how it works without any possible pain.</li>
            <li> This trimmer was great while it lasted - but it broke after six or so uses. It&#x27;s not a battery issue, either. Very disappointing.  And no way to return it.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend got his gift yesterday and he loves it! It is easy to operate, inexpensive, hair doesn&#x27;t get pulled or stuck, can be used either wet or dry. You only need one AA battery to operate it! it is so portable. Would have been better if it has a light like other similar products but overall it&#x27;s a great product!</li>
            <li> Does a poor-to-fair job of trimming nose hair. It drains a battery quickly, even if it is just sitting in a drawer. I would recommend you remove the battery when you are not using the unit.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really realize how visible my nose hair was until I got this and used it. Mother of God. Why didn&#x27;t anyone tell me? Compact, easy to clean, inexpensive, yadda yadda yadda.</li>
            <li> It is really easy to use.  Getting rid of all those unwanted hairs.  Should have gotten this long ago. Just a few senconds couple times a week and I am a new man</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been cutting my nostril hair with small hair-cutting scissors for years. It&#x27;s been absolute hell, painful, and not very efficient. The same goes for the hair on my ears. Finally, I got turned-on to this little gadget from Panasonic. It works like a miracle.  There is absolutely NO PAIN or discomfort! You can hear the little hairs being trimmed away, and that&#x27;s it. You feel great, and well  groomed, in just a few minutes. Be sure to clean it after every use, or  the cutting blade is going to get funky quickly. The instruction manuel gives clear instructions. The only remaining issue in my mind is its longevity. All in all, I would say this item is a must for any male who doesn&#x27;t want to look like a pig (nothing against pigs mind you!). Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Why spend tons of money on something to trim your nose hair?  This is simple and inexpensive.  Just what I needed.  A satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> Yea we needed to finally replace our cheap nose trimmer. This one is very well built and it does the job very well.</li>
            <li> works exactly as described,  nothing else really needs to be said.  Im only writing more because it says more words are required for posting</li>
            <li> I like it. is worth the money for a good trimmer and it stays sharp for a long time. its great</li>
            <li> Really good clean the hair nicely ... I had bought before and did not last long and those one I have for 7 months and works perfect</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing as you get older, you find hair growing in places it shouldn&#x27;t and not growing in places it should.  I looked in a mirror and saw nose hairs and couldn&#x27;t believe it!  I went looking for a trimmer and read the reviews on this one and although it isn&#x27;t as slim and slick as some of the others, it definitely is a great buy.  I love the fact that it works and no pain!</li>
            <li> Perfect for daily use!  Cleaning is extremely easy and works perfectly for me. The design of the product is perfect as well!</li>
            <li> This is the best Nose hair trimmer. you wont regret buying this. Every time I use it and wash it, it reminds me of how reliable this device is. Thanks Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on reviews just like the one I&#x27;m writing now. So far It works very good and is better than the Wahl trimmer I had previous. I feel all these small home electronics are designed pretty well and do work fine for a while, but tend to break down somehow over time. It&#x27;s good they&#x27;re not very expensive. I&#x27;ve only used this trimmer four times, like it and would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price paid. Easy to clean and operate.  I would recommend it to anyone wanting light hair removal.</li>
            <li> This product worked excellent, it came promptly and I feel that it was a very good deal. I highly reccommend this product to others.</li>
            <li> An effective way to trim nose hair, but the trimmer broke in less than a year.  Disappointing that it was made so cheaply.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this trimmer. At first he was a little worried that it might cut him but after giving it a try he loves it. It cuts close to the skin which is nice because you don&#x27;t have to use it every day.</li>
            <li> As a man(?) who doesn&#x27;t grow much facial hair, I don&#x27;t have to shave very often. And because I have an ugly mug, I often go months without looking in the mirror. This created a problem. I used to go to important events with a small number of 3 inch hairs protruding from chin and upper lip. I can&#x27;t blame them for not hiring me. I wouldn&#x27;t hire a goat, either. Because goats can&#x27;t talk, and thus make terrible customer service representatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I found a solution to my problem. You see, I discovered the joy that is the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black. It&#x27;s small enough to fit in my backpack (right between my Phoenix Wright manga and my Nintendo DSi XL), which means I can take it with me and remove disgusting hair and debris from my nose, face, ears, and neck any time I need to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, it lasts a long time in a single battery. I&#x27;ve had it for several months and have not had to change the battery. I figure at the rate I use it, it will last me about 97 years. Thank goodness, &#x27;cause I doubt we&#x27;ll still be using AA batteries when I&#x27;m 127 years old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black does have its flaws. For one, it only effective on small amounts of hair. So for trimming beard and nose hair, it&#x27;s perfect. But it took me about 30 minutes to shave my whole face with it. At that rate, it would take me a couple of days to shave my back. I made this handy chart for reference:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair Source  |  Time to shave&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Nose  |  90 seconds&lt;br /&gt;Beard  |  5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Face  |  30 minutes&lt;br /&gt;Back  |  2 days&lt;br /&gt;Robin Williams&#x27; arms |  Unknown&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black also tends to get a little warm after a minute or two. Not like oven hot, or surface of the sun hot, or even pop-tart filling hot. Just warm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, don&#x27;t put this thing in your ear canal. It sounds like being attacked by a hive of Mike Tysons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this is a great product for trimming nose and face hair. It is a mediocre product for shaving your back. It is a poor product for protecting you from bears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end.s thing in your ear canal. It sounds like being attacked by a hive of Mike Tysons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, this is a great product for trimming nose and face hair. It is a mediocre product for shaving your back. It is a poor product for protecting you from bears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The end.</li>
            <li> Worked great for about 1 week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, started making buzzing noise. It&#x27;s barely trimming any of my nose hair right now.</li>
            <li> This trimmer definately takes care of the nose. . .I haven&#x27;t tried it any place else.  I&#x27;ve also used the Norelco NT9110, which I thought worked well compared to others, but I think the Panasonic Vortex is more thorough with less effort.</li>
            <li> You can really hear it working, the air flow through my nostrils is up by at least 25%.  Its easy to clean as well.  I bought one for my brother as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of these over the years and Panasonic seems to make the best.  Trims closer and has more power than other brands I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Some time ago I purchased a Wahl circular blade trimmer. All it did was whack away at my nose hairs but it had too little power to cut through them so I threw it away and got a Remington Titanium. It started to die on me recently so I decided to give this model a try. I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far but I can say that if you&#x27;re one of those \\&quot;lucky\\&quot; people who have thicker than average nose hairs, this trimmer is up to the task!</li>
            <li> Has worked well so far. Build quality is decent for something in this price range. I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s anything super special, but it does a good job. No pulling or pain involved. Cuts pretty well and is easier to clean than others I&#x27;ve had. It&#x27;s nice to be able to wash it out.</li>
            <li> ...but works really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply put, it works well for exactly what it says it will do.  Tickling makes me the nose hair even more annoying to have, though.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very lightweight. Pretty quiet and effective.  Cleaning feature is a nice touch which separates this model from the others.  Good purchase and highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It works really well. Cleaning is easy. Good build quality. When in operation, it is not too noisy. Could have been cheaper though.</li>
            <li> veryvery good, good size, color chosen. Adjustable exceed expectations. according to the proper use, recomendado al 100% para cualquier persona</li>
            <li> Works great! Easy to use &amp; clean! Great multi purpose trimmer! You won&#x27;t regret your purchase! GREAT!! Buy it today!</li>
            <li> The hair on my head seems to be disappearing, and it seems to be reappearing in my nose and ears. I&#x27;m not sure what evolutionary function this serves, but I needed to get a handle on it. This is my second Panasonic trimmer. The first was dropped on the bathroom floor, and it started making a strange noise, so I needed a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this one, and it works as well as the previous unit. I use it with an Eneloop rechargeable battery, which keeps the cost down. There is no tugging or pulling, and it just does a nice job.</li>
            <li> I just used it for about several times and it&#x27;s broken down and doesn&#x27;t work!&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t fall it on the grond or hit it to anywhere, it just doesn&#x27;t work any more!</li>
            <li> I have only had this for a short time, but so far so good.  It seems to be of good quality so far</li>
            <li> Does a great job on nose and ears. Cleans easily. Highly recommended!  I only wish it came with a free battery</li>
            <li> This product met all my expectations. I would buy this again and I plan to recommend it to my friends</li>
            <li> Before I got this, I was trimming the hair by small pointy scissors, which is pretty dangerous thing to do now that I think about it.&lt;br /&gt;This works very quietly and gets the job done quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I have never known anybody using it, so it was somewhat scarey at first. At times, you can feel the hair being pulled but it&#x27;s nowhere close to the feel of the hair being pulled out. It&#x27;s the same as the shaver, the actual moving parts(the blades) don&#x27;t touch the surface, so even if you push it against the skin, it won&#x27;t hurt the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Even if you understand it in your head, you&#x27;ll still be hesitant to stick that metal in your nose at first.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still on the process of getting used to it and becoming more comfortable of the idea.&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll probably won&#x27;t use it as often as a shaver, so the battery juice last a long time but I still use a rechargeable because I already have it and keep them ready for many other things I have. Even if you decide to use Alkaline, it won&#x27;t be as wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is much easier than cleaning an electric shaver. The amount of hair coming out of it isn&#x27;t that much, I sometimes skip it. When you do clean it, the running water make it very easy.&lt;br /&gt;Most troublesome part of using this is some irritation when the hair grows back and starts poking inside the nose. But it happens even when you use scissors also.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t compare this to other makes and models because this is the first one I ever used. If I ever lost it for some reason, I&#x27;ll probably replace it with the same model or another (battery operated)trimmer, instead of going back to the scissors.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised-but don&#x27;t drop it. Doing so may render it inoperative. Very sensitive instrument. I may have to purchase another.</li>
            <li> Works well, tickles my nose, I need to study how to clean it, a bargain, five more redundant words required.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Panasonic Vortex trimmer to replace a Sharper Image trimmer that I had for a few years.  That trimmer finally wore out.  After receiving the Panasonic, I used it right away.  It is ergonomically correct, easy to use, practically noiseless and no pulling of the nose or ear hair while cutting it.  It seems to be well-made and I particularly like that it is warranteed and the battery life of one AA battery, with normal use, is about two years.  I also like that it comes complete with a cleaning brush and detailed information on washing the blades when needed.  I will recommend this product to other family members as well as my friends who need to purchase or replace a trimmer.  They will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well and is easy to clean.  It only gets 3 stars cuz it reminds me that I have ear and nose hair long enough to trim.</li>
            <li> Does not seem to have the power that I had expected. I normally like Panasonic products but not as happy with this one. I had a different brand that had much more power. This one seems to eat batteries. It is possible that the one I have is just not quite right.</li>
            <li> Quite pleased with item. Thanks.</li>
            <li> Works great, no complaints after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Much better than the cheapo ones at the box stores. Does the job and cleans easily</li>
            <li> I was skeptical as to how well this would work, but it does the trick.  Feels a little cheap in the hand, but for the price, what do you expect?</li>
            <li> Only worked a couple times. Seems like a very cheaply made product.</li>
            <li> Batteries burns out faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> Works, but it drains the batteries really fast.</li>
            <li> WOW! First time using a real nose trimmer and I never knew how much of a difference they make!!! I will never not have one of these again.</li>
            <li> Has lasted two years and still works great. Battery demand seems low. Very easy to clean and dry. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is just what the doctor ordered. Works as advertised. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> GREAT purchase! Best I&#x27;ve ever had!...</li>
            <li> I have been using this device for the last two years and it has worked very well over the years, just washing it out when it starts to slow down.  I did drop the first one I bought in the sink after about a year, oops, then it started making very loud noises, still seemed to work, but the noise was too much.  Excellent ear and nose hair trimmer, highly recommend!</li>
            <li> second one that goes bad within 3 month. I used to trust panasonic products but now no more</li>
            <li> super fast shipping very nice product</li>
            <li> Love it and does the job great</li>
            <li> This works very well and efficiently.  It has been a great addition to the grooming tools that we already had in our home.  The price was right and it came in a very short time.</li>
            <li> My husband and I each have our own Panasonic ER-GN30-K. I couldn&#x27;t bring myself to share it, even though the tip can be rinsed off. We have tried others which have caused nicks in the skin, but so far these have not. Be careful though when removing the tip for cleaning. My husband dropped his tip down the drain and I ended up having to purchase a replacement. I have never taken mine apart, and don&#x27;t think that it is necessary. I just rinse in hot water after each use.</li>
            <li> This is the second trimmer I&#x27;ve owned. The first one lasted years and didn&#x27;t cause any problems. This thing cuts well, but the cutter is so close to the blade that it grabs the skin every time.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer at a cheap price. It&#x27;s easy to clean and take apart. I like the feature where you can clean it while running under a faucet.</li>
            <li> Does the job VERY well.  Sturdy and has not fallen apart like other hair trimmers have</li>
            <li> Works great on nose and ear hair. Not painful and you don&#x27;t really even need to use a mirror. It&#x27;s basically &amp;#34;self guiding&amp;#34; and fool proof.&lt;br /&gt;I was going to post pictures , but I don&#x27;t think you really want to see them .</li>
            <li> Actually works great, with no pain, cuts hard to reach places.</li>
            <li> It works okay.  I feel like it should work better, but maybe having a wicked fast super sharp blade in your nose/ears/wherever wouldn&#x27;t be the best idea.</li>
            <li> This device works great and it relatively inexpensive. Although you have to go over some areas more than once, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I had used a Wahl before and it just didn&#x27;t cut the hair at all. This really works well and is quiet, attractive and even washable.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate with instructions which are WAY too complicated.  Could put instructions easily on one short page- bookenclosed goes on forever.</li>
            <li> This is a simple to use, light-weight product.  Easily trims nose hair--pain free!!  It is easy to clean and store too.  We have had this for about six months and use it every other week and have not needed to change the battery.  Good price for a good product!</li>
            <li> I had nose hair I didn&#x27;t like,  now I don&#x27;t.  Works just like the day I bought it.</li>
            <li> Works well on thick hair. No issues. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift. Looks OK to me</li>
            <li> Works great as advertised.</li>
            <li> I had bought this trimmer about a year ago since I am getting to the age where nose and ear hair need some managing, While i was cleaning it I was startled and dropped a piece down the drain. So i asked my wife to run to Walgreen&#x27;s to get me a trimmer. that trimmer didn&#x27;t cut it so i bout the Panasonic one more time. It cuts well, and its angled head makes getting the nooks and crannies easy. Cleaning is also a breeze. If something happens to this one, I will buy it a third time.</li>
            <li> The motor proved to be just too underpowered to do the job. I don&#x27;t have some crazy nosehairs or anything, but this thing couldn&#x27;t cut it, literally. One use and it would stop, thereby pinching the hair which it would then just pull out. Didn&#x27;t have the strength to actually trim anything. The blades just stop every time I use it. In the trash.</li>
            <li> Worked just as advertised out of the box. Took care of my bothersome nose hairs with no pain at all.</li>
            <li> Fairly quiet machine, and easy to use.  Not sure what else to say about it, other than it definitely does the job it was made to do.  Husband is happy with it.</li>
            <li> This Node Hair Trimmer is working great so far. It seems to cut the hairs without any problem. If it works for 2-3 years I will be happy. I typically need to trim these hairs about once a week.</li>
            <li> Like this small appliance. Good angle built into the unit so it it easier to reach those more remote places.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean. Blade seems sharper  and faster than other similar products I have had..</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Nose, Ear and Facial hair trimmer performed greater than my expectations.  I used it not only to trim the hair in my nose which was irritating me, but also to trim my mustache, and the hair in my ears.  I am extremely pleased with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Died in a few months. Before that did a very good job in trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li> This is good to go ahead on into your nasal and ear hair for a weekly grooming.  Ok for the eyebrows.  Tough getting old.</li>
            <li> I have always used Panasonic nose and facial hair trimmers but this one did not work well for me. It malfunctioned and stopped working shortly after purchase. I replaced batteries but still nothing. I could not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and is better than the previous device I owned.  Easy to use and easy to clean, glad that I got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it both for the nose and the ears and it works spectacularly. It also is built to where you won&#x27;t cut yourself and I can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough. Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> Hate to even admit I need this but nose hair drives me nuts and the other options such as using scissors are no fun.  This works well and is very fairly priced.</li>
            <li> When hair stops growing on your head and starts coming out your nose and ears, this is the tool for you!  This thing is gentle and quiet.  Unlike others, this doesn&#x27;t feel like you put a weed wacker up your nose!</li>
            <li> This nifty little device is quite an invention. It&#x27;s convenient, it runs on a single battery and does the job. A+</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer when it works.  Only lasted for 3 months...before it simply quit working.  I only used about 3 times per month, and cleaned it every time.  Panasonic needs to improve the reliability of this device.</li>
            <li> This is really nicely made.  It trims well.  It&#x27;s easy to clean.  I&#x27;m impressed.  If you need a nose hair trimmer, I recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I had a very old model from Panasonic, and it worked but this new design is must effective to cut. The old model needed to clean taking off the metal blade and with the time it is affected and the motion axel also (finally after 5 years it failed), this new model do not need to disassemble the system so I guess it will last more time. Good, Effective and Simply that&#x27;s what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Heads &amp; shoulders above all the rest !!!!!!!  I tried them all, I put several on a credit card &amp; had to return ALL of them. Bogus advertising, poor engineering led me to the net and further research.&lt;br /&gt;  I purchased one out of the country I had it for years, it was FABULOUS. The key is the bent &amp;#34;angle&amp;#34; in the blade. I was desperate to replace it. Women despise nose &amp; ear hair, and any man in the public eye demands basic proper grooming. This lives up to its features and benefits. Panasonic delivers in the ER-GN30-K!!  I purchased another to keep in back stock, in case they try to &amp;#34;improve&amp;#34; the model. Most folks know what I mean...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually not comfortable sticking anything up my nose other than the occasional finger but this thing is the cat&#x27;s nuts. First surprise was frustration free packaging. Didn&#x27;t have to risk severing an artery to remove it from the box. Opened the bottom, shoved in a cheap AA battery and starting rooting around places I haven&#x27;t been in a while. Gets a little warm after a couple of minutes but not uncomfortably so. Nose? Check! Ears? Check! Eyebrows? Double Check. No pinching, pulling or pain. Now I&#x27;m ready for all the ladies.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, would recomend to men and woman, easy to use,fits hand very well, is much better than straight head razor.</li>
            <li> Havent tried cleaning it yet but overall works good and serves it purpose for nose and ear hair. Great orice</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have found so far.  I have tried others and this one has been the best.  I do wish the motor was just a bit stronger as it seems to get bogged down sometimes.  Keep it clean, use good batteries and will work.</li>
            <li> Works great. Lots of trims per battery. Powerful motor, and the price is awesome.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer gave up the ghost - should have been sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The is a great upgrade over my old one.  Does the job quick and easy.  no more yucky hair where they don&#x27;t belong</li>
            <li> Mine just died randomly after four months of use, before I finished one battery... I thought the battery was dead and replaced it but it just won&#x27;t turn on at all. I&#x27;m not sure why it crapped out, it&#x27;s cheap and not worth my time to warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too bad, it would otherwise have been a great product.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s quiet, smooth and cuts very very well. It doesn&#x27;t rip my booger nets out like the other, more expensive trimmers I have/had. I love the fact it takes regular old batteries too.</li>
            <li> MY HUBBY GIVES IT 2 THUMBS UP!  HE USES IT FOR THOSE PESTY,ICHY, TICKLY HAIRS-WHO HAVE NO LONGER BEEN ANNOYING HIM SINCE I BOUGHT THIS HANDY GADGET!</li>
            <li> Not much to say here but that this nose trimmer works well. It does eat batteries and has an occasional tug, but overall is a good product.</li>
            <li> It works like it is described.</li>
            <li> Nose hair trimmers have come a long way since the last one I bought...about ten years ago.  Excellent!</li>
            <li> Solves a problem well.  Be sure to use full batteries.pulls a little with low batteries. Wordy rating is a pain.  Don&#x27;t appreciate having to do someone else&#x27;s work for them.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with the functionality of this trimmer. Doesn&#x27;t do a complete job for both nose and ear.</li>
            <li> The price wasn&#x27;t too bad, and my nasal passages have never been so hairless. So far this has worked like a peach. Minus the hair.</li>
            <li> The best for cutting unwanted nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Great item for the price can not go wrong , I will recommend this item to any one who needs it</li>
            <li> Great product! Does the job. Keeps nose and ears trimmed nicely.  Handy and fits in my shaving kit. You won&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Easy to use on nose and ear hair. Does not grab or pinch. Tried a couple of things before and this has been the best. Use hearing aids so trimming close is very helpful. Need about once per week.</li>
            <li> I tried one of the little comb looking nose trimmers and it was awful. So I finally got disgusted, threw it in the trash, and ordered this one. Should have bought it the first time. I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Working fine for 6 months, and so far no complaints. Battery life is decent. Give a decent close trim with a few passes. I use mine every other day before a shower. I&#x27;ve found that a bunch of 10 second maintenance jobs is better than hacking away at a forrest every few weeks.</li>
            <li> This shaves my nose hair close, and does not tickle.  Easy to use, easy to clean.  The best part is that there&#x27;s no annoying blade that touches the skin.  Not much more to say, best on the market IMO.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used norelco&#x27;s and other electric trimmers and initially I was turned off by the battery power supply.  This is the best way though, any rechargeable battery will die out on you and require charging before you use it every time.  This one turn it on make sure the batteries are good and awesome results.  No more embarrassing nose hairs, this is the perfect solution.</li>
            <li> very practical&lt;br /&gt;light, invisible in a pocket or brush my teeth, it is well done and thought I highly recommend</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a nose hair trimmer, this one works.  Good battery life.  Smooth, easy to clean, and...it...does...the...job.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it every week, but when I do, it&#x27;s a great, efficient product.  Easy to use...easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I had an older panasonic. This one feels better in the hand and works better.  What makes it noteworthy is that it&#x27;s washable so it gets clean.  Instructions aren&#x27;t great and opening the package was a dangerous ordeal if you don&#x27;t have bolt cutters.    With these you have to be a little brave and it will not hurt at all. If you are timid and pull it away from you, it can pull hair and cause pain, but if you are brave and go slow, no pain :)    The battery compartment of my old panasonic had a fishy smell. I though that was my fault somehow.  The battery compartment for this brand new one also smells like fish so i guess it&#x27;s some manufacturing chemical.    All in all it&#x27;s a good product. If I lost it, I would replace with the same.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer easy to use and no pain. It does a fantastic job and does not pull or pinch or tare no pain. What more can I say :)</li>
            <li> Lightweight and easy to use removes nose and ear hairs in seconds. Cleans up with running water. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It works, but only if you go over the same area again and again and again. It is cheap and you get what you pay for. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Much better them before Panasonic models,&lt;br /&gt;Just do not have the oportunity to prove it with water yet.</li>
            <li> Works great,my husband loves this..</li>
            <li> price cheap, work ok for 1 month , have to change blades but do not know how to order the blades alone ???</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use that you can get carried away with it.  I&#x27;ve used it several times and not a single nick or pull.  Worst part is it tickles the nose a bit but I&#x27;ve not used anything that has worked as easily and well as this.  Easy to clean.  I didn&#x27;t know this but it seems to have a bit of a vacuum on it that retains the hair and then you rinse it out in the sink when you are done.  I didn&#x27;t have any loose hair remaining afterwards and was very impressed after the first use.</li>
            <li> GREAT WORKS like it should</li>
            <li> With my overactive 60-year-old nose hair glands working in overdrive, I use to pull hairs out by the handful, but no more! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of trimmers that clog up, goop up, or just plain work like poop. Not the Panasonic, though-- this one is the real deal: Trims me down to my baby-soft nostril lining in no time, and doesn&#x27;t slime over in the process. Huzzah to the Nose Team at Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Does the deed with efficiency and keeps the nose nice and barren.</li>
            <li> Had it for few days and so far the trimmer works. Bought it for my husband to trim his eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I picked up a cheapo battery powered trimmer from a local drugstore when I got a little older, and hair began migrating from my head to less preferred areas, and while it kind of did the job, I knew there had to be one out there that didn&#x27;t sound like a woodworking tool, didn&#x27;t grab and pull, and just basically did what it was supposed to do...get rid of those annoying little hairs. I spotted this on Amazon, saw the good reviews, have had good results with Panasonic products and decided to purchase this one. What a tremendous upgrade this little trimmer is compared to the one that by the way, was not that much less expensive than this one. The first thing I noticed about this Panasonic trimmer is that it looks and feels like a high quality precision instrument, and it performs the same way. This trimmer eliminates those pesky little hairs cleanly and quietly with no drama. No more worrying about having hairs ripped out by the root or waking the family with a noisy device. I couldn&#x27;t be happier with mine. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> Glad we purchased the Panasonic ER-GN30-K hair remover. The product works great and the price was right. After purchasing it I read a lot of other great reviews about this same product.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a couple months.  In the process of warranty replacement.  I hope the next has a longer life.</li>
            <li> Chopped it up and spit it out. Super powerful trimmer.  It even trimmed the weird crazy bread hairs that pop out of no where...</li>
            <li> I think this is a great trimmer, it cuts close without pulling hairs, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This frankly doesn&#x27;t do that great a job, especially since I have some thick hair. It might work well on easy hair, but is satisfactory on thickish hair.</li>
            <li> This one actually works. I am satisfied.  Price is reasonable.  I would recommend this product to anyone in need of a nose and facial hair trimmer.  Works on eyebrows also.</li>
            <li> Works very well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> This product is handy for so many uses and I love the fact that it is wet/dry.  My boyfriend loves it.  The shipping and delivery was great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned a nose hair trimmer before so I don&#x27;t know what to expect but this one doesn&#x27;t seem worthy of 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t very loud which is nice, unlike clippers or beard trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;It never pulled on hairs or caught on skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem? it doesn&#x27;t CUT my nose hairs too well. I hear the familiar crackling sound as the blades touch my nose hairs but it takes about 5 passes over the same place before the hairs cut and the crackling stops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in short it works but isn&#x27;t as easy and convenient as I anticipated; maybe I expected too much.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!! Cheap and great!!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a spare a several months ago. When I finally put in a battery and tried it, it did not work. Amazon&#x27;s return policy no longer allows me to return it.</li>
            <li> After trying so many other brands, I am completely convinced this is the best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;Powerful and practical for nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Well guys, you get to a certain age and the hair starts sprouting.  My wife had taken to ripping out my nose hairs periodically, and after the last such tear-inducing torture session, I realized that I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore, and that I didn&#x27;t need to.  We have the technology!  So I bought this, put a battery in it, turned it on, and gently inserted it into my nostrils.  Problem solved.&lt;br /&gt;  Now, one nice, (and particularly disgusting) feature of this thing is that it&#x27;s wet/dry, so whatever the moisture condition of your nose or other hairy orifices you wish to groom, you can fearlessly trim away.  And you can rinse it in the sink, too.&lt;br /&gt;  As for me, I am still too young to be one of those old guys with epic nose hair.  This modestly priced grooming tool is my weapon of choice in the escalating war against facial hair that I am now prepared to face.  Arm yourself, and join the fight!</li>
            <li> This Panasonic trimmer is a dream.  Endorsed by Good Housekeeping (why thats not on the product page I don&#x27;t know), best trimmer I have every owned.  No pulling, easy to clean.  I really don&#x27;t write many review but I love, love, love this product!  If you are shopping for a trimmer--I promise you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> Works well and appears to be well made. Used only for ear &amp; nose hair with no problems. Much better then the Wahl and Remington models I have used in the past. Easy to clean. Well worth the $$$ to keep the nasal jungle under control.</li>
            <li> The days of trimming with tweezers is at an end. This ergonomical design is comfortable, and the simplicity of design is unparalleled. The small, but sleek design, fits in a drawer and out of the way when not in use, or sits on the counter as a bold statement that you care. If you have ever spent time trying to get the hairs out of your nose or your ears the old fashioned way, then you know that those hairs are connected to every nerve in your face. Fortunately, Panasonic has found a much better way to get those hairs with no pain. The battery life is a bit lacking, but it is powered by a single battery. he biggest feature is the fact that it is waterproof, and able to be fully submerged in water. This is important for those in a hurry, and take care of all of their grooming in the shower. No need to keep this on the counter, hope you do not forget, and get somewhere when that nose hair starts to tickle your lip. The convenience of being able to use this in the shower really separates this from other brands. Clean up, no problem. It is waterproof. Run it under the sink, and that is it. No need to hand clean the gross nose hairs by hand like the other brands. That is a huge plus to me.</li>
            <li> Convenient  and  easy  to  carry  for  traveling. It  really  works too.  It  did  not  fall apart  due  to poor  quality  .</li>
            <li> Best one ever........</li>
            <li> Well I hate to say I finally own a ear and nose trimmer....... But this is a good one to have. It&#x27;s small,quiet and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> It trims the hairs and easy to clean and use. No hair pulling and trims nicely. Works on nose, face, and ears.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t owned this item very long,  but so far it has met all  required needs.  I would certainly consider purchasing one as a gift for a friend.</li>
            <li> This product stopped working completely after about three months.  I put in a brand new battery and still nothing.  Even when it was working it really didn&#x27;t do much for trimming hair.  Total waste of money.</li>
            <li> It does its job quick easy to handle not heavy first time having one I think ill put it to good use</li>
            <li> Works well enough and the price can&#x27;t be beat.  Still working after a year.</li>
            <li> Works perfect. Priced perfect.</li>
            <li> Its been a great little trimmer so far.  No regrets.</li>
            <li> Before getting the Panasonic, I would just manually pull out my nose hairs, usually with my fingers.  The Panasonic greatly streamlines that process!  It feels compact yet solidly built, and fits comfortably in my hand.  The base has a slight angle which fits nicely into my nostrils.    The various buttons and dials move well, with nary a squeak or rattle.  The Panasonic emits a high pitched whine when in operation, and the blades cut well.  Additionally, it&#x27;s easy to clean, just rotate the dial to the wash position, and rinse under the faucet.    A solid electronic grooming device to add to your collection!</li>
            <li> I first bought this trimmer in 2000 and have been using it 15 years later. I just bought my 3rd one and the only reason is because they naturally do get dull and need to be replaced. But I have never had one stop working. This trimmer is easily cleaned and cuts close without irritation. I will be buying another one when i wear the blades out on this one in several more years. Excellent trimmer buy it!</li>
            <li> i purchased this item about three months ago. It was working as I expected at first. Then, two weeks ago, the motor in it just quite working. I tied to put a new battery in it and it didn&#x27;t fix the problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands of nose hair trimmers that were lousy and I ended up frustrated with the results so I just reverted back to the old tweezer method-ouch! I can honestly say that this is the first nose hair trimmer that has actually worked well.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic trimmer that I bought from Sharper Image that I used for years.  It worked great, but eventually died.  When I looked for a replacement I found out that they didn&#x27;t make that model anymore.  At the time the reviews of the Panasonic trimmers indicated that they weren&#x27;t as good as they used to be, so I bought a Mangroomer one.  The Mangroomer worked well enough but only lasted a year or so (water from rinsing it leaked through the seal into the motor and battery compartment and everything got corroded).  I bought this new model Panasonic about a month ago and found it to be as good as the Panasonics of the past.  The motor is very quiet (much quieter that the Mangroomer) and they have added a little drain hole at the bottom of the base.  This drain hole is important so that water can drain when running water over the cutting head to clean it.  The cutting heads stay cleaner and I haven&#x27;t had to disassemble it to clean the cutting heads, as I had to with past trimmers without the drain hole.  These trimmers are all pretty much the same.  The quiet motor and the little drain hole make this one a little better than the others that I have used.  Only time will be the judge on the durability issue, but overall I think this is well worth the couple of dollars more that this trimmer cost me.</li>
            <li> This works great.  Should have biught one years ago.</li>
            <li> Works as well as expected.  No problems at all.  Very sharp.</li>
            <li> I am one of those poor, unfortunate sots who has a lot of nostril hair. I&#x27;ve used numerous nose hair trimmers with varying degrees of success. When I first used this, I didn&#x27;t think it was doing anything because I felt no tugging as I do with most nose hair trimmers. In fact it was sharp enough that there wasn&#x27;t the typical pull, yet it also didn&#x27;t chafe my nasal cavity at all. A great trim that works quickly and simply. The curved handle also helps with getting into either side at a comfortable, ergonomic angle. This may very well be the last in a long line of trimmers for me.</li>
            <li> Fits my hand perfectly, trims well, and is much less noisy than other trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many and none of them belong in the same category as this product.  Within 2-3 seconds all hair is trimmed all the way down.  This is done cleanly, quietly and quickly with no pain at all.  In fact, the first time you use it you will question whether it did anything at all until you actually check.</li>
            <li> works well no complaints</li>
            <li> Works great!  Not much else to say.</li>
            <li> At our age hair grows out of every place you never expected, except on top of your head! This trimmer does a neat, painless job of removing nasal, ear and eyebrow hair. Cuts quite close and no pulling. Cleaning is a cinch. Twist the top, place the end in hot water while it is running and it pumps water and hair pieces out of the blade area. Removal the top cap, tissue dry the pieces, reassemble. Ready for the next grooming!</li>
            <li> Trims exactly I expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty nice little trimmer.  Definitely better than scissors.  I&#x27;d suggest removing the battery while traveling.  When  traveled recently, the switch moved to the On position and the battery ran out of juice.</li>
            <li> I bought this after reading many glowing reviews online. Unfortunately, I had better luck with my $3 trimmer from E-Bay. The power would not stay on, even with a fresh alkaline battery, as if the battery wasn&#x27;t connecting with the unit. It didn&#x27;t shave as close as my cheaper unit. Finally, after just 6 uses, the tip came apart during use and sent parts flying everywhere. Cheap plastic parts, can&#x27;t believe this has Panasonic&#x27;s name on it.</li>
            <li> You really cant go wrong with this purchase, for me personally, the rotary style trimmer works the best, i also have the philips norelco \\&quot;tube\\&quot; style trimmer, I never got comfortable using it, i found my nose would get irritated with the way you would move the serrated edge of the trimmer within the nostrils. The panasonic&#x27;s rotary trimmer does not have the serration and the circular cutting motion is a lot more comfortable for my nostrils. The \\&quot;run through the faucet\\&quot; way of cleaning it works very well. If you clean it after each use, it stays pretty clean. It works with one AA battery. My last rotary trimmer lasted a couple of years and I would venture to say that if this fails after a couple of years, i would purchase them again.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews on Amazon and decided to give it a try as I was looking for an eyebrow trimmer. This trimmer is a bit small, but it does the trick. It is relatively painless which is good. I think the size is great because it is small enough that it would be good to travel with.</li>
            <li> does the job, good product.</li>
            <li> I just received this item today. Works as advertised. This is my first nose hair trimmer and i am very happy with the result so far. Definitely will recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much ! have a good time !</li>
            <li> It does a good job.  Rally, no complaints.  After I received it, I realized that I had an exact duplicate which I thought didn&#x27;t work.  But guess what???  All it needed was a new battery.  Now I have two of the same and they both work.  I couldn&#x27;t be bothered sending the second one back.  Such is life.!!!  I trust Amazon.  Happy New Year!!</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great.  I saw some reviews that weren&#x27;t so flattering, but our experience with them is good.  They did the job and take up a lot less room than the old trimmer set up we had.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m at 32 year old guy with straight hair.  I&#x27;m not a Neanderthal but I&#x27;m not hairless either.  I use this trimmer on NOSE, EARS, and UNIBROW.  It doesn&#x27;t snag, cut, or cause any other problems.  It just works. AA batteries power it, which is a little annoying but for $12 ish who can complain?  If you want an in-expensive nose hair, ear hair or uni-brow trimmer for a small price this is your trimmer.  It&#x27;s WAY better than plucking nose hairs with your girlfriend&#x27;s tweezers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for my husband - lots of hair growing in the ears, nose, and untamely eyebrows, if they are allowed to go ungroomed.  He gives this trimmer great reviews - doesn&#x27;t pull the hair and easy to use.  He uses it weekly - so it gets used frequently.  I thought the price was right too!  Thumbs up!</li>
            <li> This product does an awesome job. However it&#x27;s brutally fragile. I&#x27;ve had 3 of them. Eventually I drop it and they stop working automatically. Very disappointing. Fortunately, they are pretty cheap and easy to replace.</li>
            <li> Works great, does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to. It was a great gift for my husband who has more trouble with his nose hair than anyone I&#x27;ve ever known. Seriously, it&#x27;s crazy. Anyway, this is a good buy, especially for the price</li>
            <li> Works fine. Good price. Doesn&#x27;t hurt or &amp;#34;bite you&amp;#34; like some trimmers.</li>
            <li> Works great. Close cut and easy cleaning. Bought another Panny at a store close to the name Trys and it sucked. This works great.</li>
            <li> Product is as advertised and works well.  No complaint and satisfied with the purchase. Fits the hand well and does the job.  Amazon continues to put out good products.</li>
            <li> Very nice. I had something similar in the past, but definitely did not work as good as this one. Clean cut</li>
            <li> Amazon notified me that the Panasonic nose trimmer I ordered was out of stock. So today I went to Best Buy and bought one for $2 less. It is outstanding...my ears and nose have not been so clean of hair in a long time. Panasonic makes a great electric razor as well...used many of them for many years.</li>
            <li> For 10 years I have been using a nose hair trimmer by Wahl and I was always satisfied with it. But over the years it got older and older and I needed to buy a new one. After reading all the reviews it seemed like this one was better then the one by wahl.. but it is not. I cringe everytime before I stick these nose hair trimmers into my nose because it pulls your hairs! It is definately not comfortable at all and is much worse than the Wahl that I had 10 years ago. Im going to have to go and buy another one.</li>
            <li> What can I say?  I read the reviews and took the plunge.  My husband is delighted and I am also.  No more nagging about the nose hair.  He just turns it on and they are gone.  It&#x27;s magic!  Thanks to a great seller.</li>
            <li> Only had this product for 24 hours but it definitely does the job! Very easy to use only took me about a minute to clean my nose up and it is very safe. I&#x27;ll admit, I was a little nervous shoving this thing around in my nose (a cut inside the nose would not be fun...) but I get used to it pretty quick and I can&#x27;t really see how you would cut yourself with this tool.</li>
            <li> Product arrived within a couple of days which was a big surprise.  The product has a great feel for Quality and doesn&#x27;t feel cheap like some of the ones I have purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric trimmer I bought and it does the job well without all the hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was previously using a small nose hair scissor and it can be extremely tedious and painful! After using this, there&#x27;s no turning back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- No weird whirling/grinding sound&lt;br /&gt;- No pain and discomfort&lt;br /&gt;- Affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just make sure to clean it thoroughly after every use since I wouldn&#x27;t want bacteria growing, thriving and forming their mini colony there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can now smell the fresh scent of life without any obstruction!</li>
            <li> Works better than most of these trimmers</li>
            <li> I have only used this on a couple of occasions and have found it to be extremely well made and it does an excellent job.  I would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> good tool to get rid of pesky ear and nose hair</li>
            <li> No complaints after using it a half a dozen times. It doesn&#x27;t seize up like other models and has a powerful motor for its size.</li>
            <li> Excellent-Easy to hold N use for both ears N nose.</li>
            <li> Great for nose hair or eyebrow trimming. Easy to clean. Goes everywhere I travel.</li>
            <li> I was using what I thought was a cheap ($9.99) one from Ross a few years back. This one is the real deal. It works VERY well. Strange odor from the batter compartment but otherwise, 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Used 4 times before it stopped working.</li>
            <li> I have purchased three now - none lasted over about 10 uses - it&#x27;s too bad because they work great - until they don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It works as advertised.  My hair has slowed down growing on top and is now sprouting from my nose and ears.  This works, great brand, price is right.</li>
            <li> This is good. I took it for my nose hairs and it works well. I would say go for it.</li>
            <li> A really fine product, high quality, cuts well, but mine will not start unless I take off the end cover ant twist the battery..... Follow up, 2015: No more problems after I have adjusted the connector tabs.</li>
            <li> With advanced age has come a flourishing but unwelcome crop of nose hair, which if left untrimmed starts to tickle annoyingly.  Against this growth, for years I used a Remington \\&quot;cross-cut\\&quot; trimmer. It worked, but this Panasonic rotary trimmer works better and is easier and quicker to use.  It does not, however, completely replace scissors for hairs that lie flat (and tickle the most).  On the other hand, unlike the Remington, which never cut me, the Panasonic has drawn blood three times.  I think what happened is that I used too much pressure trying to get those flat hairs and thereby plowed up a small wrinkle of skin that got through the slots in the trimmer head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore a tip:  move the trimmer lightly across the skin surface.  Pressure is not very helpful anyway.</li>
            <li> Great personal groomer for those pesky hairs</li>
            <li> Love it! I also gave one as a gift. Excellent!</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this. A year later and it&#x27;s still usable and works just as described!</li>
            <li> Works great. Never knew what a jungle was in my nose until I got this.</li>
            <li> You + nose hair &#x3D; not cute&lt;br /&gt;This is the solution to that equation.&lt;br /&gt;Really sleek design and a must for any man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t come with the single AA battery it needs to work</li>
            <li> Bit more &amp;#34;lightweight&amp;#34; than expected.</li>
            <li> I use the trimmer for nose hair only. Does not nick or pull. It does get quite warm during use and I turn it off to cool down if I am not finished yet. All in all, not a bad product for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve wondered about how effective these could be and I am at an age where it is useful. I was pleasantly surprised at how easy it is to use and that it is much safer than I expected. It does get warm quickly, but not dangerously so. My only complaint is that it tickles my nose, making me want to sneeze while using it.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well. Have had for a few months now.</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it to to trim nose hairs and it&#x27;s amazing at it. No worries about it pulling hairs or cutting you at all. I&#x27;m in the military, so it&#x27;s great for trimming my hair from touching my ears. It also saves you the mess since practically all the hair falls inside the tip. Cleaning is easy. Just twist off the top, pull out the blade, brush it down with the included brush, wash if you desire, then put back together.</li>
            <li> Works great....best one I have ever used.</li>
            <li> I gave to my husband and he loves it. .his ears are all smooth now and he loves that it has a nose hair trimmer..It is great</li>
            <li> I am pretty much done with trying to buy this kind of device. I have purchased several different variations of this type of product to no avail. This model does have a decent battery life but other than that not much else is worth noting. Having this get stuck in my nose while I am trimming has not yet happened thankfully. When this product arrives you might be concerned by the cheap feel of it and not want to use it. I have tried using it a few times until I threw it in the trash. It does not have enough power to trim the hairs.</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked very well for the first few weeks, then it began to stop intermittently and eat batteries. It seems like the motor on mine is exceedingly weak. I do not know if I have a defective product, or if all of this model are this way. I expected more from a Panasonic product.</li>
            <li> Hate that I have to use it but it works really good.</li>
            <li> This trimmer work very well, it is light height and works better than the last Panasonic I had. I just hope it lasts longer than my last one.</li>
            <li> This is the only trimmer which works on my tough hair.</li>
            <li> Works as described .Doesn&#x27;t feel overtly cheap. At this cost worth the buy</li>
            <li> cool for few weeks but easy to be broken</li>
            <li> This is a second one. First one lasted barely one year. Not good but tolerable.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try another. This one 2 months. That&#x27;s it. Piece of crap.</li>
            <li> Rotary round is the way to go for nose hair.</li>
            <li> WOrks great!  Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Bought one a week ago. Great job and better than the Philips.</li>
            <li> My first trimmer finally died to I switched to this Panasonic model. It&#x27;s a bit heavy and cumbersome to clean but otherwise has worked quite well. Not too loud, easy on the batteries.</li>
            <li> No more nose hair tickles.....works perfectly!</li>
            <li> Broke after using it a couple times</li>
            <li> Very nice. I love the easy wash out with water.</li>
            <li> Bought one of these a few weeks ago. Used it maybe twice. Knocked it off the bathroom counter onto the floor just now. No longer functional, might as well have been made of glass. I will replace it with a different make, see if that does any better.</li>
            <li> Lasted 2 months now just makes noise and blade doesn&#x27;t spin</li>
            <li> The speed seems to change from time to time.  Not sure if it&#x27;s the battery connection or just what.  Other than that, it works well and good design.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer. It works great...can work around tough places your scissors or the larger trimmers cant. Works on batteries which may be good for some people. About precision...it can precisely do the job you want it to do. The only negative it has is that it can get hot after running for a while so your skin feels the warmth when you try it..this might be a problem for those people who have extremely sensitive skin...but otherwise it is a great buy for all other people and it won&#x27;t hurt when you are trimming (in case any one had any doubts)!</li>
            <li> Stop working after a month!</li>
            <li> Great Product. Works just like it says</li>
            <li> Had an old Remington PG350 beard trimmer with 4 attachment.  While the flat blades have worked fine, the nose hair trimmer was worthless.&lt;br /&gt;Bought this one based on Amazon reviewer ratings (Thanks reviewers).  ONE USE AND I WAS HOOKED! I could not believe how well this trimmed those nasty, unsightly nose hair. And all with one double A battery.  It did a such a great job that I may only need to use it as often as I trim my hair.&lt;br /&gt;GUYS GO FOR IT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blessings,&lt;br /&gt;John 20:29</li>
            <li> works well for trimming nose hair and ear hair, as well as hair in between the brows.  Battery life seems good and it is easy to clean since it has a waterproof mode</li>
            <li> Works good, seems to heat up but not bothersome.</li>
            <li> Broke after 3 months and light use.</li>
            <li> Panasonic ER-GN30-K is the best nose trimmer I have ever used, and I have used at least 4 different models.  The cleaning system is wonderful; I highly recommend doing a water cleans after each use!</li>
            <li> I have purchased/used several trimmers over the years.  This little $12 piece gives me the best, most consistent results.  A quick pass every week or so, and no worries!  Others I&#x27;ve tried leave you with a hanger or two that just stick out more because now they&#x27;re being showcased.  Not with this little guy.  And it&#x27;s easy to clean.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping and great item. I would give it a 5 stars &#x27;cause it is very comfortable and safer than other used in the past. Thank you &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I bought it dude to its good review and I am pleased with it.  Not perfect.  Some hairs you need to go over a few times and you need to think where the hairs are and keep hitting that area.  Cleaning is easy.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift in December 2012. My husband uses it quite regularly for all of its functions (ears, nose, eyebrows, etc), and it is still working great and only now in 2014 did we have to change the battery. I really thought this would be a \\&quot;you get what you pay for\\&quot; type product, but clearly it is not. I cannot be more satisfied with this.</li>
            <li> My own personal nasal hedge trimmer that actually works, I guess the double blade cutting action is the thing to look for in these devices.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an okay product. Nothing special. A little big and bulky and the motor doesn&#x27;t seem to have much power (even with fresh batteries), so it can take a while to get the job done, but, eventually it does get the job done. I&#x27;m not sure what a 5 star nose and ear hair trimmer should look like (nor is it on my bucket list), but... if you need to get the job done and you&#x27;re on a budget - this one works.</li>
            <li> It works fine. Just make sure to have fresh batteries.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer. Easy to use. Does the job. Liked it. But be careful when washing it. Bcoz contain a little thing inside that comes out and can be easily lost.</li>
            <li> Died after two months.</li>
            <li> This the trimmer you want, with the cylinder type cutter, as opposed to any others.</li>
            <li> Great invention, it works :)</li>
            <li> Does the job! We&#x27;ll see if it lasts longer than the usual year a nose hair trimmer lasts (with infrequent use).</li>
            <li> Cheap plastic. Had it for about 6 months.  Used it once every 2 weeks for a very limited time then it stopped working.  Not a good product.</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do; used it for nose hair.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for fathers day. Feel like there should always be some sort of dad gift in the loot. So i got it sort of as a joke. He loved these more than anything he got. He has raved about them though non stop. He said these are the best nose clippers he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
            <li> Got it on a gold box sale for a lot less than it&#x27;s worth. This trimmer is worth every cent. It handles my thick italian hairs pretty well and that&#x27;s saying something!</li>
            <li> Great device to get rid of the unsightly hairs--would recommend to others</li>
            <li> Works well, and doesn&#x27;t pull hair. It does tend to use up batteries quick but for how it works well worth it.</li>
            <li> My old &amp;#34;Harbor-Freight&amp;#34; nose hair razor worked better than this one...Got it for a few dollars.  Use is easy, but the power just is not there.  Sorry!  BLESSINGS in HIM!</li>
            <li> this really works,  I do use it.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! I used it for my dogs facial m ear fur.. Very quiet and it is easy to use n clean.. It doesn&#x27;t cause cutting on the face and its pretty good. My dogs like it more than tweezers.. Safer too.</li>
            <li> You know your getting old when you have to buy one of these.  It has been easy to use. Tickless when first using, but once to get use to it it does a great job tamming those out of control ear and nose hairs. I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> when received it I put a battery and only worked for about a minute hasn&#x27;t worked since not worth sending back yes I tried a new battery and also 2 more still doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> This is as described and works very well so far.  A few years ago I had a simalar item which was frustrating to say the least.  This one does the job and is easy to use.  It cuts and does not pull.</li>
            <li> Pulls nose hairs, get ready for some some tearful eyes.  Just ordered a Wahl to see if it&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic nose clipper 10 years back and it just wore out. I&#x27;m glad they improved on the product and I&#x27;m glad I was able to purchase one. It came just in time.</li>
            <li> Got for my boyfriend and world great no complaints. No nicks or pulling sensation at all.</li>
            <li> over a year and still working for my dogs hair nose</li>
            <li> for a cheap nose ear hairtrimmer this has not let me down.  I will probably purchase this model again when my current one is finished.</li>
            <li> Really decent, my last trimmer was a Panasonic I bought in 1987. I&#x27;ve been having trouble with the on/off switch not working. The last time I traveled, my bag was humming when I picked it up.  The trimmer was on. This is much quieter than the old one and gives you a wet option to clean. Also, I like the matte finish.</li>
            <li> This is nothign to write 5 stars about.  It&#x27;s a eat and nose trimmer that you can rinse.  I had an aolder Panasonic trimmer from the late 90&#x27;s.  It stopped working a few months after I got it.  I hope the same doesn&#x27;t happen to this one...</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer, Only complain I have is its fragile.&lt;br /&gt;I just broke my 2nd trimmer with same reason, slipped from my hand and drop on the sink that was less than foot.</li>
            <li> i bought one of these a year ago, and for a year I really liked it a lot. It seemed easy to use, quiet, and most importantly, very effective. No problems at all. Then, last week, I bobbled it and it dropped into the bathroom sink. Nothing dramatic, just a 2 foot fall from my face into the sink. At that point, something happened to it where it got real noisy, and stopped cutting properly. I took the cutting head apart and tried to re-adjust it, but no matter what, I couldn&#x27;t get it back working the way it was. So I just bought another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I highly recommend this, but knocking one star off for what seems to me like poor durability.</li>
            <li> I bought this a little over a year ago.  Since then, I have used it maybe a dozen or so times.  When it worked, it was effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product will no longer function.  Turning it on does nothing.  I have tried replacing the battery with several with no result.  I can no longer return the product through Amazon.  I am really disappointed that such a low-use product that does not require a great amount of components could just stop working.  I will never recommend this product to anyone, anything with such low reliability especially from an established company such as Panasonic should not be on the shelves to begin with.</li>
            <li> I HAVE OWN TWO OTHER BRANDS AND HANDS DOWN THIS BABY IS THE BEES KNEES,,, HONEST GUYS THIS ONE REALY WORKS...</li>
            <li> Never worked. I bought this for my husband, I placed the batteries inside and it didn&#x27;t work. I figured I needed to buy other newer batteries.  Well, by the time we bought batteries and tried the trimmer it was too late to return. I would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Good value.</li>
            <li> Great price, very good construction, I wish I could get replacement blade as it has gotten dull, and a replacement head as I dropped it and the head is out of shape, but MEN does a excellent job other wise.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t want to need it, but if you do, for the price, this is the best one i&#x27;ve found</li>
            <li> I had been using a tired battery, hence my previous critical review. This item rocks because of its controls which allow one to adjust its rpms to suit one&#x27;s individual needs.</li>
            <li> Works awesome as a nose or ear mower!</li>
            <li> Good product. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> I think this is a good product that works well. It&#x27;s great that you can use it dry or wet and it&#x27;s easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It did the job after 1 use, but the next time I picked it up to turn it on when I flicked the switch it was completely dead. Checked through many batteries and it wouldn&#x27;t work, so it wasn&#x27;t the power source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It felt cheaply made and the cost wasn&#x27;t worth all the effort to try and use utilize its warranty. Lastly, Amazon forgot to include the invoice with this purchase so a bummer experience all around.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex lasted a single use and then broke. Don&#x27;t buy. It is a terrible, awful, despicable, unsusable product.</li>
            <li> just ok, no more comment</li>
            <li> i used it once, when i first got it, then my nose hair got stuck in the cutters, i panic, so that was a scary thing to witness. This product Sucks!</li>
            <li> This works very well and quickly.  A lot of the Nose Hair trimmers work slowly, and you must go over the area repeatedly.  This is very efficient, and gets everything in one or two passes.</li>
            <li> Not the sharpest clipper I&#x27;ve owned. I have had a Panasonic in the past and it was awesome. This product has changed for the worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very good at fixing things up to use it.  UI would say it&#x27;s OK but probably not recommend it.</li>
            <li> It works great. Easy to break down and clean. I&#x27;m still on the first round of batteries. The only thing I wish – wish it was rechargeable. But you can&#x27;t have everything.</li>
            <li> Nose hair be gone.  Best one around.  I have owned 3 different ones.  Buy this one!  Now stop reading reviews.</li>
            <li> Works at expected.  No issues so far.</li>
            <li> Husband and I both love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve surprised myself with how much I use this. My electric razor is great for shaving my face, but when it comes to trimming ear/nose/eyebrow hair this thing comes in clutch ever time. Super easy to use and clean- this thing makes basic grooming a breeze.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned two of these and both have broken within a few months.  Do not buy!</li>
            <li> So far so good.  This thing works great.  It&#x27;s painless and does a nice job.  Wished I&#x27;d bought one years ago.</li>
            <li> I, Nigel Reddingwood the III, suffer from Hypertrichosis or Ambras Syndrome. You may know be well aware of this but it is the disease of having a ridculous amount of body hair. I&#x27;ve searched from the Atlantic to the Pacific in search of a trimmer to help and this once gave me hope. I&#x27;m personally hurt because of the great reviews on this product. Literally I&#x27;m in pain the trimmer tore hair and a little skin off of my face. I gave it mercy and tried it on my nose only to discover it was entangled in my nose hairs. Seeing as how I live in the deep woods and am writing this from an e-ternet cafe in unknown location of London (you understand the secrecy) I had to walk 28 kilometers to the hospital. Now this hospital was an old goat herder&#x27;s hut who used shears but you take what you can get out in the boonies of England. You heathens at Panasonic have let Nigel Reddingwood down again and now I can never trust hair trimmers again. Learn how to make the trimmer better in all areas. Good luck sirs,&lt;br /&gt;Nigel Reddingwood III</li>
            <li> This my second Panasonic trimmer and it does a good job of trimming, but eats batteries.  I use in very infrequently and often the find the battery weak when I do use it.</li>
            <li> Works just fine - what can you say about a nose/ear hair trimmer? Now I have a better sense of smell? Women find me more attractive? This product will guarantee you a date with a super-model? No problems with the product after 5 months of use. But keep in mind, I&#x27;m not a member of any type of nose/ear hair trimmer testing club. Who in their right mind is reviewing nose hair trimmers these days anyway (I guess me)?</li>
            <li> This works well. Like anything else that cuts things, make sure to not get too over-zealous with it. I actually like that it is battery powered so I can get rid of some of the cords in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> I find myself using this once every 3 weeks and it&#x27;s been awesome. Does exactly what it says for ear and facial hair and cleaning is a breeze.</li>
            <li> Great unit from one of the worlds best providers of products</li>
            <li> Works as described. Not that powerful but it has yet to jam on me or anything like that.</li>
            <li> be careful very sharp, works well.</li>
            <li> Great tool! THe onky downside it doesn´t have a rechargable battery.</li>
            <li> Lasted 3 yrs. So last week i bought 2 more. Buy two &amp; keep them labeled separate: use shapie label 1st for ears and 2nd for nose. Germs of nose shouldn&#x27;t go in your ears. I reuse my hydrogen peroxide mouthwash in paper cup and run these Panasonic nose trimmer submerged in peroxide spit cup. Kept it germ free and sharp for 3 yrs. Confirmed buyer i am.  Others rinse in rubbing alcohol or mouthwash. So inexpensive be germ free. Firewall nose mucus germs away from ear. Don&#x27;t clean with antibacterial soap it dulls tiny rotating blades.</li>
            <li> Even simple minded me could figure out how to use this item. If you want a hair trimmer then this is as good as it gets</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Been using it regularly for over 3 years and don&#x27;t have a single complaint. Blades are still extremely sharp, never pulls a hair, so easy to clean and a battery lasts forever. I just wish more companies could make a solid product like this that lasts and is economical.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve had yet.  Works in the ears and nose,  Gets them all.</li>
            <li> Works great I recommend for any one five stars a++</li>
            <li> I purchased this so my husband can cut the hair that grows in his ears and nose. It worked just as it was designed to.</li>
            <li> Not as powerful as I had wanted</li>
            <li> This product works extremely well and is easy to clean. Battery life is great. It cuts cleanly without pulling or irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two of these due to dropping one and having it land right on the trimmer tip. They both worked flawlessly and I wouldn&#x27;t even bother looking for anything different.</li>
            <li> After using this product, I am thoroughly impressed.  I have used a handful of nose hair trimmers over the years and this one is truly the best.  It made quick work of what was a fairly trimmed nose (as in, not unruly).  I can&#x27;t speak for the longevity of this particular model, but in my experience, even with the &#x27;cheapest&#x27; models, longevity has never been the issue.  I will update as soon.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t even work😒...</li>
            <li> Works well.  Bought it a year ago and still working.  Haven&#x27;t had to change the batteries yet.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> Product arrived a lot sooner than expected. Works great. Love that its battery operated so it can used on the go if running late.</li>
            <li> Probably the best nose and ear hair (etc) buzzer you can find. My son stole my first one, so I quickly ordered another one. Inexpensive and delivers.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on customer reviews and it worked great for about 3 months and then it stopped working completely.  I am going to have to purchase a new one from a different company now.</li>
            <li> Works well. Quiet and pain free.</li>
            <li> Working well so far.  Pretty good price, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m imagining this thing filmed in slo-mo with a macro chopping down the forest of unwanted hair with logs spinning off, falling and bouncing off the bottom of the sink and I have to say it works rather well. Works pretty good in real time too.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, but it worked as advertised.  I have tried one or two other clippers and they didn&#x27;t work at all, so I am pleased so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had four other trimmers before and they all sucked! This one however, is fantastic!!! HIGHLY recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works.. Not much I can say..</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer that I have bought that actually works great product</li>
            <li> Have been using 2 trimmers made in China before this one and each either malfunctioned or broke at some point. I have been lucky to get this one on sale at $12 and it has been working well for me ever since. The design looks good and quality feels better compared  to previous trimmers, yet it still made in China and has feature that allows rinsing with soap and water which is neat as I don&#x27;t have to disassemble and clean occasionally like I did China-made trimmer which I suspect was reason behind one of them breaking. Today everything is made in China which has it&#x27;s reputation for low quality but what people don&#x27;t realize that with years China manufacturing got a lot better and today you can find same product in low quality and good quality. So when you buy similar products, make sure you buy from known brand from quality perspective like Panasonic in this case.</li>
            <li> Only used it once but it did a good job on the nose and ear hair. My nose dosn&#x27;t tickle anymore.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  just for your  nose and it&#x27;s just okay  at that</li>
            <li> This product replaces a previous Panasonic nose and ear trimmer in which the cutting blades became dull and started &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; nose hairs instead of cutting....ouch. This new unit is a slight model upgrade and seems to be working well and the battery lasts a bit longer than the original. This one is angled and allows a better grip to removing the ear hair. Its working good, is fair priced and I&#x27;m a happy camper.</li>
            <li> A wonderful product, and I am using on a daily basis and there is no any problem in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would advise everyone to buy this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best regards</li>
            <li> Good mini machine, fitting exactly what my boyfriend&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li> Works great, but it is my second Panasonic Trimmer in two years and I question durability of the product. If this one breaks in less then two years, I&#x27;ll change my ratings from four stars to something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 11-14-14&lt;br /&gt;Downgraded from four to one star. It stopped working after 10 times of use (previous one lasted for almost two years). I Need to look at a different brand.</li>
            <li> Good price and does the job.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever purchased or used in decades. Easy to use and easy to clean. The initial quality of the product lends confidence that I will not be needing to buy another unit for years to come (replacement blades the exception).</li>
            <li> No more dangling hairs or concerns that the scissors are going to cut more than they should...  Well worth a few bucks to clean the excess.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for keeping your nose and ears tidy.  I like it so much, I have given it as a gift to 4 hairy-nosed friends/relatives.  It is easy to use and easy to clean.  Runs on a battery and I have yet to change it after a year and a half.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I tried this trimmer. I thought it would snag and pull hairs but it does not. In fact it tickles a little. The tip comes off for easy cleaning after each use. I wish I had bought it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> Owned for couple months now - I think this is a really good product.  Cheap enough that if it fails, I will just buy another, but it seems to work really really well, without any discomfort, just does what I thought it would do.</li>
            <li> Be careful not to accidently knock this against the sink edge (don&#x27;t ask, sigh) and if you do, and the head comes off, and the blade drops out and goes down the sink drain, and you retrieve it from the drain (don&#x27;t ask, sigh), don&#x27;t expect the trimmer to be as quiet as it was new.... Having said that, very easy to use, easy on the battery, quiet and effective. But don&#x27;t drop it onto the sink.....</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for my husband.  He says the quality is great and does just what is needed to take care of the hair.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic cuts closer than other basic trimmers. A dual blade system cuts to a shorter length. Just get it.</li>
            <li> I just got this (13.35 with tax) and opened it up and it is really nice and works like a charm. Takes an AA battery to power it. But...when I opened the battery compartment for the first time an incredibly fowl fish odor about knocked me down. The smell only lasted a few seconds, but wow. The only thing I can figure is it must be some type of oil or grease used in the battery compartment somewhere or up in the unit. It went away almost immediately but noticed that when I would replace the battery cover and let it sit for a bit and then open it back up, I would be hit by that smell again. Maybe I will let it sit open for a couple days to see if it will go away. It does not smell when the battery cover is closed so no worries. It does work great for nose/ears though so the stink cost it 1 star.</li>
            <li> I used it 3 times, then it broke. It might be cheap, but really not worth the money. Just buy a good, expensive one, and save yourself the hustle.</li>
            <li> we travel a lot and need trims to supplement std razor shaves. This unit works the best of the ones we have tried. Personal care choices are so &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s size is good, battery performance is good and since we aren&#x27;t heavy users, the blade appears to hold well.</li>
            <li> It seems a difficult thing to find a facial hair trimmer that works. We followed the directions and nothing....meaning that this little trimmer removed very little if any hair. Still in search of a trimmer that works</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for quite a while and it has worked out great. Some unfortunate genetics have given me more nose hair than is probably strictly necessary and I used to use tiny scissors to trim it.  This is much faster and has the added benefit of not cutting the inside of my nose if I&#x27;m not careful. The head comes off easily for cleaning and is easy to put back together.</li>
            <li> Purchased product about a month ago and it stoped working. Called panasonic service number and was told to ship product to Texas. WHAT A JOKE.. This trimmer costed me $12.25 and they want me to spend another $6.00. on shipping.They could have just shipped me the part that was defective. That would have been a better business practice. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer at this price which does the job perfectly. No noise and well designed cleaning operation. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Great nose hair trimmer! Price and quality were just what I was looking for. The product is advertised as a nose/ear trimmer as well as a facial trimmer. Although it does trim facial hair, it does take a lot of time because the shaver part is quite small. Overall exactly what I was looking for though.</li>
            <li> I received this trimmer in April 2014 and was very pleased with it.  If I rated this product a week after I bought it, I would have given it 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to October 2014...just 6 months later.  I have used this product probably 5 or 6 times in the 6 months since I have owned it.  I went to use the product the other day and it was kaput.  There was no issue with the battery (I checked by replacing the battery with a brand new battery).  The unit just stopped working.  Won&#x27;t turn on at all.  Very disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyers beware that this product may stop working after a very short period of time.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Very low noise.  No discomfort.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m thrilled with this trimmer, but it works, and it was cheap.  Therefore, it&#x27;s as-advertised and I&#x27;m going to give it 4 stars.  I just don&#x27;t find it as effective as I&#x27;d hoped.  But again, it does work, it just takes awhile.</li>
            <li> It took over 10 years for my previous Panasonic trimmer to degrade (it still worked...just not very well), so there was no question about which unit to replace it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, it&#x27;s great.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> very quick and easy for trimming nose hair</li>
            <li> My husband love this nose trimmer. He uses it on a weekly basis easy to clean and maintain. Glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> This was bought for a gift and my boyfriend liked it. Works just as expected, nothing much else to say!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer after reading the good reviews.  After using this a few times I finally threw it in the trash because it kept nicking the inside of my nose which was predictably very painful.  I even kept using it for a while thinking I might just need to get used to it but after the fifth or sixth time I trashed it.</li>
            <li> If this had 10 stars I would have given it 10! My husband is over joyed with this trimmer.  I have spent so much time &amp; money trying different trimmers &amp; none did the job.  Finally I found this Panasonic trimmer &amp; will never buy another brand of trimmer again. Not as expensive as others but boy oh boy does it do the job!!!!  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> works great and is nicely compact havent had  single problem with it for ear nose and eyebrow even parts of mustache</li>
            <li> Meh, its okay. The contacts aren&#x27;t too great and it has a parasitic loss(over the course of 2 months of not using, the unit was out of power and had corrosion at the terminals. The corrosion was easy enough to clean up, but the contacts needed to be stretched afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is reasonably powerful and it is really easy to clean. Its pretty good for the price, but there was another one that I got that was a couple dollars more that used 2 batteries over the course of 2 years! So, yeah, its okay, it does the job.</li>
            <li> It is functional.  You know, there are just so many bthings you things you can say about the device,basing. t would</li>
            <li> What can I say, it does the job on unwanted hair!  Have not tried it wet.</li>
            <li> it gets every little hair that it suppose to get, they did not lie when they said it was the best.  we have tried many brands and this one tops them all</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a trimmer, this is the one to buy.  Double edge blades cut well no matter what angle you have the trimmer at with absolutely no pulling. A nice clean quiet cutter.  The best I ever owned.  Panasonic, a great product at a great price.</li>
            <li> Serves a purpose although not as effective as the manual twisting type. Good value for the price, always keep one on hand.</li>
            <li> Does the job at a very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This is ok and works but I picked up a different brand at Target that worked much better</li>
            <li> I use this religiously! I even use it for trimming my goatee. I love how this is cleaned out by water and uses a regular battery (I use a rechargeable).</li>
            <li> Product works very well; Quick and easy with no pulling or tearing; Lightweight and easy to clean; Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great little product. Cut my pesky little nose hairs in no time. Though be careful that you don&#x27;t get to wild like I did. The first day or so it felt like little prickers after the initial cut. It&#x27;s been a week now and all is well. Definitely will cut other problem areas as well. Easy to clean. Nice and compact for travel.</li>
            <li> For the 3 days this item worked, it worked well.  However, I dropped it off my counter approximately 3-3 1/2 feet on to a carpeted floor and it no longer works.  I can&#x27;t believe a simple item like this is so delicate.  I would not recommend the item based on my experience and the other reviewers who have had the same experience.  I should have listened to them.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer but be careful not to drop the small blade parts into the drain while cleaning it. Takes only one aaa battery.</li>
            <li> works great...keep my bushes trimmed nicely</li>
            <li> It is very good and does a thorough job! Would recommend over other comparable models even by Panasonic.  Double Edge blade does wonders !</li>
            <li> My family member really liked and appreciated this gift. He is 93 yrs. old and has arthritis in his hands. This made the task very simple and smooth.. a great product choice!</li>
            <li> Works great.  The tiny blade inside will inevitably need to be replaced so I decided to go ahead and buy the replacement.  I paid $14 for the trimmer here on Amazon.  The only place I could find a replacement blade is Panasonic.  They want $22 for a replacement little blade.  This is infuriating.  Obviously when the blade goes I&#x27;ll just buy another trimmer.  Next time I&#x27;ll try to find a brand with inexpensive replacement blades.</li>
            <li> If you open it to clean inside, you will see how fragile it is.&lt;br /&gt;For $12 though, it does the job...</li>
            <li> Works well, just think it should have more power!</li>
            <li> It does a nice job....easy and painless.  I would buy again.  Stay with a good name.</li>
            <li> Low price!  Good quality!  Quick delivery!</li>
            <li> not the quality i expected, the deal was perfect everything fine by the seller</li>
            <li> I seem to go thru these damn things every 6 months or so. I saw the reviews for this one and added it to my list when it was 18 bucks. I got an alert that the price went to 12 and I figured I&#x27;d give it a try. After using it once I can already tell it will last a while and work well. I&#x27;d get another one if it died within a year even.</li>
            <li> Good price, great performance, simple to clean. Works way better than the interchangeable attachments I&#x27;ve used on various beard trimmers. It cuts pretty short so for the first day or two afterwards, if you squeeze your nose it hurts a little because of the short prickly hairs. Can&#x27;t think of any cons except maybe the instructions could be a little clearer on what positions to turn the various \\&quot;knobs\\&quot; for cleaning, taking apart, changing the battery, etc.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that a nose hair trimmer would be something easy to settle upon, but the variety that are available on Amazon begs to differ. This little guy gets the job done easily and with minimal pain. I have used it for a year now on the same battery. It does get warm after using it for a couple minutes, but not warm enough to cause discomfort.</li>
            <li> Not really fast, you need to pass a lot of time at the same place for have the best cut... But its not expensive and easy to carry.</li>
            <li> I have used many nose-hair trimmers over the years, however find that their quality all rapidly deteriorate after weekly usage. This one I must say has lasted me quite a while and the quality of the trim has yet to disappoint me. The trims I get are safe and quick which is all I need when I am rushing out the door before a day at work.</li>
            <li> Poor quality product. Unit was defective out of the box. The metal contacts had to be bent to function. Called Panasonic since it had a 2 year warranty. They would not reimburse mailing product back or refund the price. Amazon would make it easier to return and be reimbursed.</li>
            <li> decent quality and good price.</li>
            <li> I&amp;#34;m sorry that you need this. But if you think you do, then you probably do. It&#x27;s pretty lightweight, so I&#x27;m not expecting it to outlive me, but the battery seems to hold a charge, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do quickly and well and it&#x27;s easy to rinse and clean. It has never cut me or pulled my hair out either, which is nice. Someday, ear and nose hair will be all the rage, but until that fine day . . . .</li>
            <li> It cuts the hair without pinching. Very little maintenance required.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found the Panasonic brand to be the best trimmers so far...and this one has a much more solid design!</li>
            <li> This is a little smaller than I expected and it feels a little cheap, but it works. Just like the product name implies it is for nose and ear hair. I wouldn&#x27;t plan on using this to trim your beard/mustache at all thought, it is just not built for that kind of work. If you need a groomer to handle thicker hair like a beard or manscape-ing I would look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Works very good! Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Works well for the nasal hair, but you have to really push it hard.</li>
            <li> Out of the box it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> very happy with this - works great and is easy to use and reliable.</li>
            <li> It works well so far (one month).  Trims very close.  Runs quiet and smooth.  Will report again if I run into any of the problems reported in these reviews, but for now, so far, so good.  I would recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Beats using a small pair of sissors</li>
            <li> Excellent product, doesn´t snag the hairs as my old one did .</li>
            <li> It works very good. its easy, light and cuts fine.</li>
            <li> 30th birthday gift for son</li>
            <li> Very nice...durable...easy to clean. Well worth the (low) price. Way better than my previous trimmer. The ergonomic curve allows you to really attack hairs at a good angle. No pinching at all.</li>
            <li> easy to use and clean, works excellent</li>
            <li> A little strange to use at first - the tip is a little different from the ones I&#x27;ve used in the past. It also tickles ALOT more than the others I&#x27;ve used - I end up with watery eyes and my nose feels tingly for about 10 minutes after. Weird. I do like how it has the little switch so it can be used with water, though. Very nice. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> A good choice after viewing all of the clipper products on the Amazon site.  The tool is light weight, easy to hold, and cuts great.  The blade trims facial hair close and comfortably. Recommend it to any guy !</li>
            <li> Nice little trimmer, works well and gives a clean close nostril shave.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend just love it. enough?</li>
            <li> This product is a great buy. I purchased it as a replacement and I&#x27;m very pleased with the results. Easy to operate and clean. I also gave one to a friend who thinks it is fantastic! This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> This trimmer left the inside of my nose feeling as smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom.  Not really, but it&#x27;s a very good trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Powerful enough to trim coarse hair with no snagging or cutting. I never felt like my skin was in danger.&lt;br /&gt;- End cap protects the trimming components, which is a nice touch.&lt;br /&gt;- Solid build.  This feels durable enough to last a while.&lt;br /&gt;- Comfortable enough to hold, although I can&#x27;t imagine needing to hold this for a really long time.&lt;br /&gt;- Washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- A lot of reviews describe this product as failing fairly quickly.  If mine fails, I&#x27;ll update the review.  But for now, it&#x27;s been working great.&lt;br /&gt;- They used to sell this as a two-pack for a low price, but now the two-pack is not cost-efficient.  Not sure why you&#x27;d need two.  Maybe one for each nostril.</li>
            <li> Works great, not a lot to say ..</li>
            <li> These things have come a long way. I had 1 or 2 of these years ago and they didn&#x27;t work very well. This one takes me a minute to trim my nose hairs after I shave. Beats the small scissors I&#x27;ve been using all these years.</li>
            <li> Great little grooming tool.</li>
            <li> Thus far, it works  fine!</li>
            <li> Keeps the grass neatly trimmed</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these through the years. So far this is the best one yet.&lt;br /&gt;It works quite well.</li>
            <li> Horrible, died after 2 uses and was stored properly in a dry room not in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic wants me to pay to ship it for repair. Not worth the hassle after looking at other reviewers.&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy something else.</li>
            <li> This product worked absolutely great for a while; the best I have ever had. Unfortunately it only lasted 1 months Had high hopes for the product but the durability is poor.i also had new battery could save it, and yes I triple checked that I inserted the battery correctly. at the end of the day go some place else</li>
            <li> Works perfectly !  Quality made</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 1 use. Useless product.</li>
            <li> I have owned this nose hair trimmer for approximately 2 years.  It&#x27;s amazing to me how this little trimmer can chew through thick tough nose hairs.  In that two years I&#x27;ve had to replace the batteries once.  I am just now at the point I need a new cutting blade.  When dull it will start pulling hair more frequently.  When new it instantly shaved the hair so you never feel it.  When allowed to get dull it can be uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s ergonomics are excellent.  When I was looking for a new trimmer (my prior trimmer of 15+ years had failed) I based my purchase upon the reviews.  Upon receipt I was stunned by how petite it appeared.  It was so thin and when it powered up seemed to have such a quiet and small motor.  To my surprise it was just an example of just how far the technology had advanced. Much smaller units but quiet powerful motors that last very long on a a single set of batteries.  I haven&#x27;t used rechargeable batteries but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s performance would also be still very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negative I see is cleaning it out.  Since it&#x27;s so small, so is the collection area.  It does rinse quite easily though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the blade, I&#x27;d say two years is quite admirable.  My Braun Shaver requires blade replacement about as frequently.  I switch off between blade and shaver often so it&#x27;s use, although more frequent, is similar.  The ER-GN30 has a very small blade so I&#x27;m quite surprised it hasn&#x27;t required replacement sooner than now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a very good purchase.  Even at two years I&#x27;m still surprised just how well it performs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope your experience with the Panasonic ER-GN30 nose hair trimmer is as stellar as mine.</li>
            <li> Does what its supposed to do</li>
            <li> works great and just as described.</li>
            <li> Works great with no pulling of nose or ear hairs.</li>
            <li> Nice size, works very well!</li>
            <li> This does the job, but my first one died after about 18 months. Maybe that&#x27;s to be expected with a less expensive item like this, but I&#x27;d gladly pay extra for something more reliable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Haven&#x27;t tried to clean it yet, but works very well.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is timid compared to a previous Panasonic model I had.</li>
            <li> Very fragile, the tip can be bent if then the blades will not work.  Inop after two weeks of purchase and three uses.</li>
            <li> This works as expected, good value for the money.</li>
            <li> Not to big, not too small - it fits the orifice quite nicely and doesn&#x27;t tug and pull at the sides. Quite a pleasant experience using it, really, and it certainly feels firm and comfortable in your hand.</li>
            <li> Nice little trimmer, battery powered.  Tickles a bit when I first used it but it works decently.  Not very loud and it&#x27;s compact enough to keep around or travel with.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer. A little flimsy, just as many other&#x27;s. Trims nose and ear hair well. Great for the price.</li>
            <li> This thing is really nice.  It does what its supposed to when its supposed to and it doesn&#x27;t pull hairs...exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Product working fine so far.</li>
            <li> not bad, better than pulling it out</li>
            <li> Fantastic products dies exactly what it says..&lt;br /&gt;5 stars.</li>
            <li> Very reliable.  This is my second one since I broke my first nose trimmer by accident.  Does its job and have no problems with this device.</li>
            <li> Very prompt delivery.  Fine product - as advertised</li>
            <li> I replaced on older Panasonic hair trimmer.  This new one is a huge improvement.  I think it rotates faster and cuts the hair much easier, with no pulling.  That&#x27;s a break!</li>
            <li> It works very well, pleasantly surprised!</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product. It eats the battery quickly and it work very slow and it does hurt your nose and other areas when trimming the hair....Another cheap Panasonic product that should be FREE!</li>
            <li> Works great- no issues!</li>
            <li> it works great, love that it is easy to clean too</li>
            <li> Just bought my second one! The first one lasted for about three years, functions as expected, no complaints. My only wish is that they would include multiple heads, when my got dull I just bought a new device.</li>
            <li> Bought circa November 2011, still going strong till now (Jun 2015). Easy to remove head to brush away hair, rinse under running water and oil.&lt;br /&gt;Works great on an Eneloop LSD battery which means it&#x27;s great for travel.</li>
            <li> Excellent for trimming nose hairs. I no longer look like I have chia-pets up each nostril.</li>
            <li> This Trimmer arrived quickly and undamaged. It works well and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> Work great! Nice product.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  So easy to use and it got to me before I expected it to.</li>
            <li> It died 6 weeks after purchase, and return option expired at 4 weeks. Ugh. Wasted money.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to use. Works great!</li>
            <li> So far it works really well and cleans up easily.</li>
            <li> Great hair trimmer!  I&#x27;ve had several trimmers in the past that died quickly or pulled rather than trimmed but this one is a winner.</li>
            <li> It sucks getting old, but at least I can keep my nose and ear hair trimmed nicely!  So much better than those crappy trimmers you find at the grocery store.</li>
            <li> Does not work that good on Ear Hair - just moves it around, wish I didn&#x27;t throw away my old one</li>
            <li> Good Quality.. Good Price</li>
            <li> Purchased for my husband.  He says they work well. We have never purchased a similar product so we can&#x27;t compare. Seems to be a good value for the money.</li>
            <li> it works.. what more can i say...</li>
            <li> Works great.... gets rid of those unwanted little hairs...</li>
            <li> This is the best product of it&#x27;s kind that I have found.  It&#x27;s curved shape is greate because it prevents the unit from rolling on a small shelf or from the sink to the ground - genius.</li>
            <li> When I was a teenager, I had a dentist with a bad nose hair problem.  I promised myself that if my nose hairs ever grew too long, I would trim them.  This tool does the trick.  It cuts the nose hairs very well.  Thankfully, I have not yet grown ear hair, so I cannot comment on its ability to cut it.  It works okay on eyebrows.  I use my hair trimmer and a comb for the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Just tried this and so far works great.  Cleans the hairs out of the nostrils so no more pesky hairs.  Works well in ear hair removal.  Cleans up nicely and simple to disassemble.  Battery power and only use sporadically so should last good , long time. Tickles the nose.</li>
            <li> It works like it should and wasnt to expensive.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer works well for nose and ear hair trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also will allow you to quickly touch up your mustache around the lip area.</li>
            <li> I gave this trimmer to my husband on his birthday (6-20-12) and he loves it. It&#x27;s the best trimmer he has owned.</li>
            <li> This little clipper is great.  It gets into hard to reach places.  And you will not cet cut.  Just get one</li>
            <li> Small and light this is a great timmer.  I like that it has the cutters on one side so I can target what I am trimming.  Comes with attachments to allow for timming while still leaving some length.  Use a couple of AAA batteries.</li>
            <li> Could not believe how good it is. After 5 mins the hairs in nose and ears are non-existent after being wookie-like for years!&lt;br /&gt;Blades are sharp and safe. Great value!&lt;br /&gt;JB</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer by Panasonic is well designed. It seems to spin at a high rate, may be cleaned under water, and has a nice tactile feel. Cutting action does not seem to be superior to other brands. It cuts and cannot be said to not do the job, but it does not trim hair exceptionally well. It also goes slowly and noisily. Nonetheless, the price is in the right range and the other features of this trimmer make it a good buy.</li>
            <li> I had clippers that were getting dull. Compared to new scissors, Panasonic was competitive in price. Works well and is versatile.</li>
            <li> Works quietly and efficiently.</li>
            <li> product sent on time and does all that it is suppose to. Works well and has all the attachments needed. Couldn&#x27;t expect anything else for the price.</li>
            <li> I think my hair grows more slowly after I started using this because it realized the futility.</li>
            <li> This worked well, so much better than the micro-touch product which was worthless</li>
            <li> Fits in the hand, does what it&#x27;s supposed to.  Solid feeling and comes apart easily to clean.  Even has a neat, little chute through which you flush water.  Way too much fun early in the morning.</li>
            <li> What more can I say. I used this to trim my nose hair and it did a great job. It&#x27;s not bad for the price either.</li>
            <li> works well been using this for at least 6 months. wet dry feature is nice since it sits on my counter next to my sink. Overall a good buy.</li>
            <li> works great!  FAST shipping!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tim</li>
            <li> Low-profile trimmer that will go anywhere without even a hint of a pinch or pulled hair. I&#x27;ve gone so far as to use this trimmer to even out the lines on my beard and it works great. I&#x27;m a few weeks into my first battery with regular use and there&#x27;s no sign of low juice yet.</li>
            <li> This really works great. I&#x27;m glad I went with the good reveiws.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of all my nose hairs, no pain and no more stray hairs. Easy to clean!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for my nose. It gets the job done, but could maybe have been more efficient. Guess it is a safety-comfort vs efficiency issue, so all in all, i&#x27;d rather spend a couple of more minutes on it, that having it cutting me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also own a Philips Norelco NT9110/60 Nose and Ear Trimmer, which was more efficient, but really cut me a couple of times. I prefer the panasonic.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to clean WELL with the wet dry design.  Likely better than the more expensive model.</li>
            <li> As some negative comment on ear hair trimming, I was a little concerning about this Panasonic Trimmer. Today I unpacked and tested over nose, ear and eyebrows trimming. Simply perfect.  Why want to spend more money.  Small and effective. I like to recommend!!</li>
            <li> I dropped my 15 year old Panasonic &#x27;personal groomer&#x27; and the tip must have bent slightly because noise level increased and the cutting was not as good as before the fall.  When I shopped for a Panasonic replacement I was concerned about the negative comments in several reviews but decided to go ahead and give it a try based on my past experience with the brand and the relatively low price ..... and all the other products seemed to have even lower ratings.  This trimmer is excellent ---- cuts the hair well and is easy to clean under the faucet.  Go for it!</li>
            <li> Well, it took me 30 mins to search what&#x27;s the best model and why. I plunge for Er-GN30-K for one reason- if it&#x27;s that bad... The the other 4,896 people would have destroy the site! Just kidding- the machine works well and it is as simple and portable as shared. More important, good quality!</li>
            <li> It does a through job of trimming  most of the hairs in the nostrils with a touch up here and there.  I check my nostrils  daily but it seems I need a trim maybe once a week. or so.  The one thing I like about the Panasonic is that it has 360 degree rotating blades which makes&lt;br /&gt;it simpler to trim 360 degrees.  There is a stainless thimble-shaped-safety-cover which fits over the rotating blades that permit nostril hairs to be trimmed but avoiding direct contact of the blades to the skin. The blades are very sharp &amp; according to instructions extra blades are available for purchase.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t trim anything.  Looks great, but works terrible.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best type of device for the job.  I tried the other type, [[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110/60 Nose and Ear Trimmer]] and it doesn&#x27;t even hold a candle to the Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Awesome bugger forest remover... Sick of all of the trees growin in the ol&#x27; bat cave? this one rocks. Plus its washable (i didnt know that when i bought it!) so you can clean it out with hot water if you unearth burried treasures.</li>
            <li> This is the best product of it&#x27;s kind. It&#x27;s not perfect, leaves hair sometimes but pretty good all the same.</li>
            <li> I have 4 clippers. This one is the best, I&#x27;m throwing the others away. The design is so efficient that you only need to use it occasionally. I think the trick is how fast the motor runs and the fact that it can be rinsed under running water.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.  I am a woman and had never done this before. I love it</li>
            <li> This is poorly built and does not cut ear or nose hairs neatly or closely.  It is torture to use and a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> Tip is too small to effectively cover areas. .  It is difficult  and time consuming to to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Worked better than expected, easy to use, not much clean up. This is the first one I&#x27;ve ever used and it was simple.</li>
            <li> My nose hair runs in pure fear when I pull these from the drawer.  Overall I am very pleased with the trimming ability and wet/dry aspects of this product.  Clip the hair and leave them running while you rinse them off.  Highly recommended for those of us with an aversion to nose hair.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, and to clean. The best part is that you get an excellent product for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> This nose trimmer is sharp, small, handy and easy to clean. Exactly for what i was looking for and very easy to use!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m really reviewing this, which means anyone reading this knows that I use an electronic device to remove nose hairs and stray body hairs. I like that you can use it wet or dry. The small size makes it sweet to fit into my cosmetic drawer. I would definitely recommend this and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> You get old.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You start plucking nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You start getting pimples inside your nostrils that would make you swear your wife&#x27;s childbirth pains could not possibly compare to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You google and learn that it&#x27;s probably due to infections from ingrown nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You buy this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You pass on the Vicodin.</li>
            <li> I used to have Panasonic Made in Japan trimmer for years and it worked great. This one, after a couple weeks, lost it steam (batteries are new) and cutting sharpness. Below average. Will not recommend and buy again. Unfortunately, return time has passed.</li>
            <li> Works better than a couple of other trimmers (different technology/method) I have bought in the past.  No pain in trimming, and it gets all the hairs that are hard to get to with other trimmers.</li>
            <li> Nothing says &amp;#34;ungroomed,&amp;#34; like a white untrimmed nose hair in a very tan senior nose. Now? No worries. Easy to use and easy to clean. Works great!</li>
            <li> This trimmer cuts very close, and rinses off easily. I&#x27;ve owned two different trimmers in the past, and neither was as good as this one.</li>
            <li> Works good, doesn&#x27;t cut too low and easy to use. Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs. I had previously bought one of those $10 cheap trimmers you see on TV which lasted like a month. Threw it away and bought this one and am very pleased!</li>
            <li> So far so good, no pulled hairs that bring tears to your eyes.  The ability to rinse with water is also a plus.  You could say this product wins by a nose.&lt;br /&gt;Prompt shipment.</li>
            <li> works very good no more hairy nostrils. I am in sales and don&#x27;t need people staring at my nose hairs...LOL!</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed. Got tired of those wimpy things that don&#x27;t cut squat. I&#x27;ve gone through several different trimmers over the past few years and now I found one that works the way it should. Exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> trims close and fast in meh nose. no more fuzzy. last a while on a battery. use say every 3-4 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting a trimmer like this for a while, and couldn&#x27;t pass up the good price I saw here. Pros: Easy to use, makes trimming a cinch, easy to clean, saves alot of time over using the scissor method. Cons: none so far. For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong with this. One word of caution: You can use the water rinse method to clean this, but if you take the trimmer section apart like I do to make sure its spotless, make sure you use a steady hand. The blades could very easily get bent and render this useless.</li>
            <li> I, like other excited users, was very pleased with it&#x27;s performance, it worked great, very close cut, powerful, easy to use, etc... performed great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However!  After a few uses(about 8 or so) I heard this horrendous grinding noise and the tip got really hot and even quit working... At first I thought replacing the battery...still the same problem...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long story short, the blades inside the head are spring controlled.... after a few uses the springs just bust out and pushes the blades harshly against the tip head..thus creating the grinding noise that makes the battery and motor wear out..on top of that it inhibits cutting abilities(I tried it 3 times... by now it just rips out hairs if it can catch any...otherwise it&#x27;s not really working at all).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted this to work.... it&#x27;s a shame because it performed great the first few times, but like many(read the reviews!!!  The good ones are from excited users who had just purchased it... I  was like that too...as it performs good...then later, by design it fails....)  My unit is not a lone, I have heard this from many other people who have owned this device....  They need to fix this issue by finding out how to retain those springs that hold the blades in.</li>
            <li> This product meets my needs for ears and nose[[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]]. I only wish is that I had this product years ago already.</li>
            <li> This product is great. It is much more quiet than the previous one I had. It shaves really close without pulling the hair(s). It seems as I get older hair is migrating from where I want it - to where I do not want it. This takes care of the latter half of that problem. Thanks.</li>
            <li> I love it. The trim is smooth and clean. Easy clean up with a quick rinse. Battery is lasting a long time. I&#x27;m sold on it.</li>
            <li> It is a completely effective item, clears the nasal passage very well.  In addition, I have a mustache and it does a great job of trimming the area immediately beneath the nose which is impossible to reach with my electric shaver/trimmer.  It gets five stars because it does not disappoint in any way.</li>
            <li> The blade is very fragile and costs $13.63. The customer service didn&#x27;t want to here any argument and hang up the phone on my face. If you decide to buy it, be very careful with it. Even though I washed the blade after every use it start making buzzing noise.</li>
            <li> Excellent Facial Shaver.......You would want to have this, shaves deep.....this is what every man should have. and it is washable....Good quality shaver I must confess!</li>
            <li> Once upon a time..... I had a Panasonic trimmer, but over time, it eventually stopped working  (Dropped one too many times on its little trimmer head).  My local retailer stopped carrying the Panasonics, so I was forced to purchase what they had.  Much to my dismay, \\&quot;Brand X\\&quot; just never seemed to do an adequate job..... and it hurt!  I should have been concerned when the instructions said something about \\&quot;getting used to the cutting head\\&quot; or something to that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well.... after two or three of those little beasts, I just happened to remember my favorite site..... Amazon.com of course.  Got on my browser, went to the site, and with much trepidation, I cautiously typed in \\&quot;Panasonic trimmer\\&quot;.... With lightening speed, Amazon returned the results..... was it possible.... Yes!, it was.  There was the long lost Panasonic trimmer AND.... bonus.... it had been updated with a new design.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to add it to my Cart and press Order.  Oh the excitement when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, yes.... I almost forgot... the review.  I love this trimmer.  It is hands down the best trimmer for my ever changing hair growth patterns... you know what I&#x27;m talking about.  It doesn&#x27;t pull, hurt or take that \\&quot;getting used to\\&quot; like those \\&quot;Brand X\\&quot; trimmers.  It does its job and it does it well.  My recommendation... stay away from those Brand X trimmers.... get the one that gets the job done.  Oh.... and what did I do with those Brand X trimmers.... Threw them out of course.</li>
            <li> Works well on nose hair. Operates silently and trims hair without pulling. Feels perfectly safe, won&#x27;t even pop a balloon if placed against it. Just wish they had one that was a little less sexy and more utilitarian at a slightly lower price.</li>
            <li> $12 bucks can you really complain? i bought this as a travel trimmer. i already had a $70+ dollar one but i wanted a backup to just keep in my suitcase. this works very well.</li>
            <li> No more humiliation when getting caught occasionally \\&quot;plucking\\&quot; nose hairs when they tickle; no more out of control sneezing from the pain when occasionally \\&quot;plucking\\&quot; nose hairs when they tickle; no more kids picking their nose as they watch you, assuming you&#x27;re doing the same when you&#x27;re really just \\&quot;plucking\\&quot; nose hairs when they tickle...  this inexpensive tool solves it all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a bit worried, at first, after a few sitcoms spoofed this type of product.  I could just imagine this getting wound up, grabbing and HOLDING a few nose hairs, and getting lodged for some hilarious pain bringing fun, but this trimmer conquers the job without even a wince.  At first, just the sound might have you leary, but I&#x27;ve grown confident in this trimmer.  No tugs, no yanks, no pulls, just a smooth trim and go.  It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, easy to store and does all it says it will do!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the product.  It works well, it is painless to use, and it is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> excellent works very well</li>
            <li> For the price,product did not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> I bought it with the Panasonic brand in mind.  It does the work much better than any other trimmers I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Very good! Does it&#x27;s work perfectly.</li>
            <li> This is a very easy product to use and clean. Batteries last a long time even if used daily. I would recommend to anyone with unsightly nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Have no complaints, this Panasonic nose/ facial hair trimmer gets the job done! Have only used it a handful of times but have nothing to report in regards to cons about it, and it is extremely easy to clean with whatever method you choose.</li>
            <li> For such a low price I didn&#x27;t expect such a nice product. The design is nicely compact. I really like how it can easily be cleaned. Of course, it clips away those pesky nose hairs like its nothing.</li>
            <li> recommend quality product like all Panasonic products</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t begin to say how much I love this device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So simple to use! Does not cause me any irritation at all either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my uni brow, it helps me keep it under control. I also have some weird lip hair in strange places. But this thing takes care of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just keep it at my desk for everyday use. It is battery powered, so no charging necessary..</li>
            <li> He has told me it is easy to use, and does not hurt.&lt;br /&gt;Because of this, he is actully using it! Looks his best.&lt;br /&gt;Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> My fear with ordering one of these was that it would occasionally pull a nose hair instead of cutting it, and those are very sensitive hairs to pull. But after using this every 2 or 3 weeks for a few months, I have had zero pulled hairs. It works well for making sure I don&#x27;t have a bunch of terrifying thick black tree trunks poking out of my nostrils, threatening to claw people in the face who are unfortunate enough to have a face-to-face conversation with me. Crisis: Averted.</li>
            <li> My wife and I believe in keeping a neat and professional appearance and now that I am 35 I have to keep up with the areas that use to not require so much attention. This is the third small area hair trimmer that I have owned and as long as it lasts I do not intend on getting another any time soon. It&#x27;s well built and it has a very nice ergonomic design. It reaches every area that it was intended to take care of. I am not disappointed and I don&#x27;t think you will be either.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I had hoped.  It&#x27;s OK.</li>
            <li> Works great. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great product by a great company. This thing does exactly what it is advertised to do. Keeps your hands out your nose, and does all the work for you.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, the blades are inside the head.  You have to move it around to get a close cut on ear/nose hair - this can be somewhat annoying but once it catches the intended area it does it job well.  Uses one (1) AA battery.  I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower so I cannot vouch for the water resistance.  Overall, its a great product and inexpensive.  I am very happy that I purchased this item over the trash on TV infomercials and other significantly more expensive products.  Nice and small, has a cap for the top and it is not loud.</li>
            <li> Have owned and used this product for 3 months now.  I have only used it for nose hair, but it does that job perfectly.  The reverse water cleaning mode was an added bonus that I didn&#x27;t expect for the cost.  Another bonus - I haven&#x27;t had to change the battery yet!  This product works as described.</li>
            <li> Replaced an old unit of a different brand which had lasted for years.  Hoping this one gives equal long service.  So far works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It works!  Hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. Says it&#x27;s the best one he&#x27;s ever used.</li>
            <li> Being 6&#x27; 2\\&quot; has mostly been a positive, but time does cruel things to a man, and high on the list of those cruelties is the sudden and rapid growth of nose and ear hair.  I swear, it was almost overnight that I went from having no such hairs to having hairs long enough to braid, and those poor souls who are shorter than me are stuck looking up at that every time they talk to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic trimmer has been a very effective and simple solution. Do you look and feel stupid using it?  Pretty much.  But do you look and feel normal walking around in public?  Yes!  The trimmer is very easy to use, but does include an instruction manual if you prefer specific details.  These are handy for properly cleaning and maintaining the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is small but well constructed.  It has 2 speed settings and effectively manages hair in the nose, ears but can also be used on facial hair and eyebrows. It is completely painless. The unit is easily cleaned and includes a small brush for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a well built, high quality trimmer at a very reasonable price.  I give it my highest recommendation as it&#x27;s been worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been given things like this in the past - most worked so so&lt;br /&gt;This unit is very user friendly - cuts cleanly - no tugging on nose or ear hairs.</li>
            <li> Great quality.  Work great without probs.  Easy to clean</li>
            <li> It is just not what I expected it to be, my husband does not like it at all.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  I wish it were a little more powerful, but otherwise it is fine.</li>
            <li> As good as the weed whacker, I was beginning to have to braid them!</li>
            <li> Works OK if you like some of the hair in your nose pulled out instead of cut. Ouch!</li>
            <li> A good trimmer for my nose forest.</li>
            <li> It works great . I wish I would have bought sooner.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good, could have a cleaner cutting head.</li>
            <li> STOPPED WORKING AFTER TWO WEEKS.  DONE WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
            <li> Was skeptical until I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Construction is not metal, but feels solid to hold.&lt;br /&gt;It does what it does great.&lt;br /&gt;Glad I ordered it...</li>
            <li> Lasted basically a year, but with the two year warranty it worked out as a good purchase for the price.  I actually went with a Wahl this time around, for basically the same price and we&#x27;ll see how that one works out.</li>
            <li> Great for those hard to reach nose hairs, it really does the trick</li>
            <li> does a great job its fast and sharp</li>
            <li> Works fine. But the con is tip could be narrower for better nose access</li>
            <li> Woks perfectly. Super easy to use</li>
            <li> Stopped working after two uses.</li>
            <li> Does an ok job. Not as good as the one I bought years ago that finally wore out.</li>
            <li> This product works great for the price.  It does not seem too sturdy, so I am not entirely confident that it will last.  However, it works exactly as advertised for a fair price.</li>
            <li> As i stated in my review for my ER430K, I bought this item in order to use its blade as a replacement part for my much older ER430K. Basically, both units use the same blade assembly which is listed at Panasonic&#x27;s web site and other online merchants for $20 (incl s&amp;h). Instead, I am purchasing this $13 unit for its $20 blade to go in my $22 unit. I prefer the other unit because it has a built in vacuum to clean up as it does its job. This one forgoes that feature in favor of a water pass through system. Now if only Panasonic would come up with a unit with both systems and actually sell a reasonably priced blade...</li>
            <li> This is great for the price.  Works the best of any other brands I have bought.  My husband loves it and uses it with ease.</li>
            <li> I bought this by mistake to remove fine female facial hair. this is meant to be used for nose and ear hairs!!</li>
            <li> Does what it suppose to do satisfactorily !! My only complain is the warranty.The warranty is only valid within US..So be sure to read the user&#x27;s manual carefully before using !!</li>
            <li> Very well designed and engineered. They thought of everything from wet/dry usage and the angel of the handle to easy cleaning options. This is a well priced, excellent product</li>
            <li> This works as described and was shipped fast. Make sure you either have a double a battery or can get one before you plan on using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was simple to install. Just pop the bottom open and put the double a battery in and you&#x27;re ready to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it to detail trim my moustache and around where it connects to my goatee to give a nice, well groomed appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, not to get too down and dirty with the hygiene here, but I trimmed any nose hairs I could find with it too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ha! And if you think that&#x27;s gross, it would be grosser to not trim your nose hairs and let hair grow out of your nose. That makes you gross.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And don&#x27;t pretend you don&#x27;t have hair in your nose, because everyone does. It&#x27;s there to protect you from accidental inhaling of dangerous substances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But because I like to stay perfectly groomed, I just zap those suckers with this trimmer the moment I detect one trying to grow and this thing works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> Works well for what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Trims everything as needed&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts a fair amount of time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CON:&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes it&#x27;s a but under powered when the battery starts to get low</li>
            <li> works great and easy to use</li>
            <li> Does the job well. My nose hairs are now well mown.</li>
            <li> Just wish that it had more flexibility  in trimming even hairs on the face.  Just really takes care of the nose and ears.</li>
            <li> Could be a little more compact, but other than that, functions perfectly.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used this product much since it arrived.  So far I like the product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your. money on this.  I put a brand new battery in my brand new trimmer.  After about 5 seconds it pulled hair out of my nose that was so painful it brought tears to my eyes.  Garbage!!</li>
            <li> Works really well.  I clean it with rubbing alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Keeps if from getting sticky or clogged.</li>
            <li> was surprise of the trim I was getting although not shapes like a traditional knife shaped trimmer. no pull of any hair. I used it for ear nose mustache sideburn hair, no pull no pain as advertised, the waterproof cleaning makes it a better buy even. battery life is great too</li>
            <li> lots of power and good shape</li>
            <li> This is a decent quality trimmer for the price. It does the job but am not sure how well it will hold on over a year, Electric / powered grooming products typically are made and feel more robust and sturdier than this unit.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and efficient.  Much better than the cheap $1.00 ones you can buy on eBay that are shipped directly from China.</li>
            <li> By far the best I have ever bought?i have had many others but none that works as well as this one.</li>
            <li> I never imagined buying one of these things because real men don&#x27;t.  Well,.. as real men age, unsightly hair can get more so.  I put my money down and the device was out of the box as soon as it arrived.  This thing works great.  Its low tech and does exactly what its supposed to to without having to stick scissors near or inside body cavities where they don&#x27;t belong.  Safety alone makes it worth the purchase.  The trimmer quickly and precisely removes nose, eyebrow and ear fuzz in a conservative manner so you don&#x27;t feel like your going over your body parts with a lawn mower.  I think I read a review complaining about the fact that it takes batteries.  Really?  1 AA.  That&#x27;s it.  While I wouldn&#x27;t take it into the shower you can rinse it with water and its ready to go the next time.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Lasted 6 weeks, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This is the best nose and ear trimmer I have ever owned. Very comfortable to hold, attractive design and it works perfectly. The best feature is the little drain built in so that the blade can be rinsed and dried. A lot of thought and good engineering went into this.</li>
            <li> Good product.  A litter bit hard to get everything to come apart for cleaning,  but other than that it gets the job done. Be careful when using it or you can cut yourself.  Not a bad product for the price</li>
            <li> This little thing is awesome. It works well and rarely misses any hairs, and it&#x27;s super easy to clean. And the fact that it&#x27;s waterproof just makes it even better. It&#x27;s a real joy to find a trimmer this effective for the price Amazon sells it for. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> this does the job well, no pulling of hairs &amp; it crops them close as well, when the battery is dying it gets slow</li>
            <li> To start, I am a 25 year old mostly-Italian male. My nose hair grows in thicker every year. I tried a cheaper Panasonic nose hair trimmer, the one with the light on it, and it worked very well but died after 2 months. I tried an Andis nose hair trimmer also but it was terrible and barely cut anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is my third trimmer in 6 months now. Although the battery was a little awkward to put in correctly(yes, the battery), that&#x27;s where any and all complaints I had with this product ended. The trim is so incredibly close and with such little effort, no pulling, and such ease. I highly recommend this product to anyone frustrated with trying to find a nose hair trimmer that actually works well. This product is also very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The product is also made with a slight curve as to better maneuver inside your nostrils, and believe me it does make a difference. The product feels sturdier and better made than the other&#x27;s I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I will update this review if I run into any issues in the future, but I don&#x27;t foresee anything changing.</li>
            <li> I have used several Panasonic trimmers before, and no one works better than this one. It works great and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> In my experience many trimmers don&#x27;t have very powerful motors, or they fail in some other way after a short time.  This trimmer has plenty of guts to do the job.</li>
            <li> I got this item in late January of 2014 and it was DOA by the end of 2014. I only used it about 8-10 times at most (always dry). But after multiple battery changes, it would not come on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like it much anyway. It sort of grabbed at the hairs instead of cutting them upon coming in contact, making it uncomfortable and even painful on occassion. Very dissapointed in Panasonic for this product.</li>
            <li> I used it three times and it works. However, it seems like it is starting to die down. I will be pissed if it breaks. You better believe I&#x27;ll ask for my money back as well. There seems to be a lot of complaints about these things breaking after a few uses. I GUESS WE SHOULD ALL REALIZE, THEY ARE MADE IN &amp;#34;CHINA&amp;#34; And you know how that goes.</li>
            <li> easy to grip, I like the slight angle.  I prefer the rotary one to straight edge clippers that i&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> Perfect product.  Works great.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has helped to keep things a bit more neat and tidy in the nostril region. Gets a bit warm while in-use which can be awkward at first but overall this does an excellent job and is easy to clean. Knowing that it works on alkaline batteries instead of rechargeables is a relief so that I don&#x27;t have to throw it out once the battery dies.</li>
            <li> Debated spending a tiny bit less with other models, but this one is awesome.  A gift for my father, it&#x27;s been one of the best ear/nose trimmers he&#x27;s had.  And the added features are really nice bonuses.  (Think my husband has his eye on one too!)</li>
            <li> I had this for a month and it didn&#x27;t really work well and it recently just stopped working completely. such a waste of my money</li>
            <li> First when it lost rpm speed I thought I had the bad battery.After replacing 3 of them I realized the motor of the trimmer is not getting power any more. Very sad to see reliable in the past brand Panasonic losing the quality in this days.</li>
            <li> I am in my 60&#x27;s and hair starts to grow in places it never did before--places you don&#x27;t want it to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, I was a little skeptical about ordering this product.  I wondered if it would cut the inside of my nostrils or pull the sensitive hairs it was cutting.  I was pleasantly surprised to find it is gentle but efficient.  It does what it is supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vendor shipped this product quickly too.</li>
            <li> I wish it trimmed closer but it does an ok job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving it a four because it works much better than the previous two I purchased (Wahl and Conaire). It isn&#x27;t as fast as I&#x27;d like but satisfactory.</li>
            <li> After a couple months and probably 4 uses it works great.  No pulling at all.  Easy to clean.  Very small and quiet.  Only use it on nose hair and for that purpose it is an A+.</li>
            <li> I needed something cheap and easy to use to help clear out my nose (so it doesn&#x27;t squeek).  It was fast and easy.  Trimmers do always tickle in an inhumane way, but it&#x27;s something that only has to be done every once in a while.  These cut well and I had no issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does feel quite cheap.  I am very curios to see how long it will last.</li>
            <li> The nose hair trimmer is great at doing it&#x27;s job. It just tickles my nose hairs without pulling on them and is very easy to clean with the little water spout in the back. It cuts well and is very easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean. Getting neat in 2 min and no more cuts! For this price what more can I ask for?</li>
            <li> I made a wise choice.  it really is quiet like all of reviewers mention and seems to be worth what I paid.  I recommend it.  well done panasonic</li>
            <li> Like a Texas twister flying up your nostril.  I have some serious stuff going on in the nose hair department.  Haven&#x27;t killed this trimmer yet.  While it&#x27;s not perfect I don&#x27;t believe any nose hair trimmer is.  It&#x27;s a lot safer than sticking the business end of a pair of scissors up there!  I have pretty thick nose hairs (sorry TMI) but this thing still does a fair job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that you can rinse it out.  Batteries are still good.  It gets a little warm after using it for a while but if you aren&#x27;t weed wacking (like me) you shouldn&#x27;t have an issue.</li>
            <li> For the price, it has done the job.  My nose is like the jungles of Saigon!!  Chop Chop!!  Nice product.</li>
            <li> Does a lot better than my old one. Totally trims my ear and nose hairs down to the skin. Works great on those straggly haiis around my mustache.</li>
            <li> Great service! Very good product.</li>
            <li> If you are like me and have long nose hairs this is definitely the product for you.  Easy to use and does a great job!  I have been plucking my nose hairs for 30 years now (I am a female) and keep wondering why I didn&#x27;t try this a long time ago.  Panasonic has always been one of my favorite brands and, as always, went beyond meeting my expectations with this product.</li>
            <li> My father-in-law saw a list of the worst possible Christmas gifts and decided nearly all of them were things he wanted. When he sent out his list, I declared dibs on the nose hair trimmers and boy am I glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He loves the things. He uses them all the time. Probably more often than anyone would possibly need to have their nose hair removed.</li>
            <li> Works as originally described. I like that I can run under water to clean without any problems. Best Nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve purchased.</li>
            <li> What I like most about it is the ease of cleaning and that it is reliable and very easy to use.  Feels solid and not cheap.</li>
            <li> Received this today and it works a lot better then those little scissors. If I remember right I payed $20 for the last pare of scissors and this thing is a lot safer to use. Make sure to read the instructoins before trying it out.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Trims very well.  Love the turbo cleaning function.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This gets the job done quickly. Fast and efficient! I used to try to use the &amp;#34;as seen on tv&amp;#34; hair remover which is a piece of junk. This is high quality. You&#x27;ll be happy with this one.</li>
            <li> What can I say, please do what you want to do. I don&#x27;t have a lot to say when you shoving something up your nose.</li>
            <li> Does a good job. It would be nice to have it rechargable instead of using batteries.</li>
            <li> I have had several trimmers for the years and all but the Panasonic were disappointing.  The Panasonic provides a quick clean cut without buzzing your head or painful tugs on hairs.</li>
            <li> Works great.  Cuts those nose hairs</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer that works really well, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent, easy to use, very portable for traveling..</li>
            <li> easy to use and best of all easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good deal for the price. I use rechargeable batteries, so that&#x27;s not an issue. Loses a star for durability, I wouldn&#x27;t want to drop it, but if you take care of it, it should last years.</li>
            <li> Apparently none of these are meant to lSt more than 3 months. You might as well buy the $9 version from any store.</li>
            <li> This trimmer did a fair job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good -&lt;br /&gt;- The trimmer&#x27;s multi-surface blade made it easy to remove hair without gymnastics&lt;br /&gt;- I liked the ability to rinse it easily with water&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s pretty inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad -&lt;br /&gt;- Less than 18 months later and it&#x27;s dead; New battery with no blade attached yields zero response&lt;br /&gt;- The speed was often variable often reducing when I changed the angle at which I held it&lt;br /&gt;- Batteries never lasted 90 minutes; perhaps half that long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy it again? Perhaps. I&#x27;ve had better luck with Panasonic devices in the past - perhaps I just had a dud.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it, says it does the job and he is very pleased.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> Decent trimmer. I use rechargeable batteries and they last fairly long. Cleanup couldn&#x27;t be easier (just wash under the faucet)!</li>
            <li> overall great experience</li>
            <li> Item purchased and delivery were as promised - 100%</li>
            <li> Does the job without pulling. All directions. Would strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very, very nice! My husband loves it!&lt;br /&gt;October 2017&lt;br /&gt;This is an update. I realized hubby wasn&#x27;t using his trimmer and when I asked why he said it has no power. It&#x27;s wimpy. I asked if it was the battery and he says it&#x27;s been this way all along. Ugh...If only he had told me I could have sent it back. Lol Now I&#x27;m shopping for another.</li>
            <li> Based on my first usage, pretty good.</li>
            <li> Works great. I don&#x27;t see what all the complaints are about. It seems well built and I expect it to last years. My last nose hair trimmer was a piece of junk and that one lasted over 8 years.</li>
            <li> Works well and nothing to fancy</li>
            <li> Great for trimming nose hairs. Does not snag hairs and is painless. Batteries last a long time, but I only use it every few weeks. Easy to clean too. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure about this since other reviews said it quit working soon after they got it.  But this is still working for me.  I bought 2 in case one did shut down, however.  Worth it.</li>
            <li> This is a great purchase for the price, but I wished that replacement blades were more easily available and cheaper. Sure, you could replace it with an entire new set for the price of a takeout meal, but it feels like such a huge waste.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different trimmers and they all have been complete junk.  I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and it still works and does a nice job.</li>
            <li> No idea why I never picked it up before. I used to take a Mach razor and try to spin it around.... Yeh like I said, no idea why we never met before ER-GN30-K</li>
            <li> Works great easy to clean.  Doesn&#x27;t pull out hairs.</li>
            <li> Good product, well made.</li>
            <li> Good tool, works well, like it, take it along when traveling.</li>
            <li> Thank&#x27;s for best supply!!!!</li>
            <li> one of the better nose trimmers i&#x27;ve bought.  durable smooth and quiet and i like the ability to rinse it out after use.</li>
            <li> Works as described. I&#x27;ll keep &amp; use it.</li>
            <li> works as needed &amp; is made well</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this is a product that Panasonic engineers should redesign. First, it consumed power too quickly. The brand new Duracell battery that I put last week was already dead. I wasn&#x27;t sure how this little trimmer consumed the energy in a AA battery so quickly. Second, it didn&#x27;t do a good job trimming nose hair. Sometimes the nose hair wasn&#x27;t trimmed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the last problem, for hygienic reason I couldn&#x27;t return the product once I used it.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised!  Great item!  Thanks for the quick shipping!</li>
            <li> The self-cleaning feature is clutch. Doesn&#x27;t pull on my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Good quality in a world of crappy face hair trimmers.</li>
            <li> I just bought my second one of these trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I dropped my first one and dented the blade guard, which is pretty much the end.  It was time to replace the blade anyway, and it&#x27;s easier and cheaper to just buy a whole new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
            <li> You grow old and hairs pop out more often and in stranger places. Drop the scissors and get one of these, it&#x27;s affordable and nothing beats the pleasure you feel the first time you drive it into your nose and all hell breaks loose, so good and satisfying, totally worth the $12.</li>
            <li> It really gets rid of unwanted hair on nose ear etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Father&#x27;s Day and he simply loves this trimmer!  It works well and it&#x27;s small and easy to use.  He would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I guess the central factor is this one appears to be a keeper and I&#x27;ve tried a number of them. It manages to efficiently trim away those most embarrassing gray bristles that seem to grow out of the nostrils like dandelions in an unkempt yard without vibrating at the decibel level of a weedwacker, and it handles the finer follicles that pop out of the ears pretty well, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In fact, it is surprisingly quiet for this type of appliance. I have a Norelco all-in-one that is twice as loud and not nearly as effective with quick trims and I also recently bought a Conair model that emits an odor reminiscent of burning hair which does not give one a sense of security when it&#x27;s jammed in a nostril or aural cavity so, for traveling away, this Panasonic unit will be a constant companion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one negative in my view, and it&#x27;s appreciably minor, is the rotary configuration doesn&#x27;t work as well for eyebrow trimming.</li>
            <li> OK, even talking about nose and ear hair is gross, but I have both and don&#x27;t like to be seen with it sprouting out everywhere. I was sick of cutting myself with scissors, so I ordered my first Panasonic trimmer about 3 years ago.  It still worked great, but unfortunately, I dropped it on the floor, and one of the internal parts fell out, so it no longer cuts. I didn&#x27;t reallize it at first, and when I finally did a couple of days later, I couldn&#x27;t find the part.  We had probably vacuumed it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the low price, I figured it was easier and cheaper not to try and find the part, but just order a new trimmer.  This one works as great as the first one.  No more Van Gogh episodes (reference to the famous painter cutting off his ear), or bleeding nostrils. It also works great as a mustache trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few of this type of hygiene device.  Mostly all with less than stellar results.  I had this one for over 6 months and so far I&#x27;m pleased with it.  I like that I can rinse it under running water.  It takes a single AA battery to power it. I use a rechargeable battery and it seems to hold up well. I haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet, but writing this has got me thinking about it so I think I will just for grins.  If my views on this product changes I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
            <li> Love it.  Has a lot of power....cuts nose hair short...doesn&#x27;t pull.  What else do you need from a nose hair trimmer?  PEACE!</li>
            <li> Just wanted to write a short review for this item.  I purchased two of these.  One was for me, and the other for my daughter.  She has cerebral palsy and has use of only one arm/hand.  She asked me to try to find something like this so she could trim those little hairs that we ladies grow on our face as we age!  This product works wonderfully.  She is grateful and so am I.  She&#x27;s never let her handicap get her down, but it truly is nice to get hold of a product that can be used with one hand, in case there&#x27;s a need.  Many thanks!!!!!</li>
            <li> this is a awesome must have tool for us hairy ones. trims nicley, good battery life, doesnt pull hair, doesnt sound like a weekeater, and keeps the hair short. feels like i installed a cold air intake for my nose.</li>
            <li> Bought for my fiance..thus, his review: trimmed hair beautifully...had enough power. Felt only 2 small tugs (not painful)...but I had expected that from a detailed trimmer. Completely satisfied and would totally recommend!</li>
            <li> my first ever of these. the motor wavers a bit in sound but the little sucker trims nose and ear hair like butter. no pulling or tugging...as of yet!</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked well when I first got it, but stopped working after only a dozen uses. By &amp;#34;stopped working&amp;#34; I mean that the rotary blade simply refused to spin any more. I tried cleaning the unit and changing the battery, but still no joy, so into the wastebasket it went. &amp;#34;If the blade don&#x27;t spin, it&#x27;s just a sin.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> need to replaced the first Panasonic trimmer as i had it accidently drop and broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t figure out from the instruction on howto remove trimmer to clean.</li>
            <li> gets to all those hard to trim spots &amp; does the job. best one I have had yet to trim nose &amp; ear hair.</li>
            <li> Bought one for my brother and one for my nephew both love it and thank me for finding it - had difficulty finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> This is an awesome product.  I really enjoyed the way it took my hairs out.  Its a must have for hairy men.</li>
            <li> I looked for a product that would work for my 78 year old father. His hair had fallen off his head and became implanted in his ears and nose. It works great! He said it tickles some, but he is getting used to it.</li>
            <li> Much better than my old one, inexpensive and works really well. Highly recommended for hair trimming in nose, ears and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Initial Impression.....Had an older name brand trimmer that was worn out and a new brand name trimmer that I just opened.  Both were bargain priced items with plastic blades.  I used the Panasonic IMMEDIATELY after using the new bargain priced brand name product and the Panasonic clearly was cutting additional hails that the other unit had missed.  I will probably order a second one as a spare for later use.</li>
            <li> It does everithung what has to do. It is very comfortable that it can be washed under water. My husband like it. he wants to buy for his father too.</li>
            <li> After trying several similar products, this is the one that really works.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to any gentleman.&lt;br /&gt;Note: after using it for a while, the metal part gets warmer.&lt;br /&gt;While it is not too hot, it might be a bit uncomfortable depending on people.</li>
            <li> I searched around for a good nose and ear hair trimmer.  My prior unit broke, and I was looking for something that worked well, trimming close as possible to the skin, without an injury.  This trimmer does exactly that.  I have thick hair, and the trimmer had no problem trimming it closely, without tugging my hair.  Cleaning the tip with water works well.  A quick rinse in the sink cleans the tip.  So far, this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> very easy to use. I love that they have a slot you can twist to clean the product easily. I had it for over a month and didn&#x27;t have to change the batteries</li>
            <li> This is so easy to use.  So easy to clean.  I am very pleased with it.  I like that it can be used wet or dry.  Will be purchasing more for my family.</li>
            <li> This works just as you would hope.  Picture makes it look a lot bigger than it really is.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong it is not the smallest thing out there, but it is not huge either.    The performance is very good.  Light is a bonus.</li>
            <li> I have used many of these devices in the past and this is by far the best one i have come across. It is powerful and cuts close to the skin without ever nicking. I am very pleased with this purchase, especially for the price. I highly recommend it. I also like the fact it takes a battery as several other brands in the past have ceased working due to issues with the rechargeable battery.</li>
            <li> This worked really great the first time or two I used it... It&#x27;s a pain to clean though, and after a few uses it stopped working as well.</li>
            <li> MY PANASONIC ER-GN30-K WORKS VERY WELL.  IT IS DESIGNED TO TRIM THE UNWANTED HAIR FROM INSIDE YOUR EARS AND NOSE.  IT ALSO WORKS WELL TRIMMING AROUND THE OUTSIDE OF YOUR EARS AFTER A HAIR CUT. I WOULD CERTAINLY RECOMEND THIS TO ANYONE LOOKING FOR THIS TYPE OF TRIMMER.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Does a nice job of cutting and not pulling.  I would recommend this to anyone shopping for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have had my share of nose hair trimmer and this is far and away the best. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer is simple to operate and does the job quite well. Just twist the shell cover, separate, pop in one battery, replace the shell cover, twist to lock and you&#x27;re ready to go. Flip the on/off switch and a low buzzing sound is heard. It removes the nose and ear hairs quite easily. I find it&#x27;s best to remove the hairs by gently touching the tips and trim each hair gradually rather than trying to remove a hair in one shot, especially the long hairs. Otherwise, the hair may get caught in the blade, pinch, and stop the trimmer. If this happens, remove the shell cover holding the blade, and brush off any hair that&#x27;s caught. With a little practice, jamming the device can be avoided and the device will operate smoothly. I&#x27;m pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> It does the job, seems to cut hairs wherever I need them cut. Happy with it&#x27;s performance... And it was a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why some have found this to crap out in a short period of time, as I&#x27;ve been using mine regularly for almost three years, and it still works great!</li>
            <li> Item arrived ahead of schedule and came in excellent packaging. I have no complaints at all with any part of the process.</li>
            <li> I had the previous model - which lasted years - but this one is taller, and angled to allow for a better grip and positioning on harder to reach areas. Great for eyebrows, ears, beard/sideburn trimming, and of course, nose hair.</li>
            <li> The unit was inoperable right out of the packaging. Multiple batteries tried, all failed. Never got the chance to see how well it worked.</li>
            <li> I have a at least four of these in the past few years and all of them were sub-par (read: they simply did not work - no power - could not sustain the spinning motion.) This one is powerful right out of the box! It&#x27;s exactly what I hoped it would be. SMILE!</li>
            <li> I think I ordered 2 by mistake, unless they were a buy 1 we&#x27;ll throw in another one and make you pay for it.</li>
            <li> I got this thinking its like those ordinary ones in the stores. Wow! Its very different. Can&#x27;t see the difference in the product just from the looks but gotta use it. Cleaning is just super easy. I&#x27;m impressed. I talked about this to my wifey and she&#x27;s been giving me grins. I betchya she&#x27;s been looking to try it also. The cap is also a helpful thing to prevent dust from settling in. Bottomline, nice product, nice price, no brainer an awesome purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great and you can not beat it for the price.  Even with all the good things to say, I don&#x27;t think I would take it in the shower and use the wet setting.</li>
            <li> &#x27;nuff said.  He actually said, &amp;#34;I love this.  It&#x27;s my favorite.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I fortunately don&#x27;t have any idea what makes a nose hair trimmer a good one (may I never need to know) but he says it&#x27;s good, and he&#x27;s reallllly picky (no pun intended), so you should believe him ;-)</li>
            <li> thus came with the cruzer and my son and daughter-in-law are so glad it did he was using it as soon as he opened it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this nose trimmer for a while now and overall it&#x27;s good.  It runs on a battery and you can easily tell when the battery gets low.  I don&#x27;t understand why they have the rotating top that opens and closes a little port on the side.  It seems like it&#x27;s there to clean it out, but why not just have it always open?  I only use this on my nose and it does indeed get in there and trims everything.</li>
            <li> So far, this trimmer has worked great. It&#x27;s a great deal, and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do very well. With small electronics like this, I think that half the quality is determined by the durability of the item and how long it lasts. So far, so good.</li>
            <li> No more nose hairs in this nostril.  Trims nicely and does not pull the hairs out.  Great for man trimming.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  As my children say &amp;#34;Daddy It Is Time To Mow The Lawn.&amp;#34;  I know what they mean by that.  This item cuts the hairs very well without pulling as some others do.  I am very happy with the trimmer.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has a beard, as most guys these days do and needed a facial hair trimmer.  I gave him this one to use and he was enjoying using it every week with the various attachments it came with.  Within 4 months, it was non functional.  It had never been dropped or anything, it just stopped working.  He cleaned it, traded out the batteries, nothing. It&#x27;s all plastic, so maybe something inside came lose, but it&#x27;s completely dead. I&#x27;d have given a higher rating if it had lasted longer.</li>
            <li> Does the job what promises. Way better then traditional scissors which has risk of damaging nose inner skins. Certainly must have.</li>
            <li> does what it says; you do have to be very thorough though as it works much better if head is vertically on top of what you are looking to remove as the sideway cut doesn&#x27;t work as well but this gets the job done</li>
            <li> What can you say about a product that does this?  It works, and if it lasts for years, even better.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift and my bf loves it.  Does just as it says.  quick, easy and pain free.  highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After going thru 3 Remington trimmers, I researched models and this had the best rating.&lt;br /&gt;After 7 months of use this product is performing very poorly!!!!  The blades now jam almost always, get stuck on nose or ear hair and jam. The cutting head is poorly designed for cleaning and repair and it EATS batteries.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Replaced a unit that was far past it&#x27;s useful life. Cuts down the ear hair.  It is Better than good</li>
            <li> This is not the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned, but it works as expected and it&#x27;s easy enough to maintain.</li>
            <li> I have bought a few similar type of trimmers\shavers in the past only to be sadly disappointed after realizing how useless they were as they wouldn&#x27;t work properly or like they were advertised to do. After being such a skeptic, I decided to give this one a try simply for the low price and the many great reviews others have posted. To my surprise, this trimmer actually truly does work and is the perfect handy trimmer I always wanted to have to be able to trim hair quickly and precisely where I wanted to. It&#x27;s rotating strength on the inner blades is rather strong and it is so easy to do quick trimming in a few minutes and continue on with my day. Given it&#x27;s low price, this handy trimmer is really a great valuable tool to keep around handy . Functions flawlessly and really does cut any hair it comes close to. Definitely would recommend this trimmer,</li>
            <li> It is so simple to use. It doesn&#x27;t hurt and it gets to all the areas it needs to. I don&#x27;t know about durability yet but I will keep updating</li>
            <li> Works really good, doesn&#x27;t cut you and takes the hair out, only need to use it every week or so.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews here and was confident but skeptical about the performance of this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve tried many others in the past with not so good results, including pulling and scraping inside the nose (ouch!).  I have to say I am in love with this one!  It&#x27;s painless, trims nose hair closely &amp; completely and is a dream to clean!  This is the last trimmer you will ever buy!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really do that good of a job trimming inside the nose, tons of areas get missed.  It&#x27;s pretty small and easy to carry around, and cleanup is relatively easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh also, the plastic packaging was one of the most difficult packages I&#x27;ve ever had to open.  Scissors, knifes, had to use the whole shebang.</li>
            <li> For once I found a trimmer that actually worked and at a reasonable price. Cuts smoothly without any problems so far.</li>
            <li> Works great.  No pinched hairs and is very easy to clean.  One of the better ones I have used.  I definitely recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Great nose trimmer. This is all I use this for. Soon as I age I am sure I will need it for my ears though.&lt;br /&gt;So cheap and easy to use. Must buy to trim those nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I use this on the neighbor&#x27;s cat, when it gets in our yard. Works great. The only issue is that it falls off the shelf when you stand it up, owing to the curved body. However, it really gets those whiskers.  If they made a bigger one, I&#x27;d use it on the neighbor.</li>
            <li> Quiet and efficient. Does the job without pulling and yanking those pesky hairs out of your nose. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift for my boyfriend. What dude doesn&#x27;t, deep down, want a nose-hair trimmer? This one is nice - you shove it up the ol&#x27; nozzle &amp; buzz it around....voila! No more party favor nose! He is the only one that uses it, so I believe just rinses the little tip off &amp; it&#x27;s good to go. The one complaint - it could be a closer cut. It&#x27;s a little hard to get super close to the root of the hair. Perhaps that is safer, however? Either way, it does it&#x27;s job. In fact, I busted my dad sniffing around this little guy at our house, so he received his very own for Christmas this last year &amp; loves it.</li>
            <li> My dad said this works the best of anything he&#x27;s used so far. He ruined the first one and now wants to order a second one.</li>
            <li> Works well but I can not get it open in order to clean it as per instructions.  I will have someone else help me but it should not be necessary.</li>
            <li> It just does what it&#x27;s supposed to and easily at that. The cleanup is also super simple, with a twist water is allowed to flow freely through the appliance and dry as well.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly expensive nose hair trimmer (at least when I paid for it). Mine worked great for about six months, and then it got really loud and stopped functioning properly. I think something went wrong with the blade. For the amount I paid, I was hoping it would last 3-5 years. I replaced it with the [[ASIN:B006Z2SP72 MANGROOMER Stainless Steel Detail Groomer]]. The Mangroomer is larger, but seems to be doing the job. If the Vortex had continued working for longer, I would have rated it five stars - while it worked properly, it did a good job with trimming those pesky nose hairs very closely without pulling or pinching (as some other trimmers I&#x27;ve owned have done). I have no idea why the item is described as a facial hair trimmer - it doesn&#x27;t come with an attachment for that function. It will do nose hair, and I suppose ear hair if you are that brave. I wouldn&#x27;t stick a trimmer in my ear canal.</li>
            <li> A great groomer, best I&#x27;ve every had. Delivery was super fast.</li>
            <li> To be honest with you, I wasn&#x27;t sure what to think about the trimmers before I ordered them.  I&#x27;ve purchased some nose hair trimmers in the past at a local chain store, but they were awful.  The Panasonic, on the other hand, works exceptionally well.  I seriously couldn&#x27;t be happier at how well these perform and how easy it is to use.  A+++++.</li>
            <li> top notch item,just as described! great product @ a great price!</li>
            <li> This product was great when I first got it. Easy to clean, water resistant, cut great, never snagged. I should have known that it was too good to be true, it didn&#x27;t last. Two months after purchasing the unit will not turn on, changed batteries, nothing works. This product could have been great but mine just didn&#x27;t last.</li>
            <li> Excellent, cuts clean and easy!</li>
            <li> Do not buy. I used this product one time and it stopped working.</li>
            <li> Great product! Well made, solid item that works quite well. I would recommend based on quality and price.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer works extremely well.  I have had it for about a month now.  I would purchase it again.  I replaced a Philips Norelco NT8110 with this.  It is a huge upgrade.  The performance is so much better that I was amazed the first time I used it.  It easily and cleanly cuts hair.  The head is very maneuverable, so you can get at stray hairs no matter how awkward.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product. However, it really tickes my inner nose when cutting nose hair, to the point of making my eyes water. Like it a lot still</li>
            <li> Husband bought another brand somewhere else and it quit on him after a short time.  Purchased this one by reading the reviews and he has found it works really well.  Now I don&#x27;t have to look at those hairs and he is still happy with it.  He says it seems to have weight and is more solid than the other one he purchased.</li>
            <li> It works so much better than the older model he had for a long time.  He also tried other brands, none of them works as well as Panasonic</li>
            <li> good price and delivery</li>
            <li> Works AWESOME. I mean it gets every hair where you put it. I use it a lot on my nose, neck, and ears and it will take them right down to the skin. Cleanup is really easy as well. It does seem to use a battery up sort of quick, but that is the only downside.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the reviews. I am glad I bought it. It worked well when I used it. A feature that I enjoyed was that with water it removes all of the hairs inside machine.</li>
            <li> This is a good product and worth the money. Not sure it&#x27;s any better or worse than any of the other trimmers I&#x27;ve had. Time will tell I guess.</li>
            <li> Nice gift for yourself... Ha Ha! In all Seriousness, it is a Great Product. Easy, fast cleaning. Works wonderfully! Best one we&#x27;ve had yet!</li>
            <li> E&lt;br /&gt;Amazing , it works.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I&#x27;ve only used it twice so far but it cuts cleanly,</li>
            <li> Great product. Good deal.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love? Only $10. It would be nice to have a rechargeable version.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer with almost half a dozen nose hair trimmers that stopped working after only a few uses. With so many positive reviews, I hoped this would actually work reliably. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t. It worked fine a few times, then stopped. I give up. All of the battery powered trimmers I have tried are junk.</li>
            <li> Worked great for first few months and then stopped running. Tried changing battery...didn&#x27;t seem to work until, by pure luck, it started running when I pinched the battery in a certain position with the cover off. That lasted a couple weeks and now it doesn&#x27;t work at all. It was a much more efficient trimmer than my Sharper Image model that I used, but that lasted for 8 years. So do the math...this just wasn&#x27;t worth it.</li>
            <li> gets the job done feels real nice after good sh*t</li>
            <li> meh, occasionally rips out a clump of hairs rather than cut them.&lt;br /&gt;works no better, if as well as trimmers that cost half as much. flat out eats batteries.&lt;br /&gt;However, it is big enough to hold comfortably.  --jm</li>
            <li> Great product so far. Works as expected.</li>
            <li> works better than expected</li>
            <li> Used many nose hair trimmers in the past, this is great for the money.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT. HAVE PURCHASED PRODUCTS LIKE THIS BEFORE AND WERE ALWAYS CHEAPLY MADE. THIS ONE SEEMS VERY SUBSTANTIAL AND NOT LIKE CHEAP PLASTIC.</li>
            <li> Product works great for trimming nose hair and ear hair.  It comes with several attachments which I have not needed.</li>
            <li> Good one. Always believe Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Great nasel and ear trimmer love it</li>
            <li> Works great, I&#x27;ve used it quite a bit and I&#x27;ve got pretty thick nose hairs and it goes right through them. I would recommend this to anyone who has unwanted stray hairs it will take care of them</li>
            <li> This thing is amazing! You can hear all the annoying little hairs being annihilated by it. It&#x27;s very effective at cleaning up nose and ear hair and is also portable and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Very disappointing. I agree with some of the other reviewers that this trimmer starts out great, but then the blades fail after just a few (8 or so) uses. Just long enough to fail outside of the return window. I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> good deal.  so so quality</li>
            <li> dose its job well with no pulling.</li>
            <li> BEST ON THE MARKET AND LOW PRICE.</li>
            <li> Did not work after 1 week and only 1 use.</li>
            <li> Works as described and designed</li>
            <li> It works nice but it sure goes through a lot of batteries. My previous unit was a rechargeable plug-in one and it seems like I only had to charge that once every couple of months. This one seems like I have to replace the batteries every month, which is a pain and gets expensive. I&#x27;d recommend finding a unit that plugs in and doesn&#x27;t require separate batteries.</li>
            <li> Works as described, am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> So far it seems to work well, better than a previous model...</li>
            <li> Best one I&#x27;ve tried yet. I ended up having to buy my wife one so she stop stealing it.</li>
            <li> Used the cheap ones and they just don&#x27;t work. This works very well on nostril and ear hair.</li>
            <li> My husband says this is the best!!&lt;br /&gt;Works awesome</li>
            <li> Much better than the sharper image nose trimmer I had that cost a bundle.</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer of this type.  It works great and is quiet.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough to give it 5 stars yet.</li>
            <li> Kinda loud but it does is job very well. It gets a little hot for using it too long but just by adding water a little at the tip it cools it down a bit. I have been having this about 2-3 months and nothing major has gone wrong</li>
            <li> it is wonderful to keep right on the bathroom counter. great deal at around $10 and worked nicely as a stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this trimmer. It gets the job done quickly and painlessly. It is also very easy to set up and clean. I like that it is small and easily fits into an overnight bag/luggage and stores in a small drawer in the bathroom. The battery life is much better than similar models. I would definitely recomend this panasonic model for it&#x27;s quality and value.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does an excellent job on any facial hair. It is also waterproof, which makes it very easy to clean: just hold it under a stream of water.</li>
            <li> Curve is nice and being able to use it in the shower is nice as well.  Nothing extraordinary...it IS a nose hair trimmer, but good.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great, it&#x27;s larger and ergonomically shaped for better handling than my previous trimmer and the fact that it&#x27;s a wet/dry makes it even better. 5 Star</li>
            <li> You can tell that this is a quality product.  Works extremely well.  The mechanism runs very smooth and quiet.  The ability to rinse it off is a big plus!</li>
            <li> Good power and not the hard to hold onto tiny things usually associated with this style of grooming.</li>
            <li> Nose hair rampage! Fear not! THIS IS HERE! The build quality is great and functions just perfectly. The tip is metal so it will last a pretty long time. Waterproof is a bonus. Good buy.</li>
            <li> Never a distraught day has gone by without the pain of me personally plucking out each individual nose hair that dared to grow outside of its limits with my own fingers. Man has once again reached to the sky and landed on the moon with this remarkable display of man’s ingenuity. Since receiving this product I have been able to eliminate hair from every aural cavity. My nose can once again breath the fresh air of life and I am now able to sculpt my Einstein-esk eyebrows into whatever configuration I so desire. Currently, I am sporting the popular Spring 2015 Vogue Vulcan Eyebrow look. My Instagram page has never been so popular with the amount of likes I am receiving from my popular selfies (especially now that I don’t have fiber optic cables growing out of my nose). Getting the ladies has never been so easy and I am consistently having coitus on a regular basis. The girls especially enjoy using my new trimmer to initial their name into my back hair! Thank you Panosonic for changing my life!</li>
            <li> No nonsence tool that works.Nice design. Good quality. Great value for money. I would buy it again should it break.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied, I advise!</li>
            <li> My husband has gone through many of these and seems to like this one the best</li>
            <li> great product works better than advertised</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and is small and lightweight. Gets all nose hair and the little hairs between my eyebrows above my nose. Extremely efficient with only using one battery.</li>
            <li> 1AA Battery required and that gets you started. No electric plugin. Very comfortable, handy and i guess is an amazing trimmer!</li>
            <li> Biology is a B*&amp;CH.  As men age, they lose their hair on top and gain it in their ears and nose.  Don&#x27;t be my professors who could have outfitted a broom with his ear hair and braided his nose hair.  It was mesmerizing, but disgusting.  I keep my nose and ears tidy and this makes it easy.  Friends and colleagues, you are welcome!</li>
            <li> So far my husband is happy with this trimmer he has had a few other brands over the years and they haven&#x27;t the best but for the price we think this one is very good!!!</li>
            <li> As an older person, I&#x27;ve been spoiled by the good, old-fashioned products that were previous made in the USA, so my expectations are much lower these days.  All in all, this trimmer was adaquete for the price.</li>
            <li> Arrived in a blister pack, but was not too difficult to extract. Charged up the device overnight, and it worked well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because the girlfriend kept pointing out a few stray hairs every now and again. This works pretty well especially if you do not like to get your nose hairs pulled like some cheaper models tend to do.</li>
            <li> Initially it worked great, I&#x27;m not a picky person, i use a product for what its designed for and this worked well. But a few months after i brought it it just stopped working, so i brought new batteries and tried again, didn&#x27;t work so i brought an additional pair of batteries, still didn&#x27;t work, i maybe used this product about 10 times total. I am disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was using a manual nose hair trimmer and wish I had this before. I absolutely love how it cuts all my nose hair and the fact that I don&#x27;t have to worry about the item not being water resistant because I do like to use water to clean and not the brush.</li>
            <li> My husband is very happy with this. It is easy to change the battery, and only uses one AA and we always keep a supply of those in the house unlike odd battery types. It is also easy to clean and maintain since all you have to do it twist the head off to get the little hairs out. It is light weight and fits in his travel bag for when we are away from home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, personally, like that it doesn&#x27;t have a giant charger that is always sitting out on our bathroom countertop like his last one did. For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
            <li> I like it. Would have liked more attachments.&lt;br /&gt;Good price for it. Nicer than picture shows.&lt;br /&gt;More ideal for a guy.</li>
            <li> Love this little trimmer. This is actually my third one, because they seem to not cut as well after 6 months - 1 year of using. I have tried so many other brands that are sold in stores because I hate having to order this one, but won&#x27;t waste my money on those anymore. Fantastic!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these things and both have broken. Not gonna give it a third try...</li>
            <li> Excellent my road worriers and no need to worry with a mirror (if you know your nose and ears) best trimmer I&#x27;ve used up till now.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works for eye brows and nose hairs. I dropped my first one and it broke, ordered a second one.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other brands of trimmers in the past, but none compare to this Panasonic. I use it on my husbands face and around his ears....he can take care of his nose as everyone should. Unit is quiet and painless.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well for nose hair thus far. Haven&#x27;t yet tried ears or water, so can&#x27;t say anything about that but I mostly got it for the nose and it works great for that :-)</li>
            <li> Painless and the job well done as described</li>
            <li> Nice hair remover.  Gets close.</li>
            <li> I have bought several different nose hair trimmers over the years, and will have to say this is the best one I have ever owned by far.</li>
            <li> this thing plows through any unwanted hair and clean up is so easy. It works great for trimming up those eyebrows too. Awesome for trip and quick tuoch ups on the go.</li>
            <li> Had been slogging along with a cruddy old trimmer that finally died a few weeks back.  Bought this on based on the recommendations and despite having reservations about the size and price have been very happy. Fits my hand well, is relatively quiet and is amazingly efficient at what it is suppsoed to do .. cut hair in places you don&#x27;t want to be weilding scissors.</li>
            <li> I really like and  works as it says</li>
            <li> This is very compact and does the job very well. Uses just one AA battery and last quite long without any change,</li>
            <li> Very effective ear trimmer.  The best I have ever had next to an underfed goat and does not leave behind reminders littering your yard that you must bag up for disposal.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for my dad. I read the instructions for him and it seems really easy to use and clean. So far I haven&#x27;t heard any complaints from him, so I&#x27;m giving it five stars.</li>
            <li> When your nose hairs still sticking out of your nose and tickling your nose when you breath that means you&#x27;re getting old.  That also means it&#x27;s time for a nose hair trimmer.  I was opting for the manual method which meant taking a pair of small scissors and cutting what hair I could without cutting my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally gave in and researched electric nose hair trimmers and came to the conclusion that I needed to invest in one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this trimmer, put some batteries in and went to work on my nose hairs.  Let&#x27;s just say I have not had a nose hair randomly tickle my nose for a while now.  It works well.  I have read reports that it dies rather quick, less than or around 1 year of solid use before it goes belly up.  I guess I&#x27;ll come back to this review if something should happen in that time period but for now, if you are getting older or if your nose hairs grow extremely long and fast, this is for you, don&#x27;t wait, you won&#x27;t regret this purchase.</li>
            <li> Its ok, doesn&#x27;t cut as good as I thought it would....</li>
            <li> Lasted until the warranty ran out, then died.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer - buy this one.  The round cutter on the end of the tip is much more effective than the design that uses a linear set of cutters along the side of the tip.</li>
            <li> great deal, best item ever</li>
            <li> Really works great and doesn&#x27;t pull on the hair! Much better than the one with the curved end! Liked it so much I bought a second one.</li>
            <li> Great product. Works well with removing the hair in the areas the product has mentioned. Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> this product is very helpful. especially when i get stuck on a problem and cant move on, this book helps alot.</li>
            <li> The reason I could not give this product five stars is because of the motor. It runs much slower than expected, which means it is not very powerful. Because the product is new, the inner &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; cuts perfectly, but I doubt will due so in the future once the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; starts to dull. Overall I am happy I bought this, but I am very disappointed in the product I will soon have. This was the first nose/ear trimmer I have owned, so I really had no basis for comparison. I wish more experience with these products so I could have bought a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> Nothing wrong with this. Great quality that make quick work out of facial grooming. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> at first this works great but just after a few uses it does begin to pull which can be pretty painful</li>
            <li> I bought  this trimmer to replace the panasonic ER411 that lasted 10 plus years and was a excellent model. Can no longer buy this model. This inferior model ER-GN30-K is  junk and the motor died in 2 months. Waste of money !</li>
            <li> It arrived on time and was exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a simple product that does what its supposed to do. All this time, I&#x27;ve lived without a nosehair trimmer. This product makes things so much easier.</li>
            <li> This little thing is great and it gets the job done, especially with nose hair. Well designed and does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do with no pain.</li>
            <li> These nose/facial hair trimmers don&#x27;t seem to hold up too well... I&#x27;ve had to replace mine... but I got my money&#x27;s worth out of the first one. Summery: They do the job as advertised, and last for a couple of years or so, and then you&#x27;re shopping for a new one. These are inexpensive. Other brands may or may not be better, but these can cost a lot more $$$. I stuck with the one I know.</li>
            <li> Works well if you can get it to work at all.  Had to re-seat the battery and jiggle the switch every time, and then it MIGHT work.  After 6 months, it wouldn&#x27;t work no matter what I did.  Even at this low price, this is a FAIL.</li>
            <li> this is a love / hate review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a GREAT trimmer (quiet, fast, accurate, sharp and cleans up easily) - until it SLIPS from your hand onto tile bathroom floor while you&#x27;re taking off the protective cap. And it always falls blade side down. And always requires a new blade. Which costs MORE than the trimmer itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can be as careful as you want - it will happen to you. Be prepared to buy another in 6 months. :-)</li>
            <li> Work and have lasted well.</li>
            <li> Purchased in Jan 2014 and use about once a month - blades are sharp and there&#x27;s no catching. Comes with a plastic cap. I bought a &amp;#34;multi groomer&amp;#34; that also has a nose hair trimmer attachment and if I could go back I&#x27;d probably just get the multi groomer since I don&#x27;t really need multiple nose hair trimmers and I get more functionality out of the multi groomer.</li>
            <li> Best rotary nose hair trimmer I have ever used!  I have tried many trimmers in the past and have always experienced irritation and discomfort.  Even to the point of getting ingrown hairs inside my nose.  Painful!  This trimmer doesn&#x27;t cause any of that.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s due to the sharpness of the blades, or the design but whatever it is, it works.  Very well.  I&#x27;m not in the market for a trimmer anymore.</li>
            <li> It does the job.  Great product!</li>
            <li> Works great, easy to clean, doesn&#x27;t catch or pull on hair. Battery lasts a long time as well. Feels sturdy in your hand as well</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job well, hasn&#x27;t hurt me.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that lets my trim my pesky nose hairs. No longer do I have to fiddle with scissors in my nose lol</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, easy to carry around. I like it.</li>
            <li> Works pretty good. Easy to use. So far so good. Only used it about 4 times so far. Glad I made the purchase.</li>
            <li> Nose is hairless.  Mission accomplished.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this three times and any time it goes into the nose it will catch a hair, conk out and stay locked on that hair. If you let go with your hands, it will hang from your nose. As you can imagine, there&#x27;s only one way to fix the immediate problem - yank!&lt;br /&gt;Sorry to sound so disgusting, but you&#x27;ll thank me for not buying it and experiencing the same. What a piece of junk.</li>
            <li> I bought one for my husband and he liked it so well I opted to purchase one for myself.  I Like it and I keep it on my makeup table.  No muss no fuss.  Buy it!  It doesn&#x27;t hurt and is very effective.</li>
            <li> hey, gotta get rid of those nose hairs somehow!  I find it works very well (I&#x27;ve only used it dry)....takes a few mins once a month or so, and am good to go!  good price, I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> Switch isn&#x27;t very good.  You have to bang it to make it work.  I&#x27;m going to buy a different brand.  However, it does a good job when it runs.</li>
            <li> I got 2 of these about 6 months ago.  One for my self and one for the elderly parents.  It works great.  No pulling, no pain.</li>
            <li> This is easy to use and battery powered so there is no cord to fool with in the bathroom.  It fully met my expectations.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, following instructions, work&#x27;s great in nose &amp; ears, no feeling of hair pulling. You only hear the hair being cut while you are using the trimmer. Perfect size instrument. Easy to clean &amp; easy to reassemble. The prime price was to my liking so I purchased it. I am a satisfied customer</li>
            <li> This was great, when it worked! It broke after 1 year, and now I have to buy another one.  Won&#x27;t buy this again!</li>
            <li> love this thing. i do very little maintenance on it, and it&#x27;s still going strong. i even take this thing to my eyebrows (because im a real man) and it keeps things tight up there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but about once a week or once every 2 weeks, i take it straight to my nostrils, and it does a great job clearing my nasal pathways so i can breathe easier. nose hairs be gone!</li>
            <li> Another gift I researched and compared it to the Wahl, but I think my husband is totally satisfied with it. At least he has not grumbled about it as yet and he sure does enough of it when he does not like something. I would say it is a great price and a good product. Not much to it, but it works!</li>
            <li> Just as good as advertised!</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great.  It is very easy to use.  It does not hurt or anything.  It is small, so it fits anywhere in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> No pinching or pulling. No discomfort. Gets a bit warm with use but I see no flaws in function when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I bought this in early August, received it the first week of August and used it twice since its purchase. Today I went to turn it on for use and discovered it no longer works. So, it&#x27;s too late to return it and I got two trimmings out of it. I don&#x27;t recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit #2: It still works, somehow. It has a mind of its own. I put fresh batteries in it and it still sometimes doesn&#x27;t want to work. It&#x27;s hit or miss but it still turns on.</li>
            <li> trims my nose hair very well. previously I had a trimmer that had vertical blades, the spinning blades on this work much better. also nice to have the cleaning function</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how I made it through 43 years without one of these. This trimmer works great. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because of my age but at 43, I seem to have more hair growing out of my nose and ears than my head. Every man should own one of these and for the price I paid everyone has no excuse not to have one. My wife said this is one of the best purchases I have made.</li>
            <li> First one I bought I think about last February. After 6 months it just stopped working. I thought maybe it was a fluke and it worked well during those 6 months, so I decided to give it another go since it is so reasonably priced. I bought a second one in about October. I maybe used it 4 times and it just stopped working. If you like throwing your money away, this is the trimmer for you.</li>
            <li> So precise it&#x27;ll trim the hair off a peach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least that&#x27;s what my neighbor told me before he borrowed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later I found peach is a nickname for his pnads (the &amp;#34;p&amp;#34; is silent).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I later discovered that &amp;#34;pnads&amp;#34; is a nickname, too. At first I thought he meant his panda, but I wasn&#x27;t sure he had one anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I trimmed my nose hairs again, the device smelt a bit funky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked it (using the word &amp;#34;smelt&amp;#34; that is).</li>
            <li> Was a gift and what I hear is that it work well. Five is all I got . Recommend yes I would.</li>
            <li> So, I am old enough to need to actually replace one of these.  Has a Wahl or some such thing before and it was ok.  This one, though, is good.  Tight tolerances, easy to clean, does a good job at getting close to the skin without dragging or pulling.</li>
            <li> Works great for those silly little husband nose whiskers. No more nostril stares for that ole guy. he he he</li>
            <li> I became self-conscious of the little, tiny hairs around my nose. I did a little research and ended up purchasing this nose hair trimmer. It does a great job!! I even use it for other things - the area between my eyebrows and the hairs I miss on my upper lip. It has a cleaning mode where with the flick of a switch you can run it under water to get the hairs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is the batteries don&#x27;t last long in it.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results, after using on nose and ears, are exactly what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fred</li>
            <li> Bought this for Christmas presents for my wonderful husband and  great son n law and they both love it! Works great!</li>
            <li> This is a very good trimmer, better than the previous model the ER421KC which I had but never worked great! It does a good job and cleans out in seconds.  I highly recommend this trimmer.  It&#x27;s all you really need and reasonable in price!</li>
            <li> Works well, won&#x27;t break the bank!  I mean, what more can you say about an ear and nose hair trimmer?</li>
            <li> I didnt buy this because I am not old enough to need one of these yet.  But dang if that one random ear hair wont stay away!  This thing is quiet and efficient.  I cant imagine there being a better one except maybe a rechargable version.</li>
            <li> Works well and is not so loud that you feel like your damaging your ears which I was concerned about from other model I had. Just the joy of that weed wacker like sound chopping down those ear hairs.  I just wish it was electric. 1 rating point off only because it is not electric. I dont use for nose.</li>
            <li> Never thought I would be old enough to write a review about a nose hair trimmer,  sigh. Works great and cleans easy. What more can you say?</li>
            <li> Much better than what I have used in the past. Considering the price this is a winner for sure. Doesn&#x27;t hurt.</li>
            <li> All my old trimmers would nick and cut the inside of my nose.  This one never does, I would highly recommend it for anyone with an odd shaped nose or if you haven&#x27;t had luck with older model Panasonics.</li>
            <li> This is an inexpensive hair trimmer. I got it to replace the scissors I had been using to trim my nose hair. It does a neat job and has not yet pulled any hairs.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hygiene tool to replace one that I suspected may have been getting dull. It turns out that the one I had was dull and for sure this one will not yank half of my nostril into the blades. Great product at a great price and excellent service and delivery.</li>
            <li> This product is better than all previous brands I&#x27;ve used in the past. It does a good job more quickly than most. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Was a requested gift from my son-in-law for X-mas Guess he likes it. I have not spoken to him lately and since I am a woman I do not use one</li>
            <li> My husband have bought several Nose and Face trimmers and this is by far the best. It does a nice job of getting rid of the hairs in  his nose, ears and eyebrows. It quite sharp and most time he does only one pass and the hair is all gone. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Ok, so I&#x27;ve tried three different of these type trimmers in as many years. This one being the most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;I guess, I just don&#x27;t get it. Why go to all the trouble to manufacture what turns out to be a mediocre product?&lt;br /&gt;The motor sounds like it is running on half power. Yes, and I did put a fresh battery in it, hoping that would do the trick&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I expect this to be another one of my &amp;#34; collection&amp;#34; in less than six months.&lt;br /&gt;It the meantime, it does work....it does an average job trimming, if you want to hold it long enough.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit larger than others, which I had hoped would translate to better quality and durability...but sadly....no.&lt;br /&gt;I would just have to say it is no worse than others and not a whole lot better.</li>
            <li> Got this product for my boyfriend as he kept trying to pluck his nose hairs and it looked incredibly painful. He was so grateful I did too! This was so much quicker and less painful. However, he had a little blood afterward so we think a couple hairs snagged but he said it did not really hurt so all in all I&#x27;d say its a great product for a great price just make sure you have good batteries.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well (so far).&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that when i clean the head with water there is sometimes a dark liquid which washes into the sink.&lt;br /&gt;Almost looks like oil mixed in with the water used to clean it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple nose trimmers in the past. Neither worked very well, and both pulled my hair out at times. After reading reviews, I spent a few bucks more on this one. Works perfect, and never pulls my hair!</li>
            <li> This was a new product for me but i wanted to try it and i have to say it works. its a bit strange to stick in your nose but it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I searched around for a good nose hair trimmer. My prior unit broke, and I was looking for something that worked well, trimming close as possible to the skin, without an injury.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer does exactly that. I have thick hair, and the trimmer had no problem trimming it closely, without tugging my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the tip with water works well. A quick rinse in the sink cleans the tip.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t seems to cut the one with curbed one...&lt;br /&gt;and need to have it clean all the time after...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;but still good product to have.</li>
            <li> Batteries last a long time. Easy painless nosehair trimming. durable and easy to clean. I use it everyday and love it.</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for a few weeks but it seems to work as advertised.  Easy to clean and it does not feel like it is yanking the hair out of my brain through my nose.  I cannot go 5 stars until I see how it holds up over time.</li>
            <li> It seems Panasonic gets better at these trimmers every year.  This one spins very fast and runs smoothly.  I bought a &amp;#34;as seen of TV&amp;#34; one and it doesn&#x27;t compare to this Panasonic trimmer.</li>
            <li> This does serve the purpose but the razor edge is not sharp enough to cut through  my husband&#x27;s very tpugh beard.</li>
            <li> The last time I visited my barber, under instructions from my wife, I asked the barber if he could please get rid of the hair in my ears, that was thick enough to grow potatoes. I also have annoying nose hairs that tickled my nose on many embarrassing occasions. I wanted them gone too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My barber pulled out the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, and went to work. In maybe a minute, all my nose and ear hair was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I ran home (in my car, of course) jumped on the computer, and bought this wonderful item on Amazon.com, for less that 13 bucks; no tax and no delivery charge (I have Amazon Prime for an extremely cheap 79 bucks a year, which gives me free two-day shipping).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two days later, the trimmer was at my front door, and now I am in heaven. Every time I shave, I use the trimmer in both nostrils  and in both ears. It works like a charm, and now my wife will have to figure out another way to grow potatoes.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> This product does a nice job with the exception of the tickling feeling I get when I use it &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Nothing amazing, I mean, it&#x27;s a nose hair trimmer. But it was easy to put in a battery, worked well, and was easy to clean.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to well, def get this product, reliable, havent had to change the battery in a year and plus,</li>
            <li> okay, the product was described and the price was worth to be. you have to provide ur own battery though for it doesn&#x27;t come with it</li>
            <li> The clipper cuts really well.  My only complaint is that the battery life isn&#x27;t great.  Oh well, you can get 3 or so good cuts with this for one set of batteries and it does a great job.</li>
            <li> Price and quality were both highly appreciated. Cuts super close with no pulling or irritation to the skin. Would recommend to anyone that is dealing with ear/nose hair growth. I was tired of cutting my ears with my regular shaver and having to deal with embarrassing scabs on my ears when in public. Two thumbs up!</li>
            <li> So far so good on this bad boy. Less than $13! This thing works better than any other nose hair trimmer I have ever used and this is the least expensive of the bunch. It&#x27;s quiet, light and you can wash it under the faucet. I only have to use it once a week, if that, but I am super happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I really like this gaget! Does exactly what I need it to do. The slight curve does helps. It&#x27;s really easy to keep cleaned, too.</li>
            <li> Had several in my lifetime and this one is the best ever. Who would brag about a device like this. I&#x27;m not but as I said this one does the job.</li>
            <li> Battery life is much longer that my previous trimmer, and this one trims faster. Comfortable to hold on to, and a breeze to utilize.</li>
            <li> it is a lovely product. The item came on time and it was well packaged. I am pleased with my order and look forward in the near future to do business with this company again.</li>
            <li> No Pain no problems so far. It works great but have only used it to trim nose hair.  Just had it about week now will update if problems.</li>
            <li> works great for the undesirable task of trimming nose hair. Don&#x27;t have anything else to add &amp; Amazon needs to rethink their minimum word requirement</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer.  It&#x27;s powerful and versatile. I have had this for some time now with no issues.</li>
            <li> works well, quiet too. It works very smoothly too... no hassle. The great part is that it&#x27;s washable under running water</li>
            <li> Though I love the trimmer, it is certainly not meant to replace a true beard and mustache trimmer. This device is for those delicate areas that require pinpoint precision, and not for removing extensive amounts of hair. This Panasonic trimmer is good for fine tuning your mustache, beard, eyebrows, and good for ear or nose hair removal. Just a great all around product for such a low price.</li>
            <li> Amazon had great pricing on this trimmer that I purchased as a gift.  The person who received it LOVES it and said it is one of the best trimmers they have ever owned!  Easy to clean under running water and &amp;#34;no-stall&amp;#34; operation!!</li>
            <li> It feels underpowered and takes a bit of a fuss on nose hairs.  Facial hair, not unless you have all night.</li>
            <li> Really happy with this trimmer.  My old one always hurt as it pulled out the hairs rather than cutting, even when new.  Not this one, it really cuts well, it&#x27;s quiet, and it can even be rinsed out in the shower...awesome!</li>
            <li> I had this for only 2 months. When I went to use it for the 3rd time it would not come on.</li>
            <li> It just doesn&#x27;t seem like it does the job the way I would want it to, but is effective.  I feel like I need something a little more powerful, so if you are an especially hairy person, you might want to try something else.  It is quiet, light weight, and sturdy.</li>
            <li> A great value and worked really well, for two months. I can&#x27;t get an exchange from Amazon as it&#x27;s one week outside of their return policy, Panasonic wants me to ship it to them at my cost for repair or replacement. It&#x27;s not worth the time and money to bother, I know for sure I&#x27;ll never buy another Panasonic product.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a while now and have not seen any trouble at all. Can be rinsed out with water for cleaning which is easy to do. good product</li>
            <li> this trimmer is okay for it&#x27;s price. the only complaint i have about it, is that it&#x27;s kinda weak when it comes to power. you put in a brand new battery and the speed is just a little too slow in my opinion. other than that it&#x27;s alright.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer easy to use and works well. It fits well in hand, gets the job done fast, and has easy to read instructions. I haven&#x27;t tried to wet wash it yet, but I am sure it won&#x27;t be any problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had philips bodygroomers in the past and this one is no different, meaning it works PERFECT, no irritation, no cuts, feels as smooth as if you shaved with a regular razor.  If theres any downside, it&#x27;s that the foil on these things were not meant to last forever unfortunatly, depending how much you use it, how aggressive you use it, if you use it wet or dry will impact how long the foil  lasts.  trial and error my friends, def worth the money!!</li>
            <li> all my life i got nose hair trimmers from tv advertisements and other brands  . but i have to say panasonic makes the best one. buy it with eyes closed..</li>
            <li> This is the best of a group of groomers I&#x27;ve owned. The product does what it is supposed to do. Cleaning is easy and the wet/dry feature is good.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works fine and is very easy to use.  The price was outstanding and it arrived promptly.  It was just what was expected.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is quiet and cuts better (less hair pulled out by the roots) than other trimmers.  It was difficult to open.  I had to call customer service for assistance.</li>
            <li> Many others have stated the grinding noise this will eventually make.  The blades come loose and grind against the outer shell making it unusable due to slower speeds.  Panasonic says mail it in, but shipping costs almost what a new one does.  Moving on to another brand, and that is unfortunate because this thing is a champ while it works.</li>
            <li> a little disappointed. It didn&#x27;t cut the nose hairs well. You had to go over the area a few times to get the job done.</li>
            <li> UPDATE AFTER FEW MONTHS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many other brands I tried, the blade gets stacked and won&#x27;t start even with daily cleaning. I need to lubricate it with water to get started.&lt;br /&gt;Since last week the blade makes loud mechanical noise. Very disappointing Panasonic! To late for return of this low quality product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My original review 5 star:&lt;br /&gt;I have been through about 5 brands and the issues were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1-not powerful enough engine causing the trimmer to slow down or stop&lt;br /&gt;2-not enough close cutting leaving hair in the side of nostril etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device is superior, great engine and super easy to clean with water jet wash, love it!</li>
            <li> This is my second one, and this is the best.  I love it.  It is easy and quick and does the job.</li>
            <li> I am a female, and it is painless to use on nasal hair. It sucks getting older, but this helps. Easy to follow instructions.</li>
            <li> Its Panasonic, you cannot go wrong with this company! Most of the stuff I have is Panasonic and highly recommend this product. Cuts my nose hairs nicely, and it only takes one battery and it lasts a while!</li>
            <li> This little gadget makes it easy to take grooming to the inside edges.  While hair doesn&#x27;t readily grow on my head, it grows wild in unwanted areas such as ears and nose.  Just a few minutes once or twice a week prevents me from looking like a walking hairball.  It is also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for several months now and I love how easy it is to clean and how well it works! It is perfect for trimming everything that has hair. I&#x27;ve even used it on my dog&#x27;s ears (probably not recommended by Panasonic). It has never pulled my hairs or pinched me in the time I&#x27;ve had it. I highly recommend this device!</li>
            <li> A power tool for your nose!  Isn&#x27;t that every guy&#x27;s dream?  I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks, used it a few times- quick, painless, slick- it seems very well-constructed.  So far, it seems perfect.</li>
            <li> poorly made, eats batteries, uncomfortable (pinches and plucks out hairs). Does not trim close. Can jam and stall. It died after two weeks.</li>
            <li> This works much better than any other product or method I have used. I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a trimmer of this type.</li>
            <li> This is a great item, but i had to return the 1st one but 2nd one worked great no issues. I think I just got a bad one the 1st time.</li>
            <li> Gotta have one for the nose and ears...  Safe, never been cut, Works excellent!&lt;br /&gt;One AAA battery lasts a long, long time.</li>
            <li> The trimmer seems to work great on fine hair. I get some dark hair on the outside edges of my ears and it takes care of that just fine. The nose hair is a little thicker, and it stopped once when a thick hair jammed it up, but it still easier takes care of the nose hair with minimal pulling, as long as I go slow. However, the manufacturer claims it&#x27;s good for edging beards and mustaches, but when I tried it out, it failed abysmally. Beard and mustache hair is too thick for the trimmer&#x27;s tiny little blades and motor to handle. It ends up pulling and jamming, and seems like it wouldn&#x27;t be good for the blades at all, so I stopped using it after one attempt. I&#x27;m gonna keep it for ears and nose hair (it&#x27;d work on eyebrows too, probably), but saying it can edge beards and mustaches is a fabrication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was a little disappointed with the feel of the whole thing. The pictures and video make it seem more than it is. It doesn&#x27;t feel chinsy, but certainly isn&#x27;t as high quality as it could be, with the switch mechanism and the motor. Though, it&#x27;s still a decent buy for the price, I guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had excessive nose hair as long as I can remember and it just gets better with age - not.  I had a rotary trimmer years and years ago that snagged hair and yanked it out and it HURT, so I got scared of them and have made do with little scissors since.  They&#x27;re okay until you jab a bit the wrong way or snip when you incorrectly think you&#x27;ve just got hair between the blades and then OWWWW!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I saw this and all the good reviews and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  Just freaking amazing!  I stuck it in my nose and it sounded like there was a lawn mower running in there but I did not feel one single pull, not a twinge, not a hint, nothing.  I was very tentative and delicate with it because I expected to get a painful snag any second.  Nope.  I tried the other nostril; same story.  Went in the bathroom and looked and I have *no* nose hair.  None.  This is magic and should get 10 stars at twice the price.  Buy buy buy!</li>
            <li> My last nose trimmer died and I went without for one for awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I pulled the trigger on this one. My last didn&#x27;t cut at the top, just the sides, which made cutting some hairs REALLY interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a few times and I use it a couple of times a month. If it lasts a year, it will be worth what I paid.</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer, easy to clean and NO PULLING on hairs.  Easily worth the few bucks it costs to keep yourself neat and tidy.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  Far more superior than my previous one, would recommend this product to anyone. Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This unit stopped working after ONE use. I would advise consumers to not purchase this device. It took me longer to remove this trimmer from the packaging, than the device actually ran.</li>
            <li> have been using for a few weeks now and it is very nice and virtually painless. would recommend to anyone sporting that nostril bush</li>
            <li> Something very satisfying about trimming nose hair.  Works great on ear hair too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28, my wife said I needed one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that I&#x27;m 28 and wish I DIDN&#x27;T need one of these, it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was picturing chainsaw action when I read &amp;#34;nose hair clipper&amp;#34;, but it&#x27;s actually painless, no pulling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I mention I&#x27;m only 28 and wish I didn&#x27;t need one of these yet?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next I&#x27;ll be writing a review about walkers....</li>
            <li> This is great for doing inside your nose and ears.  It does other surface areas okay as well, but prefer a straight edge to do those areas as it&#x27;s hard to create a clean line with this.  I also found the batteries went dead fairly fast.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have too much experience with this type of product, I did buy one other nose and ear groomer about 5 years ago.  Needless to say, it was unpleasant.  Having your nose hairs tugged out en masse is never a fun thing.  But this one is different.  It cuts cleanly, with no tugging.  It is also water resistant, and has a slider switch to enable use in wet conditions.  Cleaning is a breeze, just remove the top cap and run it under some water while turned on.  I have no comment on battery life as of yet, the original batteries I have in it have yet to give sign they are dying after 3 full uses.  Construction feels a little sacrificed on this unit, it doesn&#x27;t have a very robust feel to it, nor does it carry heft.  However, I believe it is solidly built, it&#x27;s just the majority of the unit is plastic.  For the price of this unit you really can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Works great! Washable tip feature is good to have.</li>
            <li> Waste of money. Item came and did not work, cheaply made. I threw it out since returning it would have cost as much as I paid off this. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the performance of this trimmer.  It is easy to use and does the job well.  I also love the feature of cleaning this device very much.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> my husband has gone through dozens of trimmers and this is by far his favorite</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well trimming the hair in the nose. It also works on my eyebrows. No more bleeding noses.</li>
            <li> I like this a lot. It does what I need it to do and trimmers painlessly. i was a little skeptical of the battery power vs rechargeable plug in, but now I&#x27;m sold. Unit goes in the drawer when I don&#x27;t need it and keeps the counter clear. Batteries last a long time.</li>
            <li> This product broke after 2 uses.  It is cheap and I was very disapointed.  When it worked, it was fine, but didn&#x27;t last past 2 uses</li>
            <li> Amazing! Just put it in your nose although I did need to go to Walgreens for the aa battery!! :(</li>
            <li> The last item I purchased like this was so painful to use that I threw it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is great.  No pulling and does a great job on nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price.</li>
            <li> Works well and seem to clip better than the ones I have had previously. Works well and seem to clip better than the ones I have had previously.</li>
            <li> Works well and is effective.  I would recommend the product.  Easy to use and works great.  I would buy the same product again.</li>
            <li> It is better than the most expensive ones I have bought and does not pull which is extremely pleasant. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It preformed its job well.  Very durable,easy to operate and is very pleased with the product.  Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> WORKS GREAT!  MY HUSBAND IS USING IT - YAY!!</li>
            <li> Works well, but would prefer a rechargeable, cordless one next time. Not a fan of changing batteries. Otherwise it trims pretty well. My husband hasn&#x27;t had any complaints for me.</li>
            <li> stopped working shortly after i purchased it.  doesn&#x27;t really connect with battery well so doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> I avoided using one of these for years, but I&#x27;m over 50 and the ear and nostril hair grows faster than my midsection, so I gave it a try. I chose it because it had the best reviews on Amazon and the positive reviews were right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t spend mored. By this trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper than my last trimmer so I guess I should expect it would not have the power.  It&#x27;s okay.</li>
            <li> Mostly for nasal hair .. seems to work fine and I haven&#x27;t cut myself ...... yet .... we&#x27;ll give it time!</li>
            <li> The best of the average trimmers on the market. Not overly thrilled, but it&#x27;s better than the last two I purchased. That said some day someone will make a trimmer that works well.</li>
            <li> Not much else to say than that it works effectively without a whole lot of fluff. I prefer this type to all others for both comfort and capability. Runs off batteries, which rarely need changing.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product with an easy grip. Let&#x27;s face it, a nose clipper is a nose clipper, but his one has an ergonomical grip; and eliminates the hairs in the nose as well as the ears.</li>
            <li> Got this as a gift for a friend and they loved it. It&#x27;s easy to use and it&#x27;s not very noisy.</li>
            <li> This one doesn&#x27;t nick anything. You can flail around in noses and ears and don&#x27;t have to worry about hurting anything. It&#x27;s also very nice that you can stick it under the facet and rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve every tried. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Im Not Use To This Little Thing Yet, But It Does The Job.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly and is easy to clean! This is exactly what I needed.  Trims perfectly without any pulling. Easily stores away.</li>
            <li> This works extremely well. Previously I had a smaller trimmer that used a smaller battery, however the smaller trimmer&#x27;s battery did not last very long, and neither did the trimmer. This trimmer works well, and lasts longer due to its larger battery and being a higher quality item.</li>
            <li> I do not have a lot of nose hair but enough that I felt I needed this. It stopped working even with a battery change after 2 weeks. I also bought another Panasonic that didn&#x27;t work. I think I need to change brands.</li>
            <li> Burned through several other units because they go dull so fast.  This one has kept going for 6 months now with no problems.  Stays sharp and has no mechanical issues so far.  Worth every penny in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have bought numerous &amp;#34;Nose&amp;#34; trimmers,for the price this is 1 of the Best ones,&lt;br /&gt;but nothing beats an expensive pair of Revelon tweezers,a car rearview mirror or&lt;br /&gt;Vanity magnified mirror/light and a box of kleenex for tears!</li>
            <li> PURCHASED FOR MY HUSBAND-ONE FOR HOME AND ONE FOR TRAVEL.  ONCE WE PUT AWAY THE CHRISTMAS MESS AND OPENED THEM AND PURCHASED BATTERIES, ONE DID NOT WORK.  I THOUGHT THE BATTERY MIGHT BE OLD, PURCHASED MORE AND IT NEVER WORKED.  THE OTHER ONE DIED AFTER A MONTH AND HE SAID IT DID NOT WORK WELL. IT DOES NOT SEEM TO ME THAT THIS IS A VERY TECHNICAL PRODUCT. HOW HARD CAN IT BE TO MAKE A BATTERY OPERATED NOSE HAIR TRIMMER. SCISSORS WORK OK.  BY THE TIME WE FIGURED THAT THEY BOTH WERE NOT WORKING, IT WAS TOO LATE TO RETURN.</li>
            <li> Very well pleased with the trimmer, it does exactly what I purchased it for. I like the wet cleaning feature as well.</li>
            <li> I hardly ever rate anything!  But I had to stop and tell you that this is the best darn trimmer ever!  I replaced an older Panasonic that lasted for many years with this new one.  My nose hairs are trimmed so close it looks like little dudes went up there and shaved me with razors.  VERY GOOD BUY!!!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as well as I expected, based up reviews and rating.  Just O.K. It works, not outstanding t.hough</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. have used 3 times so far. it works great and easy to clean. love it! I hope it will last as well.</li>
            <li> This is a Great product I have found it to be one of the Best and easiest I have used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts and doesn&#x27;t pull the hair, it runs off one double A battery, and it rinses under a faucet with it&#x27;s cleaning feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works and Fills my needs, I would suggest this to anyone need a Great Trimmer, I have tried other brands including Whal, Remington, And one or two other I cant recall what there names are, Sorry.</li>
            <li> Works great. Definitely a good buy.  Bought one for me and one for my wife. Best trimmer we&#x27;ve had yet.</li>
            <li> A bit cheaply made but works adequately. Pretty much as expected. The cutting blade is pretty flimsy so I would be suprised if it works for more than a few months.</li>
            <li> Not much to say other than it works and it is cheap.  Much better than other cheap trimmers I have bought.  Only had it for about 2 months now...but still works great...use it about once a week with no issues.</li>
            <li> Easy to use. Great quality.</li>
            <li> How hard is it to make a nose hair trimmer that works? This one does.</li>
            <li> I own a few other panasonic units from long ago.  They ripped the hair out of my nose and it hurt.  This one is EXCELLENT.  it is quiet.  it works on the nose and ears and even the face.  huge improvement in quality and it uses AA battery! I am so so happy I bought this</li>
            <li> Very nice ,I like is so much , it is very good and very easy to use and very Safe.</li>
            <li> This does it&#x27;s job period.  Great Value.  If looking for a Nose Trimmer look no further this is the one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through several different types and brands of trimmers, and this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.  It&#x27;s powerful and does it&#x27;s job well, and it&#x27;s even great for detail work around mustaches and goatees.  The fact that it&#x27;s got a setting for use in the shower as well, wet/dry, is a bonus.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll start this review out by saying that I mainly use this as a nose hair trimmer and with ocassional facial hair and eyebrow trimming as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have read where people have mixed reviews when it came to them touching up their facial hair and eyebrows.  So I decided to bite the bullet and give it a try.  I have coarse hair and have had ZERO problems with this.  Trimmed stray eyebrow hairs and stray goatee hairs with ease and no pulling whatsoever.  Trimming nose hairs are just as painless.  It&#x27;s easy to wash as well.  Just twist the switch and run the device under water to clean.  It really can&#x27;t be any simpler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that I wish I knew about this product sooner!</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever used, painless and works really well. It is easy to clean and is really high quality. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product. I have wasted too much money on other trimming products to finally find this great product.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it was designed and performs extremely well.  Another great product from Panasonic, and the fact that it is cleanable makes it a best buy.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, care for, pretty quiet, and not painful if you press a little too hard. Eats through batteries after a handful of uses.</li>
            <li> No pulling those tender nose hairs!&lt;br /&gt;This little device is well worth the price!&lt;br /&gt;Shipped quickly and without any problems!</li>
            <li> I have tried a few of the trimmers over the last few year, This one is by far the best of the lot.  Only complain is that its not easy to trim stray hairs off the eyebrows as it&#x27;s not designed that well for that function but for everything else this one is hard to beat.  I like mine and got one for my dad as well.</li>
            <li> Does a great job and it is super easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean and you can hear it working in your nose. I use it all the time to keep those nose hairs down.</li>
            <li> This one is far better than other similar products that I have tried in the past. You can go for this product.</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer works very well if you are gentle with it.Do not jam it in you nose looking for positive results or you will get your first scorpion bite followed by some tears.If you follow this advice you will have a pleasurable experience.The cleaning feature is neat and works.Great job Panasonic.Everyone should have one of these in the bathroom.</li>
            <li> This machine does a grand job; quick, painless, quiet and very easy to clean.  Oh, the joy of bald nostrils!</li>
            <li> It worked amazingly at first, after a few uses it turned useless. It simply won&#x27;t cut anymore and the motor sounds like it bogs down if you slightly turn it. 2 stars because at first, it kicked ass</li>
            <li> Great item for the price.</li>
            <li> For the highly rated item with a lot of sales I wasn&#x27;t skeptical at all. This does exactly what it says it does! Great product rom a great company. No complaints at all. Not loud, not low quality, not dirty, well packaged... what more can you ask for?</li>
            <li> Bought two and initially they did a great job. Unfortunately within two months they both stopped working.</li>
            <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;Trims hair&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t tug&lt;br /&gt;Does its job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;Lil bulky</li>
            <li> Perfect!  Added bonus, washable!</li>
            <li> Took me awhile (a few times) to get used to sticking a buzzing device up my nose, but I love this little guy. Worth every penny. Just wished more guys would buy this and clean out their nose.</li>
            <li> Great....light weight but study,</li>
            <li> This little trimmer works excellently.&lt;br /&gt;It never seems like it is doing anything as it seems slow moving, but it does.&lt;br /&gt;A fine purchase would purchase again.</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent delivery time, I would re-order. Thanks for such good service/</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> What I was looking for soes the job</li>
            <li> Quiet, safe, efficient, and very easy to clean using the rinse feature. Takes care of all my needs.</li>
            <li> They work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice price!</li>
            <li> This unit is quiet but that is its only plus.  Perhaps it is just my hair but this doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I go over the hairs over and over again and they remain.  I am so disappointed.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different nose hair trimmers and this is definitely the best one for me. Cuts clean with no pulling and no skin abrasion  and rinses clean with a little warm water after each use.</li>
            <li> So far no problems, i like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Nothing super special but cuts clean without pulling.</li>
            <li> Works good not great.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my hubby and he loves it, works great.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.  Very effective.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useless and awful product.</li>
            <li> Does what its intended</li>
            <li> exactly what I needed</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Cuts nice, no hair gets ripped out&lt;br /&gt;Great battery life (takes one AA battery)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;none so far.</li>
            <li> Only used it once, but it seems to do a good job of getting a nice close cut. Doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; nose hairs at all!</li>
            <li> Battery does not last very long.</li>
            <li> got this for dog ears and works so well....thanks came fast and have been using it ever since...</li>
            <li> works great ......came on time .....everything was included</li>
            <li> Gets rid of my nose hair. What more can I ask for.</li>
            <li> This thing does what it&#x27;s supposed to do and cleanup is easy and simple. Not a lot of mess or complicated procedures to clean it. It does seem weak. I&#x27;ve tried known fresh batteries right out of the package but it still sounds like it&#x27;s having problems cutting hair. I expect it to get caught on a nose hair one day and give me the pleasure of having to rip it out of my nostril. So far though, it has not done that. Hopefully it will continue to work, however weak sounding, and prove to be a quality grooming device for years to come.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this.  I have tried a number of these trimmers and wanted something better.  Something that wasnt as cheap feeling as the others i have tried.  This is a nice product, well made, and i am sure it will last.  Would buy it again for sure.</li>
            <li> Got it for my friend. He likes it. He says it works well and it doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. Super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. I use recharge-able battery and it works well. Good price as well</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried different trimmers, including an older model Panasonic, and none came close to this trimmer.  It&#x27;s fast, easy, painless, and does such a great job on my nose hairs, that I don&#x27;t have to worry about them for a long time between trimmings.  An added bonus is that it&#x27;s very easy to clean.  Pretty much the perfect nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Bottom line...excellent</li>
            <li> Very good, I can finally breathe out of my nose!</li>
            <li> very little noise...works well.</li>
            <li> good result of nose hair shaving, and easy to clean. good.</li>
            <li> Decent little ear and nose trimmer.  Very pleased and happy with the price which was significantly less than I&#x27;ve seen advertised elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Great product,  finally a good grooming tool.  Highly, recommended.</li>
            <li> It works - compared to 2 others I have bought before, this one does the job beautifully.</li>
            <li> Does whatit is supposed to do &amp; cleanable.</li>
            <li> I love it, no more plucking my nose hair and tears dripping down my cheeks. Only thing I don&#x27;t like is the small amount of burn smell while in use.</li>
            <li> Got this for a good price. It works well and can trim closely with precision. Haven&#x27;t had it long enough to say how it holds up. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this for his unwanted nose hairs. We&#x27;ve had the product for quite some time now and the batteries haven&#x27;t even dies yet. Very durable.</li>
            <li> So far, this item is working just fine. It is very comfortable to handle and so far it does not pull the hairs.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised!  I like that it takes batteries so that it is one less thing I have to charge.  Also, I will not be using it terribly often so I assume I will not have to change the batteries frequently.  A+</li>
            <li> Works great, can use to touch up mustache and eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;Takes one AA battery and turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;It functions well, is quiet and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Usually only needs a simple rinse rather than adjusting the blade, turning the cap, and popping it off. But easy either way.&lt;br /&gt;Little on the big side, smaller would be easier to control.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean. - gets in all those nooks and crannies a must for those with hair in unwanted places (the mature)</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. Awesome product. (thumbs up)</li>
            <li> Bought this for my elderly father in law. Should be easy for him to use.</li>
            <li> Works great and i like the washable feature. It makes it feel more clean versus just wiping down like my older models. It goes thru batteries just a tiny bit faster tan I would like but that&#x27;s really not a big deal at all.</li>
            <li> This little gem does the job, without noise or pain. Really like it a lot. Will suit you if you like a good machine with no bells and whistles, doesn&#x27;t take up much space, and is very effective.</li>
            <li> First thing I noticed was how quiet this shaver is,nice when you use it near your ears. Good product at very low cost,really does the job and runs a long time on the battery. . Try this one I think you will really like it.</li>
            <li> Great product...I love it.  Works very well</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work well for nose or much else. Maybe since I used rechargeable batteries but if that&#x27;s the case I have other, older &amp; cheaper tools that do a much better job.</li>
            <li> Good item. Does the job</li>
            <li> This is great. Easy to use, which is important. Works fast and does not hurt!. Easy to hold. No bulky.</li>
            <li> Works great fast effective!</li>
            <li> The vortex seems to be standing up well to the test of time, and still cutting hair. Good price--worth the cost.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this product! It is easy to use, requires common batteries, and is effective. Also, it&#x27;s small enough to leave out on the counter.</li>
            <li> Used to trim nose hair and trim around my beard, no problems, very convenient. Doesn&#x27;t work well with rechargeable batteries though.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried three other trimmers before this, and this is my favorite.  the er-gn30-k functions well and so far seems sturdy.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is super.  Has plenty of power and is easy to maneuver in hard to reach places.  Even runs when wet, though I haven&#x27;t tried that.  Reasonable price for excellent, name brand quality.</li>
            <li> Hi there. How are you today... I hope you&#x27;re doing well. Okay, product review time: This is a great nose trimmer. I used to pull out the hair of my nose, but since I use this, I&#x27;ve yet gotten rid of another bad habit. However I&#x27;d prefer that it come with a battery included, or for it to be rechargeable. But besides that, this is a fantastic buy! Thanks for reviewing and have an awesome day, will ya.... :)</li>
            <li> Product worked great - when it decided to work. I think I got a defective product and will update when I get the replacement.</li>
            <li> Compared to 3 similar products I&#x27;ve used over the last 6 years, this nose/ear hair trimmer has two big pluses: 1) It&#x27;s modestly priced (under $15); and 2) IT WORKS! In fact, it works amazingly well, is easy to use, and does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Durability has been a problem with some other trimmers that lasted roughly a year. This one has a 2 yr. warranty, so we&#x27;ll see. In the meantime I look forward to continuing to use this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This product worked great the first time, then wouldn&#x27;t work when I went to use it the second time. Tried numerous different brands of batteries and none could get it to work again. Terrible quality.</li>
            <li> Yes, kind of a personal item, but needed.  It works exactly as advertised, does a great job and does not hurt or &amp;#34;pull&amp;#34; at all.  I recommend it.  It arrived right on schedule, in perfect condition.  I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> I like this better than my old one that was pulling rather than cutting...</li>
            <li> Husband can single handedly mow down pesky ear and nose hairs at whim now!  Thanks, Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Works great, first one I have ever owned and wish I would have purchased on long ago instead of using little scissors...</li>
            <li> I basically bought this to make it easier to trim my nose hair. Barbers don&#x27;t do it any more and as I got older it grows faster anyway. It is very practical for that though I had to get used to the tickle. It is easy to clean. I just hold it under the faucet. The instructions for dry cleaning were complicated compared to the wet method. Other facial and ear hair is easier to trim with a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not high powered, so it takes a while and gets a little hot in the process. It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and it works as advertised. No more nose hair, ear hair, excess whiskers, hell, I might use it for trimming the bushes out front of da trailer.</li>
            <li> This little guy gets the job done. Easy to use, and easy to clean. Best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Very handy, effective and useful. Cleaning is a cinch. Battery life is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Two years, and still kicking strong.</li>
            <li> Actually works and works well, a little pricey so I took  a star off...</li>
            <li> Works well and good quality for the monay.</li>
            <li> buy it.  You wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Does what it claims, but not spectacularly. Still haven&#x27;t got the hang of the &#x27;water flushing&#x27; system, but seems to work by just blowing it clean!</li>
            <li> So far, so good!  Really gets a close shave for my nose hairs, PLUS, if I miss anything shaving, it gets that really close to the skin too!  Very comfy grip.</li>
            <li> Stopped working all together after four uses.</li>
            <li> Terrible item.  It barely cut nose hairs and quit working after 6 or 7 uses over 4 month period.  Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
            <li> What can I say, it works.  It trims your nose hair without much pain.</li>
            <li> No more nose hairs!  Used it two months ago and they are still gone!  Easy to clean and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer i use it all the time but my next one will be rechargeable.</li>
            <li> Works fine. but had to send the first one ordered back because it wouldn&#x27;t run. Amazon replaced it immediately, even before I had returned the defective one. Very happy with it, quiet and easy to use.</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s nostrils have never been so clean and hair free! ;-)  No pulling of hairs and no cuts!</li>
            <li> Plucking my nose hairs proved painful, and using scissor was a delicate procedure.  This trimmer is perfect for taming my nostril hairs. No more unsightly boogers stuck in the hairs nor hairs hanging outside my nose.  I also find trimming the hairs helps me breath better.  The price was good, it runs on a single double A battery, and appears to be easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Not very powerful. Need to go over an area several times to remove hair.  The openings at the cutting edge are too short.  The ergonoic design is not comfortable in your hand. Will look for another brand.</li>
            <li> Just be careful, this is an excellent device but you can easily injure yourself in a incredibly annoying but mostly harmless way if you get overzealous.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what you want.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t say performance is exceptional but appreciate the comfortable feel and ease of cleaning.  On performance it IS as good or even better than any of the many others I have used.  None met desirables but none injured either (except for one)!!</li>
            <li> Great for all it&#x27;s recommended for using.  Particularly good for nose and eyebrows.  Completely pain free.  I ended up buying 3:  one for nose, one for eyebrows and one for a spare.  Would recommend this with my highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Best nose clippers and they are cheap. Keeps my nose looking like a teenagers nose, I am a happy old fart...A+</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be a hairy mammoth. Most people aren&#x27;t interested in checking out flies legs hanging out your nostrils. Do some maintenance and trim those ugly things off. This does the job no worries. Works as advertised. Quick and easy to use. Takes an AA battery and I have not changed it in 6 months. I use this maybe once per week on average.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, removes your unwanted hair fantastically, no pain and easy to wash. Recommended.</li>
            <li> Looks and works just like the wright up!!!</li>
            <li> this is working perfectly!</li>
            <li> purchased for my husband, he said this is the first trimmer that didnt yank out the nose hair</li>
            <li> I hate nose hair. It bothers me a LOT. This gets rid of it all perfectly and I haven&#x27;t found any other nose hair trimmers that do the job as well as this. Very simple and effective. Bought it in the middle of the night from my phone when my nose was bothering me too much. Growing up sucks.</li>
            <li> This is pretty good, does what it is supposed to do!!&lt;br /&gt;cleans easily and battery lasts for months(been using it over a year and its still going strong).&lt;br /&gt;Quality product, I recommend it!!</li>
            <li> This is a winner of an item.  I have tried different ones before and bought a different style for my husband that was so flimsy and basicly worthless.  This one is built well and works exactly as expected.  I definately recommend this item.  Edited to add--I bought another one for my husband. Our toddler even loves to &amp;#34;use&amp;#34; it.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Excellent value for the money.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> working good for now will see how well they holdup</li>
            <li> Works slightly better than earlier models.</li>
            <li> Panasonic makes good grooming devices. This is good. Silent and effective.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is easy to clean and easy to use.  All you have to do is turn it on and shove it up your nostrils!  (as long as there are batteries in it, which of course are not included).  This trimmer also works famously for getting stray hairs around your eyebrow line, or around your nose that you may have missed with your razor that morning because your a lazy schmuck when it comes to shaving.</li>
            <li> So far so good.... I replaced my 10 yr old Panasonic unit with this one.  Better handle and lighter. Let&#x27;s see how long this will last</li>
            <li> It works great.  CAn&#x27;t give it 5 stars cause it does feel a lot plastic... But then again what do you expect? Ha.</li>
            <li> My nostrils had become so overgrown, I was afraid I was going to suffocate in my sleep. Thank you Panasonic for saving my life.</li>
            <li> So far I love it. It actually works unlike another similar trimmer that I tried before (which wasn&#x27;t trimming anything).</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked fine... Until you have to clean it.  The first time I unscrewed the top portion to clean it out, a tiiiiny little spring that holds the blade up fell out. This spring is so small that it can be hard to reposition or even see if you don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s in there.  The second time I cleaned this trimmer, the spring fell out again and down the sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous nose trimmer was a Norelco and I had that for years.  Funny that I only had this trimmer for about a month and it is now inoperable.  Extremely flawed engineering.</li>
            <li> having owned several of these devices, i&#x27;ve still not seen anything comparable to the old heavy-duty sharper image \\&quot;turbo groomer 2.0\\&quot; i had ten years ago, but this is about as close as anything out there.  it is a tiny little thing, lightly built. it does not have a lot of power and uses only a \\&quot;AA\\&quot; cell. but it is quiet, well designed and it AT LEAST CUTS THE HAIRS, which is more than the others will do. it does not spin very fast, but the blades are well made, they cut efficiently. you can rinse it out with water (ok) or just pop the head off and tap it on a counter (better). it doesn&#x27;t burn up the battery too fast, it doesn&#x27;t pull and snag. its easy to hold and seems to catch the hairs more quickly and easily at more angles than the mangroomer and others. you will have to go back and touch up with a regular scissors every now and again, but mostly this will be all you need. i&#x27;d still like to see a sturdier, more heavily built, maybe even rechargeable, version of something like this, but for now this is about the best i&#x27;ve seen out there.  recommended.</li>
            <li> This works great. It is nice to be able to clean it with soap and water. The Vortex is great for nose and ears!</li>
            <li> Works pretty well as a nose hair trimmer but it broke really, really easily. Disappointing, given how durable other Panasonic grooming devices have proven to be over the years.</li>
            <li> I loved this device and used it for over 9 month. but it just stopped working. I liked it so much that I ordered another one, but hope this one works longer.</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  It does a good job on trimming hair in your ears . This tool works great for that. Its pretty easy to clean. I could not do with out one now.  It uses 1 AA battery . My battery has been in it for 6 months and its still working.  I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does a great job... when it turns on. I&#x27;ve found that on occasion mine simply won&#x27;t turn on. I&#x27;ve tried a few different batteries and get the same result. Still this only happens maybe once every 5 times, and I will admit that I might just have extremely bad luck with batteries. Your luck may vary, and for that I would still recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is my first and only purchase of a product like this and I&#x27;m quite happy with it. For those like me who have never bought something like this before let me reassure  you: it will not pull your hair out, it&#x27;s gentle, and it works.  The hair on my ears was just getting to be too much and this trimmer took care of it with no problem at all.  I have no clue how long a single AA battery will last in it nor do I know if any of the other products listed on Amazon in this category are better. What I do know is that this one works and I&#x27;m glad I bought it.  Now, if we could just get Panasonic and others to redesign their packaging so it&#x27;s more easily openable...</li>
            <li> I love this little hair trimmer, I use this to trim and shape my eyebrows, so much easier and lot less painful than eyebrows threading.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer thinking it would, well, trim! Imagine my dismay when one day (after a few weeks of use and cleaning in accordance with the directions) the trimmer did not turn on. I changed the battery, check the head to see if there was a jam all to no avail. If it were possible to assign no stars and review, I would. This trimmer deserves less than one star for less than a month&#x27;s worth of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am beyond disgusted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the scissors it is I suppose.</li>
            <li> Ordered this and was skeptical. I really liked my comb style trimmer from Noreclo, but this one is infinitely better. Easier to use in everyway imaginable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for ear, nose and that spot right between your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my comb trimmer I couldn&#x27;t tell if it was actually clipping hair or not.... Especailly with ears and nose because you can&#x27;t really \\&quot;see\\&quot; as you cut. But with this style of rotary trimmer, you actually hear the hair being cut, so you know it&#x27;s doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again, no questions asked.</li>
            <li> This product worked absolutely great for a while; the best I have ever had. Unfortunately it only lasted four months. (Amazon kindly gave me a refund when I called and explained my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have bought S I X Panasonic hair trimmers in the last eight years. Every single one of them failed. I believe I have sent in every single one of them to be repaired while they were still under warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The latest one, the ER-GN30, was bought only four months ago. Yesterday it started making a loud buzzing noise, which it had not made previously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I called the number on the warranty sheet enclosed with the product, and THEY tell me they do not fix ear and nose trimmers, and I have to send it to Texas, which address is not even on the warranty sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This is the last Panasonic product I will ever buy.</li>
            <li> This product died on me after 5 months. I am going to be spending a bit more on a different product.</li>
            <li> Awesome performance, light weight, does not heat up on tough jobs. After using several products totally in love with this one, especially for its performance, looks and ability to do what its supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I scanned reviews before buying this trimmer.  I remember reading some reviews indicating that the product died relatively quickly.  I thought to myself I&#x27;ve never had that happen, so I went ahead and bought it.  Well, it happened.  When the trimmer works, I think it works well.  I never used it for more than 20-30 seconds, always cleaned it with a brush, kept it clean and dry.  After about 3 - 4 months of use maybe twice a week, one morning, the trimmer just wouldn&#x27;t power on.  I changed to fresh batteries, but nothing.  At the end of the day, it wasn&#x27;t too big a hit at only $15 or so, but for it to die out that quickly really irked me.  It&#x27;s unfortunate, too, because when it works, again, it works well.</li>
            <li> As I get older, I have less hair on my head, and more everywhere else.  This helps keep you from looking like your own Grandfather looked to you when you were a kid.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was very disappointed with this trimmer after using it for the first time. I bought it to replace the nose/ear trimming portion of my all-in-one groomer that finally gave out after 7 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions for cleaning the trimmer are more confusing than they need to be (a Panasonic trademark) and the actual cleaning is tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was more than a little miffed that using the device on my nose often resulted in quick little tugs as the blade yanked a hair out rather than cutting it. And after all that, I had to go back and use it again right away because it left huge conspicuous hairs untouched after the first use.  All in all it took about 5 minutes, whereas I would expect such a procedure to take MAYBE 30-45 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade this replaced was one of 5 uses for a similarly cheap groomer, and it worked infinitely better. I&#x27;m going to have to look and see if they still make that model and replace this junker.</li>
            <li> My last one finally died on me.  Wouldnt work anymore.  So I was looking for an replacement.  Saw this with some reviews and ended up buying it.  Shipping was a hassle.  Especially dealing with USPS.  Had to go pick it up instead of it being delivered to me.  But other than that.  Popped a AA battery in it and used it to see how well it works.  It works pretty good.  Now my nose is hairless.  I would recommend it for nose hair.</li>
            <li> It has been working great. It does not pull my nose hairs, but the machine is not super strong so I can see it pulling your nose hairs if they are very long. I tend to use it frequently, so I have never had the pulling problem that other people have mentioned. The narrow shape allows it to reach the caverns at the tip of my nose. It has been working well for several months. I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.  It is probably the best 18 bucks I have ever spent.  It works well for personal grooming, with no pulling or cutting of skin.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few other trimmers and this one has been BY FAR the best. It cuts great and easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> Not the best I have used...BUT does a pretty darn good job.  Way better than many out there...that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
            <li> I have used&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Older Panasonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great Sharper Image model from 10 years ago&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is efficient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It trims 95% of the hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smaller than the Sharer Image which is #2 in my book&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the rinse mode&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this $18 last two years I am happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have great confidence in Panasonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even higher for their personal care&lt;br /&gt;Why? Quality, longevity, and great value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a tough review</li>
            <li> This one works.  So far the only brand I have found that works is Panasonic.  Some have cost me more, but no other is as effective and pain less.</li>
            <li> The best products don&#x27;t require a lot of description.  This trimmer removes hair from places where you don&#x27;t want it.  It&#x27;s small, quiet, and works painlessly.  It&#x27;s not rechargeable, but runs on a single AA battery which you won&#x27;t have to change too frequently.</li>
            <li> This ergonomic model performed well on nose and ear hair (not so great for eyebrow trimming &amp; sculpting) for the first 5 months - before it jammed. Not worth the hassle for return under warranty, I removed the trimming head and tried to free up the blade, to no avail. Later, I ordered Andis Cool Care Plus for Clipper Blades and that did the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Running the trimmer head under the faucet may not be enough for maintenance; consider keeping a can of Cool Care (B000LNB8HK) on hand to clean, lubricate and disinfect your clippers; it comes in a big 15.5 oz. can that will probably last for years.</li>
            <li> This does a great job. Panasonic makes good stuff. I am glad I bought it. Keeps me kempt. Yeah buddy.</li>
            <li> Not as good as I had hoped from the previous reviews. Easy enough to use but you really have to work it to get at everything and then not all are removed.</li>
            <li> This fit my needs and I am happy with purchasing this item. There nothing fancy or unusual about this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great grooming appliance because it works well, is safe, easy to clean, and designed well.  I bought several to give as gifts because some people in my family really needed it and did not find them in stores they frequent.</li>
            <li> Replacement for an old one, this works great. It is better to blow your nose before you use it.</li>
            <li> This battery powered unit works very well, but it is a bit louder than the other Wahl unit I had with the crappy rechargable battery. I like that this one takes standard AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Seems like a quality unit, and is easy to take apart and clean.&lt;br /&gt;Good choice.</li>
            <li> Works well and as expected.  What else can I say.  It&#x27;s light, no sharp edges, and works. Also a great price.</li>
            <li> This is the best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned. It doesn&#x27;t pinch the inside of my nose like my old trimmers. It also cuts the hair very low. It&#x27;s easy to clean and it doesn&#x27;t eat through batteries like my old trimmers.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a cheap $5-6 off-brand version of one of these trimmers a few years ago. It was horrible. I felt like it was pulling out my hair rather than clipping it. It always seeming like it&#x27;s batteries were running low even if they were brand new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When looking for something better I saw this and thought, &amp;#34;could it really be any better then my previous crappy version. I mean it&#x27;s not like there is a lot of technology going into these things. How different could they be.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer: Very different. Because it works, it&#x27;s easy, it&#x27;s portable and washable. Pay the extra cash and get this one. It does a great job and really doesn&#x27;t cost much more than the off-brands.</li>
            <li> I was scared at first to shove any object up my nose that has razors spinning fast. As I have gotten older I notice I am growing hair in place that shouldn&#x27;t and am losing hair in place I should have hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After sticking this trimmer up my nose I was in awe. It did magic to my nose. I no longer have long hair hanging out of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product. Highly</li>
            <li> Works well.  Was afraid it might be &amp;#34;grabby&amp;#34; but no issues.  Does have a bit of a funny chemical smell, maybe the lubricant in the motor?</li>
            <li> Decent product for the price. Cleaned up those pesky nose hairs real nice. I had a cheap trimmer from some grooming kit I got at a drug store and it was crap. I thought it was ok, until I got this, never buy a man a tool that uses a AAA battery. AA minimal.</li>
            <li> Ordered for boyfriend, he loved this product.</li>
            <li> I owned the high end Sharper Image to the cheapo no name brands and I actually own several differnet panasonic models over the last 10+ years, this one is up there with being the best, these will last you a couple of years(2)  depending on use, after that be prepared to buy a new one, they dull out and start pulling which can be extremely painful, but 15 bucks every other year is a small price to pay to not have to creep out folks and digust them with nose or ear hair dangling!</li>
            <li> This is a useful and cheap tool that gets the job done. Very quick and painless and came in the mail in a couple daus</li>
            <li> Ok I hate the fact that to own this I am admitting that I&#x27;m getting old. It works better then my old one but it still feels like it needs more power to do a better job. It is pretty easy to take apart and clean it well.</li>
            <li> My fiancé asked for a nose trimme for Christmas. I had no idea what he would like so I tried this just to see. He won&#x27;t me me watch him use it(lol) but he says it works great</li>
            <li> No discomfort from nicking or hair pulling on your nose or ears.Takes up minimum space  in bathroom,  bedroom,or a travel kit.</li>
            <li> This is a great nose hair trimmer. It is built well.  You can clean the blades very easily with water as it has a dial you can turn when you need to clean it.  Operates on  one AA battery.</li>
            <li> Bought for father, works well.</li>
            <li> This works great for its intended purpose.  It cuts well, doesn&#x27;t Knicks the skin and is surprisingly quiet!  Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job and is a sturdier, more durable product than I&#x27;ve previously used. Good buy and most recommendable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just kidding. But really, they save him from saying a lot of &amp;#34;Ow&amp;#34;s while plucking. Eesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew there was a better way for him to stay &amp;#34;manscaped&amp;#34; and leave sharp twinges of pain out of it. This is washable, doesn&#x27;t tug or pull (good because that&#x27;s what nobody wants) and you&#x27;re done in a flash.</li>
            <li> Wish it was wired, not battery operated, but works good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a few of these in the past.  My last one cracked on the cutting head and had to be replaced.  This one seems to run faster/quieter than previous ones.  Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price of it.</li>
            <li> I have had two of these now and they both have broken after one use, I would recommend not purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a couple of months of light use. Trying to figure out how to get money back. Panasonic website is terrible. Don&#x27;t buy panasonic!</li>
            <li> We bought 4 (3 sons + dad). We are now noses clean per the Queen&#x27;s request.</li>
            <li> after 5 months this stopped working, my husband barely used it at all. covered by warrantee but not worth the shipping price to send to panasonic.</li>
            <li> Works very well...great deal on this.</li>
            <li> I wish it trimmed a little bit closer on the nose hair, but all in all, its fine.</li>
            <li> Works great. Now I don&#x27;t have to hear my wife say &amp;#34;OMG... you have a forest growing from your nostrils&amp;#34;. This baby deforests very well ;-)</li>
            <li> Works pretty good but I have to lightly bang it to get it to start even with a new battery.</li>
            <li> The person I gave it to says it holds up. Who can complain about that? This came highly recommended. Thanks!</li>
            <li> II brought it for my beard, and I love it,I use it for my eyebrows, ears, and nose.I recommend this to every guy out there!!!!</li>
            <li> This was a a fantastic item until it stopped working totally.  Lasted 4 months and now won&#x27;t work at all.  I can&#x27;t recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised.  Not much discomfort to use in nose. .</li>
            <li> The item is good and reliable as advertised. One of the best product.</li>
            <li> Pro:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Its cheap and did the job.&lt;br /&gt;- Two years warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is two design flaws on this device that could potentially causes the device to stop working.&lt;br /&gt;- There is a tiny hole on the device that may allow water enters the device when you washing it.&lt;br /&gt;- avoid using a flat negative end battery, the middle one that shown in the picture below&lt;br /&gt;http://ekatibah.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/image_1.jpg</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer! I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks now, and used it on nose, ear, and eyebrows. I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent trimmer for a long time at a reasonable price and I finally found this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels heavier and sturdier than previous trimmers I owned, and it operates that way too. Easy to handle, good ergonomic design, and easy to clean. Doesn&#x27;t rip hairs, but truly cuts, and easy without discomfort. For the price, this is the best I&#x27;ve had so far. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> As good as I could reasonably want a nose hair trimmer to be. I would definitely buy again AND I can think of countless times that I could suggest these to others in need of nose hair trimming.</li>
            <li> Just bought it recently, and it works like a charm. Good for the price!</li>
            <li> Only used it a few times and its almost dead</li>
            <li> Very functional. My husband loves it even thought it&#x27;s very loud</li>
            <li> Male ear and nose hair you have met your match....now if only they would use them on a regular basis!</li>
            <li> Seems to work just fine to me.  Feels a little flimsy at first but does the job without problem.</li>
            <li> Good product and excellent supplier</li>
            <li> Nothing great it&#x27;s as good or bad as others I have purchased,&lt;br /&gt;Must be that type of item.</li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB INTENDED, NO PROBLEMS SO FAR.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well. I liked their older ones better, but this is ok. It&#x27;s tons better than the super-duper fancy one I had that sounded like a 747 taking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of them are a shadow of what they once were, thanks to lawyers. Grrr. Shakespeare was right.</li>
            <li> I should have purchased this in the store instead of online. It worked for a month then it died.</li>
            <li> This unit does a great job for the intended purpose.</li>
            <li> It works well at trimming nose hair!</li>
            <li> Works perfectly.  Of course batteries not included.  Great value for the price.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny! This trimmer works longer than others I&#x27;ve tried, and does a much better job.</li>
            <li> This is one of my must have items. Handy to use and easy to keep and maintain.</li>
            <li> This bugger is fast, cuts clean with no pulling.  It&#x27;s quiet too, especially given the speed of the cutter. Washes up easily. Gets rid of the &amp;#34;old man look&amp;#34; of hair coming out of ears and nostrils.</li>
            <li> Works as good as i need it to. I have used this quite a bit since purchase. Removes the hairs quite well with no pain what so ever.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve ever used a nose hair trimmer and was worried that it would hurt by pulling/pinching hairs. There is no paint at all. I always used small trimming scissors but for 12 bucks to time savings is immense. It takes a few seconds to clean everything up and you don&#x27;t feel anything you just hear a nose when it makes a cut. Great value and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Fantastic Nose trimmer would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Decent value for price. I&#x27;d buy again. Great design.</li>
            <li> Does the job and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> works well,  easy to clean.  delivered quickly</li>
            <li> Good tool,but then I&#x27;m not picky!</li>
            <li> This has been a great tool for keeping the hairs trimmed and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> seems to have common traits as other panasonic nose hair trimmer. couple months after purchase found battery not making a good connection</li>
            <li> It was just what I needed.</li>
            <li> I would have given this product 5 stars as it trims well and lasts long on the batteries.  The problem I have is the product durability.  I have purchased 2 of them in the past 6 months.  The first one just stopped working after about 2 months of infrequent use (1 – 2 min every other week).  I took the head/top off (that contains the blade) and turned it on.  The shaft inside the base unit that spins the blade was spinning fine (quiet and fast). When the top was put back on it would not spin.  It seemed as though it was seized up or caught on something.  I cleaned and dried the head unit and still nothing.  I ended up getting it to “work” by bending the blade guards up a little allowing the blade to spin but it made an awful noise and got hot after &amp;#60;30 sec of use.  I used it like that for a few weeks (although it was a little unnerving as it sounded like I was shoving a mini wood-chipper up my nose and in my ears).  I decided that I would buy another and baby it a little (maybe I was too rough on the last one?).  The next one came and it worked great.  I would rinse it in water as described in the manual after each use and allowed to dry.  After a month, this one seemed to get louder during operation.  I opened the top to see if there was some hair/buildup inside.  When I opened it, a tiny spring (think of the spring in a retractable pen only shorter) flew out and before I could shut off the water it went down the drain.  I didn’t see any spring in the first trimmer I owned so I’m not sure if this is a design change or I just lost the other one without even knowing it.  Either way,  two trimmers down.  I am a glutton for punishment so I am considering purchasing a third on and placing it in a foam lined case and operating it only while wearing white gloves and the drain stopped up.</li>
            <li> Works great. Keep a fresh battery on hand.</li>
            <li> It gets the job done with very little drama. It does not cut too close to the skin which works great for me as I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and does the job.  But it is clearly very cheaply made and feels like it will last maybe a few months at best.  Time will tell.  If I&#x27;m still using this after a year, I&#x27;ll write again and up my rating.  It&#x27;s just amazing how hard it is to find quality, well-built products these days.  We live in a disposable world.</li>
            <li> Excellent little trimmer. If you need a small trimmer for hair in unwanted places, this would be an excellent choice.</li>
            <li> Love this grooming tool</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting on in years and hair is growing in new places, this is the thing to have to keep myself well-groomed and looking like a responsible adult.</li>
            <li> GREAT UNIT. WORKS AS INTENDED WITH NO COMPLICATIONS. USED FOR NOSE AND EAR</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because of the great reviews and for the price.  I wasn&#x27;t in the market for the all in one grooming kits.  I bought this specifically for trimming nose hairs.  I bought this with the idea of having a quick and fast way of trimming my nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first initial reaction when I had unboxed this, was this thing was light and felt cheap.  The plastic body feels like it&#x27;s made of cheap china plastic that would break or crack on your first accidental drop on a hard floor.  The light weight does make it a plus if you need to spend a considerable amount of time trimming so your hand or arm doesn&#x27;t get tired.  Taking it apart and putting it back together is very simple with a twist and lock/unlock system.  The concept to remove or install the head of the trimmer or the battery compartment is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to point out that the picture displaying the vortex cleaning system is a stream of water coming into the tip and exiting the side hole.  In all reality the trimmer is submerged a stream of water coming out of the faucet.  It&#x27;s almost next to impossible to get a good steady stream of water to flush it out as it is depicted.  I just turned on my faucet and stuck it underneath until I saw water coming out of the side port for a few seconds to clean it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are worried about water affecting the unit, water didn&#x27;t manage to find a way into the unit while I was cleaning it.  I would be worried about it&#x27;s water resistant properties as time goes by and parts wear down.  Even though it advertises on their internet site for use in the shower, I wouldn&#x27;t try  it simply because a product at the price they sell it for usually isn&#x27;t built to last.  Also, electronics + water is usually bad.  In case it doesn&#x27;t last, the product is backed by a two year warranty which is pretty impressive than what most manufactures offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to say that it lacked a little bit in it&#x27;s performance.  This is my first time using a product like this, so I&#x27;m not sure if the sound of it catching a random thick hair and cutting it caught me off guard and startled me or if it caught a hair and had slight trouble cutting it.  With the exception of those few moments, it cut well.  I did have a problem where I had to move it around a lot and in a lot of different angles to get the hairs I felt like the unit missed.  I would attribute my difficulty to getting all the hairs to the size of my nostrils compared to most.  It did feel fairly comfortable in my hand while I was using it.  I only used the product once and haven&#x27;t used it again.  I prefer using my specialized scissors I can use to manually trim hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though this product isn&#x27;t really for me, the combination of the warranty, the ability of using it with water / getting it wet, performance, and for the price, I would say this is a good buy for anyone who needs to trim some hair in their nose or ear without sticking sharp objects in it.  It also works for people on the go or someone who doesn&#x27;t have access to a mirror.using a product like this, so I&#x27;m not sure if the sound of it catching a random thick hair and cutting it caught me off guard and startled me or if it caught a hair and had slight trouble cutting it.

            <li> Does a good job trimming nose hairs. Easy enough to clean in spite of the rather verbose instruction sheet.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband to use and at first I think he was a little miffed at me (because I was obviously telling him that he needed one).  Once he got over his initial embarrassment and tried the trimmer, he couldn&#x27;t stop raving about it!  He tells all his friends now too.  That is actually a little embarrassing if you ask me!  But it obviously shows how much he likes the trimmer.  He says that it cuts well and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs out; that the sensation is a little ticklish, but not painful at all.</li>
            <li> Its a lot smaller than the picture looks, which is a good thing because the picture makes this thing look huge!  But its actually quite compact and get the job done!  Powerful, efficient, and simple to use.</li>
            <li> Worked nicely and didn&#x27;t pinch.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
            <li> excellent product - my husband loved it !</li>
            <li> Works good. My only concern is it feels  pretty lightweight and cheap so I am hoping it doesn&#x27;t break quickly but so far haven&#x27;t had an issue. I admit that I don&#x27;t use it overly often its just to trim up some nose hairs when they get annoying.</li>
            <li> stopped working after 4 months</li>
            <li> Quick and easy to use and clean. And the best part it doesn&#x27;t rip out your nose hairs it cuts them.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer that&#x27;s easy to use and does what it&#x27;s supposed to. Being easy to clean is also a big plus. :)</li>
            <li> This product was for my husband &amp; it worked great on his nose/ears. I like that it uses a single AA battery so we don&#x27;t have another charger to keep up with.</li>
            <li> A good nose hair trimmer and not expensive at all would readily recommend this item to my friends and others.</li>
            <li> well this is a good trimmer for the first couple of weeks. but after you remove the head to wash and clean it it doesn&#x27;t fit back in. I am hearing unusual noises after I did this and I can&#x27;t make it fit again. the quality of trimming has also been deteriorated since I removed the head for cleaning.</li>
            <li> This trimmer just works. It gets all the hairs. I much prefer this style of trimmer to some of the others on the market.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this trimmer at this point.  It does a good job with no pulling and is pretty good on battery life.</li>
            <li> Grooming hairs on your face you don&#x27;t want visible. Sounds like a slam dunk, what can be so hard? I can&#x27;t believe there is so much out there that doesn&#x27;t work. This does. Nearly perfect, it does clip hairs but can pull them if you go to fast. Go slow and it works better. Nose and ears are neatly trimmed.</li>
            <li> This shaver worked fine for a while until the other day... After I used it I cleaned it off under running water.  Then I shook it to dry it out and the head came flying off.  Parts flew everywhere and when I put it back together it started making a loud buzzing noise when I turned it on and when I tried using it, it started pulling at hairs instead of making clean cuts like it did before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it did work great prior to this incident, I cannot give it a good rating given that Panasonic doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any kind of replacement parts for the blades.  Of course at only $12 I could just get another one, it&#x27;d just be nice to be able to buy replacement blades/etc if needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer my Groom Mate Platinum XL Nose &amp; Ear Hair Trimmer to the Panasonic now given that I think it&#x27;s more durable and just works.  Plus the Groom Mate is tiny and perfect for travel!</li>
            <li> What can I say. It does the job on nose and ears completely painlessly. With good AA batteries, it sounds and feels like it&#x27;s moving very fast and efficiently. Not overly noisy for ear use. You can clearly hear when it encounters hairs. You can also do a quick, simple mustache touch up with it.</li>
            <li> My big sharper image trimmer finally died, so I did some quick review searching. Seems this trimmer is thought of highly, and after receiving mine, I agree with the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s much smaller and lighter than my previous trimmer. I have no complaints. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I look cleaner, better! She may keep me now! I&#x27;m officially a metrosexual! Now I do my beard, my brows, my ear hair! It&#x27;s great and she loves me!! Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I just got this a couple of days ago, and have tried/used it twice, and I must say I am satisfied.  This trimmer is comfortable, quiet, and does an adequate job.&lt;br /&gt;It didn&#x27;t heatup too much either.  It cleans out easily with a shot of water, and has a tip cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For nose hair it is great - cuts close and doesn&#x27;t pull.&lt;br /&gt;For ear hair it is good - cuts fairly close and doesn&#x27;t pull.&lt;br /&gt;For facial hair it&#x27;s soso - cuts ok and it&#x27;s a slight task to contour and shape, few minor pulls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All around good trimmer that I would buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good job P&#x27;sonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4*</li>
            <li> For such a small unit, this trimmer packs a real punch.  Nose hairs are pretty coarse yet this trimmer cuts through them like the are nothing.  I have added twenty seconds to my morning routine a couple of times a week and am pleased I did.</li>
            <li> It works well and is indeed waterproof and easy to clean unlike a previous model I had years ago.  Good deal.</li>
            <li> Does as it is advertised, we are very satisfied with this total purchase. Price was very reasonable too. I would reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple: It trims hair. It trims hair well. I have always swore by this trimmer and only had to buy a new one because I left it at a hotel while traveling. If I bought it twice, you definitely should buy it once.</li>
            <li> Sometimes there are features you don&#x27;t think you need then you experience them.  The water cleaning system in this is fantastic and works exactly as it should.  Makes me feel better to know it&#x27;s clean.</li>
            <li> I wanted a nose trimmer that I could rinse with water to clean, based on the review I purchased this Panasonic. I used it twice over a month period and the third time I went to use it was dead. A new battery did nothing. I returned to Panasonic and was given a new one fairly quickly, disappointed that I had to pay the return shipping.. I used the replacement ONCE and the same issue. It was cleaned following Panasonic&#x27;s instructions (how hard can it be?)&lt;br /&gt;Save your money!</li>
            <li> This is my third one I purchased and by far this one is the one I am most comfortable with because of its simple ergonomics. Cleaning is a bit tricky and hard to get used to, but the locking mechanism confirms a secure fit.</li>
            <li> This item was very well priced and worked extremely well.  My husband loved it.  I would definetly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li> Very nice design. Works as described. Nice feature to be able to clean under running water. No pulling of nose hairs. Great value.</li>
            <li> Work great..  then it fell off the counter onto its cutter and started making a horible sound..  panisonic says replacment cutters and shields available, but they are not sold ANYWHERE .. i look .. on panasonic website, google, ebay, amazon of course...  they just are not available..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I replaced it with the previos model save a dollar or two and it works every bit as good from what i can tell</li>
            <li> My husband loved this and I do NOT miss his nose hairs! He said it was easy and painless. If your guy could use some manscaping, I would recommend this!</li>
            <li> Broke the third week, very unhappy.</li>
            <li> Solid feel. While using it to clean my nose hairs, it initially felt as if to not be strong enough but when I got done and looked into my nostrils, they were both quite clean. Frankly, I don&#x27;t know the first thing about how strong nor how effective something like this is supposed to be, but this unit appears to do exactly what it is designed to do - clear the hairs from your nostrils.</li>
            <li> Great price and easy to clean. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Bought this after my previous Panasonic trimmer finally bit the dust.  Was delighted that this is stronger, faster, mad more versatile since I can even trim the beard  growing out of the deep dimple in my chin.  Easier to clean  and the price is the same!</li>
            <li> Had this baby for almost 2 years, I love it. I can clean up my facial hair and nose hair for the price its a no brainer.</li>
            <li> works great...i lost mine the second day i had it...will buy another.......dont use scissors..!!</li>
            <li> It is easy to operate, but not easy to cut long hairs. I would like to have a more efficient one.</li>
            <li> It needs more power!!!!! Not bad !!! Truly just not enough</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift &amp; it&#x27;s much more solid than the current 1 my friend is using.  Seem to work really well too!</li>
            <li> good....but could of gotten it at FRY&#x27;s for less.....</li>
            <li> Had a different trimmer but did not like it at all.  Gave this one a shot and it works great, would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Good service. Great product my husband says.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works well.  I&#x27;ve had it a few weeks &amp; so far it works as advertised.  I like the fact it has a way to run soap &amp; water through the blades without disassembly.  Hopefully this will not only keep it sanitary but also keep it running smoothly.</li>
            <li> Works well and cleaning is a breeze, is the best part about it. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I wish I bought this years ago.</li>
            <li> This thing is GREAT.  I hate unsightly &amp;#34;old man&amp;#34; hairs sticking out.  This totally solved the problem for 13 bucks! Go Panasonic.</li>
            <li> I have had several cheaper models and was not really happy with them. This one has the power and better quality feel to it.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this to anyone in need of a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I use weekly.  No issues or problems after several months of use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product last February and it did a good job of trimming both nose hairs and facial hair but it died after about a half-dozen uses. I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This works really well, trims nose hairs with very little discomfort, is comfortable to hold, not too noisy, with a low price also.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer! Great for women! Works well on the lip, nose hairs or for those little eyebrow hairs that you need to wax.  Great product and highly recommend.  Would buy again!</li>
            <li> Seems like a strange thing to write a review for, but one thing i wished i&#x27;d known before i bought it - these things tickle like crazy!</li>
            <li> Just what I needed for my husband</li>
            <li> Have had several battery operated trimmers over the years and none can come close to comparing with this one. Batteries last forever, easy to clean and super easy to use. Small and quiet also. Wish my Panasonic shavers worked as well as this little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Useful and works as specified.  Haven&#x27;t had problems with it.  It does take battery AA.</li>
            <li> I used this product less than 10 times and unfortunately it began to fall apart. When I washed it for the first time, the spinning blade part fell out into the sink. The part is about 5mm in diameter and was not secured properly onto the device. Now I have a vibrator that doesn&#x27;t trim the hair next to my taint. I wish it could return the product or replace the part.</li>
            <li> Great product. Snips away at nose hair cleanly, comfortably and quickly. Glad I choose it. Can&#x27;t beat the price. Far superior to the old school trimmer that it replaced.</li>
            <li> Well thought out, well made, does the job well. Seems to lack a little power so it&#x27;s slow, and takes time to trim.</li>
            <li> Very silent operation, cuts the hair with ease,  it is washable under the tap so cleaning is not a problem.</li>
            <li> ...but it walways poorly built. This baby is extremely well made and works beautifully. Super handy to carry when travelling and ability to be rinsed under a tap is great to kep it clean and in tip top shape.</li>
            <li> It does its job pretty good. It can snag a hair no and then. Kind of a pain to clean each time you use it, but over all a good unit that I have used regularly for over a year without any problems.</li>
            <li> As you age, you use your brain more which causes the hair on your head to be pushed out of your ears and nose.  This trimmer will help with this phenomenon.</li>
            <li> Great product. Very happy with the length of my nose hair!</li>
            <li> its the first time i have bought something like this.  it works and is easy to use. i&#x27;m not exactly sure i enjoy using it.  it gets the job done.  i think i may try using wax as a comparison.</li>
            <li> Quiet, painless, long battery life, easy to clean.  This one is way better than the Braun unit I threw out.</li>
            <li> Hubby says that it is easy to hold and easy to use.  Razor gets into all the &#x27;nooks and crannies&#x27;... very nice trimmer.</li>
            <li> If you would have asked me what I thought of this trimmer a month ago, it would&#x27;ve been the best I&#x27;ve ever used.  Then I went to use it yesterday and it won&#x27;t turn on  Tried multiple batteries.  It&#x27;s just dead.  It had a weird battery drain problem that I didn&#x27;t think much of the last time I used it - had brand new battery in it when I got it, but then it needed replacing after only a few uses.  Now it&#x27;s dead.  Not even worth the hassle and money to check the warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 03/05/2014:&lt;br /&gt;Changing to 3 stars because Panasonic&#x27;s Warranty Service was quick and easy.  It was a hassle, being without a trimmer for a little while, then having to buy a new trimmer (different brand this time) and paying to ship it out.  But I decided that for the $3 postage it&#x27;d cost me that I&#x27;d try it.  They sent me a brand new one in about 2-3 weeks, so now I at least have a backup.  And I really did like this up until it completely stopped working a few months into its life.  So there&#x27;s that at least.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Wish I had known about this long ago. I&#x27;ve tried others similar, but none match up to this one. The tip does get a little warm, but that&#x27;s the only negative I&#x27;ve found.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used many ear and nose trimmers, THIS IS NUMBER 1 AT THE MOMENT!!! Go buy it, you will love it!</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle, easy to clean, trims my nose, ears, eyebrows, very cleanly, painlessly, and efficiently.  In other words it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It was finally time to upgrade my grooming tools and I went with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s actually great.... much more effective than the old clunker I had... it keeps isht clean/trimmed longer and has a neat way of cleaning it (read the instructions!). I mostly use it for nose and some fine hairs on the sides of my ears... eyebrows is a little trickier but you can do a little work with it...I&#x27;m still figuring that out. I&#x27;m happy with the nose function alone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price, I&#x27;m tempted to order another one for home/travel!</li>
            <li> This little gadget does the trick.  Much better than the Remington model.  Just don&#x27;t drop it, they&#x27;re a little sensitive.</li>
            <li> Go ahead.  Break down and get one.  You know you have little hairs growing out of your nose, and it&#x27;s gross.  Ears, nose...whatever.  This does a great job and it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
            <li> I have owned a couple of different trimmers and this one has some great added features. I love that you can put it under the faucet and clean it out. Also, the strength of the buzzer is great and doesn&#x27;t leave anything behind.</li>
            <li> It works okay. I expected more for the price. I found a better one at Target, but my husband wanted this one.. we both wish we would have stuck with the different brand.</li>
            <li> My husband received for Christmas from me and was trying to use the product today - does not work - I am sending it back for a refund.</li>
            <li> Really a good product much better than my previous facial hair trimmer! Doesn&#x27;t pull hair and can trim hair very closely</li>
            <li> Hairy ears and nose is not a problem with this machine.  I trim the long eyebrow hair and it works perfect.  This trimmer is the best. I call it Dirty Hairy because it blows away the unwanted hair. Perfect, No it&#x27;s man made but it is close to being perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Easy cleaning the head in water it&#x27;s cool to see it pump the pieces of cut hair into the pool of water in the bottom of the sink.&lt;br /&gt;I give it 12 stars. The price is right so there ya go.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmed and Proper.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0049LUI9O/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title</li>
            <li> This trimmer is about a thousand times better than the one I was using. The head is perfectly shaped for use in the nose or ears, it&#x27;s pain free, very quiet, and easy to clean. In short, it&#x27;s everything you could want and everything you would need. I&#x27;ve used it for a long time now and never had to replace the battery and if I ever lost it, I would buy another one.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it works great! I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and There&#x27;s been no problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this trimmer for several weeks now and it works great. I&#x27;ve used it to trim my nose hairs mostly, but I&#x27;ve also trimmed some small hairs that were starting to grow out of my ear canal. It doesn&#x27;t tickle the inside of your nose as much as other cheaper trimmers do, which I like. My last trimmer was one of those cheap Avon/Sharper Image ones and this one works much better and costs the same amount. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
            <li> well, worked as it shd, comfortable using it as comparable to those that i used/owned in the past. highly recommended</li>
            <li> You can clean this bad boy under running water.&lt;br /&gt;I like the tilted handle. Takes care the nose, ear and eyebrow area.</li>
            <li> Yup, cuts my nose hair with not too many passes. No pain. Cleans easy. Quiet. We&#x27;ll have to see how long it survives.</li>
            <li> Why dont they make these electric?&lt;br /&gt;I not a big fan of the battery not enough power.i mean i dont have foorest growing out of my nose but more power would be nice chop it down quicker.&lt;br /&gt;Plus everytime i groom its in my restroom not while drving.&lt;br /&gt;I ve been thru a number of battery trimmer troughout the years and they all seem to last five groomings.&lt;br /&gt;This one has outlasted all of them so far.so ill stay optimistic and say its the best trimmer ive owned so far.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> It tickles but it does well. Just don&#x27;t mash it into your nostril because that hurts. Now I don&#x27;t have hair coming out of my nose like an old dude.</li>
            <li> This simple tool has changed my life, freeing me from the embarrassment of exposed nasal hair.  Other devices have been less effective and reliable, and some have pulled rather than cut nose hair in a gruesome fashion.  This tool is the hight of nose hair control technology.</li>
            <li> So far so good, I would definitely recommend this if you just want a simple no nonsense machine.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s easy to figure out and easy to operate.  Just take it out of the package and literally go. Oh,&lt;br /&gt;make sure you have a AA battery..it&#x27;s NOT included.  First time I used it, it worked wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I thought when I bought it in a portable, easy to use, low cost and durable and that&#x27;s what I got. The only weaknesses are that it is not rechargeable and the shaver overheats.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it arrived damaged or not, but the inner blade rubs on the outer blade quite a bit thus slowing it down and making kind of a racket.</li>
            <li> I have owned several trimmers. This one worked the best of any. Will see if it holds up over time</li>
            <li> this product is good amazon &amp; shipping was prompt.&lt;br /&gt;However have to say that the packaging of the product (not amazon) is worst.&lt;br /&gt;If you are&#x27;nt careful Im sure u will hurt your fingers</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I had so far. Works great and easy to clean. Does not pull hair. Like the tilted design.</li>
            <li> I bought the panasonic one after putting up with a horrendous sunbeam trimmer for years that I got from a discount store. I should have upgraded sooner. Generally speaking, the panasonic trimmer simply does its job, and it only &amp;#34;yanked&amp;#34; on me once out of maybe 20 times that I&#x27;ve used it (pretty good if you ask me). I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Been using this trimmer since 15 December 2012, and it&#x27;s performance is awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little machine does its job well and quietly, albeit there is minimal buzzing noise, which is generally acceptable. First time trying out a nose trimmer, and surprisingly there wasn&#x27;t any slightest level of discomfort. Trimming nose hair is pretty quick. Took me less than 2 minutes each trimming session. This trimmer is also very easy to operate and disassemble to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may even use it to trim hair at other parts of your body, for instance, eyebrows, bread, sideburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall would be the trimmed nose hair would be left inside the nose. This is just a minor issue, which apparently Panasonic designed the &#x27;Panasonic ER430K&#x27; with a vacuum system to address it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will monitor it&#x27;s durability and update this review in future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a product that will satisfy your trimming needs. Excellent trimmer!&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;After a year of infrequent usage (once every 2 weeks or so), the trimmer fails to work well and it tugs on your nose hair. Really uncomfortable. From what I read in the comments, this is due to the malfunctioning springs inside the little blade. The damaged springs could be a result of my OCD habit of disassembling the trimmer into its components for thoroughly cleaning. It is weird that Panasonic doesn&#x27;t sell replacement blades. Perhaps they would prefer to make a larger profit by sell entirely new units instead of replacement blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue is, the seal at the battery compartment is not up to standard. I did not soak the trimmer in water, cleaned the trimmer as instructed, and yet water managed to seep inside the battery compartment. Now there is a faint weird smell permeating from the trimmer whenever I change the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product at all, unless Panasonic comes up with replacement blades and improves on the seal.</li>
            <li> The trimmer I just ordered had a battery with an expiration date of 2009.  Since the lifespan of the battery is about 5 - 7 years, the trimmer was probably made between 2002 - 2004.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even though it&#x27;s an old one, it still works great. Very gentle while cutting the nose hairs close to the skin.  Definitely five stars.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my fiance&#x27; for a christmas stocking stuffer. He said it was not the best but it got the job done in a easy fashion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s that simple, it just works. I have thick hair, EVERYWHERE, but thanks to this I can cut back on some of that hair. Breeze to clean, no pulling, great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had two Panasonic&#x27;s and a Whal. The Panasonics are far better IMO doing a nice job. All of these trimmer will require you to go back to clean up loose ends...</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s a... trimmer, right? It just gets the job done, have nothing bad to say about it. No wires, waterproof, small, hence transportable, runs on 1 AA battery. There&#x27;s nothing wrong about this product, if you need it get it.</li>
            <li> Way to go Panasonic.  Ouchless hair removal.  While I don&#x27;t look like the hairy creature from Star-wars, I do find that as I age hair sprouts from ever new places.  The guys with none on top seem to have it worse.  Thanks Amazon for quick delivery.</li>
            <li> I was only able to use it twice before it quit working. I changed the battery but had no luck. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
            <li> Works as intended, long battery life, fairly quiet, great for male or female.  Gets rid of unwanted hair of any kind!</li>
            <li> This was a perfect stocking stuffer at Christmas. It does the trick without that annoying tickle. Gets rid of unwanted nose and facial hair that the hubby doesn&#x27;t want.</li>
            <li> It took me about 5 minutes to get the thing to even start, it worked for all of two seconds then seized.  It never worked again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible cheap device.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is by far the best one I have purchased, and I have been through a few. I like all the features listed in the description, so this should be the last one I have to purchase for a good while, I won&#x27;t buy another one until this one gives up which given it&#x27;s quality construction should be a a long time. Great on battery life also.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life?  I can now talk to people without wondering if I have that one long disgusting nose hair sticking out. Cuts great, no pulls, easy to clean.  All of that in a wonderful price!</li>
            <li> Worked good at first. 2 months later it was real dull, heads needed replaced.  Not cost effective if that&#x27;s how long they last.</li>
            <li> what can i say... it trims the unwanted hairs and doesnt hurt a bit. its easly to clean and hasnt rusted.</li>
            <li> It works ok, but it does tend to rip out hair rather than cut it, which hurts.  Its just ok.</li>
            <li> I chose it because most reviews were positive, they were correct. It is powerful, it does what it is supposed to do and it is easy to clean after each use.&lt;br /&gt;Word Of Caution: be careful where you use; it is powerful like I stated already, so you may create some unintended damage. Follow the directions to the T and do not get inspired that it can be used everywhere.</li>
            <li> This is the only one I have ever purchased so I&#x27;m not sure it works better than any other.  I just know that it works well.  Does the job...</li>
            <li> I got the product, put new batteries and was very disappointed that it was running on a very low power as if it was going dead!</li>
            <li> it works and good price</li>
            <li> I was very uneasy about this product. read some reviews of other brands and they weren&#x27;t favorable. But this Panasonic is exceeding my expectations. It&#x27;s very powerful and the battery is holding up very well Would recommend it to anyone. Jim Sullivan</li>
            <li> much better than the cheap one I got locally, does a great job!</li>
            <li> It does what it is supposed to do.  Reasonable price, good utility.</li>
            <li> Love it ... not going to explain exactly why.</li>
            <li> Worked great for first use.  After cleaning and reassembly (in accordance with the user guide), the product clattered loudly and just never worked.</li>
            <li> My husband loved this item.</li>
            <li> DOES A GOOD JOB ON NOSE HAIR AND EARS</li>
            <li> Purchased this Panasonic as a gift and works good!</li>
            <li> Best Product. Quality, easy to wash. Nice work triming. Very very nice product.</li>
            <li> Great product too purchase or give as a gift, too someone in need of grooming.</li>
            <li> Great for women and men. Easy to use. does the job quickly</li>
            <li> The unit is very nice. It stopped working due to cheaply made battery compartment. stay away from!!</li>
            <li> Shapes sidelocks well and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> did not cut the hairs very well</li>
            <li> It is OK. Would have preferred an attachment (comb- guide) for trimming eye brows.</li>
            <li> Small, compact, and works as described!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean, lightweight, good quality</li>
            <li> Product arrived timely and in good shape. Very good quality. Would buy this maker&#x27;s items again. I haven&#x27;t had any problems with this trimmer. Very quiet and works quite nicely.</li>
            <li> Got wet one time and died.</li>
            <li> It has worked really well and hasn&#x27;t pulled any of the hairs out making my eyes water.... so that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> Somewhat disappointing.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to cut quickly and  you have to work at it to get the job done. I have used  a different brand that worked better. I thought this would be a step up  but instead it was a step down.</li>
            <li> Works great so far. I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have tried many nose hair trimmers before, and pushed this one off since it was so cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is the cheapest, and the best. It trims nose hairs very well, cleans well, and is easy and safe to use. It&#x27;s awesome.</li>
            <li> Cuts close and gets the hard to reach areas. Good battery life. Cleans easily. Best trimmer of this kind that I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
            <li> the best I&#x27;ve had, perfect clean cut easy, and cuts nicely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it once so far and it works as it&#x27;s supposed to. I like that I can clean it with water after use.</li>
            <li> Great Product, Just like the description.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend it to everyone. Thank you !!!</li>
            <li> Broke down after just 1 month, but worked great while it lasted.</li>
            <li> Works much much better than the other two brands I bought from Amazon</li>
            <li> Much better than a Conair brand I had a while back.  Works well and has a good weight to it.</li>
            <li> Great product, great service.</li>
            <li> It works but it leaves a metallic scent in your nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve now purchased four of these - they work great in the beginning but all have broken within 6-12 months.  For a while I just bought another one, figuring they&#x27;re inexpensive so why not?  But after the last one, I&#x27;m done with this product.  You get what you pay for, I guess.</li>
            <li> Good one. Comfortable to hold and removes hairs with ease.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and carry item for travel and home use.  No problem using one AA alkaline battery so far.  Easy to clean and maintain. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my boyfriend, easy to use and works great!!</li>
            <li> Mine also stopped working. It was fine for a few weeks. Then I cleaned it, which means I took the top off. After that it never worked properly again. First I thought it was the battery, but it&#x27;s the design. I am an engineer and this looks bad. Still worked somewhat, but after a while, I threw it in the trash. Almost worthless.</li>
            <li> To quote another reviewer because the same thing happened to me after several uses:  &amp;#34;After a few uses(about 8 or so) I heard this horrendous grinding noise and the tip got really hot and even quit working... At first I thought replacing the battery...still the same problem...  Long story short, the blades inside the head are spring controlled.... after a few uses the springs just bust out and pushes the blades harshly against the tip head..thus creating the grinding noise that makes the battery and motor wear out..on top of that it inhibits cutting abilities(I tried it 3 times... by now it just rips out hairs if it can catch any...otherwise it&#x27;s not really working at all).&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I just received this today and ordered it because my  nose hairs were getting wild and out of control! If you have a huge nose with big nostrils like I do you have to own one of these! I&#x27;ve had 3-4 in my lifetime the first was a no name cheap one from TJ Max which broke in 4 months. The next two were Phillips brand which looked fancy but also broke in 2-3 months. Then this guy just arrived today and has a good weight in the hand and cuts nose hairs  fairly well. My only complaint thus  far is that when in the nose if left own for longer than 30 seconds the metal tip with the blade in it begins to heat up and gives me a bit of a scared reaction. Other than that it tames my nose hairs well!</li>
            <li> Broke the second time I used it.Don&#x27;t buy it .And of course it was past the return policy timeline.&lt;br /&gt;Product made poorly.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had it too long, but so far so good.  Works as expected, takes 1 AA battery and is washable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use &amp; seems to work well &amp; painlessly. Have only just used it once so far on nose &amp; ears.</li>
            <li> This product works well for trimming the nose, ears and mustache! I use it daily and would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I doubt I will ever buy a non Panasonic personal product. Own the men&#x27;s razor, best I ever owned. This is so much better than my old name brand trimmer, no comparison.</li>
            <li> In general, I have been pleased with the price/performance balance of this trimmer.  With lite-moderate use (X2/month), it has preformed well -close cuts without pulling.  Batteries have been changed twice.  The shocker came at 6 months when, despite new batteries, the unit started to pull.  Pluck a nose hair guys and you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about.  So I went to buy a new blade.  The new trimmer itself sold for $12.50, a replacement blade cost $17 even on Amazon.  That is if you can even find one.  That makes it cheaper to buy a whole new unit every 6 months.  And that&#x27;s a waste I can&#x27;t live with so I am in the market for a different brand right now.  Count on an annual cost (unit/blades/batteries) of about $35-$40 /year.</li>
            <li> The hair was there, and now it&#x27;s gone. It cuts nicely and does not snag the hair. I&#x27;m glad this was my first nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband&#x27;s nose hair and he really likes it.  No pulling or plucking.  Only downside is he has to do it more often.</li>
            <li> I have had this for 2 years now and is great. It is a good product for the price. I recommend to a friends.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely because of the 1100+ reviews to replace my old trimmer which I never have been happy with. And boy am I glad I did! This trimmer can cut the hair really close to your skin without you being anxious about it cutting you. Simply because it feels like a high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: About one year out, and I will still uphold my original rating. It has started to vary a bit on the RPM, and it is not due to the battery. It may be the engine is just a bit too weak to take the increased resistance as time goes, but it still does the job sufficiently.</li>
            <li> very good for nose, ears. If you have a mustache watch out around the lips, can nick certain areas. very quiet too</li>
            <li> Even with a brand new battery, the trimmer lacks power and behaves as if it is about to run out of juice.</li>
            <li> I have had this product for months and have yet to change the battery. easy to clean. My only complaint is I have trouble with it getting *every* hair.</li>
            <li> This is supposed to be water-proof. I used it after shower and it has not given any troubles after one year. I would recommend it especially for travelers.</li>
            <li> I have been through several of these types of tremors, and I have to say unequivocally that these are the best tremors I&#x27;ve ever used. They really work. I am hard to please when it comes to this type of stuff, and I can say for sure, this seems to be number one.</li>
            <li> Wish I would have got one a lot sooner.  It works great and would recommend it.  Easy to get rid of unwanted nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect, convenient, easy and just as seller described. Does the trick efficiently and at the low price, it can&#x27;t be beat. I will be a returning customer.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for 7.5 months.  Then it quit.  It has a two year warranty, but you must pay shipping and insurance to mail it to Texas for repair and include sales receipt/proof of purchase.  So it,s probably not worth the time and effort.  I will just buy another brand.</li>
            <li> This works very well!.. You definitely have to be careful when trimming your nose hair that you don&#x27;t trim too short...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time using I went for it and was bleeding pretty bad from my nose and was extremely uncomfortable for a few days because of pressing the trimmer up against the inside of my nose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Read the directions.. They definitely say go gentle!! Whoops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you try to trim half way.. And don&#x27;t press the trimmer against the skin.. You will be ok.. The trimmer definitely works really well.. Just don&#x27;t get carried away when the trimmer starts tickling!.. It just makes you want to press harder! Resist the urge!</li>
            <li> MY HUSBAND SAID GOOD HAIR TRIMMER. HE IS SATISFIED IT.</li>
            <li> Bought this and within 6 months, the rotor seized up and would no longer run.  While running it was okay, but nothing to get excited about.  By contrast,about 2 years before, I picked something similar for less than half the price and it is still runningand doing it&#x27;s job.  A rare instance where you don&#x27;t get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> I have to agree with the others who gave this a poor rating. Worked well in the beginning then it just stopped working. Tried new batteries, still nothing. Never dropped it, always kept it clean. Cheap product in my opinion. I&#x27;m going back to using scissors to trim out the nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Works as intended. Simple and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but you do have to be careful. Of course, when you stick a rotating blade up your nostrils, you should be careful. In some youtube videos, you can see people poking around trying to get a better trim, but you can cut yourself.</li>
            <li> Works well and a great price.  There is no hair pulling as I had with other units.  It also works well in trimming all hair; nose, ears, mustache and beard.  Price is good which was comparable with the unit I had that hurt.  Cleaning is easy with the water flush through feature, and taking it apart to clean is fast and easy.  The only thing I don&#x27;t know is how long the batteries will last.</li>
            <li> Overly complicated design. Panasonic&#x27;s other, cheaper version is better.</li>
            <li> This does not work well at all.</li>
            <li> Seems to work well so far.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. Works great for trimming nose hairs and doing some trimming around eye brows, etc. I wanted something cheap that would work well and this is it. I don&#x27;t use it that often so I don&#x27;t know how well it lasts but it seems to be made pretty well so I think it should at least last a year, maybe more. I recommend it if you don&#x27;t need something a little more heavy duty.</li>
            <li> I bought the ER-GN30-K trimmer and used it twice before it failed to come on even after I changed the battery.  Assuming I had maybe done something wrong, I bought another one.  It failed the same way after only one use.  Even though I really liked the way both units trimmed when they worked, I cannot recommend this model trimmer because of the almost immediate failures of both units..</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned it for 6 months now as of this writing and I have zero complaints. Does exactly as it says. The batteries are still good and I use it around once every 2-3 weeks. I have never tried it wet however. Definitely would reccomend.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Cuts hair quickly without pinching you.  Nice compact unit that is easy to clean out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted and expected, and the product got to my house quickly.</li>
            <li> Good product. Works as advertised, painless, and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> My husband says this is the best trimmer he has ever used.  Did take a few uses to get the procedure right, it&#x27;s held a little different that his last trimmer</li>
            <li> Great great nose trimmer.  I&#x27;m older and as I age, hairs come out of the nose.  I find it distinctly distasteful to see that on otther people, so I like to keep my nasal passages &amp;#34;groomed.&amp;#34;  This unit does so comfortably and efficiently.  And just as important you won&#x27;t get cut.  You can get to all areas,  Prior to this I used a baby toe nail scissors and it works...sort of. There were always areas that were difficult to get to, and I had to contort my face to get into areas in my nose.  But nice to have an appliance that does the job really efficiently and well.</li>
            <li> Broke after only 1 use! Also looked like it had already been used before me...</li>
            <li> no problems noted good quality</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer. I got this about a week ago and have used it several times so far. I like how easy it is to use this product and everything about it is very straightforward.</li>
            <li> The reason for 3 stars is because it heats up a bit when used and it does not trim and shape my beard. It is ok as a nose trimmer.</li>
            <li> This works great as it is both fast and easy to maneuver. Very quiet and cleans easy by running water thru the cleaning port. It is better built than other nose hair removers that I have tried. The small size and curved body makes it easy to hold.</li>
            <li> It works, not as good as the other brand I used to use, but it does work better than many others that I have tried!.</li>
            <li> I replaced it&#x27;s predecessor which lasted for many years.  Gets the job done and takes up very little space</li>
            <li> I like how they made cleaning the trimmer easy. You can tell cleaning and ergonomics were a big focus in the engineering of this product. I have owned two other nose hair trimmers in my life and they were both terrible. This one I haven&#x27;t had for more than a week, but I already like it more than the other two piece-of-crap trimmers I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
            <li> I bought this item about 6 months ago, to replace a long-lived trimmer that finally died. It worked marginally well at best - tended to catch more than my prior trimmer, causing little bits of pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it failed me utterly recently, when the battery started leaking acid and the trimmer stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s either (a) faulty circuitry or (b) I finally got the alleged Wet-Dry trimmer - &amp;#34;use it in the shower&amp;#34; - a bit wet, and now the battery burst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I removed the battery, dried everything out with paper towels, air dried it for a few days, put a brand-new AA in, fired it up, and - boom - another battery leaking toxic fumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No go for me on this trimmer</li>
            <li> I bought this about 6 months ago and I&#x27;d rate it average.  I would not buy another one.  It just seems that the hair I want to cut has to be in perfect position (or the cutter has to be) in order for it to work.</li>
            <li> Fast, efficient, quiet. Nice tool!</li>
            <li> Works great. Have had many trimmers but this one works the best of any I have had. Easy to use, trims all areas (nose, ears and around eyebrows) very easily and painless.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great gadget highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I resisted these types of clippers for years as they were for &amp;#34;old guys&amp;#34;. Well, its fantastic and gets rid of any nose and ear hair very easily and painlessly. For the price, its amazing!</li>
            <li> Much better results with this trimmer than any others I&#x27;ve bought.  A little more money but well worth it.</li>
            <li> its do the job love it</li>
            <li> Was blown away at how quickly Amazon delivered this item.  Less than 24 hours from time of order.  Excellent safe little trimmer.</li>
            <li> works well... no problems... helps clean up all the errant hairs nose, ears etc...</li>
            <li> First of all, I am not one of those Vine writers. I paid for this trimmer. My old one landed in the trash can after I realized how much better this one was. The older one still worked, but I knew I&#x27;d never use it  again. Also, regardless of the hype published by the manufacturer, this thing is really on good in your nostril or auditory canal. It&#x27;s not so good for eyebrows or moustaches. For those use scissors or a clipper made for that job.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great. I just wish you could buy replacement blades. I spend more time cleaning the device than I using it.</li>
            <li> It works ok it&#x27;s not as precise as I thought it would be and it takes a while too get your nose trimmed. The one thing that I really did like about this trimmer is that it does not pull your hair at all.</li>
            <li> Looks identical but when compared to the original, the sound quality is very poor.</li>
            <li> Works exactly as it&#x27;s supposed to, however I recently bought a beard trimmer that has a nose hair attachment, making this product useless to me. I guess I&#x27;ll throw it away?</li>
            <li> This was a replacement for another trimmer that was too old.  I did not realize how dull the blades were.  This one is wonderful.  Trims down to the nub.  Leaves be clean and trimmed.  Keep up the great work, Amazon.</li>
            <li> Why does hair - at least more hair than is need for basic filtration - grow in your nose anyway.</li>
            <li> Head and shoulders better than any of the other Nose/Ear trimmers I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. Quiet, cleanable, does its job.</li>
            <li> This is a great nose hair trimmer, as long as it works, which isn&#x27;t long. It&#x27;s a good thing they are reasonably priced, because they eventually die. I buy a new one every 1.5 years.</li>
            <li> I really like the cleaning features. This thing rips through my nasal hairs like a black-robed villain&#x27;s light saber through a young Jedi&#x27;s forearm.</li>
            <li> Thick negroid hair is a different matter all together; I&#x27;ve had difficulty with other trimmers of similar design, but this trimmer cleaned me up thoroughly for both nose and ear hair (even those folded tucked-in difficult to reach areas).</li>
            <li> Great product - easy to use no nicking/cuts should had ordered one of these a long time ago!!</li>
            <li> product has a nice design and looks great sitting on my sink. Not working.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer was used maybe 5 times. Went to use it one day and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, figured it was left on and changed the battery...twice... Nothing, no response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not very expensive by itself but given its lifespan, I spent $3 a trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is beyond its return period so I&#x27;m out of luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try to spend a bit more and buy something more substantial.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas, since he was always mentioning that he wanted one. When I gave it to him, I honestly thought he was going to think it was stupid. He absolutely loves it! The first time he used it he said it actually helped him breathe better. I can also hear a difference in his breathing at night. He&#x27;s even used the eyebrow tool too, so I don&#x27;t have to &amp;#34;tourture&amp;#34; him when I pluck them. (His words, not mine)</li>
            <li> I will not miss sticking tweezers and scissors up my nose ever again.  They&#x27;re quiet and cut nicely.  I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been wanting one for a while, then a friend that cuts hair mentioned she could wax my nose hairs... So I bought this so she couldn&#x27;t.  it didn&#x27;t hurt or tickle like I feared, just cut the hair.  felt a little strange the first day, but now i find myself cutting the hair once a week or more.</li>
            <li> This thing works, BUT: the speed with which this thing goes through batteries defies physics! I can use this MAYBE four times before I have to replace the battery. Also, as the battery gets low, this thing has a tendency to tug at hairs. This thing is a little louder than you might expect. As soon as I come to grips with the fact that I have been &#x27;taken&#x27; on the purchase of this I will be buying a different one. I would not recommend the purchase of the panasonic er-gn30-k.</li>
            <li> It was a nice gift for someone</li>
            <li> My old Panasonic nose hair weeder finally failed after 12 years. This new one is a bit different with a more contoured body and some sort of wash lock I don&#x27;t understand but the working parts are same and it does a great job. Oh it has a flat bottom that makes it easy to stand up. A bonus is it drives the cat crazy.</li>
            <li> Simple and easy to use. Uses a regular battery. No complaints!</li>
            <li> I saw this on Amazon and it had great ratings, but after having used it for over a year I honestly don&#x27;t get why it&#x27;s rated so well at all.&lt;br /&gt; - Battery does not last, and rechargeable batteries don&#x27;t seem to work well with it either.&lt;br /&gt; - Trimmer gets jammed every 10 seconds, requiring you to shake it and hope it restarts&lt;br /&gt; - Cleaning without full head disassembly isn&#x27;t easy (twisting to open the small side hole to run water through won&#x27;t clean it)&lt;br /&gt; - Pull your hair often since it doesn&#x27;t spin fast enough&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, not a great product. I still use it since it works and don&#x27;t care enough to buy a new one, but to be honest I would pay more for a better product in the future.</li>
            <li> Piece of junk! Used it twice then stopped working. Of course I&#x27;ve replaced the battery to see if that was the issue. I cannot return it as I no longer have the packaging. It also wasn&#x27;t as good as others reviewed it to be.</li>
            <li> With the exception of the warmth issue, the trimmer works great.  Has an option to allow it to be cleaned under a running faucet.  Would buy again - great product!</li>
            <li> very effeciant and works as described</li>
            <li> Works very well. No pain. I like it a lot.  I dropped mine on the hard floor and now it makes a little more noise than at first, it was pretty quiet when I first got it, try not to drop yours.</li>
            <li> Two uses is all I got out of this before the blade literally popped out, while I was using it.  Fortunately, it didn&#x27;t injur me.</li>
            <li> Works surprisingly well.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer and I like that you can use it wet or dry.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t nick the skin, but on the flip side, it does not trim the hairs as close as I was used to with my previous trimmer.  Other than that, it is constructed well and can be used trim hair anywhere on your body.  I would recommend it with the exception of a close trim.</li>
            <li> Never used one of these before - My son suggested it.  Works great!</li>
            <li> I choose this rating because it WORKS. I always hated hair coming out of my nose, it was always embarrassing. This product is the answer, it takes care of the job in about 30 seconds. I will totally recommend it to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my family, love it,gets nose hair, ear hair and even eybrow hair. Buy it, You will not be sorry.</li>
            <li> Just what I expected and it came on time.</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, if you have a forest of hair growing from your nose and want to rid your self of it, grab this trimmer.</li>
            <li> It works but I dont like using it. battery lasts a long time. I still use it so I would recommend it to someone who wants one.</li>
            <li> Considering how many things tend to be disappointing in one fashion or another, this tiny little device (about the same shape as a lightsabre) works beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admittedly, this is my first time with a nosehair trimmer, and the spiky results left me twitching and sneezing for days after! Alas, the things we do for fashion.</li>
            <li> This is so much easier to use then the type that goes back and forth.  My husband said he no longer has to ask me if he missed any hairs in the ears.</li>
            <li> Compared to the zero turn mower this is the next best invention on earth. Works great!</li>
            <li> This replaces the one that I had before. I like it better since it is smaller and more compact. Good product</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a great job! It&#x27;s so much better than any I&#x27;ve ever tried before. Only one run-through and all the hair is gone. I would definitely recommend to others.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t figure out how this item got so many great reviews, there is nothing great about it, it takes time to remove the hair, after many attempts it still leaves hair behind, had to use scissors to trim my nose after using it because it did such a poor job. Is Amazon or Panasonic paying these folks or something to write great things about sponsored products? Now I am starting to doubt great reviews on Amazon, defeats the whole purpose of me shopping here.</li>
            <li> This product works great-I got it for my boyfriend and he loves it. Great value and does the job! NO cuts-you don&#x27;t feel anything when the car is coming off-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not quite a powerful as the small older model, but it does work. I mostly use it for its nose hair feature.</li>
            <li> gets the job done, but sometimes it feels like its trying to pull hair out instead of trimming it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t believe all the negative reviews. This is the best trimmer I have ever had. You don&#x27;t even need to be in front of a mirror to use it. You can trim while watching TV. I read all the negative reviews before buying but none of those reviews can be applied to this trimmer.Since you can return it within 30 days you have nothing to lose if you don&#x27;t like it.</li>
            <li> I have tried numerous nose trimmers over the years and this was is AMAZING!!! No more waxing for me or my husband!!!</li>
            <li> Works well. Easy to clean. Recommended .</li>
            <li> I bought this because the reviews were good and the price was right.  It seems both more robust with a higher rpm and more durable than the trimmer it replaced.</li>
            <li> Not much to review&lt;br /&gt;Insert one AA battery and turn it on.&lt;br /&gt;It functions well, is quiet and gentle.&lt;br /&gt;Does not tickle the nostril area, and cleans up nicely.</li>
            <li> I use this to buzz my nose hairs and it works great.  Theres no tugging and is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really amazed that this got rated so well. It technically trims hair, but it does so sporadically and is hard to aim. I tried from the top, the sides, and even tried rolling it! I cleaned it, and repeatedly checked to make sure it wasn&#x27;t on the rinse setting while trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took way longer than it should to use and I gave up on most areas and got out a small razor and some tweezers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even at this price, it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have owned several of these in different brands, and this one is distinctly better than any of the others.</li>
            <li> Works great and cleans easily.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY IT (YOU WILL ANYWAY!!!)&lt;br /&gt;Broke after one use. A piece of garbage.  Really poor construction, flimsy, poor design</li>
            <li> Worst nose trimmer I have ever had. It runs slow and stops sporadicaly, plus hairs so bad it will bring tears to your eyes LOL. Changed batteries twice still no speed up. I replace an older Panasonic that I had for years, this replacement is the epitome of Chinese junk.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. Excellent. I recommend this to anyone thinking about buying one. It&#x27;s very easy to use an works great.</li>
            <li> My husband bought one from Best Buy and has been using it for the past 4 years and it still works fine. I later bought 2 for my parents. Very easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> Recently bought this nose hair trimmer and it is not living up to the reviews.  It doesn&#x27;t trim very well.</li>
            <li> Cheap Chinese product. Lasts as long as a disposable razor.</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to buy him new scissors to trim his nose hairs.  After reading the reviews, I decided to give this a try.  He loves it!!  Easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Worth the money.  It uses the same mechanical cutter blades as other Panasonic nose trimmers.  The washing out with water without taking it apart is a great idea.</li>
            <li> This is my 2nd one, a gift to my dad!</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and does the job.</li>
            <li> Been trying to get my hubby to buy me a nose hair trimmer since we got married three years ago - apparently it&#x27;s not romantic? I finally bought one for myself. And I picked well! Easy to rinse. Trims without tugging, which is the worst part usually.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace an older Panasonic unit which needed to have the blades replaced.  Although the older one still spun happily, blades cost nearly as much as a new one so I gave this one a whirl.  It&#x27;s much much quieter than the unit it replaces.  Sharper blades?  Goes without saying.  Feels good in your hand.  Looks like it&#x27;ll be easier to clean as well.</li>
            <li> Solid 4 Stars !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish I knew that this is not a rechargeable product and works with batteries. Otherwise everything is great, does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used on old siccors for many years and hated trimming my nose that way.  I am totally pleased with how this trimmer works and have been telling all my friends about it and how easy it works.</li>
            <li> Works well! Great design!</li>
            <li> Not that I am proud to be getting older and have the need for a nose/ear hair trimmer, but this definitely is a nice product. Works great and like the fact that  you can clean it with water. Have used it probably 4-5 times and it does a great job of trimming the unwanted hair. So much easier and safer than using scissors, a razor or tweezers - and NO pain!!</li>
            <li> It started overheating the second time I was using it. I returned it and ordered Norelco Nose Hair Trimmer instead - well, Norelco is a much better choice.</li>
            <li> Works great! No more being tickled by little hairs.</li>
            <li> I only used it once but it does job well, nice and light and cleaning it is very simple I would recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer! It doesn&#x27;t pull hairs, trims well, and cleans quickly! I also like the price! It is by far one of the best trimmers I have used!</li>
            <li> I had it for a year and now it is broke.  Was hoping it would last a little longer than that. Wish there was some warranty on it or something.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great. The bent shape of it fits nicely in your hand. I don&#x27;t think the instruction book is as clear as it could be (for cleaning purposes) and that&#x27;s the only downfall to the trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have now used this product several times.  While I have no quibbles about function, I do not like the result.  Even after using the item, I have still had hair where I wished none to be.  Also, it leaves behind a feeling of five-o&#x27;clock shadow inside my ear right after use.  Calling the item an eyebrow or moustache trimmer is a bit of overselling because the instruction manual states one has to insert the hair to be cut into the middle of the razor&#x27;s tip.  It also warns there is no method of regulating length of such trimming.  All in all, I am disappointed with the product itself and plan on searching for a wand-style trimmer to replace this rotary one.</li>
            <li> It is pretty good. Cleaning is alright but I wish I could take it apart just a little more to clean it really well.</li>
            <li> It still takes a lot of work to get the errant hairs trimmed, but this design is better than many of the systems out there.</li>
            <li> I have tried several battery powered trimmers in the past and this is the&lt;br /&gt;first one that actually works!  Seems to have plenty of power to do the job\&lt;br /&gt;and it cuts the hair cleanly and quickly with no pulling...  Reasonably&lt;br /&gt;priced and does the job....</li>
            <li> I really can&#x27;t say how many trimmers I&#x27;ve bought over the years and discarded because they didn&#x27;t work as they should.&lt;br /&gt;Some were so cheaply made they broke after only a few uses.  This one is different.  I&#x27;m an old guy and was getting hairy ears.  I hate nose hair and had never found a product that really worked.  This one does!  It is comfortable and easy to use.  I dutifully clean it after every use and dry as recommended.  It is a sturdy product and expect it will last a long time.  I think it is a great value.</li>
            <li> Compact &amp; quiet. Trims hairs without pulling or nicking. You hardly notice it doing its job except for the low hum of the motor.</li>
            <li> The product works well, cuts even short hairs easily and does not pull or snag.  Easy to clean by rinsing with water.  It is easy to hold and feels pretty sturdy in construction.  It does, however, get pretty hot, pretty quickly.  You can still use it but it is interesting it gets hot that fast.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product.  As a woman it is gentle and easy to use.  The curved base fits nicely in my hand.</li>
            <li> I needed a nose hair trimmer because as everyone has noticed a stray hair poking out. Anyways I went with this model because of all the reviews and price $13/14. It works fast &amp; easy w/no pain, I did give it 4/stars because you can not disassemble/remove spinning blade part to really clean it like my old Wahl nose hair trimmer. I think if you rinse/dry it after each use it should last 2-4 years or more. (hear a tip on how I cleaned my old Wahl trimmer and it should work for this trimmer also) You will need a small cup,white vinegar, pour small amount in to cup just enough to soak silver tip/spinning blade let soak for 30min to 2hrs depending on how dirty it is, rinse off with hot hater/maybe brush off with old toothbrush &amp; dry off.</li>
            <li> This trimmer pulls out the nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a good design with poor quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last Panasonic trimmer lasted for 15 years and was a&lt;br /&gt;high quality  precision trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Stay away from this one.</li>
            <li> it works and seems to be made well, battery life is reasonable and in line with similar products. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> My husband wanted these for Christmas. He uses them often and they don&#x27;t pull the hair while they&#x27;re trimming.</li>
            <li> Perfect in every way. Easy to use, better blade system than older trimmers. Can&#x27;t recommend highly enough. Go buy one.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic.  It is serious about not just being a nose hair trimmer, but trimming other facial hair!  Yeah sure, nose hair.  But the cutting end is so friendly and safe, it makes it seem as though trimming other hairs would be good.  Those clear hairs under your eyebrows that you know are there even though no one can see them?  ZZZZZt.  Gone.  The unicorn hair that grows right between my husband&#x27;s brows?  Zzzzzzzzzzt.  Gone.  Little peach fuzz?  Zzzt.  So great!  I am so sorry I didn&#x27;t have one before this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that my husband refuses to trim his own hairs, so I have to do it, and he squirms and hates it.  He claims that sometimes it pulls on his nose hairs.  I think the blades are better suited to fine hair, and sometimes cannot quite zip through a thick hair.  So if you have serious hair, you might need a more serious trimmer.  But its great for my little lady nose hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea why it has a wet/dry feature.  We never seem to need it.</li>
            <li> Cuts and trims your hair just fine.  Honestly, I&#x27;m not sure what more can be said about the product than that.</li>
            <li> I brought this to replace one that I have been using for many many years. I lost count how long. It was a great product so when I needed a replacement I went with the same company. This one seems to be better, and I hope it lasts as long as the first one. Worked as advertised, packaging was great.</li>
            <li> I have yet to use this item because we apparently threw out the &#x27;blades&#x27; that come with it?  If the blades were included in the shipment they were not an obvious inclusion in the package and we now have a completely useless trimmer since a bladeless trimmer is no longer a trimmer...would be helpful to know how to buy &#x27;replacement&#x27; blades.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband for Christmas and he loves it; works as it was described.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean. Works great in hard to get to places in your nose.  I&#x27;d recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Totally pleased with this product.  It effectively removes hair from nose, ears, eyebrows, and anywhere else hair is  growing that you  want to get rid of.</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s there to say really. It cuts nose hair and does it well. It doesn&#x27;t pull out any nose hair.</li>
            <li> This is a great deal for what you get. I had an old sharper image one that was about 14 years old. This one is better because it can be cleaned.  That won it for me.</li>
            <li> This is a very nice nose hair trimmer. It works well and seems like it will last for a long time.</li>
            <li> I had doubts when I bought this item but it works beautifully. 100% satisfied. Highly recommended item to purchase. Awesome.</li>
            <li> Cuts hair decently, but broke within a few months.  Had to return for warranty and paid for shipping which costs half of the price of this product.&lt;br /&gt;I have received a letter stating that they will not redeem my warranty and it&#x27;s going to cost me $48 to repair.  Their warranty is a SCAM!</li>
            <li> I can put it in my daily use collect with my Panasonic Es 4289 S . I need both 1 time a week.</li>
            <li> This thing is great. I have had trimmers in the past that feel like they are ripping your hair out! I can&#x27;t even feel this one working.</li>
            <li> Works nicely. Seems to pull on a hair every now and again, but really isn&#x27;t that big of a deal. Easy to clean, and simple to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product for the price.</li>
            <li> The product came on time and I gave it as a gift to my husband. It did not work at all and since I ordered it early, I did not realize it was defective until he opened it a month and half later. Boo!</li>
            <li> Works OK but the power is wimpy. If you have a lot of nose and ear hair buy a plug-in model.</li>
            <li> it cuts the hair but takes forever. Have to hold it exactly right which i am not sure of yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had several of these over the years and believe this to be the best available for the price. They don&#x27;t last forever but what does these days. It has a very fast motor for clean painless trimming. I seem to be growing hair on my ears better than my head anymore and these keep the colony at bay. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Does the job, inexpensive and quiet. I bought this a few months back and have used it quite a bit. I have no complaints other than the fact that i think mine might be a bit defective because it seems like the AA battery in it drains extremely fast. I have switched out the battery more time than i think is necessary and i feel like it doesnt spin as fast as it once did.</li>
            <li> The sound is a little funny but this thing,,knock on wood, has yet to tug or pull one hair from ears, nose or wherever.....You will not make a mistake getting this!!!!</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re in the market for a good nose hair trimmer, this should be for you. works well and i use it all the time. seems well made and can be cleaned pretty easily.</li>
            <li> Worked great for 1.5 months and then just died. Not even a brand new battery could save it, and yes I triple checked that I inserted the battery correctly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that this device does exactly what you want.  It trims your nose hair painlessly, and efficiently.  Even course and difficult to trim hair is cut.  Sometimes it can take a bunch of passes, but it&#x27;ll get your nose nice and tidy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I&#x27;ve found that it has some serious issues when it comes to reliability.  My particular device has serious issues with its battery connection.  I have to fiddle with it endlessly to get it started.  Once it gets going, it seems to operate okay, but it involves a lot of jiggling and twisting to get it to turned on.  I&#x27;ve tried new batteries, but it hasn&#x27;t helped.  It&#x27;s definitely some kind of defect in my device.  This is a problem I&#x27;ve noticed in most nose-hair trimmers which I find odd, but it is what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s a comfortable and quality trim that I wish was a little more reliable.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for my old reliable Panasonic trimmer that finally gave out. It gives the same good trim, and  the trimmer head seems strong and does not jam easily. I can&#x27;t comment on battery usage as I use rechargables  and replace the battery weekly. I don&#x27;t know why they went with a curved body; my guess is just marketing esthetics. The rinse head cleaning is also handier than the disassemble-clean-reassemble routine on the old model. It has a broad base and stores easily in an upright position.</li>
            <li> Works just as expected. Allows me to stay well groomed in areas often neglected but obvious to others. Every man should have one!</li>
            <li> When get to about 45 or so you start to grow hairs out of everywhere right.  Works on the nose ears-eyebrows etc.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, for my husband who has had a stroke, and has the use of only his right hand.</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for. Something to trim those unwanted hairs. I would highly recommend this unit to just about anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product at a great price. It works and is very easy to clean. The Hair Trimmer is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Thought this model looked pretty well designed and it was very low in cost.  It does work but runs off a single 1.5 volt battery. It&#x27;s motor turns the cutter head slowly, so it takes forever to use.  When cutting the motor slows appreciably.  Instruction book says the battery will last a year.  With so little motor RPM that is likely a good guess. Usually Panasonic products are better than this.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again if it stopped working.  It is easy to use and gets the job done comfortably.  I have used other models, and they just did not cut the hairs very well, so it took forever to use, and they were really hard to clean</li>
            <li> I got these for my dad, as he sometimes looks kind of shaggy.  He also is having some serious memory loss and executive function issues associated with dementia.  As this trimmer has a safe shielded rotary blade, I figured he wouldn&#x27;t be able to accidentally hurt himself.  After 6 months of use, they&#x27;re doing a good job, and he hasn&#x27;t had any issues with them, other than to replace the battery.</li>
            <li> I only use this to trim my nose hair. It works great! It does a super job and never hurts.</li>
            <li> It does the job very well without tugging on my nose hairs.  I do wish I had gotten the nose trimmer with the vacuum though, because those hairs just end up in the back of my nose and throat and make me get congested.</li>
            <li> With this trimmer I have experienced:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No malfunctions&lt;br /&gt;No pulling of hairs&lt;br /&gt;Excellent battery life&lt;br /&gt;Extremely easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty simple. What else would you want a nose/facial hair trimmer to do?</li>
            <li> this trimmer cuts all those pesky nose hairs without cutting or scratching the inside of your nose. I like that its easy to rinse and clean</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase.  Very good quality, no problems so far. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this nose hair trimmer and the fact that you can rinse it.  He likes the circle style better than the straight comb style and this one works great.</li>
            <li> What can I say. As guys get older eyebrows, ears and nose hair grows. This trimmer is just what the well groomed older dude needs to look sharp. Great price, easy to clean and pack.</li>
            <li> It works. Not elegant, but why should it be when it is in your nose?  Easy to clean. Easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean. Doesn&#x27;t pull or tug sensitive hairs. Like the shape of it, it feels secure in your hand.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. Cuts close around the ears and nose, and also trims the eyebrows.  All without pulling the hair.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 trimmers in the past and none of them seemed to work well.  This unit works.  You could spend less and get something that will not do the job.  The price is very good and it shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> It does what it say it does. It is reasonably quiet, and easily cuts those pesky nasal or ear hairs. I&#x27;d recommend this as it is quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Upon using this product I had minor trouble at first.  But realizing that the blade is removable and can therefore be easily cleaned, I was pleased with this.  This allows you to remove clipped nose hairs, albeit gently, with a small brush.  The blade could be bent if you don&#x27;t take care to gently clean off the clipped hairs.  Once I&#x27;ve finished gently brushing out the hairs, I proceed to use my Norelco shaver lubricant to aid in the cleaning and lubrication of the cutter blade.  All this together with a fresh battery make for an excellent nose hair trimmer that trims rather close.  Way to go with a great product Panasonic &amp; thank you Amazon for a great price!</li>
            <li> I bought a cheap trimmer a while back and it was junk, this one works well. I can recommend this one</li>
            <li> I chose this trimmer because it was advertised as easy to clean and also because it could get 90 minutes from one AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;I like that the protective cap is open to allow moisture to escape. The motor rotates efficiently even while trimming. I use it about once a week and I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> this item is great for what it stands for, it dose a great job my wife is in love with it</li>
            <li> Works good it is a good product and I like the way is looks the quality is good I would recommend this to anybody</li>
            <li> My first nose hair trimmer was one of these: www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ER415SC-Facial-Trimmer-Silver/dp/B000O5VKK0/ref&#x3D;sr_1_3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was bad. It pulled and it hurt and I hated using it.  So I decided to buy a new one, and got the Panasonic ER-GN30-K instead. The difference is dramatic. It goes through nose hair like butter. It&#x27;s never pulled, it&#x27;s never hurt, and it works like a charm. This is the one you want!</li>
            <li> It works.  It works well.  It is comfortable and does not hurt.  It leaves me feeling self assured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no more to add.  If you are a man of a certain age and the hair on your ears and nose grows more than the hair on your head, this is the perfect one for you!  5 Stars for sure!</li>
            <li> I have had product loyalty for many years. Once again Panasonic has proven quality. Powerful...it doesn&#x27;t bog down. Comfortable to hold. Grooms in those crevices that need attention.</li>
            <li> Had another brand which I didn&#x27;t like.  This works well, no pulling.  I don&#x27;t know how long battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will last, just carry a spare.</li>
            <li> This really works my husband loves it&lt;br /&gt;we both use it its great works very well&lt;br /&gt;we will buy again  Hair is Gone&lt;br /&gt;thanky</li>
            <li> Hair...who wants it sticking out from your nose. This cuts it close and easily. This is my second device and this cuts from the end and sides so it gets the hairs cut well. Would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> All in all it&#x27;s not a bad grooming tool. As long as you keep it clean it will perform well. The blades should be changed out about every year (give or take depending on usage).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note of caution: DO NOT use a weak battery in this unit or you&#x27;ll be sorry!!! I did one time and ending up pulling out nose hairs instead of cutting them....OUCH!!!</li>
            <li> The other reviews here influenced me to purchase this. I had been using an old one that did a very bad job. For some reason I just never thought to replace it. Then it broke. This trimmer is far superior to the others that I have used. It is definitely worh buying. It does the job.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic DR-GN30-K is only the second of such powered hair trimmer that I&#x27;ve ever bought.  The first powered trimmer that I used was a generic, shipped directly from China and cost a little under $3. In defense of that cheap little trimmer, I did keep it running for two or three years.  So, could the Panasonic trimmer actually be worth a cost that is 4 times greater? My answer is &amp;#34;yes&amp;#34;&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;  The first thing that I noticed that it trimmed the hair very smoothly. That alone  had me sold.  Some people may say that it has a tendency to pluck hairs.  I argue that if you go after a full beard with just an electric razor, it will probably offer similar hair plucking.  That&#x27;s why they are called &amp;#34;trimmers&amp;#34;....just saying.&lt;br /&gt;  This product has been working great so far. The build quality is substantially higher than the generic trimmer that I a  I kept going for a few years.  If I remember, I will revisit  this review for a longevity update.</li>
            <li> This little guy does exactly what it is supposed to do - quickly, gently and efficiently!  Gets rid of all those tiny stray facial hairs without tugging or pulling.  And on top of that is runs fairly quietly!  It feels sturdy and well built and my hubby and I are very happy with this purchase.  Feels like it should last as a long time!</li>
            <li> What can you say about a nose trimmer. Works or not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works. It&#x27;s handy for mustaches too. Hope it lasts.</li>
            <li> Gets the job done. No pain or discomfort. Batteries last awhile. Gets rid of all unwanted hair and is small enough to store most places.</li>
            <li> This product is phenomenal. Great design. Great price. Great function. LOVE the ability to wash/clean. Whoever designed this thing should get a raise. Every part of it is great. Effectively cut my nose/ear hairs and trimmed my eyebrows. Enough said. Buy with confidence!</li>
            <li> Very dependable.  Does a nice job trimming nose hairs without ripping them out of your nostril.  Humane trimmer.  Keeps nose hairs high and tight</li>
            <li> Works Perfect for me, pretty simple instructions.. Although it would be nice to come with a AA battery for it.</li>
            <li> Trims hair quickly and painlessly and then stores away in a bathroom drawer until the next time you need some grooming.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t it &amp;#34;funny&amp;#34; that as we get older, some of us lose hair in certain areas and it begins sprouting like crab grass in others!  I have tried a few of these products over the years , and they all were pretty worthless to begin with and/or died a quick death.  This Panasonic model works like a champ, is quiet and appears to be built quite well.  And the price from Amazon was GREAT!</li>
            <li> I used this about three times. It worked moderately well for trimming nose hair, but left annoying stubble. It did not work so well in trimming ear hair and also left stubble. I did not find it easy to determine how far to insert it for trimming nose hair, so caution is recommended. Cleaning is also somewhat hit and miss, since you need to take it apart, wash it carefully so as not to lose any small parts or cut yourself on the double-edged blade. On the third use, it just quit and would not start. I tried several new batteries of high quality and no results. It just died. The batteries were in the proper orientation in the handle, but no luck. I eventually determined that to ship it back for warranty repair would cost more than the original price, so I gave up and tossed it in the garbage, which appears to be the proper storage container for this disappointing product from Panasonic. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this toy.[[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> These things suck!! I should have listened to the review that were written on them before I purchased them. They worked perfectly for the first couple of months then just stopped working from one day to the next. I thought the batteries were dead so I changed them out. To my dismay the damned thing still wouldn&#x27;t work. Going to see if I could get my money back. What a rip off!</li>
            <li> The concept is great but the product does not have replaceable blades and eats through batteries.  I mean really.  I don&#x27;t trim every day and this thing is dead in a month.  I went with waxing and tweezer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has good design. Easy to clean. Performs as advertised. Comfortable to hold and use. Single battery appears to provide enough power. Good buy.</li>
            <li> excellent product. convenient, clean and powerful. very solid material and it works perfectly fine. totally recommended. works great also around ears and neck areas.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer at a great price. Cleans easily and does a very good job, but be careful not to strike the cutter guard on anything or it will bend and jam the cutter. I thought mine had quit until i realized the guard was jamming the cutter from getting slightly bent inward,......bent the guard back into position and has been working fine since.</li>
            <li> worked once...then failed....had to return</li>
            <li> This item wasn&#x27;t exactly what I had in mind; it turns out I think I might need something stronger. All in all, somewhat satisfied.</li>
            <li> Like the title says: setup was simple. It works well, no pulling or tugging feeling. Cleaning is a simple task: open outlet, place under running water.</li>
            <li> Cuts lie a dream. Cleans easy. This is a top rated product and for good reason. This product is a great value and is absolutely worth a try if you need to trim some nose hair.</li>
            <li> Worked well, at first. But very quickly (6 months) lost its power. Even with new batteries, barely works. Going in the trash.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work in less than a year.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li> perfect shape, perfectly powerful, really nicely made, the rest of the small and cute nose trimmers were trashed immediately. love that you can rinse it under water to keep it clean. this is the best nose trimmer i&#x27;ve had so far and it will be hard to find better...</li>
            <li> I like this product, but cannot HIGHLY recommend it. It does work well when needed, however it does seem to be quite sensitive to batteries. What I mean by that, is that it seems to only give you the full power it can give if you have a battery that has most of it&#x27;s life in it. If it is a somewhat less full battery it is only is able to give some power then when it trims your facial hair (I use it for my nose)... it then can kind of pull your hair rather then burning it off quickly which results in an uncomfortable pinching of your nose hair (kind of like it feels when you pull a hair out yourself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Slightly recommended, perhaps there are better, I haven&#x27;t tried looking.</li>
            <li> Broke after 3 months. Weak motor.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband but I also use it to trim my eye brows.  It is great for trimming eye brows, stray nose and ear hairs. Have been using it for years and have never had an issue with it &amp;#34;yanking&amp;#34; any hairs when the battery gives out.  Usually have to change the battery once a year (unless you are exceptionally hairy).</li>
            <li> Expected a trimmer to have sufficient power to rotate the blades with the speed to cut effortlessly.  Instead, it is comparable to the performance of weed whackers that run on batteries.  If you&#x27;ve had a battery run edge trimmer/weed wacker, you know exactly what I mean. Disappointed and would not recommend.</li>
            <li> I have bought several of these types of devices over the years, and this one is simply the best.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reviews and cost. I bought one for my husband and one each for my sons. The biggest reason was nose hair,so very hard to get at. They were all thrilled and it did a great job; the price was quite reasonable too.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT nosehair trimmer. Im not sure how they classify this as a facial hair trimmer. This has absolutely no attachment which is disappointing. Maybe I am being unfair because it didnt say in the description that it included any attachments, but i was looking for ONE unit to do nose, ear and the razor attachment for eyebrows, like the mangroomer one I had before. Again, this is a GREAT nosehair trimmer.</li>
            <li> I had it for maybe a month before it started fritzing out. Tapping it at the right angle and adjusting the battery seemed to help for a while so there was obviously a loose connection in it somewhere. After six months of dealing with the frustration just getting it to work when I want it to it&#x27;s completely bitten the dust. Cheaply manufactured, buy a different model or brand.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have issues with the blade getting stopped when trimming my hair, forcing be to turn it off and on again. The device itself could also be of higher quality, mostly made of a fairly cheap plastic. It is pretty easy to clean though. Fair warning, if you are trimming your nose and the blade gets stuck on a particularly thick nose hair, you are in for a bit of pain!</li>
            <li> If the tip hits a hard surface, it can bend the tip and that ultimately destroys the perfect fit of the rotary blades inside. Other than that, this is an excellent product. It shaved the hairs off the back of my hand and inside my nose without pulling. The wife likes it too.</li>
            <li> Works as perfectly as described and reviewed by previous purchasers. Recommended!!!!</li>
            <li> Motor seems underpowered, had to move around the battery until it get a good connection.</li>
            <li> Late shipment with no notice but product is great !!!</li>
            <li> Easy to use once you know what the buttons do. Cuts cleanly so far. No pulls. Feels comfortable in your hand and gets the job done. Cleans up easy, even if you take it apart, which I do. Recommended.</li>
            <li> This thing brought tears to my eyes, but it cleaned out my nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I have had to buy 2 so far... look, bottom line is they work and work well but both get too old or something and then the motor starts sounding loud and will not perform as well.  I will buy another because via price and the competition it is a battle of attrition.  So the life cycle for me which is use 4 times a week for 6 months.  Not bad for the price but annoying to have to keep replacing.</li>
            <li> Does a good job keeping nose hairs in shape.  Much better than using scissors, &amp; reasonably priced.  Way Way better that the Remington nose hair clipper it replaced.  Remington was all rusted, and never did cut so well.  This Panasonic cuts very well, &amp; is very well made.</li>
            <li> Easily the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Easy to clean and durable.  I recommend this item highly.</li>
            <li> easy to use. works great</li>
            <li> It lasted for about a year. It died and I replaced the battery, but still no luck. Not worth it even at the low price it was still a waste of time and materials going into a landfill.</li>
            <li> works well really gets in their    and no one paid me to say this, i bought this on amazon like everything i review.... im 100% verified</li>
            <li> I thought I&#x27;d try it from all the good reviews but after only using maybe 4 times, it has died.  Not returnable now either so not happy at all with quality or the return policy for poorly made items.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not real impressed with this trimmer. It works great for the nose. Not so much for ears. It does trim the ear hair, but it takes forever. The cutting action is at the very tip so you have to really work it for a while to get the job done. Cleans easily and is pretty quiet if that is important to you.</li>
            <li> Lemon. Don&#x27;t bother with warranty, waste of money and time. Buy other brand.</li>
            <li> Got the product fast, easy to use, and works well...  Maybe could have been more powerful and cut closer but cant complain.</li>
            <li> It does the job, not too expensive and it does what is expected not that bad after all. I would spend a little more the next time and get something better.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a Y chromosome, but what I do have is a big Jewish nose filled with some really ugly dark hairs. The whole combination has made me really self-conscious about my face in general, especially because the hairs would show more when I smiled. I used to use cuticle scissors, but those could only get the biggest ones and had a frequency to pull out the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am *so* happy I bought this. Sure, I&#x27;m gonna keep it more hidden than my vibrator, but I am just so happy I have it. It worked, it didn&#x27;t hurt, and now all I have is a cute Jewish nose, not a huge Jewish nose filled with black hair. No one ever commented about my nose hair, but it was one of those things that I knew existed and I just hated. A $10 confidence boost is pretty sweet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only two things brought it down a star:&lt;br /&gt;1.) This thing was a *bitch* to get open. It honestly took me fifteen minutes.&lt;br /&gt;2.) I think the little head protector thing could be a little closer to the blade to get a closer shave. When I look in the mirror closely I can still see the hairs. I suppose having the hairs be there is better than ingrown ones though!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this on the mustache God granted me too, but I think I&#x27;ll stick with Nair on that one :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, if you are a girl who is embarrassed by her nose hairs, bite the bullet and buy this. It really worked and has made me much more confident :).</li>
            <li> Inexpensive, eerily quiet (a great thing), easy to clean and well thought out. Yes, I couldn&#x27;t be happier! The tools shape and feel are good in my hands too.</li>
            <li> My husband really loves this trimmer and the size is great for travel. He never leaves home with out it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different nose trimmers from other manufacturers and this is absolutely the best one I have ever used.  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It seems the older I get the hairier I get.  One of the most annoying things in the world to me anyway is having wild nose hairs.  They itch and get pulled and are definitely a distraction for any other person that is looking at you closely I&#x27;m afraid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little device if used regularly can make that problem disappear.  Extremely easy to use and reasonably priced.  I had another similar trimmer that came with a set but it was of lesser quality and the motor gave out after a year or so.  This panasonic seems to be going strong.  I use it about once a week probably.  Very good item for it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I have used several similar products in the past and my Panasonic is the best by far.  It remains to be seen how long it will last but so far so good.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t know how much I needed one until I bought this.  Gross to talk about, but sometimes a single hair in the nose becomes very irritating, difficult to remove.  This little guy gets them all, nose and ears, very quickly.  The cleaning instructions could use some work, but so far it hasn&#x27;t jammed up.  Definitely a worthwhile purchase, especially if the barber is starting to trim nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> It works as intended.  It has a very quality look and feel.  It is also very simple and safe to use.  I only clean it every two weeks, and it&#x27;s relatively easy to clean as well.</li>
            <li> Did its job, Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised, gently removes hairs, very easy to clean, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> Ran water through to clean it and was shaking it when the tip assembly just came apart from the inertial force of shaking the water out........</li>
            <li> Bought it as a gift and the feedback is that it does a decent job on nose and ear hair.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well. I&#x27;ve had others, but they went bad after a while.&lt;br /&gt;This one has is the best I&#x27;ve had so far.</li>
            <li> Nice and cheap, works well!</li>
            <li> All the others I have tried seem to die withing a couple months. This one seems well made and works well.</li>
            <li> Having used various nose &amp; ear trimers over the years with marginal success, it&#x27;s nice to see that the ER-GN30-K trimmer hit the bulls eye in performance and value. I can&#x27;t imagine how a competitor could offer a better solution.  I bought a second for my wife. An unequivocal 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Well, one of those things that happens when you get into your 40&#x27;s is that it would appear that hair runs away from your scalp and decides to grow in your ears, nose and eyebrows. Dangit!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have been tweezing nose hairs for years and still prefer that option; but, that takes a bit of time and is an eye watering mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works better than any other electric trimmer have tried. Quick and safe, has never pulled a single hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the water cleaning port, too. Great design!</li>
            <li> Trims those hard to get places perfectly.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a father day gift to my dad. he loved it although he had some problems figuring out how to take it apart to wash it</li>
            <li> I thought this would be painful and it isn&#x27;t. The perfect trimmer!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband... super easy to use, and super easy to clean! This nose and ear trimmer is a much better alternative to digging in his nose with little scissors!</li>
            <li> Works excellent wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Its so easy, quick and fast to trim it actually doesnt feel like a chore anymore!  Amazing product and easy to use and clean :D</li>
            <li> Good Quality product that works very well and very reasonably priced</li>
            <li> I love this little thing. It is simple to use, easy to clean and it works!</li>
            <li> Bought one for myself not to long ago, liked it so much bought this one for my son.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, but fragile. Don&#x27;t drop it or you&#x27;ll be out of business.</li>
            <li> The war against unwanted ear and nose hair requires a proper tool.  The Panasonic ER is that tool.  I had tried other products but they never had the necessary quality to hold up to regular use.  This tool fits well in the hand, is of sturdy construction (a must) and functions well running off of a AA battery.  My highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully!  Not painful like a couple of other ones I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> Great, easy to use. Wish I had gotten sooner.</li>
            <li> Works fine.  Takes a few passes, but it does the job.</li>
            <li> Ever seen Dumb and Dumber. I think this may even trim their nose hairs.</li>
            <li> works great , and great price</li>
            <li> This works very well.  It has a nice ergonomic design and is easy to clean.  I like that it has a cover for the tip too.</li>
            <li> comfortable to use, easy to clean- too soon to tell relaibility, but seems made well enough</li>
            <li> best nose trim! I bought many differnet type adn this is the best one out there.</li>
            <li> Big fan of this trimmer. I primarily use this for my nose and it has worked really well. I do like the washable feature where it lets water out of the vent in the back - highly recommend to users looking for a nose trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that I have experienced some burning-type smell when using it for a longer period of time but this is no show stopper.</li>
            <li> Son loves this Christmas gift!</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. He had never owned one before and thought it would be uncomfortable or pull, but as it turns out, he was incorrect. He simply used grooming scissors before, and Ladies, those stragglers are no longer visible. Thank YOU Panasonic!!</li>
            <li> It cuts very closely and cleans easily. Does the job better than any other similar trimmer I have used in the past. Very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works great.  I have a 10 year old previous model which has worked great.  The new one has a way of cleaning the blades without removing the head.  The head assembly still comes off with a 1/4 twist of the cap.  It makes for easy clean up.  It cuts very close and with minimal pulling.</li>
            <li> My shorter friends tell me that they appreciate my freshly maintained nostrils. I don&#x27;t have to wear my hair long over my ears either.</li>
            <li> This does a good job with nose hairs, would wish it was able to get the nose hairs a bit shorter. But i find no faults with the unit.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband. He loves it! Battery retains charge for a long time: he doesn&#x27;t use it often but the battery has not run down.</li>
            <li> item works just as described, j</li>
            <li> This broke down totally after using it 3 or 4 times.  uhggggg</li>
            <li> The best Nose and Ear Facial Hair Trimmer ever!</li>
            <li> Easy, fast and great!</li>
            <li> Yeah, so I got old and invested in a nose hair trimmer. I don&#x27;t have a ton of experience with these things, but it seems pretty solid so far.</li>
            <li> Nice cut in nose and ears.</li>
            <li> Where have you been all my life : )</li>
            <li> There comes a time in you life when those little hairs in the nose continue to grow.  They must be cut, otherwise people kind of look at them.  So, get one of these and cut them.  It is extremely bizzare to stick this up your nose in order to cut nose hairs, and can hurt a tiny bit when ripping out some hairs, but overall, it keeps those nose hairs nice and trim, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Works great ,much better than my old one i got at the 99 cent store.I always have good luck with Panasonic products</li>
            <li> GETS THE JOB DONE WELL!</li>
            <li> Excellent little groomer ... powerful and quiet. Easy to clean although you have to dissemble the cutter to clean. Easily done and I guess this process maintains it&#x27;s efficiencies. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> its ok my older panasonic trimmer was much better....</li>
            <li> Quiet, effective, does not pull. Only uses one battery. Just what I needed. There is no pulling and the hairs are cut without any pain. Very satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> This is extremely easy to use. It&#x27;s a little curved so it fits&lt;br /&gt;easily in your hand and it&#x27;s light and easy to use. It works with&lt;br /&gt;great precision and it&#x27;s[[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]] a breeze to clean. All you need is a \\&quot;AA\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;battery and that&#x27;s all. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Well my nose hair was always out and my friends had to tell me that I have to put them back in.&lt;br /&gt;I just used once and this is no hair in my nose right now. but I feel like I am swallowing all the dust without filter.&lt;br /&gt;Overoll, it is good product</li>
            <li> painless and gets the job done</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out and hurt you like other hair trimmers I have used in the past. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Work Great no pinching!!!</li>
            <li> Great for cutting nostril and ear opening hair. Good and ergonomic, Gives close cut and can be operated wet and also washed with water.</li>
            <li> Works great. Does not cut inside your nose like other product.</li>
            <li> Works great, good price and value.</li>
            <li> Working out just great!</li>
            <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, gets the job done for nose trimming!</li>
            <li> This works and use this to trim hair in my ear and no where else.  :-)</li>
            <li> My nostril grooming has never been better! My wife can&#x27;t believe the difference. We both highly recommend!</li>
            <li> This is absolutely amazing, you can find shipper options online of course but this one is easy to clean does not feel that uncomfortable as others so you are paying for a great quality product.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best hair trimmers I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s light and shaped just right for holding it without it being awkward.  Time will tell concerning the longevity of the product, but I am hopeful.</li>
            <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to use&lt;br /&gt;- Durable&lt;br /&gt;- Battery (name brand starts with a &amp;#34;D&amp;#34; :-)) lasts a long time&lt;br /&gt;- Easily cleaned under running water&lt;br /&gt;- Survived a 3 foot drop into a wooden drawer&lt;br /&gt;- Trims ears, eye brows, and beard well&lt;br /&gt;- Surprisingly quiet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Trimming around the corner of your mouth may cause some cuts&lt;br /&gt;- Protective lid pops off too easily during transport (luxury issues)</li>
            <li> As you get older hair starts growing in all the wrong places.  This is a life saver.  Simple and effective.  I even bought one for a friend as his really long nose hair was bothering me :)</li>
            <li> still functions and was delivered timely</li>
            <li> Did not last very long.  The top of the device gets clogged up and stops working.  When you remove to clean the device, it does not function properly.</li>
            <li> Great for keeping those freaky nose hairs at bay ..... Though, I use another trimmer for fighting back the out of control ear hairs !!!!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. No fear of ripping nose hairs out anymore. Really... that&#x27;s a big one.  :-)</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t think this does the best job of clipping nose hairs. I mean, if you use it once a day then maybe, but it doesn&#x27;t reach far enough into your nostril to clip the really long hairs before they start growing out of your nose again by 5 o&#x27;clock. Purchased as a gift.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself works fine but I hate the cap. It is smooth and tapered so your fingers keep sliding off of it when you try to pull it off.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this thing. He had asked for this for Christmas and I felt weird giving this as a Christmas gift but hey he asked for it. Well that has been a couple years ago and he still uses it and loves it. It works well and all he has had to do is change the batteries.</li>
            <li> Excelllent product.  Would definitely buy again from this Seller.</li>
            <li> Not easy to follow instructions for use and cleaning. But it does the job.</li>
            <li> Works well simple to use and clean</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband in December 2014. He really liked it and used it for about 9 months. Then it fell apart. He&#x27;s put it back together repeatedly but it&#x27;s a pain in the neck! I&#x27;m going to order a different brand.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a little while.</li>
            <li> Perfect as it should be.</li>
            <li> Does not work well at all...</li>
            <li> Absolutely perfect.  Exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> Quiet, good cut and easy cleaning. Comes in a small package</li>
            <li> Excellent in every way</li>
            <li> Excellent Product, and a great buy!</li>
            <li> good, easy to use and seems good quality</li>
            <li> Problem with getting hairs cut somewhat close.</li>
            <li> Worked well, but broke way too soon.</li>
            <li> Functional and easy to use! REcommended</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut close enough.</li>
            <li> Use this a couple of times a week to trim my nose hairs and less frequently on my ears.  It works great and is much quieter than I expected.  Still using the same batter for &gt;6 months now, no signs that it&#x27;s about to die.  For the price and the job it does, this is a 5 star item.  It would be great to have a vacuum system to catch the hairs and for literally a few extra dollars, panasonic has a model that does just that (I might try that next time).  Also, when you clean the blade and put it back in place, if you push down too far the machine becomes a lot more noisy.  Would be nice if there was an easy demarcation letting you know how far to place the blade back in.  Of course, you can just figure it out after a few cleanings.</li>
            <li> The product worked very well for 6 weeks, and then promptly broke. I tried it with 4 different sets of fresh batteries, and it simply refuses to turn on. It was never dropped or mishandled, just lived its short existence in my medicine cabinet before failing completely.</li>
            <li> This product work really good.  I have these cheap batteries and they only last for one clipping.  I will be trying some name brand batteries to see if it will last past one clipping.  Other than that, it doesn&#x27;t pull your hair, and gets everything for a clean nose, lol</li>
            <li> So far this is a great product that does what it is meant to do. Watch out....it tickles your nose and makes you want to sneeze. ;)</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.  Does not pull or pinch.  Light weight and ergonomic design for easy handling.</li>
            <li> When I got this I felt a little silly trying it out for the first time. Something about the idea of a nose hair trimmer made me feel old even though I am only 25. I must admit though that I like it a lot. It&#x27;s a lot better than going at it with a pair of scissors and I&#x27;m really a lot less concerned about a stray hair popping out. It really only takes a minute or so to be finished and despite having some nervousness about it, it has never nicked me. When using it, it does give a bit of a tickling sensation, but I guess that&#x27;s just the nature of the environment and it may be different for others. Great item to add to your grooming regimen because it is so cheap and so effective at it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> This product worked as promised. I guess my boyfriend likes it and he can get rid off his scissors haha...</li>
            <li> Works perfect!  Great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now.  It worked great at the start, but is showing signs of slowing down.  Not sure if this is a battery issue or product issue yet.  We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean and cuts well.  What more can you ask at $10?</li>
            <li> ...like a lot of the reviews state. I Guess I&#x27;m not a sasquatch like some of the reviewers, and need it for really the occasional trim, clean up, and stragglers. For that, I need to take off the guard to use it, and am not sure if I will eventually cut myself - kinda scary. Otherwise, nice and compact, does the job.</li>
            <li> This nose trimmer from when I received it acted like the batteries I used were almost dead. I have come to the conclusion it was never the batteries, instead it is a defective trimmer. It has gotten progressively worse to the point I am going to have to buy a different one even though this trimmer is only about 2 months old. I know this trimmer has gotten good reviews, that is why I bought it. But my experience has been quite the opposite. It trims well, but it has some kind of power issue and I will have to replace it. Not a good experience for me.</li>
            <li> the conical slotted tip works with multiple passes in the nose but with unsatisfactory service for the ear.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on amazon reviews and it did work great the handful of times I used it (maybe 8-10 times). THe most recent time i picked it up it did not turn on. Hmmm...Not used very often but maybe the battery broke. Change the battery. No luck. Changed it again. No luck. OK looks like it is burnt out and not working. Well that wasn&#x27;t a very long time. Not impressed. Panasonic you need to step up your quaility.</li>
            <li> No complaints, came in on time. works great dry. I have not tried it wet. I don&#x27;t think I will ever will. Glad I finally bought one. too embarrassing at the local store. ;) its just me.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean. Love it. Perfectly priced.</li>
            <li> Nice, no pulling, my only complaint is that the single battery design means that as soon as voltage drops a tad, it doesn&#x27;t have enough torque to start. I can fix sometimes by jiggling and fooling around with it, but usually I end up replacing the rechargeable (eneloop) battery. It might like the slightly higher voltage of an alkaline battery, but I&#x27;ll never buy one of those again.</li>
            <li> With age comes the growing of hair in places you don&#x27;t want. I bought this unit to replace a dead Wahl trimmer and I like this on far better. No pulling or snagging and does what it is supposed to do. No complaints.</li>
            <li> Nice product. As described.</li>
            <li> Better than sliced bread! When you hit 40 this device is mandatory. Buy a magnifying glass while your at it.</li>
            <li> Please note:  I intend to supplement this review when I have more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received unit yesterday, read the manual, used it only once, but it cut nose hairs very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned two other nose trimmers over the years.  The first was rotary and it worked but not all that efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;The second contained horizontal blades and I felt the unit was a pain and was not good at all at clipping the nose hairs-it was a tedious process as well as irritated the skin surrounding my nostrils-for that reason, I would recommend only rotary trimmer for nose.  This is a rotary unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, I am not able to comment on longevity, but unit is warranted for 2 years parts and labor.  That&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips I can pass on based upon my reading of manual, telephone conversation with Panasonic, and use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1  Manual should definitely be read thoroughly;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. However, the manual did not cover all my inquiries so I contacted Panasonic;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3  There are some intermediate positions but they do not have any function-one should either set the dial at &#x27;0&#x27; to use the unit or on &#x27;faucet&#x27; for water cleaning;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. When you are able to discern from the manual how to remove the outer blade (which contains the inner blade) use the supplied cleaning brush to clean both off;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Re re-inserting the inner blade into the outer blade-just push it in gently, but there is no way to &#x27;lock&#x27; it in AFAIK, so no real proper orientation or grooves to slide into-don&#x27;t worry about it;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. When one wants to connect the outer blade unit to the base unit, press down on outer blade once you have (by feel) rotated it to proper orientation, and, importantly, turn it clockwise and do apply some considerable force until you hear it &#x27;snap&#x27; tight-keep on turning until you hear a pronounced snap and will go no further.  At that time, you will see the solitary index mark on the base of the outer blade unit is aligned with theindex mark on the blue dial.  If you don&#x27;t do this the unit may start to come apart when turned on-this happened to me.  So if you are going to mess with removing and brushing the blades be sure that you have properly secured them to the base unit, and test run it first before inserting in any area to be trimmed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price point, this is the best that I&#x27;ve found thus far and it&#x27;s well worth the cost.  I was pleasantly surprised with this unit&#x27;s clipping ability.  It definitely deserves 5-Stars!</li>
            <li> This works great for the price.  My husband&#x27;s ears never looked better and trims his nose like a champ.  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It works but it certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like a well made trimmer.  It feels like its about to fall apart every time I use it.  But for price its not to bad, just don&#x27;t expect quality.</li>
            <li> My how things change when you get older. I used to have my hair cut every other week and never worried about nose or ear hair. Now I can go 4-5 weeks without a hair cut, but it seems like every time I look in the mirror there is a beard growing in my nose. And if I turn my head sideways it looks like someone has transplanted Hobbit hair onto my ears. Growing old is definitely not for sissies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old Panasonic trimmer finally wore out after three days of plowing through the nose beard. I&#x27;m only kidding, it must have lasted at least three years. But recently  I had to start reading reviews so that I could replace the trimmer that I fondly referred to as &amp;quot;Old Yeller&amp;quot;.  I called it that because it finally started pulling out the hairs instead of cutting them. Anyone who has plucked out their nose hairs can relate to the sounds I made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I took the 1000+ reviews to heart and ordered this Panasonic ER-GN30-K unit. Easy to use, powerful (it better be), and very cost effective. If it lasts as long as &amp;quot;Old Yeller&amp;quot; then it will really be a good deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased two of these trimmers, and when they worked they were great -- but both failed extremely quickly. The first one lasted about two months (maybe about 8 uses), while the second one lasted about 3 weeks (2 uses).</li>
            <li> It was broken out of the box. Unfortunately, I threw away the packaging before using it so I had to throw the shaver away too.</li>
            <li> Great product for the price.  It&#x27;s cheaper to buy a whole new one than buy parts for one!  Great sale.</li>
            <li> Works great, Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I thought that this would be great as I usually have long nose hairs and I figured cutting them out would be a good idea. Instead it makes the inside of your nose feel like a cactus if you venture in too deep, which I am assuming isn&#x27;t standard recommendation, but sometimes you feel like exploring things to their limits. In this case, that wasn&#x27;t such a good idea. Cactus nose never again. Its great for getting at those easy to reach stray hairs that take it upon themselves to make you look like a Neanderthal. Keep it shallow. No deep exploration up your nose to avoid cactus nostrils.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an inexpensive option for removing that pesky extra nose hair and found it in the Panasonic Hair Trimmer. It works perfectly for the nose, and I would definitively buy again.</li>
            <li> This product does everything as advertised. Painlessly removes nose and ear hair. I even used it on my eyebrows. It comes apart easily for cleaning. I&#x27;ve only had it for about a week, so I can&#x27;t comment on longevity.</li>
            <li> It does the job - I use it mainly for nose hair. Definitely worth the money for the trimmer that cost less than $20</li>
            <li> It works ok, but not great.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for almost a year now.  The nose trimmer simply does what its meant to.  I have not had any problems with it. The trimmer is well-designed and you don&#x27;t feel it cutting when you use it.  The battery also lasts pretty long.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Does a good job trimming, it cuts like it&#x27;s suppose to, no pulling of hairs,very quiet running.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean out the head.</li>
            <li> I am glad I bought this.  Its very easy to clean, and even easier to used.  I used to strain my eyes trying to trim nose hairs and ear hairs... Now I just put this in and move it around.  NO FEAR of cutting myself or having to explain why I am bleeding from my nose!</li>
            <li> First one I&#x27;ve used, purchased based on previous reviews. Works great, quiet, easy to use, easy to clean. . .</li>
            <li> Just got the trimmer last night, Works GREAT!! No pulling or snagging on my nose hairs!! Cheap and works great what more could you ask for!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very convenient and useful little device, quite happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> Update: STOPPED WORKING - Purchase on Aug 2014.. Today is Nov 2016&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviewed in Sept 2014&lt;br /&gt;Works great.&lt;br /&gt;Better then the panasonic e471&lt;br /&gt;The bent device makes no diff.&lt;br /&gt;The head is really good and fast</li>
            <li> I love it.  A must have for everyone (male or female) that wants to be nicely groomed in the nose area or ears.  So easy to use and portable.  Runs on battery so no wires attached.  Can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t have this.</li>
            <li> Works great no issues.  The only reason I am not rating it 5 stars is that I don&#x27;t know the longevity of this product.</li>
            <li> great product, excellent quality its better than expected, great colors and it was as described product in the before buying it</li>
            <li> no fear, no hair,nowhere!!!</li>
            <li> How can one purchase do so much for so little money. I thing I paid around $15.00 for this. It does a great job.</li>
            <li> This thing is really unbalanced (top heavy) and easy to knockover. I dropped it one time and it stopped working. Don&#x27;t waste your money folks!</li>
            <li> I have used various nose/facial hair trimmer and ended up going back to scissors because they were horrible. However, this trimmer is great! If anything happened to it, I would replace it with the same thing.</li>
            <li> I makes the ugly old man hairs go away. Easy to use, and easy to clean, what more could I ask for?</li>
            <li> Very easy to use.Blades are sharp so they cut,don&#x27;t pull. Well contoured so you can access small areas,like your ear canal and your nostrils.Very easy to clean.Extremely good value.My only criticism is that the instructions in the Owner&#x27;s Manual could be clearer.I like this a lot more than some others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Received just what was said.</li>
            <li> battery life is short but works well</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas.  He likes it.</li>
            <li> This is a no frills, easy to use way to just get rid of nose hair. You put in the batteries, and your good to go. Just put it in your nose, hit the button and in 15 seconds your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really doesn&#x27;t do much for any other spots like your ears or eyebrows, unless you are planning on spending a long time feeding hairs in one by one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s awesome at the low price point. I have a spare in the glove box since it&#x27;s so small and I tend to grow nose hair faster than I do on my head. If only it would fall out of my nose too!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give this a shot. Don&#x27;t waste your money on some overpriced tool. This is all you need.</li>
            <li> Seems like a good product, still kinda new, but I like it.</li>
            <li> It works so well!  It trims and it does not hurt at all. I used for the nose and ears and I am so pleased!</li>
            <li> Love this thing. So much better to use than other products i have owned.</li>
            <li> Best of the best.  Works better for ear/nose hair than any other shaver I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Very comfortable, with smooth contact areas, and no blades to feel.  We enjoyed ours so much, we bought one for my dad.  Can&#x27;t beat the price here, either.</li>
            <li> Sticking a small rotating metal object in your nose can be a little scary.  Well this little piece of magic is like a vibrator for your nose yet removes the thick bush you have growing up there very easily and pain free but it does tickle.  Once your nose is hair free you will be able to breathe easier and have less boogers caught in the thick bush.  Cleans easily, battery changes are very simple and rechargeable batts can be used to power this little beast.  Can be used in the shower but should be oiled after every use.  I also recommend blowing the nose trimmer out after each rinse so water does not rust the blades.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Great price!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li> great product well worth the money</li>
            <li> Did not work!!! &amp; I did not feel that it was worth it to return it as it was cheap to start &amp; I would have to ship back.</li>
            <li> This Is Just a Great Product. Mine got to be over 4 years old. I replaced it and boy it&#x27;s as good as new. lol&lt;br /&gt;Seriously for the money and quality. There no other way to go. I&#x27;ve had one with a expensive laser light from a catalogue.&lt;br /&gt;This product works better than any and is the best deal. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Is not Comfortable to use</li>
            <li> works well and cleans easily</li>
            <li> Great product easy to clean  prefect</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Would order it again if and when this one goes down.  Thank you</li>
            <li> So so.  Cuts weell. The possible problem is the low quality control Panasonic now has.</li>
            <li> Outstanding.  Quiet and doesn&#x27;t pull hairs ever.  No nicking either.  6 stars.</li>
            <li> Very well designed. Working excellent so far</li>
            <li> Works great,a very good product.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 2 weeks</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I have been looking for something to take care the bothersome nose and ear hair. Buy it, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> A very good product for the price, works well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK but got to work at it to get all the hairs . Better than an older model I had years ago</li>
            <li> It is the best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  All I can say is &amp;#34; IT WORKS&amp;#34;. And after buying 3 others that didn&#x27;t, this one is AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> This product is so much superior to the old one I had.  It is amazing how gentle it is and how fast the problem is resolved.  I also use it on an occasional stray eyebrow.</li>
            <li> Works very well.  Priced right!</li>
            <li> I use the Panasonic to trim nose and ear hair. It is perfect for my need.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is really nice and easy to use. It&#x27;s taken some nasty falls to a tile floor and is still hungry for nose hairs.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well and I haven&#x27;t found any problems yet. I am really pleased with the fact that it can be used in a wet environment.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer, I&#x27;ve had it a year now, it takes 1 AA battery , It&#x27;s been over a year now on 1 battery and it is still going, I would recommend it , it&#x27;s quite too</li>
            <li> This is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> This really was a fantastic buy.  Better than I expected! I would highly recommending buying this product great price great product and it got here fast</li>
            <li> Works great!  This is the one to get.  Forget getting the trimmers that have one row of clippers going down the shaft.  Those don&#x27;t even begin to trim anything in your nose.</li>
            <li> very easy to trim with this.  better than my last one and a nice price.  I love the easy to clean blade compartment.  just rinse and the cuttings come out the side port.</li>
            <li> Works well and easy to use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good product and even my wife uses it.</li>
            <li> Does a good job. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the deal: I was embarrassed to buy a trimmer like this because I find the whole nose hair thing--the fact that I am so old that I have to contend with it--humiliating.  But this Panasonic trimmer is great!  So much so that I&#x27;m willing to publicly admit I use it.  I wish I&#x27;d bought it years earlier instead of using small scissors for as long as I did.  This works great and is easy to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> I really liked this product but it stopped working after 6 times.</li>
            <li> It works perfectly. Pain free and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Nice product.  Much better made than my previous one.</li>
            <li> Does what I bought it for; cut my nose hairs.  I hate the &#x27;stubble&#x27; feel in my nose, but I guess not as much as I hate the watering of my eyes when I reach up and rip those buggers out.</li>
            <li> This thing works great.  Wish I had found it years ago.  For the price, I don&#x27;t think you can beat it.  Also very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Wow Really Far better than the TV nose clipper I had been using. This is Fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend .</li>
            <li> Does what it is supposed to do, but the batteries run out quite quickly.  Broke after five months of light use.</li>
            <li> A gift for my son.  Says it works perfectly.  I asked if it was painful to use and he said no.  It cuts the nose hairs clean and is safe.</li>
            <li> Bought this a couple years ago and it&#x27;s still works great.</li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer and I find it adequate for it&#x27;s intended purpose. I actually bought it to trim out the hair in my poodle&#x27;s ears so I would not have to pull it or use sharp scissors. This trimmer does only a marginal job with that chore and takes many repeated tries to accomplish the task at that. Of course, dog hair and nose hair are different in thickness. For human use, this is a good product and I would buy it again if it lasts me for awhile.</li>
            <li> Like the Product.I will recommend this to other friends.Only one issue and that is AA batteries but still cheaper compare to other products overall.</li>
            <li> Awesome product works great!It&#x27;s a great value for the products price. Panasonic nailed this one. 2 Thumbs Way up. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This easily trims nose hairs, and is straight forward to use. The price is remarkably low for the value you get.</li>
            <li> I like to stay clean, and this product does it for my long nose hairs. They tend to get in the way and tickly my nose. Several people thought I was snorting the magic dust. But reality was my nosehairs!&lt;br /&gt;This little device takes care of that for me.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this as an extra gift for my husband for Christmas.  He really likes it!  He said it is the best one he ever had.</li>
            <li> Performs just as advertised and easy to clean. Does not pull and cuts with very little effort. Purchased a second one for travel.</li>
            <li> Very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> A must have for every man...</li>
            <li> Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer  it is a cool thing arrived in time also i am satisfied with this</li>
            <li> works well and will be used otften&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;glad i found online, makes shopping so much easier for me so i dont have to deal with traffice</li>
            <li> This trimmer works better than any I have owned to date.  I recommend it to others.  It is well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Got it for my boyfriend, and it is very easy to use. just need a AA battery to operate. Don&#x27;t know how long it will last on one battery though. My boyfriend loves how it works, it cleans his facial hair very well.</li>
            <li> I like it so far.  It works very well and I have no complaints.  I can&#x27;t say much more than that!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Its well made and it does exactly what you want it to do.  It cuts without pulling and thats important</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been sold on Panasonic products for years and this trimmer is another in a long line of excellent products.  I&#x27;d prefer it to have a little more power than the single AA battery is able to provide but the trimmer performs as advertised a with no problems.</li>
            <li> Amazing. Just simply amazing. Works flawlessly!</li>
            <li> This is the best one I&#x27;ve used so far. It does very good job.</li>
            <li> Nice product, fits the bill of what I am using it for</li>
            <li> Works great for the nose and ears...</li>
            <li> I had purchased a couple of these at retail stores and paid about the same amount as this one cost.  Liked the fact that this could be rinsed under water.  HIgh quality and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement/upgrade from my old trimmer. Seems to work as advertised. The price is fair and I like the cleaning option of washing the cutting head with warm water. Good battery life too.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I bought this.  Hair in these places can be tricky.  I was very happy with the performance.  Looking at the tip it just doesn&#x27;t seem like it would allow much hair to enter the cutting area.  But for nose and ears it works very well.  I keep mine in the car and trim up on the way to work.  5-star if it was just a touch more powerful and if it had a battery life / replacement indicator.</li>
            <li> Fantastic product, I use it both for nose, eyebrow, and around the ear trimming. Really good for precise sculpting without risk of cutting yourself.</li>
            <li> My husband uses it dry only and he says that even though it pinches a little, its the still the best one he&#x27;s ever owned. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> This thing is so cool!  Plunge it into the old nostrils and root around a bit.  No hair, no cuts, just smooth!  Love it.</li>
            <li> This product is just OK--it doesn&#x27;t do the best job of cutting all hairs and it can get frustrating sitting there with it trying to get everything because it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work efficiently.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, works effectively, easy to clean, small and lightweight.  Cutting is quick and clean, no pulling or tearing.  No chance of cutting your skin with it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get it wet. Worked great in the  beginning, then I washed it with water and it stop working.</li>
            <li> Works great. Does a perfect job</li>
            <li> This is the second one, the first one was ruined by moisture</li>
            <li> Worked well for the first few months, but now it only sporadically turns on. Replacing the battery didn&#x27;t work. I think there&#x27;s a loose contact somewhere in it. I have to tap it on its side to get it to turn on, and even then it may run for only a few seconds.</li>
            <li> It is a wonderful product. Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast delivery, and a very good quality product. Would not hesitate to suggest this to my friends.</li>
            <li> It does the job and gets the nose hairs. Just have to be careful as it can irritate the inside of the nostril if you get too close.</li>
            <li> This thing is just what I&#x27;ve been looking for. I&#x27;ve tried a cheaper nose hair trimmer and it did a pretty lame job. This thing can get all the hairs in my nose. Works better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> This was a perfect solution to those awful nose hairs that stick out!  My husband just loves this hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Strong enough to do the job well. Best one I&#x27;ve had. Strongly recommend.</li>
            <li> Much better than the old one I had. Cuts well while also preventing unwanted cuts. Although, cutting oneself is not entirely impossible as I just did it this morning.</li>
            <li> Works well, light weight big improvement over older 10+ year old Panasonic trimmer I had prior.  Contoured design is nice.  Not really too effective for getting those stubborn ear hairs.  For the nose and eyebrows, it works well but does not cleanly get down close to the skin for nose hairs.</li>
            <li> Once you have nicked the interior of your nasal passage by trying to maneuver another trimmer, you will so appreciate the double blade action and smoothness of this item. Well worth it!</li>
            <li> This Panasonic GN30 nose hair trimmer was gifted to me ~7 months ago, and since then I&#x27;ve had no problems with it whatsoever; it&#x27;s built simply yet sturdily, it functions perfectly and only once have I managed to \\&quot;cut too close\\&quot; (my own fault).  ...I enjoy this trimmer so much that I bought one to gift away to someone else!  I def recommend this product if you&#x27;re tired of cutting your self with scissors.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews it had on Amazon.I had a old panisonic like this one that has seen it&#x27;s final days and I needed a new one just like it.Glad I did It works great and the battery last a long time.I would buy this again.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Better than drug store brands.  It works very well for nose and ear grooming, not so effective for facial hairs. Too much information!!!!!</li>
            <li> Worked just once.  Then did everything I could think of including changing the battery.  It will be thrown in the trash.</li>
            <li> Favorite nose hair trimmer yet. Several years of use now.</li>
            <li> Seems like after 50 you get less hair where you want it and a lot more where you don&#x27;t but this thing works pretty well. I bought it based on user reviews and I&#x27;ve had it quite a while. Works well inside tight places and on surfaces. Never tugs or yanks. It does need to be cleaned now and then to maintain it&#x27;s performance!</li>
            <li> Product performs as advertised. Nice ergonomic shape. Easy to get into tight places. I would recommend this product for those interested.</li>
            <li> Works just as described. We&#x27;ll see how long the battery lasts, but this is a well built product that is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Very will made, does the job but doesnt clip close enough - leaves stubble behind. Will go back to my remington</li>
            <li> My wife got me this like 6 month ago and I can tell you it&#x27;s a great quality trimmer. I&#x27;ve bough some trimmers and Walmart which got dirty easily, and eventually it power faded even after changing the batteries. This Panasonic trimmer has been going and going, and it&#x27;s easily cleanable. This product is amazing</li>
            <li> I had originally purchased this to get rid of annoying nose hairs and found that it works very well in that regard. (Tip: be gentle in the nose. No need to push aggresively.) I found that it works well for grooming eyebrows as well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a problem with the product- it works really well.  My problem is that I can&#x27;t wrap my mind around the fact that I&#x27;ve growing older and nostril hairs are starting to hang lower than they used to.  I feel embarrassed about it.  I feel like this shouldn&#x27;t be happening to me.  I need clippers such as these to make life a little easier.  I also need to trim eyebrow hairs.  I get these hairs that are longer and thicker than the regular eyebrow hairs, and they grow out a half inch longer than the other ones.  These are the kinds of things a man in his early 30&#x27;s has to deal with.  I hope it doesn&#x27;t get any worse because this is about all I can take.</li>
            <li> does its job well. have not had any issues and its prices very well...&lt;br /&gt;would buy again. have used only a few times but it hasnt grabbed hair yet as some commented. i would think all would when they get dull anyways.</li>
            <li> he likes it, I guess... he uses it an it does job done! totally worth 12.50$. He uses it for nose and ears and is setisfied, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s good for eyebrows. anyway it was not waste of money, good purchase</li>
            <li> Great detailing trimmer.  Painless to use and does the job quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t owned a trimmer like this before so don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  Highly recommended, get it.</li>
            <li> Unit is light, but not flimsy. Simplicity in design with few moving parts make this a great product. Don&#x27;t for get the AA battery.</li>
            <li> I was tired of my previous trimmer (which took twice as many batteries) falling apart so I ordered this along with some other items thinking what the heck, the price is right and it can&#x27;t be any worse.  Oh my, it is so much better.  Only takes one battery and the quality is head and shoulders above my previous one (which was promptly thrown out).  I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> I have owned three or four of these of different types and brands and this one stands out. I found it quiet, efficient and easy to clean. When you assemble or disassemble it, you will notice how well engineered it is. Trimming that hair is a yucky task, but this excellent device makes quick work of it. Several reviewers complained that they bought these, only to have them fail early. We will see. If that happens to me, I will update this review.</li>
            <li> No problems, works well, I&#x27;m a happy trimmer!  I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone else looking for an easy trimmer that&#x27;s hassle free.</li>
            <li> It is very Good. We are impress with the product. We compare it with another one we have before and it is day and night difference.</li>
            <li> ok, i was skeptical at first..but it really works really well, i tryed it right away and it really does what it claims, nose hair, eye brows, its easy to line everything up..cleaning is easy dont even need to use water just remove the head and blow on it to get the small pieces of hair that might be in there out..i did give it 4 stars instead of 5 because it does not come with a AA size battery, i mean come on this is 2012 everything comes with a battery..lol so i was really surprised it did not come with one..but other then that im very happy with this purchase..now i will look eve more sexier if that was possible..lol</li>
            <li> I have probably had 10 nose hair buzzers over the years.  They all seem to give out pretty soon.  But, unlike the others, this one seems so well made, I am hopeful it will give better service.  The product documentation is excellent.  The unit works beautifully, the best I have ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very solidly built and good feel.</li>
            <li> This is what you need for doing exactly what you think. Getting rid of those little hairs in the hard to get and sensitive areas of the ears and nose. perfectly priced too</li>
            <li> To begin with it didn&#x27;t work, so I had to futz around with it until it did.  It was loud and did a lousy job.  Picked up the Norelco NT9110 at Target.  It is very quiet and cuts really close without any discomfort.[[ASIN:B000W405SG Philips Norelco NT9110/60 Nose and Ear Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> this product works as intended. it is easy to clean and maintain. reasonably fast delivery. long battery life. doesn&#x27;t pull the noes hairs.</li>
            <li> Sorry about the title....  Doing too many of these reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Removes the hair from inside your nose and growing out of your ears.  Cleanable.&lt;br /&gt;Better than going to the barber twice a week...</li>
            <li> I had an earlier generation of Panasonic before, and it was excellent. Unfortunately that one went missing after going through airport security. Was pleased that this replacement was even better. I would find it hard to believe spending more would yield anything better.</li>
            <li> it is nice trimmer and let&#x27;s me remove hairs from my ears without any bleeding like when i do it with my gilettes back blade on the cartridge.</li>
            <li> This IS the closest cutting trimmer I&#x27;ve used. It is also the most pain-free, and no burn, either. It seems a bit weak but it gets the job done. I use Lithium Energizers in mine. I think the motor will loosen up over time and spin more freely and seem stronger.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this product both in performance and price! I did my research and others felt the same way.</li>
            <li> * Burns through batteries: After 2 uses, a fresh battery had no juice left.&lt;br /&gt;* Not particularly thorough: Takes 2-3 passes before it trims all of the hair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend sticking this this in your nose. Let me tell you I have stuck quite a number of things in my nose but this is the only thing I&#x27;m gonna do it with now.</li>
            <li> This is probably my husbands 4th trimmer. It&#x27;s very easy to clean and you don&#x27;t have to disassemble to do it. No pulling, trims very close without having to go back several times to get the job done.</li>
            <li> I have tried similiar products with little luck.  This one does the job very well.  Great price also.  Makes grooming easy</li>
            <li> well made and efficient tool for the job.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve only had it for a week and wonder why i didn&#x27;t purchase one sooner.</li>
            <li> This works as advirtized.  It does not pinch or pull hiars.  It does not tickle.  It gets the job done.</li>
            <li> How can this have so many positive reviews? This gizmo has ZERO power it doesn&#x27;t do a thing !  I&#x27;m so disappointed !! I&#x27;m glad it didn&#x27;t cost me more than I think maybe $10 or $15 but it certainly does not do the job I thought it would and I&#x27;m not expecting it to hack through werewolf hair.</li>
            <li> Works better trimming than previous versions.  Very nice product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this exact trimmer back in college (think 2006) and it was a piece of filthy garbage back then. Unfortunately, in a drunken stupor, I purchased this online again since I forgot that it was once in my possession. I dreaded it the next morning when I realized what I had done. After having come to terms with the fact that I bought a trash/worthless trimmer, when it finally arrived...it wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. AVOID THIS P.O.S.</li>
            <li> Works as expected. Trims hair that my previous trimmers could not get to.&lt;br /&gt;The washable head makes it very convenient.</li>
            <li> Good value and quality.  I bought two so I always had one when I travel.  I&#x27;ve had several trimmers and this is the best one</li>
            <li> its cheap, functional, and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Piece of crap. The motor spins fine but it won&#x27;t spin the blade. I&#x27;ve tried replacing the battery with no luck.</li>
            <li> This product is really good.  Cuts hair without any pain.  Have had for a while and still works really good.</li>
            <li> So... I&#x27;m 34. And ever since I reached 30, my nostrils have become a forest of eager vines desperate for daylight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought a couple trimmers, only to have them unequal to the Jumanji like task of trimming my nose jungle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex. With a name like a rocket engine, I knew this thing was up for the task. And it was. It kicks my nose right in the butt, eliminating nostril-vines like a machete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every Indiana Jones has featured a &amp;#34;spinning death&amp;#34;. Ark had the plane propeller. Temple had the ceiling fan. Crusade had a boat propeller. Crystal Skull had... well I guess it had a flying saucer but that doesn&#x27;t count which is why that movie was lackluster. You must kill a bad guy by spinning death! It&#x27;s an Indiana Jones rule! Yeesh!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the point. Much like Indiana Jones bad guys must fear spinning mechanisms, so now must my nose hair fear the Panasonic ER-GN30-K.</li>
            <li> Unless you enjoy a trimmer that tugs and pulls instead of gently clipping out your gnarly nose, eyebrow, and ear hair, I would stay away.  I sadly had to say goodbye to my old &amp;#34;gross old man hair trimmer&amp;#34; that worked like a champ for 15 years. In the market for a new gizmo that would eradicate my Andy Rooney-like eyebrows, I chose these.  Sad to say, I cried like a teenage schoolgirl at a One Direction concert after using these for the first time.  If I wanted to yank out my eyebrow hairs one-by-one, I would enlist the services of Connie, the friendly Korean lady who does my my wife&#x27;s nail, as well as some other &amp;#34;grooming.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for trimming my nose hair. Haven&#x27;t encountered any problem so far, definitely much better than my previous unbranded one which I bought very cheap.</li>
            <li> Works great, not painful at all. Luckily I don&#x27;t have to use it very often but it has lasted for at least 2 years from when I purchased it.</li>
            <li> This thing is quiet and cuts close. It&#x27;s miles better than the Conair one I&#x27;ve had for years. It does such a good job trimming nose hair that I even use it for edging my mustache.</li>
            <li> Economical, easy to use, and works extremely well. Far superior to other brands of a similar item. I recommend this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to be honest, I just turned 40 and I can remember looking at my grandfather, more specifically, looking at the hair growing out of his ear and in your youth, you never think it will be you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it will be and my grandfather is only unfortunate that he did not have one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried $10 and $20 versions of these trimmers, the generic kind you get at Wal-mart, they are always cheap, they always cut a little hair.  This one is better and gets all the hair on a good battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then there is the tweezer method, now even thinking about that makes me cringe, as head-lined above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So five stars in comparison to other products at about the same price and rating based on effectiveness, ease of use, lack of pain and not having weird long grey hairs growing out of my nose and ears, at least</li>
            <li> best nose hair trimmer I ever had also good for ears and being waterproof helps it you need this type of thing</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a few different brands and styles of trimmers and this one is the best so far. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to quickly and painlessly, &#x27;nuff said. They&#x27;ve also designed it to be easily maintained/cleaned.</li>
            <li> I put the battery in for the first use and the on/off switch does not work. I can not turn it off.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He says he likes it MUCH better than the one he had before. It was a different brand than this one. He is very happy with this trimmer!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nose trimmer; There are only two kinds, manual and automatic, and this is of the automatic flavor. Manual nose trimmers appeal to those who may use DE razors (like me) but often get horribly reviewed because they end up grabbing and tugging like a vice rather than simply scrubbing away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opting for automatic, I got this one, as there isn&#x27;t many other options out there. It works fine, is built to be washed (thank god - I had another one that got rotted smelling quickly because it wasn&#x27;t designed to be cleaned in any simple manner), and it cleans hairs out if you give it the time to do so and swish it around enough. Final verdict? If you have long nose hairs (whether or not they show themselves beyond your nostrils) then this is a fine way to clear them away.</li>
            <li> Every well-groomed man (and woman) needs one of these.  Buy one for the man in your life and then you won&#x27;t be embarrassed when out in public....of course, you have to get them to ACTUALLY USE IT!!!  HAHAHA</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year and I absolutely love it. It&#x27;s easy to clean, gets every hard to reach hair. It gets used every other week and still works as well as the day I got it.</li>
            <li> Nothing chops &#x27;em up better.</li>
            <li> Works great. Runs off a single AA battery. I really like the fact that you can rinse it while running and there is a port that discharges the water and hair.</li>
            <li> Time will tell. I have used this a few times &amp; it works well. I could not find anything similar, locally &amp; every one that I&#x27;ve gotten in the last few years has died on me in short order. I an hoping that this one will last longer &amp; do as good of a job. So far so good.</li>
            <li> Does the job fast and without pulling any hairs! Much better than the two others we&#x27;ve had in the past! Five stars!</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many nose hair trimmers and always been disappointed. Finally I find this one and have never looked back. The fact it cuts hair straight on and sideways is the best feature of this trimmer. It makes quick work of nose and ear hair and doesn&#x27;t skip a beat. Washing with water as it describes does work to an extent but I still pull the head off to give it a thorough clean once in a while. For the price you absolutely cannot beat this trimmer!</li>
            <li> Apparently, Panasonic is fine with the fact that the manufacturer in China would ship this product without even testing whether it would power on. Tried two pack of batteries too.  Careful examination of the warranty means I have to pay to have it shipped to Texas to get replaced or repaired.  Hmmm.  Me paying more than everyone elses&#x27; purchase price to repair a product that never worked?  Sounds like there are lots of positive reviews. Shame I never got a chance to experience the product.</li>
            <li> Just as I would expect from Panasonic, a well made simple tool.. Most of these last a year or so,  so I&#x27;m curious how long this will last.</li>
            <li> Totally love this trimmer. Stick in nostrils and feel the ease of comfort of having your nose hair being clipped in a non-abrasive manner. I recommend this Panasonic unit over most models.</li>
            <li> Motor spins fast, does quick and efficient job. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> My dad love this I bought it for Father&#x27;s Day!!!! Thanks</li>
            <li> My husband has the tolerance level of an infant when it comes to pain, so he was skeptical about a nose hair trimmer. I promised him that this had great reviews and he gave it a whirl. It was quick and easy to set up and use. It took about 10 seconds to get rid of the hairs, and he didn&#x27;t feel a thing. It&#x27;s small and quiet too!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and the results are amazing. I have used other brands with good results but if i were to buy a nose trimmer again for any reason, i would buy this. I was a little doubtful about how this product can trim my eye brows but after using it, i am pretty pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> made in China . easy to use and clean .</li>
            <li> I have used this for a year, and it has worked reliably without breaking. I like that it is very easy to keep clean and hasn&#x27;t had any damage from getting wet.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean but wish blades were sharper. Had hairs pull a couple times but other than that product is great!</li>
            <li> It trims effectively and does not pull or hurt. The design is good and allows for easy use. Its also easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Really good and essential thing for every man. Works great and doing it&#x27;s job just perfect!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 4 years now.  Still works fine. I use it about once a week for ear and nose hair.  The wife uses it about once or twice a month.  We both break it down and give it a good cleaning after each use.  So yea, it does see what I would consider normal, frequent use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not the highest quality trimmer, but the price is right, gets the job done well, and lasts a good amount of time, making it a &amp;#34;buy&amp;#34; recommendation.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work well - hard to fit into a nostril and doesn&#x27;t cut all the hair in its way - frustrating</li>
            <li> My old nasal trimmer stopped working, so I replaced it with this Panasonic ER-GN30-K, based on good reviews. I can&#x27;t believe how much better this Panasonic works. This one seems to cut any hairs instantly, whereas my previous trimmer seemed like you had to keep going over the same area again and again to finally cut the hairs. There is no pulling, or discomfort. The trimmer rinses out in a few seconds under running water. It&#x27;s so nice to see a product that works the way it&#x27;s supposed to for a great price. It seems silly to worry about nasal and ear hairs, but I actually look forward to trimming them with this product.</li>
            <li> Good quality product. Easy to hold and use. Works well and was decent value for the price. A little bigger than a thick marker.</li>
            <li> Love it, works fine. first few times got a little cuts but when you use to it it works good.</li>
            <li> Love this gadget. Works great!&lt;br /&gt;Really does the job.&lt;br /&gt;Say goodbye to tiny scissors.&lt;br /&gt;Wish I could attack most men with this miracle trimmer!</li>
            <li> So I have only used it a few times, and it does what it is designed to do. Doesn&#x27;t feel like I should expect it to last a very long time. The price makes it worth it, and super easy to clean. I would say go for it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works and is lasting longer than others purchased in my family in recent years. I would purchase it again when needed.</li>
            <li> Immediately after buying this I was really impressed by how well it worked.  It&#x27;s completely painless and quick and removes all visible hair.  However,  a year after buying the device it stopped working.  I will not buy another.</li>
            <li> A review a product is essential for other s who are interested is buying it. It does help with the process.But there is a limit. this is an item that I trust anyone who would purchase it knows what it does. Is an in-depth review necessary. Come on Amazon filter it so that reviews apply to a product that could actually benefit from one!!!!</li>
            <li> Wacks that hair off/in ears good.  Tickles the nose a bit when routing out all the hair, but the look on my face while doing so amuses the wife so it&#x27;s all good.</li>
            <li> Great product. My fiance loves the trimmer, and has no complaints. He also uses it to keep up on his eyebrows and finds it works well for that too.</li>
            <li> Great product, super easy to use, just turn it on and go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe would be the claim of a facial hair trimmer.  Not sure how short people are going with their facial hair, but it&#x27;s pretty well useless unless you want a very very short stubble.  Other than that, does what it says, compact, great battery life, well done!</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something that could trim my nose and ear hair and this one does the trick.  And I like the fact that you can rinse it with water.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, works well and now it is so much easier and quicker to get rid of unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Fast, easy and quick way to get rid of annoying nose and ear hair. Be careful though, these tiny blades are very sharp.</li>
            <li> Luckily I&#x27;m not a hairy guy, but the occasional tickle in my nose drives me CRAZY.  Other shavers have just SUCKED - didn&#x27;t work, or hurt to use them.  This thing doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, it cuts fast and clean. Finally!</li>
            <li> I love using this trimmer.  My old one would cut my skin and this is a fantastic product.  I had a difficult time to get the battery to take, but once the metal connections within the battery compartment was stretched, I&#x27;ve had no problems and it is great for the price.</li>
            <li> Without going into gory details, lets just say I bought this for my husband as a gift to MYSELF!  The alternative it to become an expert at braiding!  Get it for your man!  Don&#x27;t walk....RUN!</li>
            <li> Good product.  I bought this because of all the positive reviews and I needed an upgrade for a nose hair trimmer.  So far it gets the job done without any problems.</li>
            <li> My reviews are usually very good....this barely works. Should have known.  To actually get rid of any hairs, it took repeated attempts. I&#x27;ll buy a better one soon....</li>
            <li> Never thought I would write a review about a nose hair trimmer, but hey, here it goes. I did way to much research before buying this one, but it works very well indeed.  Much better than the Wahl I had before which seemed to slow down quite a bit. That&#x27;s all I can say about this.</li>
            <li> Some other trimmers can make you feel like Arnold in that scene from the original Total Recall, in which he extracts a homing device from somewhere in his upper nostril.  This isn&#x27;t one of those trimmers; its shape prevents you from exploring the nether regions of your sinus cavities.  However, if you have deep nostrils (Who really knows this about themselves?), you might want to consider something with a longer end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at this product closely.  Zoom in.  The tip&#x27;s small openings are somewhat less effective than an exposed cutting mechanism, but also less painful.  It takes some finessing to get all of the hairs, but with a little patience, it happens.  This product isn&#x27;t meant for longer hair, but it catches stubble easily, so use it every day or two, for a minute or two, and you&#x27;ll be happy with the results.</li>
            <li> ... but here I am anyways. I have been using a Remington brand trimmer for the last few years but always dreaded it. It had a brass head on it which was pretty thick. This translated into hairs not getting trimmed as close as I&#x27;d like. It also had a problem of corrosion buildup on the battery contacts, resulting in a power drop to the motor. This meant that I&#x27;d always have to keep a super fresh battery in it, and was constantly dealing with low motor speeds and pulled hairs. Ouch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is a very nice improvement. The trimmer head is a thinner metal, so the hairs get trimmed much shorter. It also doesn&#x27;t have the problem of corrosion buildup on the battery contacts, so I always get fast speeds. There isn&#x27;t a lot in day to day life that&#x27;s worse than pulled nose hairs and I&#x27;m happy to say that I am now free of that experience. It&#x27;s also a nice touch that you can open up a port to help water flow through and rinse this out. It&#x27;s good on ear hairs and trimming up facial hair, as well. Ah, the joys of aging.</li>
            <li> I bought one of these for my boyfriend and one for his father for Christmas and not only is it well worth the money, it&#x27;s very well made and good quality. They love it! I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;m getting old, but this is definitely needed for those annoying nasal hairs, works much better than others I&#x27;ve owned, but has a hf buzz so it tickles a bit.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 others before for my husband and they were not good. the last one was usd12 at Ross, and it was not working. i gave up. After reading the reviews, decided to try this one and, wow, perfect!</li>
            <li> This product is great for soft nose hairs, and I assume ear hairs but I haven&#x27;t used it for that.  However, despite the picture of a handsome guy using it to trim his stubble, this product is TERRIBLE for facial hair.  It is just not sharp or powerful enough to cut through those kind of hairs.  I bought it to clean up the edges of my very mild beard, and instead of cutting cleanly, it pulls and cuts the hair. It&#x27;s actually a little uncomfortable.  And every time, you can hear the motor slow down as it struggles through each stiff hair.  It really needs a better blade than the tiny one it comes with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problems with this. It&#x27;s a good price and works well. I recommend it for anyone that needs one.</li>
            <li> This is a GREAT product. Since I have the old man ear hair syndrome, I needed some quality product to attack those nasty ear hairs. Easy to use, and clean. GET ONE.......good buy.</li>
            <li> the blade doesn&#x27;t get caught as some reviews state. The only thing is wash the blade and the top guard before you use it, with water otherwise you will have a black stain where ever you used it but don&#x27;t worry it comes off.</li>
            <li> I use it every now and again, Can&#x27;t say much about it. It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used multiple trimmers and this one is by far the best.  Gets the job done in multiple locations.  Reviews have led me to the right product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this now for a few weeks and it works quite well. I expected that all hair trimmers &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; and pull hair (occasionally) but so far the Panasonic ER-GN30-K does NOT. If anything, it occasionally tickles your nose! Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> The price is reasonable and it&#x27;s convenient and non-intrusive. It only requires one AAA battery. It is also pretty small.</li>
            <li> I am trying another model.  I had this model for years and it finally broke (years). I think this is the second one I have purchased in 6 months.  Seems anytime I put them in a suitcase and travel, they arrive broken at the destination broken (I am not sure why this is nor if its even related but this one lasted a month).  Two times unlucky, third time a fool, hence I am no longer buying this model, I have ordered another Panasonic.  What keeps breaking, a small black plastic nub (I find it rattling in the battery compartment and once that occurs, that is the end of the it.)</li>
            <li> One of those little gadgets that is well worth a few dollars. It works great and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This product works very well.  Each of my family members have one and we are happy with the ease of use and safety this provides over scissors.</li>
            <li> Price is good, works great, easy to clean and well built. I highly recommend this for every day use in the shower or for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several brands of nose hair trimmers but I like Panasonic and this model GN30 the most. I find that it trims the nose hair close to the skin but not too close that it cuts or irritates. The tip is a bit smaller than others so I find it more comfortable. Be careful when cleaning the tip head which comes off with a twist, you don&#x27;t want to damage the blade or plastic retaining clip. These tend to last me about 3-4 years but would probably last more if I didn&#x27;t drop it. I want to give it 4.5 but not quite 5 since I find the power a bit weak, perfect for me but I can see it having some difficulty with thick coarse hair. Use a good quality battery for optimal results.</li>
            <li> AWESOME , THANK YOU .</li>
            <li> Its awesome.  Best nuisance hair trimmer Ive ever used.</li>
            <li> Great product, exceptional price. Love Amazon.</li>
            <li> I cant tell if it is good or not, I cant get it to turn on.  I have tried regular and  rechargeble batteries but had no luck.  This is the 3 rd unit i have gotten that failed.  I tried this unit twice Philips Norelco NT3155/60 3100 Nose Trimmer  as well, it worked once each time before failure???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will need to pluck (ouch)</li>
            <li> would you believe that this is what my wife requested as a holiday gift....When she opened it , OMG she was so exited! she ran the the bathroom to try it out. I laughed until I used it also... This thing is really great. NIce sharp (protected ) blades - does a great job.</li>
            <li> Product is not good. Used only few times. It&#x27;s not working now.</li>
            <li> Gets rid of those pesky nose hairs. Use it maybe once every two weeks and they are unseeable now. Cant believe I use to actually pluck them....</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked way better than one I had for several years prior. Too bad it died in less than two months after only being used a few times. Really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Love it, easy to use and efficient.</li>
            <li> Work best for nose hair-  can be used for ear hair.  They work better than other clippers I have purchased in the past</li>
            <li> Does the job with minimal effort.  Love that it has a slight curve making it easier to operate.  Also has a water rinse feature where you move a knob to a setting and place it under running water to clean it out.  Love it  and great price too.</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer does, in fact, trim nose hairs. I like that it doesn&#x27;t pull on the hairs put cuts them making the hair removal pain free. The long battery life is also a great plus. For those interested, it is lightweight and has a good curve to it that makes using it a pleasant experience. I docked one star because, for the price, it seems odd that it doesn&#x27;t have any attachments or side burn trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is so easy and convenient to use that my man no longer neglects his nose and ear hair. Happy me!</li>
            <li> The trimmer seems ok.  I need to really use it throughly. However, it does seem to be a needed device I would suggest&lt;br /&gt;to others.</li>
            <li> Not as noisy as most. Cuts good, but it&#x27;s new. One battery powers this unit. Could use a little more oomph.</li>
            <li> Good product, battery lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Amazingly this nose trimmer just worked the first time. I received this item around one week ago (Today: Jan-28th), once I opened the box I realized that this item is very poorly made. The material is soft plastic, in fact: not the best materials...but you can rarely expect something better for this price (except for Gillette Fusion Proglide Styler!! this thing rocks!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this nose trimmer this morning, and for my surprice it did not worked at all. I checked the (new) batery life and was fine. I tried with another batery and the same results. This thing just dont work. I dont recommed this at all.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is far superior to the tiny fingernail scissors I used to use to trim nose hairs. I wish I had purchased this way back when my wife said &amp;#34;Please do something about your nasal hairs before I braid them!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Gets rid of those annoying nose hairs..... ever so gently and effectively !!! Washes clean very easily as well !!</li>
            <li> nice to use and valuable&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it can be washed directly by water.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean and wash.</li>
            <li> Heavy duty nose hair trimmer actually goes in and does what it is made for.  Cuts&lt;br /&gt;nasal hair with no troubles.</li>
            <li> This works well, there is not much to say because it is a nose trimmer.  It doesn&#x27;t yank the hair and it seems to cut it.  I haven&#x27;t heard anything negative from my husband.</li>
            <li> Does its job as a nose hair trimmer and easy to clean. My husband has no complaints about it and I&#x27; very grateful for it</li>
            <li> I had a Panasonic nose trimmer before this, and it worked fine! After a while, though, it stopped working because of too many hairs getting trapped inside, and my cleaning it out would not get it back to full operation. This product addresses and fixes that problem with its cleaning switch. So easy to use! I would concur with others that using a strong double A battery as opposed to rechargeable or cheaper batteries is a must. Less room for error (and pain!). So simple to use, quick and painless.</li>
            <li> Like the shape of it The power of it not too noisy. I like it because you can use it wet are dry</li>
            <li> Does it&#x27;s job well and quickly.  Only con is it feels cheap but then again that makes it very light and portable for travel.  Cleaning it is a breeze.  Takes AAA batteries which means no need to worry about using a charger.  I&#x27;ve had it for half a year now without a breakdown but even if it does it&#x27;s very inexpensive and easily replaced.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, and have a bit of nose hair, you will only be doing yourself a favor by purchasing this device. I bought this little guy on a whim years ago and it has served me perfectly. The battery lasts seemingly forever. It doesn&#x27;t clip skin or pull hair. It&#x27;s easy to clean but MOST importantly, it works! Now, I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair in my nose or ears, as I&#x27;m only 26 (perhaps more is coming?) but every once in while I get one or two hairs that start to tickle my nose. It&#x27;s incredibly aggravating and this things has become so undeniably worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely don&#x27;t hesitate if you&#x27;re having the problems I am. It&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent grooming tool for an affordable price.  It is not loud, it is very easy to use and effective.</li>
            <li> Item is POS already quit working!Just past 30 day return policy! Return policy should be 90 days on this type item. What a waste I will go back to stores that have 90 returns.</li>
            <li> Gave this to my husband as a gift and apoligized for giving it as a gift.  But he thinks it is the best gift ever.  States it is gentle at removing hair and does not hurt.</li>
            <li> Only used it twice so far - for nose hair removal. But, for what it is, I cannot imagine a better product.</li>
            <li> This works very well and does not tug or cause any discomfort.  Definitely recommend for anyone looking for a basic and effective trimmer.</li>
            <li> After years of battle against facial hair i decided to buy this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy so far with it, it takes no more than 2 minutes to remove every unwanted hair from my nose or ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It uses 1 AA battery which is fine and lasts for many sessions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design is good, operation is comfortable, it is easy to clean, price is a bargain.</li>
            <li> Cheap product but it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do.  I&#x27;d recommend it.  Fits well into your hand and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer for the price. I like that its ok to rinse off and runs on batteries.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it to anyone&lt;br /&gt;Get one today</li>
            <li> Exactly as described!!!! As you read the product info, you always wonder if products like this are what they describe them as.  This one is.</li>
            <li> Used few different models before this one.  This one does the job smooth and without any pain in hair removal.</li>
            <li> Got tired of poking myself with the small scissors I used to use. This works well with no hassles. The price is right too. I wish I would have purchased one long before now; then maybe my friends wouldn&#x27;t be calling me pokey nose.</li>
            <li> I have tried many nose trimmers over the years and this is the best one I have ever discovered for this price range.</li>
            <li> Good item for the price does exactly what I wanted it for. Would recommend it to others, the only thing I have a problem with and guess its like that with all products of this nature. Wish it cut better. You have to work at it to work. But still does the job</li>
            <li> Not a bad product for $13. I bought a couple of $10 trimmers before and the all stop and snag nose hair even when the batteries are new...not a very fun feeling.&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex does the job well, no pulling, no snagging and it only uses 1 AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it&#x27;s wet/dry - easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---- Update: July 2014 - there is now pulling &amp; snagging...the motor is also noisy. It lasted a good 1.5year. Time for a replacement.</li>
            <li> I have had this hair trimmer for about a month. It works as I expected. Nothing to complain. But I am not sure how long it is going to last.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean. Very dependable and does a great &#x27;cleanup&#x27; job. I especially like the way you just run it under the faucet to clean. I purchased this to replace an old Wahl unit and this one does a lot better of a job.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it didn&#x27;t pull at the hairs like some shavers do. I love it! I love it!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for ear and nose hair which I find disgusting as he is 61.This is much better than anything he has&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;tried before! I would highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Unlike others that I have tried over the years, this device actually works to cut the hair out my my nose without pulling them out like other such products.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband when he asked for a noise hair trimmer for Christmas. (We&#x27;re such romantics! Ha!) He was thrilled with this little trimmer and has used it with great success and he&#x27;s also happy that I won&#x27;t be ripping out anymore stray ear hairs! It trims well and you can hear it cutting the hair. He&#x27;s used it on nose, ears, shaping eyebrows and even to keep his sideburns cleaned up. The end part does get a little warm if it&#x27;s been running for a minute or two but doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s something that will hurt you.</li>
            <li> Other trimmers require you have to see what you are doing.This one you use without having to use extra mirrors. Only wish it came with batteries included.</li>
            <li> I have owned three of these kinds of clippers. This is the first one to work consistently. It works best on dry hair. There is little if any pinching. Not prefect, but I would get it again.</li>
            <li> I like how it doesn&#x27;t make much noise.  It works well on the nose but not on eyebrows.  One thing though, is that mine is used and there is scratches on it, I guess someone bought it and returned it to Amazon and they just gave it to me.</li>
            <li> I have only used it once, but it seems to work very well. Happy with my purchase and would recommend to a friend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended, practical and easy to use, also is also to clean, this article need to be presentable to us.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer really works well for trimming those pesky nose and ear hairs.  Good product for the price. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the creme de la creme of nose hair trimmers! Powerful, yet quiet. Use wet or dry. Nose hair, ear hair, even the random hair in an odd place of your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do it, your significant other will thank you.</li>
            <li> met expectations aaa aa aaa aaa aaaa aaaa aaaa xaaaa aaa aaa aaaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaa aaaxaaaxaa aaa</li>
            <li> The product is exactly I was looking for. No hurt to cut hair. It&#x27;s also easy to clean. I recommend this one to anyone!</li>
            <li> Its just a nostril trimmer but it is the best one made. Fast and quite. Greatconstruction . Seems like it will last a long time</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several of these devices over the years and mostly by Panasonic.  Past experiences have been a mixed bag.  They all worked okay, but I found I had to go over and over the same areas to get all the hair and they all eventually burned out to the point where it was pulling the hair out rather than cutting it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first time using this model I was instantly impressed at how good it was working.  This thing is like a lawn mower through hair, no pulling, and gets everything in just a few passes.  It sounds powerful and keeps running at full steam the entire time.  Other models always seemed to fluctuate in power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far I feel this model is the best of them all. Fast, powerful, and no pulling.  Perfect.</li>
            <li> This works OK.  I wasn&#x27;t fully satisfied with the nose hairs that were still in my nose after whirling this thing around a few times.  After using this I still pulled out the tweezers....</li>
            <li> The trimmer is good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it can be washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just misses the bag that is coming with the ER430K model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;Rodi</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This trimmer is just perfect for the nose, ears, and eyebrows.  It performs as advertized and is a super value.  I was a bit surprised at the quality given the very reasonable price.</li>
            <li> hubby says it works fine.  No problems to report.  Likes the waterproof feature.  Cuts that unwanted hair and does what it is supposed to do.</li>
            <li> Got this based on all the positive reviews here, and it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  Nice sharp blades easily cut hairs.  It&#x27;s easy to rinse off.  And the cap actually stays on tight, which was always a problem with the ones I&#x27;ve owned in the past.  Takes 1 AA battery, not included.  Feels nice in the paw.  Good build.  Should survive accidental drops and normal wear and tear.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this stuff. This is a very trustworthy shops. I&#x27;ve been using the 2 mouths. i will note the store.</li>
            <li> Does not trim well at all...do not waste your money on this model.  Other Panasonic trimmer that I have purchased have performed well.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had any problems with this thing. Cleaning is relatively easy, the seal around the battery compartment has held so far, and the unit does its job.</li>
            <li> NO!!!!  It works great when it works.  I bought 1 &amp; it died within a month.  O well so I bought another &amp; it died within a month, Amazon replaced with another that died within a month.  I&#x27;m a pro-Amazon customer so this is a true review.  So out of 3 purchases of this product, they all quit working in a month  FIND ANOTHER</li>
            <li> Just tried once. Very nice product. Runs on one AA battery. It works perfectly, no pulling the hair, so no discomfort of any kind. Easy cleaning too. Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchaed it on December 12, 2012 and it is not working now (Feb 24, 2013) .  I even changed the battery and it&#x27;s totally dead.  Bad purchase.</li>
            <li> *&lt;br /&gt;(Please rate this review if you find it helpful)&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was i looking for?/Why did i buy it?:&lt;br /&gt;  I first thought of getting a nose hair trimmer during the flu season and my best friend told me how amazing his was.  I decided i would give one a try.  I just wanted a basic one that would trim the nose hairs and i could use wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Impressions:&lt;br /&gt;  When i first opened this, i was shocked at how small and light the unit is.  It fits very well in your hand and it weighs almost nothing which is great if you want to bring it on vacation. I put in the batteries and fired this thing up and i could barely tell that it was on.  This thing runs very quietly and smoothly that i was not at all worried about jamming this into my nose.  After about 5 minutes of different directions and patterns, i was able to get 95% of my nose hairs and i could immediately notice a difference.  I just felt so much cleaner and i could breath a bit better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;  fits well in hand&lt;br /&gt;  lightweight&lt;br /&gt;  small&lt;br /&gt;  runs quietly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;  slight odor when you trim you nose hairs but i&#x27;m pretty sure thats just from the hairs.  I don&#x27;t think it has anything to do with the product itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall:&lt;br /&gt;  Overall, this was a great purchase.  My girlfriend has noticed the hairs being removed and she says it gives me a cleaner look.  While this is something that most men think is \\&quot;unmanly\\&quot; to do, just do it and you will feel better.  No one has to know that you bought it.  Just hide it in your sock drawer and no one will ever no.  This is a great product and everyone should have the opportunity to know that it works and i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly well, I recommend to all.&lt;br /&gt;The option of washing with water is very good.&lt;br /&gt;Very light and works qith only one battery</li>
            <li> I got to use this about two times before the motor died. I am now looking for a different brand as I would not trust another Panasonic trimmer.</li>
            <li> the  Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer does an okay job but not as thorough as I would like.</li>
            <li> my husband liked this product so much he started using it not only for his nose hairs but for his eye brows.  i turned around and immediately purchased one for my dad.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;quick and close trim&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Will not stop nostril hair growth&lt;br /&gt;was not free&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to anyone looking to buy a trimmer.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant to try this because I couldn&#x27;t believe that it could trim hairs without pulling and hurting. But after reading the reviews and seeing the low price I decided that it was worth giving a shot. So glad that I did. No, it doesn&#x27;t trim right down to the skin level, but that&#x27;s not necessary, and not even desirable. It&#x27;s so easy to use that about 60 seconds once a week or two is all that&#x27;s necessary. I hope it holds up because I will use this for a long time.</li>
            <li> This product works so well, I even used it on my eyebrows!! I have never had a trimmer remove as much hair as this one does with such little (NO) pain.  $14.99 very well spent!!</li>
            <li> Gentle.  Works great for my husband.</li>
            <li> Actually trimmed nose hair that I had ignored for a long time. Does not cause any kind of pain as I thought it might. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> Works good. No complaints. Not sure what other thing to mention</li>
            <li> I am 100% happy with this thing.  It works incredibly well and doesnt cut or tickle my nose at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my parents and It stopped working within a couple of weeks. Very fragile as well. As they say \\&quot;you got what you paid for\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It has a neat little shape to it.  It&#x27;s much smaller than my previous one, by Conair (junk).  It takes one AA battery.  I only had a used battery, so I installed that and went to work.  It cuts beautifully.  The dual cutting system is not just hype, as I had worried.  Right away, it chopped off hair in my nose and ears that had escaped my Conair for years.  I will really be enjoying the use of this product.</li>
            <li> I had this product for only about a month and it stopped working within that time frame. I can&#x27;t recommend this item.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed. I am a bit of a burly guy and have hair, so to keep my self groomed my lady I would pluck my nose hairs. It was inefficient and painful. This thing worked fast and painless. I highly recommend this. It also feels like I breathe better through my nose.</li>
            <li> its just great buy it now</li>
            <li> I have bought other removal nose, ear and facial hair items and this one seems more sturdy and reliable.</li>
            <li> Very quiet and works well&lt;br /&gt;For the price it is a great quality of product and performs very well&lt;br /&gt;Small and not bulky</li>
            <li> It does tickle a bit but it chops all them hairs out. For the first day after, I felt like I was taking massive breaths through my nostrils. I did get used to this.</li>
            <li> This product was much better than other Panasonic ones I&#x27;ve used.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt when the hairs in your nose are getting cut.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> works as advertise. easy to clean, one battery can last 6 months.  Good product.</li>
            <li> This is a good, quality nose-ear hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> This little guy worked impressively well - for two weeks. After that the motor burned out, and thankfully Amazon accepted it as a return. I bought a Norelco product after that and am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It&#x27;s easy to use and does the job of trimming hair very quickly with no pulling.</li>
            <li> In the past I&#x27;ve purchased a few ultra-cheap nasal weed whackers and they just weren&#x27;t up to the job. I&#x27;d use them and then catch glimpses of errant hairs jutting out of my schnozzola. This trimmer has a good heft to it, and I can feel AND hear the difference it makes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had it to do again, I might go for the next model up, which vacuums the trimmings right out of your proboscis. Nevertheless, I&#x27;m perfectly satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I tried several brands during the years and found every time that Panasonic is simple the best. Totally satisfied. I will not buy any other brand.</li>
            <li> Probably the most \\&quot;useful\\&quot; product I&#x27;ve purchased in a&lt;br /&gt;long time. No doubt about it; hairs from nostrils and&lt;br /&gt;ear openings are groomed PAINLESSLY! No need to even put&lt;br /&gt;on my prescription glasses. I can think of a handful of&lt;br /&gt;friends that would benefit from this product and they&lt;br /&gt;will each receive one as a \\&quot;gag\\&quot; (but very useful) gift&lt;br /&gt;for Christmas!</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s not much to say really, its a great little trimmer. I bought this to replace a Wahl that was a few years old and not performing well. This new trimmer is great, no snagging or pulling, and the cleaning feature is great.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my dad. He hasn&#x27;t had any complaints.  It does the job.</li>
            <li> First nose trimmer I have purchased works as expected, easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> Great product and ditto delivery.</li>
            <li> It works alright, but it heats up really fast and you could possibly burn your nose or face with it. It also doesn&#x27;t trim hairs very short, so you will have some stubble left over.</li>
            <li> The quality is extremely poor on this product. I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and it doesn&#x27;t turn on. I&#x27;ve had it for 3 month. I will change the rating if I get a replacement and it works more than 10x.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Nice item.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt and I no longer have nose hair sticking out when smiling. I can&#x27;t imagine how people tweeze their nose hair. Every time I do it, I am sure some of my nerves are being pulled but with this product, it&#x27;s painless and easy. BUY BUY BUY!</li>
            <li> This style works much better than some of the new trimmers I have tried in the past, the Panasonic is still working great</li>
            <li> works as it says it does.</li>
            <li> I have had this for about a month now and it has done an excellent job trimming hair. It does as advertised and is easily cleaned. It is nice to have a product that does what it is suppose to and for the price.</li>
            <li> Like most people seem to be saying, this is the best nose hair trimmer around.  Works as advertised, came quickly, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, trims hair instead of pulling it.</li>
            <li> I bought this for myself and I just love works great. I would recommend this to my friends.Great price and value</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer or whatever it is stopped rotating. Haven&#x27;t been able to use it.</li>
            <li> works great doesn&#x27;t pull</li>
            <li> This trimmer was not expensive but does a decent job!</li>
            <li> Old man, hair growing everywhere but on my head, and this trimmer is a real harvester.&lt;br /&gt;It works great. Nose, ears, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to. A little loud, but what could be louder than a big swatch of ear hair rustling in the wind?</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve bought this type of item, so take this review with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, this product met all my expectations. It made facial trimming exceptionally easy, with this you can do basically anytype of \\&quot;clean-up grooming\\&quot;. Clean up beard/mustach lines, eyebrowns, nose hair... Does it all and it doesn&#x27;t hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have no hesitation recommending this.</li>
            <li> All was as described!!!!!!  Great!!</li>
            <li> Hands done one of the best facial hair trimmer. I bought mine years ago and I am still using it. It&#x27;s durable as an ox and works just perfectly fine. The only thing you have to be aware of is that you have to make sure the clip is always closed when you trim and open it when you clean the inside but always make sure to close it before you start trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I say so is that sometimes it can get off if not tighten.</li>
            <li> Really nice product, very effective and solid in my hand, will probabl last for a while.</li>
            <li> I bought this specifically for nose hair, but it&#x27;s not the simple solution I hoped for. The manufacturer instructions actually say not to put the trimmer into the nostril! I found out why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time in, I was rooting around inside my nose hoping that when I pulled the device out, all the hair would be gone (a reasonable expectation, I thought). Instead, half the hairs were still there, particularly the hairs that hug the nostril wall. So I went back in, closer to the sides of the nostril this time, and cleaned out as many more hairs as I could bare. (The trimmed hairs fly into your nose and make your eyes water, it&#x27;s about as pleasant as chopping an onion.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next day I woke up and blew my nose only to find blood all over the tissue, from both nostrils. Obviously the blade had trimmed more than just the hairs in there. I felt mild stinging in my nose for the next few days while it healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lesson learned: this trimmer is for people who have nose hair growing _beyond_ the nostril opening. Proceed with caution, don&#x27;t let the tip of the trimmer touch any skin. And most importantly, don&#x27;t expect this device to completely eliminate your nose hairs, because it won&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Purchased this Panasonic Hair Trimmer in June, 2012.  Used very infrequently at 2nd home....perhaps three times.  Unit no longer works, regardless of how many new batteries I put in it.  Will say it worked well the three times I used it.  BUT as it has died after three uses, I cannot recommend you buy it.</li>
            <li> When I opened the smiling box, my girlfriend seemed way more excited about this than I was. We&#x27;re an... adventurous... couple, so she was disappointed to learn that, while battery operated, this is only a nose and ear hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the first impression, or maybe because of it, I really like this trimmer. I had an older model Panasonic for about five years that finally burned out on the nose and ear puberty I&#x27;ve been combatting since I hit my 30&#x27;s, so I feel good about the reliability of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It cuts quickly and without tugging out the nostril roots, which can make a burly man tear up something fierce. From experience, if you find your nose trimmer pulling, it&#x27;s time to replace or charge the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the washout feature: I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of running this in my head holes while I&#x27;m waiting for the water to heat up in the shower and flush it out before getting to the latherwork. I&#x27;ll probably like this feature a lot more once cold and flu season arrives: I&#x27;ve always anguished when I couldn&#x27;t trim my nostrils when suffering a stuffy nose.</li>
            <li> ... it works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Well, overall it works and great build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a few downsides:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The design could have been simpler. All covers close/open are rather confusing and w/o a proper look, u might damage the cover.&lt;br /&gt;  U certainly have to be awake when using this even in the early morning u just woke up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The tip which u insert into ur nose gets very warm during trimming.&lt;br /&gt;  So hot and it makes u uncomfortable and worrying!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit (4th Jan 2013):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The internal seems to emit some kind of foul smell (smells like something rotten to be exact)&lt;br /&gt;Believed it was water sipped thru the head during cleaning and its internal has gone rusty, hence the foul smell!&lt;br /&gt;And gosh, it smells really bad whenever i opened the battery compartment!!!!</li>
            <li> Remarkably effective as well as very quiet product.  I feared that a product this cheap couldn&#x27;t work well.  I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li> I bought this one because of the reviews and my other thing I used was to loud. This thing works great is quiet I can use it inside my ears and is not to loud. Wish I bought it 10 years ago. This would make a great gift - but probably for a relative a friend my think your kinky ???</li>
            <li> I was a bit scared to stick spinning blades in my nose. Thankfully I can do whatever I want with this thing when it&#x27;s in there and it hasn&#x27;t even pulled a hair, let alone nick me. It&#x27;s perfectly safe and harmless. It does a good job, but still has trouble with those \\&quot;tricky\\&quot; hairs. You know...the ones that lay flat against the bottom inside part of your nostril, that you can only see with a small mirror and light. OK, maybe it&#x27;s just me who&#x27;s anal enough to notice something as odd as that.&lt;br /&gt;This thing is great, though. The price is right and it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
            <li> This cutter really gets close and works great. Ordering another one. It cleans up easy too. Don&#x27;t settle for the cheaper ones.</li>
            <li> Been using the Vortex for about three weeks now and it has been working great for me.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a trimmer.</li>
            <li> After a very noisy experience with my old, shameful trimmer that died,  I ordered this one based on the overwheming reviews. And I&#x27;m very, very glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s build solidly. It&#x27;s light and small, but not too small. Feels great in my hand. And, it&#x27;s quiet. Really quiet. And best of all, it does a fantastic job, very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t recommend it more, really.</li>
            <li> works great, love it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of these trimmers before.  This one is the best one by far.  It is very quiet and does an excellent job of  trimming nose hair and hard to get at ear hair!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s noisy.  The battery life is not great.  It doesn&#x27;t do a superb job cutting nose hairs or ear hairs.  I have to make multiple passes.  It is better than the &amp;#34;Philips Norelco NT9130/40 NoseTrimmer 5100&amp;#34; if you plan to use it in your nose.  It&#x27;s not better if you want to use it on your sideburns, etc.</li>
            <li> recieved on time good quallity nice shape excelend made recomendate this product small and good keeping in hands&lt;br /&gt;good colors</li>
            <li> Wow, it Works Great for a limited time period then stops completely working. I mean it literally just stops working regardless if you replace with new batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was simply over taken by the extreme amount of positive reviews on Amazon for this Nose &amp; Ear Trimmer. I should have read the 1 star reviews as the reviewers reveal this weakness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic device is not built to last &amp; it appears it was designed to fail at a preset time period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update as soon as I find a better durable unit which actually works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 11/12/2015 6:18 PM: After much research I found a superior Nose &amp; Ear trimmer which really works &amp; appears to be a far better alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It costs just a little bit more, but it&#x27;s definitely worth it. Uses only one AA battery vs Two AA&#x27;s, features LED light to see unwanted hairs, very easy to clean unlike the Panasonic version. Plus it has a metal casing instead of cheap plastic. Best of all this trimmer comes with a lifetime warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00E4PMQAO Professional Water Resistant Heavy Duty Steel Nose Trimmer with LED light. Backed by a Lifetime Guarantee]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please click on yes, if this review definitely helped you. Thanks!</li>
            <li> The trimmer is light weight, small, and accurate which is what i wanted, plus it&#x27;s easy to clean and easy to take apart.</li>
            <li> This is cheap and its a really good product, I would not ask more than what this thing gives you. Just buy it!</li>
            <li> First, it tickles too much.  Second, it seems to miss the nose hairs that need cutting.  Third, my cheapo one does better even though it sometimes pulls and sounds noisy.  Fourth, it runs smooth, cleans easily, and looks tres cool.  In summary, meh.</li>
            <li> After seeing all of the other great reviews of this item, I easily decided that this was the trimmer I would purchase for myself. It works great and the price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. I understand some reviews were harsh on this product but I think it is one of the better trimmers sold.</li>
            <li> So far it&#x27;s good. Does the job</li>
            <li> It broke after one use. I was really disappointed, and apparently Amazon will not let me return it.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer. Batteries don&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of these all with disappointment, I have used this for a while now and it works great. It feels a bit wierd when you use it but the results are good. AND it lasts. Many others were god for a month or so then wre useless.</li>
            <li> Works great until it stops working (Lasted 6 weeks)</li>
            <li> Fantastic product for hair removal. Leaves everything trimmed with no problems and I think the motor is very strong (it sounds silly) and that&#x27;s a big deal for me. Especially when my previous trimmer was a knockoff Chinese product that lasted less than 3-4 weeks. Still works, but motor is completely whiny and trimmer just stops when I try to trim anything.</li>
            <li> Best nose hair remover I ever bought.  It is so easy to use and also to clean.  It doesn&#x27;t pull at all, and you can get the nose hairs very close to the skin.  Very quiet.</li>
            <li> Really impressed with this product.</li>
            <li> Had an older Panasonic  and this model is much better.  Great price thanks.  Very quiet and smooth.  Nice trimmer..  Ok</li>
            <li> No hair pulling at all with this thing! It literally made me laugh when I did my nose cause it tickled a little bit, I&#x27;ll take that over the hurt of pulling or being cut or pinched any day! It&#x27;s quiet, light, made well, and most important works well. It&#x27;s also washable and rinses off as advertised as well. This is great and I am very VERY pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Works better than other ones I have bought. Doesn&#x27;t pull on hairs and cleanly cuts the hairs.</li>
            <li> husband is very happy</li>
            <li> Product as described.&lt;br /&gt;I would order from this seller again.</li>
            <li> nice item, fast express</li>
            <li> Not really stoked with the nose and ear trimmer, Y? Because it broke within a month. The issue is, it&#x27;s designed to stand up, laying it flat causes it to roll off counters so standing it is the best option, till it falls and breaks because it&#x27;s made of thin plastic and once it&#x27;s broke. Eegone!!!</li>
            <li> Face it people... when you turn 40, hair shows up in places you have never seen before.  I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he uses it on his nose and ears.  It was kind of a joke at first but he does use it and loves it.  It does not hurt and he will never have to use my tweezers again.  I&#x27;d like to buy one of these for a couple old men I know that have hair growing out of their ears.  &#x3D;o)</li>
            <li> Yep, I dropped it on the second night using it.  5 foot drop destroyed it.  I&#x27;m not prone to dropping things, but I was surprised when it smashed the entire metal &amp;#34;head&amp;#34;, making it useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy something better.  You&#x27;re worth it.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this. Does require a good cleaning to run properly, but healthwise that&#x27;s a good idea anyway.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic worked very well for me with no pinching or pulling. My hair is not very thick or coarse which may have been a factor in the negative reviews. I can imagine a different outcome for someone with wiry hair but for me it was very fast and smooth.</li>
            <li> it works good BUT the dag gone thing EATS batteries like crazy. i have gone through soo many batteries on this thing, and i dont even hardly use it!! i dont need a bush hog up their, so i only use it once a month. and it seems like every time ive got to change the batteries or its plucking them out like i was using tweezers. if u have re-chargeble batteries its probably not bad.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect much based on the price.&lt;br /&gt;I only this unit because it was rated so high.&lt;br /&gt;Exceded my expectations; should have bought it sooner.</li>
            <li> Even on a single AA battery, it works at full speed. I haven&#x27;t tested its water-resistance yet, but its design is superb</li>
            <li> It was quiet and worked great when I first received the item. I took the blade out to wash it after a while and now it makes a very loud noise. I read this was a common problem. Great product if you never have to clean it or replace the blade.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very quick on this item.  I put a battery in it and it worked beautifully.  I love this one compared to another I had purchased at a local store.  It is very powerful and seems to work very well.  I love it!!!!</li>
            <li> worked great the 1st 3 times -- was happy - 4th time, not power - changed battery - no power ,, checked batteries (they were fine) -- tried to adjust battery contacts, no help ... junk ! ... don&#x27;t buy it !</li>
            <li> Worked like a charm, only good for noise.</li>
            <li> I have been using these Panasonic nose trimmers for a long time.  They work great and are a great value.</li>
            <li> This is my second.  One for each place.... Summer &amp; Winter so no travel for it.</li>
            <li> Thanks for this. This is really efficient in trimming hair</li>
            <li> I got this for my boyfriend. It works great and he absolutely loves it. It doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull the hair. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect hair remover.  It is compact, but does an excellent job.</li>
            <li> The device is small and does exactly what you believe it would do. Only this is I would recommend using it on anything other than your nose hair... it is advertised with multiple uses but lets be honest and call that a bit of a stretch. Great product nonetheless!</li>
            <li> get those unwanted hairs out of your ears and nose, It works,.</li>
            <li> junk stopped workn after 1st use</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s amazing but the battery drains out too quickly.</li>
            <li> My husband loves his!</li>
            <li> Check out the manual here: http://s3.amazonaws.com/szmanuals/47bbe67db4f7c2a243d3ffe525faf71f.  Nasal hair is itchy. This groomer can only trim to the thickness of its outer blade, the user manual says .5mm. Beats tweezers because no pain!  As the old joke goes, &amp;#34;I have as much hair as ever, but more of it is in my nose and ears.&amp;#34;  This is the best personal groomer I have had owned.</li>
            <li> my nose hairs never looked better!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned 2 of these now. The first one lasted a while and like the others have said, it works very well. When it works. Without warning, a few months after owning my first one it suddenly stopped working. I figured it was the battery and tried a couple other AA&#x27;s with the same result. Maybe it was defective? I didn&#x27;t use it that often, so how could it break? I ordered a second one thinking that this was an isolated issue soon after. Once again, worked great at first. Then, a little over 2 months later, after only a handful of uses, it stopped working just like the first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After going through some other reviews, this seems to be a common problem with this model. I find it rather annoying that this problem seems to have been happening for sometime now and nothing has been done to fix it. Like I said it, it does work well WHEN it can run. But the fact that you&#x27;re buying something that will only work a handful of times is ridiculous, even for this price. AVOID.</li>
            <li> works great. every guy needs one of these</li>
            <li> Broke after not much use.</li>
            <li> Good product - use it regularly - does exactly what it is supposed to do - design is nice, light, ergonomic and fits easily in the hand</li>
            <li> It does the job, but it is not the most durable pice of machinery. In the future, I would spend more money for something similar, but better construction quality.</li>
            <li> It worked great for the first few times.  Then it just quit.  Battery replacement didn&#x27;t work so I threw it away.</li>
            <li> I am a long time panasonic user (shavers, clippers and other various things) and normally I am always satisfied with their build quality and how well they work. Overall though this nose trimmer was a huge disappointment compared to the few cheaper no name brand ones Ive had in the past. Those all seemed to work better and get the hairs cut closer. It seems the panasonic misses more hairs, I have to go over the area longer and doesnt get them cut as close meaning I have to use it more often. Its build quailty is good though and the wet dry function worked as expected. It felt good in the hand and wasnt slippery at all. But I think with this kind of product function is the most important issue and the panasonic falls short IMO. Ill continue to buy panasonic products but will just go back to my cheap non wet dry nose hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> All you need for $15 Works great!</li>
            <li> Manual is pretty bad, but works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Great price.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my husband for Christmas along with a 10x lighted mirror to really encourage him to trim. He was very hesitant to use it because he&#x27;d purchased two in the past, both of which would pull out nose hairs and cause him pain. However, now he&#x27;s used this model several times and it has never pulled any hairs out! Finally he takes care of his long hairs without my having to &amp;#34;nag&amp;#34; him about it! ;-)</li>
            <li> Broke after 5 months.</li>
            <li> Does a great job, no complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s a moment when you say: I need my nose to stop looking like a New Year&#x27;s Eve party favor. It&#x27;s at that moment that this device comes to the rescue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other moments when you say: I want to make a blended smoothie.  Sadly, this isn&#x27;t the device for you (but with the cleaning feature, no irreparable harm done...except to that poor banana).</li>
            <li> It broke in 3 months.</li>
            <li> Works OK but is too loud when in operation.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have described, it worked quietly at first, and would have earned 4 stars, but after some months it became too loud to use in my ears. I tried lubricating it with mineral oil, then WD40, neither of which made a difference.</li>
            <li> at 29 i bit the bullet and accepted that im old and i have to trim my nose and ear hair before i can start to braid it</li>
            <li> good upgrade from my last one.</li>
            <li> Stop reading this. Buy this now. How many crappy devices have you purchased over the years for general clean-up, either on a whim at Target or because you thought &amp;#34;X&amp;#34; might look like it does a good job (marketing, celebrities, etc.). Listen to me: I will be buying this exact brand and model for the rest of my life, should it ever fail. This thing is so easy to use and comfortable...Just stop reading. If you want a trimmer for your manly or womanly bits, just buy this. Now.</li>
            <li> This works as advertised!</li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer, smooth, easy no pain.</li>
            <li> Better than the garbage found at the pharmacy stores.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s simply just excellent for trimming nose, ear and hard to reach hairs.  Great price for an excellent product.  It&#x27;s powerful.</li>
            <li> This is the first electric nose trimmer I had ever tried. When first using it, I was very scared it would pull the hair or scrape the skin (looking at the top, it seems like it would).  To my surprise, it cuts really well, and I didn&#x27;t feel any hair pulling or irritation even when pressing the top against skin.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean also.&lt;br /&gt;At $15, this product is a great value.</li>
            <li> Works great on the moustache on a daily basis.  Once in a while the nose hairs too.</li>
            <li> All trimmers should work this well.  It simply does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Sounds simple, but I&#x27;ve owned other trimmers in the past that just fell short.  Recommended :)</li>
            <li> i read the reviews and persuaded decided to try the panasonic.  it arrived well packaged and so i tried it out immediately and this thing rocks.  my wife can&#x27;t believe i&#x27;m excited about a nose hair trimmer.  works well and remarkably quiet as well.</li>
            <li> Ah, the joys of becoming older, hair starts showing up in places that it never was a problem before, and this solves it. And not in a painful way, so really there isn&#x27;t too much to say. Bought to replace a previous Panasonic trimmer (which was becoming less sharp/effective).</li>
            <li> This is my third trimmer like this and by far my favorite.  Cleans very easily. Gets into all of the hard-to-reach places.</li>
            <li> I liked this trimmer. It cuts the hair in the nose in a very easy way and without even feeling that the hair is being cut. Good choice and fair price.</li>
            <li> this item does the trick at a good price,it was reasonable and came very fast. No shopping all over to find it.</li>
            <li> Worked okay until it fell apart.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned several hair trimmers, including that manual one that got all the 5-star reviews (but is worthless).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never have I experienced one that works as smoothly and trims as closely as this one.  After using several others, I didn&#x27;t even think it was possible.  Yes, it does get a bit warm if it&#x27;s on for more than 2 or 3 minutes, but that&#x27;s an extrememly minor complaint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one works so well, I&#x27;m considering buying another and storing it just in case Panasonic ever discontinues it.  I simply can&#x27;t imagine a single way this product could be improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> I really like the Panasonic ER-GN30 because it is an easy and efficient product. Easy to clean and use, trims well when you&#x27;ve cleaned it. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Works fine, low price, no problem of discomfort.</li>
            <li> Handy, light, and works great.</li>
            <li> Works great still 6 months in.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is quiet and powerful. No snagging and is easily cleaned with the waterproof housing. Just turn to flush mode and put under running water and its clean. I am very happy with this product. I replaced the battery once in a years use. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> I had a remington and it did a much better in getting the job done. I would use the Panasonic to target a particular area, but afterwards it did not do its job.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer is so easy to use.  It is easy to change the battery!  It trims facial hair very well.  It is a must for nose hairs!  I am very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Replaced my old trimmer which had gotten dull and did not have much power left in it even with new batteries.  This Panasonic is great: it is sharp, lots of power, and easy to clean.  Stick it up your nose, seriously, just do it!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my old trimmer wouldn&#x27;t work anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Straight out of the box all I had to do was put in a battery and it began working - way better than my Remington model which I got from walmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cleaned it per the instructions and everything went as expected. Nothing fell apart, nothing looked cheap. Everything disassembled easily and was assembled back together just as easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only had it for about a day but it looks like it&#x27;ll last.</li>
            <li> I was kind of worried that it was going to just rip my nose hairs out, but this awesome little machine cuts the hair like butter, no problems at all.</li>
            <li> Great nose hair cutters, no complaints.</li>
            <li> Needs a AA battery!&lt;br /&gt;Does what it is suppose to for a really fair price. It is better than getting my nose waxed.&lt;br /&gt;I just would have liked the item to include a battery and charged a little more instead of buying a whole package of them.</li>
            <li> As I&#x27;ve been getting older, hairs have begun sprouting out of areas I never paid attention to before, like my nose and ears.  This trimmer does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and does it quite well.  The fact you can run it under the faucet to clean without taking it completely apart is a huge plus.  Another huge plus is the fact it runs off of AA batteries.  WELL worth the $10 I paid for it!</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked the first time I used it, and did a pretty good job.  However, I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on after that.  I inserted a new battery and double checked the polarity, but couldn&#x27;t get it to power up.  It&#x27;s now in the trash.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean, simple to operate, gets the job done with minimal hair pulling.  Small enough to fit in a convenient place at home or on the road.</li>
            <li> Works as expected.  We&#x27;ll see how it lasts.</li>
            <li> No doubt it will cut your nose hairs the only problem is that it also tends to pull them. I dont know if the issue is blade dullness or slow rotation but get ready to ouch a little when you use this.</li>
            <li> Great shape, price and performance</li>
            <li> Better than your average low quality trimmer</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t beat this for $10.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and you can clean it with water.&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this item. Couldn&#x27;t be&lt;br /&gt;happier!</li>
            <li> It is nice and sleek and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I wont recommend for Eyebrow but for nose it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> a replacement for one lost. knew I would like, and use . price was fair , combo with other product for lower ship cost .</li>
            <li> Wow this nose trimmer blows my other one out of the water , love it I have only used once since it just arrived yesterday for me, only thing is still can&#x27;t get the hairs at peak of nose just inside nostrils like the inner rim, my other trimmer also could not get that spot don&#x27;t know if anyone else has a trick lol</li>
            <li> Very good product.  Well worth the price.  Takes care of those pesky hairs without pulling or any other discomfort.</li>
            <li> First time I ever buy\use one of these gadgets so I cannot compare it with anything. The item is sleek, sturdy, portable, easy to use, and looks good in the bathroom as it stands on it&#x27;s own base like handle.  Will not be using it often but it will satisfy the need.</li>
            <li> Works really well without pulling the hair or causing pain, like some of the other products out there.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This product is very quiet and efficient.  Works wonderful and a great price. I am very happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Does the job, I am still yet to replace the battery. I dropped this a couple times and it withstood the fall. Glad I chose this one over others I was looking at.</li>
            <li> it works but its slow, i think mostly because the unit pushes the hair down instead of cutting it so you really have to move it around from different angles in order to do a good job.</li>
            <li> Very good, I didn&#x27;t know anything like this was made until the lady in Walmart showed me one they had. I bought another brand there and went online to Amazon to see what they had and bought this one. They both do the job and now I can easily get that tickling pesky hair. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with the purchase of the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gave it a four because I am not going to say &amp;#34;I Love it&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> very good nose hair trimmer, easily get those hair trimmed&lt;br /&gt;and no more annoying nose hair. Very easy to clean too</li>
            <li> IT works! lol Well what else do you want from it? Small, easy to clean but no battery included, always a negative to me.</li>
            <li> It is very quiet and does the job efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;Is easy to disassemble for washing.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem for me is that for nose trimming tickles me and make me sneeze.&lt;br /&gt;(for this reason I give just 4 stars)</li>
            <li> I cannot believe the high quality build given the low price.  It does a great job of trimming nose hair.</li>
            <li> Okay, what the heck is up with getting older and having hair growing out of your nose and ears at an alarming rate?  Yuck!  This one works quick and easy without pulling them out by the roots, and getting all teary eyed.</li>
            <li> I got this for my hubby and he says it really does the job. So if he likes it, I like it!</li>
            <li> I am a female of the &amp;#34;older generation&amp;#34; and I&#x27;ve found this product just what I&#x27;d been looking for. It removes any face and nose hairs nicely and with no pulling or nicks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and he really likes it! He mentioned it being sharp so be careful!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again if need be.</li>
            <li> Got this for my husband because he said he needed one. I went looking at the store and had no idea which one to get so I we t on Amazon to see what other people liked. Well I ended up buying him this one from Amazon while I was still in the store since the price was amazing and the reviews were great!</li>
            <li> this is an okay trimmer. i liked the original one better. doesn&#x27;t quite seem to give a  real close shave. will do in a pinch.</li>
            <li> feels very cheaply made and it cuts slowly.  it drives me nuts tickling my nostrils.I would not recommend this to future buyers</li>
            <li> And this is as good as any I have had. I bought one recently that was not battery operated. Works fine but cumbersom.</li>
            <li> Works perfect. I had an old one and this is a great replacement. Recommend it to everyone. You will like it.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works well and meets my expectations. It&#x27;s efficient and gentle and gets the job done;) get it today!</li>
            <li> The nose and facial hair trimmer is great. It is very comfortable and really gets the job done. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Had many different models over the years.  This one&#x27;s nice because the trimmed hairs are not sharp and do not poke after cutting.  Only trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had that didn&#x27;t scratch my nostrils raw.  Cleans nice too.  Confidence the trimmer is clean when the flow-through runs clear.</li>
            <li> Purchased this to ease trimming my nose hairs, but it does not cut it well. I am back to using my trusty little scissors!</li>
            <li> This is compact, lightweight, and overall well made.  I would recommend it to a friend.  I like how it cleans and that it uses only one battery.</li>
            <li> Have purchased several trimmers only to be disappointed, some cut the skin, some pulled, or simply did not cut the hair. The panasonic is easy to use, never pulls, and does the job, quickly and painlessly</li>
            <li> I like this model more then the ones with the exposed blades. I just don&#x27;t like using the exposed ones in sensitive areas like my nose.. This one works great for that and I don&#x27;t worry about getting cut.</li>
            <li> Dropped my old one and it broke. This one seems as though the battery will last longer than the previous one and it doesn&#x27;t bite.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well,  does what it says!  My ears are beautiful!  no nose hairs in sight.  Even my eye brows look better.</li>
            <li> It really worked out real well.  The price was right and it easy to use.  This is the first time I have used something like thisl</li>
            <li> Works great, like the built-in water rinsing feature.  Overall better than the 15 year old unit it replaced.  Quieter and heavier than the old Panasonic unit.</li>
            <li> While it is early days with this small gadget, (used it twice) it seems to meet my expectations, and, after having done some prior research I am comfortable with my buying decision, which in the end, was swayed by the positive feedback of other purchasers and reviewers.</li>
            <li> I dropped this thing less than one foot into the sink and it broke. It worked well but should be able to sustain a 12 inch drop.</li>
            <li> So my husband and I have bought no less than four trimmers in the past year and each and every one has just been awful!  I took time and read lots of reviews and decided to buy this, and I could not be happier!!  This is an awesome trimmer and my husband was shocked at how well it worked.  Haven&#x27;t used it wet yet, but dry is just perfect with perfect results. You cannot go wrong with this purchase and the seller I had got it to me very quickly!</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great...if you can get it out of the package. The inexcusably difficult to open package is why I gave it only 2 stars. The package is made out of hard, clear plastic. I tried without success to pry it open. Then I tried scissors, a sharp knife, and wire cutters without success. I was finally able to saw it open with a hacksaw. Unbelievable. If you buy this for a frail old man, please do him a big favor and open it for him.</li>
            <li> I think this nose hair trimmer works very well. I didn&#x27;t want to spend too much for a trimmer, so I took the chance on buying this one. It does everything as it is supposed to, and for a reasonable price. I would recommend this trimmer to everyone.</li>
            <li> this item is a great way to clean you nose and ears that have hair in them.&lt;br /&gt;quick return on item sale.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for the task; highly recommend!  This solves an issue most people have for sure I would grab this low cost product!</li>
            <li> Still working fine after a few years of admittedly occasional use. Battery lasts a long time. No problems noticed so far.</li>
            <li> Just one more &#x27;benefit&#x27; of the aging process - hair in places you don&#x27;t really need it.  But not wanting to be one of those guys I see all the time with hair poking out of their nostrils and ears, I tried this little gadget and am quite satisfied.  It works well, is easy to clean, and is cheap enough that if I only get a year&#x27;s worth (or less) out of it, I&#x27;ll have no regrets about buying a couple more to cope with the onslaught of unwanted hirsute characteristics where I don&#x27;t want them.</li>
            <li> Pleased with my purchase. I works as advertised. Happy customer!</li>
            <li> Good Product.Arrived Promptly and as described.</li>
            <li> Works as it should that&#x27;s why I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> You will LOVE it when you first use it...but just wait!  After a few uses, it will start buzzing loudly and the tip will get really hot and it won&#x27;t cut anything.  So not happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Easy to clean.  Can&#x27;t go wrong for the price.</li>
            <li> When the unpleasant task of nose/ear hair trimming is due, you can&#x27;t do better than Panasonic.  I have been using this brand for years, and while the original version (gosh, 20 years ago!) was extremely powerful and ultra sharp, I do recall being a little sore.  This is a kindlier, gentler version, which at first felt like it had no oomph, but now that I am used to it, I kick myself for thinking that the original power mower was better.  No, this version is the improved one, not vice-versa.  Must buy!</li>
            <li> the best way to cut hair nose, use only a one baterry AA, easy to wash and clean, and cut pefectly...</li>
            <li> This is an excellent nose trimmer. I don&#x27;t use it as a face trimmer so can&#x27;t comment on that part.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I got this and it worked good.  Then suddenly stopped working after a while.  Then saw the great reviews on Amazon when I looked for another one so I gave this model a second chance.  Same thing happened, stopped working after only a few months.</li>
            <li> Got this for someone and he loves it.  He said he had 3 other trimmers and this one, by far, is the best.  I purchased it based on the reviews so I wanted to add my 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this a handful of times now and I&#x27;m extremely happy with it.  I like that you can wash out the inside with the unit on.  So far no pulling on the hairs which is what my previous trimmer would often times do.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works well, won&#x27;t buy any other.  Tried several brands, but this has been the only one that works for me.</li>
            <li> After trying a dozen different trimmer, finally found one that works. Highly recommended for travelers. it is great on Battery usage.</li>
            <li> Works well. Good quality</li>
            <li> I have some groomer that&#x27;s necessary. It&#x27;s called man-scapping. This little device is easy to maintain and takes care my unwanted nose hair (yuck). It&#x27;s still going strong after a few months of ownership. I will update this post if it brakes in a year of use. I will give it 5 stars if it last over a year.</li>
            <li> Does the job well, tickles a bit though. My first one died after a few months of not-that-heavy use, hopefully it was just a fluke. It&#x27;s not very expensive anyway, so replacing is not a big deal. Cleaning is easy, you can clean it under the tap.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.  It is easy to use and does a great job.  I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> I have had long nose hairs all my life. Now they are white and very noticeable. I was very leery with nose cutters. This product works really well! It did not pull hairs at all, I used it the day It delivered. It really tickles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am much happier now that my icky nose hairs are no longer a noticeable problem.</li>
            <li> I bought these on the basis of other Amazon recommendations and I was not disappointed.  It&#x27;s a solid piece of kit and cleans out the nose hairs without pulling.  My one, minor criticism is that unlike other trimmers, it doesn&#x27;t have a optional &#x27;hedge-trimmer&#x27; attachment, which would be so useful to keep sideburns and eyebrows tamed.</li>
            <li> 1st one lasted 6 years.  Pretty good for a $12 item.  This one works even better !!!  I highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Does whatever it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li> Thoroughly impressed with this thing. Cleans easy, simple to store. Battery lasts a while, glad I purchased.</li>
            <li> Works great can get a good quick clean cut around the chin and lips</li>
            <li> Great for quickly and painlessly trimming those pesky little hairs that grow in delicate areas.</li>
            <li> Worked good at first, but then the tip made a noise, and now just makes a loud grinding sound and gets hot/doesn&#x27;t actually trim.</li>
            <li> Awful ... Don&#x27;t waste your $$. Barely worked ... New out of the box. Started pulling hair. Had to restart every time.</li>
            <li> Nothing special to say one way or another.  It is a simple tool which does what it promises.  Just fine.</li>
            <li> As the title says, died just after 12 months of low use. It was well cared for and looked after. Very disappointed in Panasonic. Worked well when it was working though.</li>
            <li> And then completely died. I only had it a few months. Very disappointed, you would think it would have lasted at least 6 months for the price.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer and recommend it to anyone requiring it.  It cuts clean and meets my requirements to a tee.</li>
            <li> Does not cut effectively. Additionally, head became very noisy after 10 uses...so much so that I cannot stand to use it near my ear.&lt;br /&gt;Do not waste your money. cheaply made, and built to fail.</li>
            <li> Not noisy. It make cut nose hair very easy. I just use once so far. I don&#x27;t know about the power cost.</li>
            <li> Does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do. (Definitely better than risking your safety with a pair of scissors!) If you know what I mean, and I think you do.</li>
            <li> This is an extremely useful product. It works well and causes no pain. I wish that I had found it sooner.</li>
            <li> Worked perfectly for the first month....then I dropped in on the counter a little too hard and it never worked again.</li>
            <li> Cleans my noise on nicely. If it lasts that long, probably my ears eventually too...</li>
            <li> Did what it was designed for</li>
            <li> not powerful enough to work</li>
            <li> Breathing freshly and no longer showing my nose friends. Great buy, great shipping. how the heck do I clean it though?</li>
            <li> Works like a charm, my husband loves the convenience</li>
            <li> Well this was a stocking stuffer for my hubbie...he is rough on things yes...he&#x27;s a big guy yes...but this died by April and He told me Santa must have been on a budget...Buy in a pinch decent price...but we have found a much better product since</li>
            <li> use it all the time great product</li>
            <li> Piece of junk. It stopped working shortly after purchase.</li>
            <li> Does the job, but gets hot quickly. So work fast!</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Better than any other I have used.</li>
            <li> My husband reports that he &amp;#34;loves it!&amp;#34; and says it&#x27;s &amp;#34;so much better than his old one&amp;#34;. He said when it hits a hair it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s yanking it out by the root, he doesn&#x27;t feel any pain at all. So I guess it&#x27;s five stars!</li>
            <li> Broken after 1 month and about 3 uses.&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought it was great. Simple. Worked. No chargers or parts to lose.&lt;br /&gt;But it just up and died after no time at all. Definitely not worth the $.</li>
            <li> Its powerful and trims without snagging a hair. Easy to clean and ample instructions on different cleaning procedures. Seems to be well constructed and waterproofed.</li>
            <li> A quality devise that any person wanting proper daily grooming would enjoy and benefit from its purchase.</li>
            <li> it works. Well. easy to use and clean!</li>
            <li> Great for trimming your nose, leaves your nose free to breathe feeling fully energized throughout the day! IF you ever have trouble breathing, are short of breathe, exercise, and just plain want more energy, use these! Who has time these days to use a scissor for nose hairs? While almost all reviews for heavy hair use aren&#x27;t that great for this as it eventually breaks down; this is wonderful for your nose. If you still have trouble breathing, get an air filter and a good vacuum for your home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IF you are like most people and feel very queasy about sticking a rotating RAZER UP YOUR NOSE, fear not; for this is actually a very comfortable and effective tool. I would recommend this to anyone and is very straightforward and user friendly. Would even recommend to elderly that wouldn&#x27;t like technology.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and easy to maintain.</li>
            <li> This item is a must have if you are over 60 years of age. This seems to be the age when hairs of all sorts and sizes seem to appear in every orifice of the body!!&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. It works so well.</li>
            <li> So far, so good - LOVING it compared to my previous one!</li>
            <li> This product broke after 5 uses. Unfortunately, the return policy is only 30 days and I didn&#x27;t use it enough times for it to break before  the warranty expired. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I know, it&#x27;s gross to even talk about, but when you get to be MY age.....sigh....well ANYWAY!  I&#x27;ve had one other trimmer similar to this, it was a Braun, and because it was a piece of junk and just stopped working, I decided to look at something a little more expensive, and with better reviews.  I&#x27;m here to add to the good reviews.  These are actually very reasonable priced, I don&#x27;t know, maybe I just got one of the anti-lemons, but the blades seem to tolerate pretty good use, the angle of it is actually pleasing in the hand, and I would buy it again.  I don&#x27;t get real excited about battery powered items like this, because I&#x27;d prefer more raw, longer lasting power, but considering what it&#x27;s used for, and have a very heavy goatee that I shape with this, it does a great job.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t go 5 stars, but 4+ for sure.  I&#x27;d buy another one, and I think you should seriously consider this one if you&#x27;re in the market.</li>
            <li> A very compact and easy to use product. I found it a little difficult to get the battery cover back on as there are no lines or dots to use and I had it 180 degrees off.</li>
            <li> Works ok nothing to write home about...eats batteries  died after 2 months waste of money</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I waited so long to get one of these,I&#x27;ve been using scissors for a long time.</li>
            <li> Weak.  Buy a better powered version.  Good for fine / tiny hair, I suppose, but that ain&#x27;t what you&#x27;re gonna find in the tender nostrils of the Northern Outdoors Male.</li>
            <li> I use it to remove hair in nose, and it works well!</li>
            <li> Works great. Love it.</li>
            <li> Works great for both nose and facial / neck hair.</li>
            <li> Works great... stopped working after 3 months. :((</li>
            <li> Not as good as I had hoped.  This replaced a Brookstone model I had for 5+ years.  It is not as effective.  Seems like the blades spin a bit slower and tugs a bit which is not pleasant.</li>
            <li> Good s*** right here gets all my nose hairs and it works on eye brows too</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and it worked for 6 months.  I am now ordering a different one and hope for a longer lifespan.</li>
            <li> Small and works great!!!</li>
            <li> Good product but only last for a few months and then stop working.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Easy to use right away out of the box.  My daughters let me know big time on Fathers day that I needed help.  Don&#x27;t let this happen to you!  Get your old self cleaned up right now!!</li>
            <li> This works well. I had a few others, and was pleasantly surprised how much better this one works. Pretty fast, pretty comfortable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd one of these bad boys.    Pros: it cuts well, and that&#x27;s what you want right?    Cons: if you look at it wrong, it breaks.  I recently,... two days ago, in fact, bought two of these because I know how crappily built they are.    While using one, I dropped it.  It fell all of 10\\&quot; to the sink, and now is extremely loud and doesn&#x27;t cut as well.  Apparently the &#x27;guard&#x27; used over the blade will bend if you so much as breathe on it.  Good thing I bought two.    For 12$ it&#x27;s not that bad but they should up the sturdiness and charge $25 for a quality product rather than selling a crap product that works but breaks easily.</li>
            <li> not any better than any others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> This device works great. Trims nose hairs just right, is easy to clean (as long as you do it with each use) and is easy to charge and use. It trims closely but hasn&#x27;t nicked me (yet). That&#x27;s all I ask for in a trimmer, and this is one of the cheapest ones you can buy. Sometimes the simplest product is the best one. I highly recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a very good unit.. I had to buy a second one because I dropped the first one on its tip and it stopped working properly.</li>
            <li> Wow! No pinching or pulling. Just makes the hairs disappear!</li>
            <li> I was looking for a way to deal with annoying hairs that didn&#x27;t involve me stuffing some tiny sharp scissors up my nose. I resisted buying one for ages. You know, trimming nose hairs being the sign that I&#x27;m getting old and all that jazz. Boy was that dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Construction wise, this guy is pretty easy to deal with. You&#x27;d have to do some seriously mean things to it to break it. Works wet just as good as it does dry. The cutting blade is safely hidden, and the only way you will potentially nick yourself is if you crush the unit against your skin. Cleaning is a charm, just flip the ring to pass through mode, put under a faucet, and turn on. Every week or two pop open and take a brush to the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m powering this with a Sanyo Eneloop AA battery. It hasn&#x27;t had any problems with pulling of hairs or any of the other issues people have described when using rechargeables, but YMMV. It may just be that my facial hair isn&#x27;t as thick as theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a man who no longer has to worry about the walrus nose hair look, I found this to be a very worthwhile purchase, especially as cheap as it is price wise.</li>
            <li> Works but not as powerful as I would like. Does get the job done.</li>
            <li> This thing is not as advertised! It sucks!</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve been without a nose hair in your hair trimmer and this one is the best we&#x27;ve ever had I like that we can use it in the shower</li>
            <li> What can I say, it cleans out the nose hairs with no pain and it is easy to use.  Durability remains to be seen.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean. Works really well.</li>
            <li> I use this trimmer to get my nose hairs. I have used other products in the past and I have to say this one is the best so far. Works well and hasn&#x27;t run out of batteries yet and I&#x27;ve had it for months now.</li>
            <li> I have tried several of these type trimmers and this has been the best one.  I have not experienced any pulling as I had in other trimmers.  Use as nose or ear trimmer.</li>
            <li> Works well...nothing too fancy, complicated or dangerous...battery last a reasonable amount of use time...batteries go in the bottom and the hatch for them is fairly strong with no breakage problems so far.  The cutter detaches so that you can dump and clean.  I have more than a years use on this one...my last one lasted about 13/4 years.</li>
            <li> Finally trimmed my nose hair for the first time. It&#x27;s ticklish, but the blades do a good job of trimming them hairs fast and pain-free. Do remember to brush/ clean the blades after use.</li>
            <li> like the title says - it does the job and does it well.&lt;br /&gt;seems durable and has a good warranty so i&#x27;m not worried about it&#x27;s build quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve got nose or ear hair, do yourself and everyone else a favour, please use this so everyone else can stop pretending they don&#x27;t notice your errant hair - even if you don&#x27;t care or don&#x27;t know, if you&#x27;re over 40 this should be in your grooming gear kit.</li>
            <li> Not a fun item to have to purchase in life, however, when that sad day comes, this is a great item to buy.</li>
            <li> Perfect device well engineered comfortable, works perfectly good value perfectly compact I would recommend this device easy to use and clean</li>
            <li> I use this to trim nose hair, this is a pain free method of removing offensive nose hair. Get one and get that nose cleaned up!</li>
            <li> As described it works much better than the other type of nose hair trimmer. Now I wish I could tactically give to some people I know.</li>
            <li> Worked great for a couple of weeks then it stopped spinning.  It wants to spin initially after reseating the blades, but then it gets caught up on the blade guard and stops.  For around 10 bucks it&#x27;s not worth returning, but I am disappointed it stopped working.  While it did work it did the job pretty good.</li>
            <li> After years of using models from gift sets and the drug store end caps this unit really impresses.  It can run hot quickly at the stainless steel tip if you have it in the water mode and aren&#x27;t contacting water. Check the mode before you use it.</li>
            <li> It does what it says.  Works like a charm for cleaning up those hard to get to places.. Every guy should have one.</li>
            <li> Once again an Amazon store comes through, the product itself is great, fairly quiet and is what I wanted. The shipping took a while but that is the fault of the post office. Couldn&#x27;t beat the price either, the least expensive I found.</li>
            <li> Finding a decent nose and ear hair trimmer is not easy.  Some are shabbily made and fail early.  Others just don&#x27;t cut hair as they should or are designed for use by someone with at least three hands.  This Panasonic model, powered by a single AA battery, does the job and is a sturdy product.  It even offers the choice of cleaning by running water through the cutting head - a very useful idea since products like this often become clogged with hairs that bog them down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price, good product.  If you&#x27;ve been looking for a good trimmer for a while, as I did, I think this one will satisfy you.</li>
            <li> Great price, great design, easy to clean and does the job well. Runs on AA battery so thats a plus too.</li>
            <li> I have to change the battery after a couple light uses (eyebrows, nose)  ... works great otherwise and easy to clean</li>
            <li> this trimmer can be used to trim nose hair, no one is surprised at this. but, not displayed here is a conversion kit that turns it into a juicer, a coctail blender, and for the yard, a brush-hog! you&#x27;d be surprised to know that this little gadget is used on the space shuttle to gyrate a powerful telescope, and circulate the oxygen in ratios similar to those present here on earth.</li>
            <li> I read so many bad reviews, but the price was great!  This trimmer does exactly what it says.  If you want better performance, make sure the batteries are replaced when needed and after cleaning the blades, pour a drop of mineral oil, it will run like a Porsche.</li>
            <li> Works as described. Better design allowing for quiet operation, quick cutting and easy to clean. All Panasonic trimmers/shavers work great.</li>
            <li> It cuts.  Nice clean nosey and earies....</li>
            <li> Works well, cuts close with no pulling and easy clean up.</li>
            <li> I used the think perhaps 30 times over 6 months and it stopped working.  I thought I had bad batteries and after buying fresh ones it still wouldn&#x27;t work.  I decided to through it out and after one last try it turned on.  Unfortunately the blade(s) had simply fallen off and I couldn&#x27;t find them after their travel back and forth to the room where I kept my batteries. I liked how the product worked it is the durability I question. I have an old Sears electric trimmer from the sixties that has worked on three generations. I wish things today would be made as well.</li>
            <li> I had a 20 year-old Panasonic &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; nose hair trimmer that worked well.  The motor eventually wore out and so I replaced it with this larger Panasonic model.  The new trimmer is easy to hold and operates quietly.  The construction quality is excellent and I expect it to last many years.  Very pleased.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have found to date.&lt;br /&gt;Although I have not tried the &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; setting, I am totally satisfied with the product and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Makes a grooming job much easier.</li>
            <li> Best nose hair trimmer EVER!  As I&#x27;m getting older, these frikkin nose hairs have been just driving me nuts.  Most trimmers just don&#x27;t get close enough, especially right inside the nose on that septum area.  This trimmer owns that space!  Don&#x27;t even mess around with other ones...this one kills them all!</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my son and he loves it.</li>
            <li> Finally a trimmer that doesn&#x27;t pull your hair out.  Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer!  Works extremely well with no nicks.  Easy to clean/rinse after each use! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> It works well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> so far, so good.  i&#x27;ve used a different panasonic in the past which does not last very long.  the problem with both of these is you can&#x27;t buy a replacement blade for less than replacing the entire unit.</li>
            <li> This thing works just great, does not pull out hair and is quite convenient and precise to address nose/ear hair!</li>
            <li> This product does the job and is offered at a low price.  I would buy another one.  I use it for my ears and nose.  The blades must be sharp because they cut without any problems.  It cleans easily.  I don&#x27;t notice much hair left after being cut either, I think the machine captures it.</li>
            <li> Very powerful device. Fits well in your hand and works very smoothly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this review because I just cut myself again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought this a year ago and it&#x27;s been okay -- but either I&#x27;m stupid or this product has its drawbacks, because this is the second time I&#x27;ve nicked the inside of my nose. It&#x27;s not a gash, but it is a bit of a shock, and I blew out a bit of blood when I blew my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s great fo the price, but I&#x27;m writing this review to tell people that, if they found a legitimately better quality one for 2x or 3x the price, go for it. I&#x27;m definitely gonna consider alternatives.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after one day. After that it would not turn on again.</li>
            <li> I have found this trimmer to be all I hoped it would be. Fast, efficient and safe to use and it was priced just right.</li>
            <li> excellent and painless</li>
            <li> As hair trimmers go for nose and ear, it works.&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that it is washable under water after use.</li>
            <li> Works great and not flimsy like other similar products</li>
            <li> Sharp and a breeze to use!&lt;br /&gt;Unlike those multi-use contraptions that allow you to switch out the tips for various grooming needs, this one has a sole purpose...and it does that purpose the utmost justice!&lt;br /&gt;In previous experience, I was reluctant to use the included nose trimmer tips that came with other grooming kits after trying them once. Why? OW! That&#x27;s why! My experience has been that most tend to pull hairs as they cut. After reading the excellent reviews on this little gem I thought I would give it a try...and I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;It cuts like a hot knife through butter! There is no pulling and no pain even in the sensitive nostril area.&lt;br /&gt;And the bonus...it can be cleaned with tap water! It is designed to rinse clean after each use!&lt;br /&gt;If you have unruly hair that fits a tool like this one, look no further!</li>
            <li> Easy to use. About the same price as elsewhere. Very light and compact</li>
            <li> It works great and cleans up well. I think I tried to get to close though and wound up yanking a hair or possibly nicking myself. Either way, shouldn&#x27;t be an issue, just don&#x27;t press too hard.</li>
            <li> This works like an electric shaver, in that the hair is cut very close to the skin. Most other electric trimmers do not do as good a job. The trimmer is small, light, quiet, very nicely engineered and made. Using this daily makes me a whole lot more comfortable and I look neater as well.&lt;br /&gt;If I remember right the Amazon ad does not menion you will need AA batteries. Small inconvenience for an otherwise excellent prduct.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this since it&#x27;s really inexpensive, but it works great.  My husband was really impressed with it.</li>
            <li> This is the second time I purchased it, and it works really great.</li>
            <li> The item is not working properly.</li>
            <li> Bought this is late November.  Worked until early Feb., then just died.  Only used about once a week!  Tried to return to Amazon, but, of course, too late.  Junk!</li>
            <li> Excelente Producto, recibido sin problemas en mis manos. Buenos colores y buen precio Gracias por el servicio y por buen producto.</li>
            <li> A good nose trimmer is hard to find. This one works very well for me and it makes it easy to clean after each use.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t even sneeze... great product for those of us with more ear or nose hairs than the average person.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness something that gets rid of the ugly nose hairs. I am female and I think any man with hairy ears should have one of these.</li>
            <li> This is a painless way to get those hairs that would bring tears to your eyes if you tried any other method of removal.  Great product!</li>
            <li> I had an old Panasonic trimmer...something like the Panasonic ER421, and it just didn&#x27;t want to spin up very fast...even with a brand new battery in. I see Panasonic sells a model similar to that still...but can&#x27;t say if it works better or worse than this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new Panasonic is great though. Even with a rechargeable AA battery...it spins up super fast. Easy to clean, good switch on and off...works great.</li>
            <li> I know, I know ladies have this unsightly problem too.  The packaging for this handy little tool only shows men, but we all know ladies struggle with those ugly little black hairs sticking out of their nostrils as well!!  After hating 2 different drug store models that only resulted in shorter ugly little black hairs, I resorted to using scissors... OUCH!!  So I decided to give the battery operated option one more try and SUCCESS!!!!  This trimmer really works, quickly and painlessly!  No stubble, totally clean nostrils, every girls dream come true!!!</li>
            <li> Grooming machine from a renowned manufacturer. Works great.</li>
            <li> This broke within no time. Do not waste your money. There are more options for cheaper that wouldn&#x27;t stop working as fast as this did.</li>
            <li> Not cumbersome at all. Quiet motor.</li>
            <li> Love this! I read reviews and everyone said how good it was so I ordered one. So easy to use by far way better than scissors. I highly recommend this!</li>
            <li> I give 5 stars if something blows me away. A nose trimmer won&#x27;t do that, but this one more than meets my expectations. I had previously used another Panasonic trimmer that I was happy with but was discontinued. This unit trims the hair comfortably and thoroughly. Also, it arrived ahead of schdule - always a plus!</li>
            <li> I purchased despite some negative reviews.  I already own a nose hair trimmer from like 10 years ago.  I figured it was time to upgrade.  First thing I did was use my old nose hair trimmer.  Then I used the Panasonic trimmer.  Wow!  I could hear it snip snip snipping the nose hair away.  Very satisfied.  I should have bought this ages ago.</li>
            <li> Good for nose and ears. haven&#x27;t used for other areas.  no discernible feeling when used.  that is not always the case with these products</li>
            <li> Bought this for mom to trim her nose hair.  She said it&#x27;s very easy to use, easy to clean just wash the head in the running water.  Comes with a mini brush for cleaning.  Requires one battery only.  And best part she said - it&#x27;s very quiet when running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I read reviews for many different trimmers, and I chose this model due to those I read. Unfortunately they were wrong. Have not found a good one yet.</li>
            <li> Have been using all sorts of various nose hair trimmers and this is by far the best, most efficient and easy to use hair trimmer I ever used.  Will buy again from Amazon</li>
            <li> I needed nose timmer I think It is good for me In my opinion, It is also good for you guys</li>
            <li> Great, painless,quiet, easy to use device for the relief of garden variety bushy nose and ears. It is easy on the AA battery it requires and the business end can be rinsed under the faucet or, if you are so inclined, the top can be removed, the hairs can be collected and woven into a cloth for a biblical haircloth shirt,</li>
            <li> Works great.  I share the same frustrations as pointed out in other reviews and I&#x27;ve searched for years for one that actually works.  This one does.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after a month. piece of Junk I can&#x27;t recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> My husband is a hairy beast and his ear hair can get out of control (not that I&#x27;ll admit that to him - you know what I&#x27;m saying ladies).  I purchased this as a Christmas present and the first time he used it, he was amazed at what a close trim this thing gives him.  For the price, this was totally worth every penny.  If our household had use for another, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy one.</li>
            <li> No tearing nose hair!!  I had another one that felt like it was either shocking me or pulling nose hairs out. This one is quiet, smooth, and not painful. Love it!  I am a girl, so cannot speak for ear hair, but I would think it would be the same.</li>
            <li> I primarily use this trimmer for my nose hair, not for facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My nose used to get so ticklish from the nose hair it was driving me nuts. I bought this trimmer and it&#x27;s made my nose feel so much better. Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to - gets rid of unwanted nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had an issue with the tickling sensation when trying to use it (not an issue with the trimmer, just with dealing with nose hair in general), and my wife had a great tip: blow out through your nose when using it. Not sure if the distraction is what helps, or if the hair being pushed out is what does it, but either way, it works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Works great and easy to clean</li>
            <li> very good thanks for sending greetings from Venezuela all perfect very good thanks for sending greetings from Venezuela all perfect</li>
            <li> Being 28 years old, I never had to use a nose hair trimmer, and for the majority of my life I never thought I&#x27;d have to. Until, one day, I saw hairs that weren&#x27;t part of my mustache. No, these hairs had no style or elegance. They had no shape or beauty. That&#x27;s because they were coming straight from my nose...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried little scissors, but they seemed painfully  tedious. So my search began for a good pair of nose hair trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I already have a norelco beard trimmer and a norelco electric razor, I thought to myself, &amp;#34;What the hell. Let&#x27;s look at nose hair trimmers by norelco.&amp;#34; These being the only trimmers for nose hair that I could find by norelco I put them on my wishlist since it was around the holidays and received them for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I thought they might hurt my nose, but the exact opposite  happened. They actually tickled my nose at first. But after a bit they became more comfortable. It was awesome. And now, not only are the hairs gone but I feel like I can breathe better. These are lightweight and feel cheap when held but they really do the job and I haven&#x27;t had any problems in the last 3 months I&#x27;ve had them.</li>
            <li> works perfectly love this product easy to clean as a well</li>
            <li> I have been going the manual route with nose scissors which never work that well. Decided to take a leap based on these reviews. This thing does the trick that is for sure. It seems very easy to clean overall. My one concern is what happens when the blades dull or what not, I guess I can order another one at that time for the price of this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmed nose hair: Works very well, tickled at first but then didn&#x27;t. No yanking on hair or anything painful and gets very close when trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trimmed Ears: Works very well on ears as well, this was a big plus with this thing. No pain etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrows: Have yet to try that but I am sure it would do those just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very happy with the bang for buck factor with this.</li>
            <li> Best little trimmer I ver had. Good Service.</li>
            <li> What can I say? Does the job, and does it well.</li>
            <li> Most guys are not excessive &amp;#34;groomers&amp;#34;. However, we can&#x27;t walk around with nasal and ear hair hanging out all over the place. This product fits the niche requirement of removing these unwanted sproutings.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this product works as expected.  It trims unwanted hairs with no pain.  It&#x27;s a simple machine that does it&#x27;s job very well and at a great price.  Panasonic always seems to make great products that work and are worth the price paid.</li>
            <li> Works very well. No plucking or pain. Cuts very close and works just as I expected it would. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> this is the best nose clipper on the planet.  no pain, no problems, washable in the sink.  what more can I say.  love it.</li>
            <li> Product worked until blades stopped working after 3 months.  Customer service at Panasonic was absolutely impossible to deal with (confusing automated responses, getting transferred all over the place incorrectly, one group claims you have to talk to another group, etc, endless frustrating loops)  so don&#x27;t have any expectation that the two year warranty is worth anything.</li>
            <li> I only ever had it pull a hair once, and that was when I let the battery run way down.  As long as you keep fresh batteries in it your good.  Easy to clean.  Battery life is pretty good too.</li>
            <li> At first I thought this trimmer was the solution I was looking for, but it&#x27;s ready for the junk pile after 4 months of use.</li>
            <li> Very useful. I used it many times without any trouble. Met my expectations.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the little scissors, tweezers (ouch), and other electric trimmers and all of them sucked. This is the first time I found trimmers that worked amazingly well and was quick and painless. Get them.</li>
            <li> First time I&#x27;ve tried such a trimmer for my nose.  I love it.  Gently trims the hairs with no pulling or irritation at all.  Wish I had found this years ago.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and quiet.  Has a nice solid feel and it trims very well!  I Iighly recommend this trimmer to anyone.</li>
            <li> For something you&#x27;re meant to hold up close to your ears, the trimmer is painfully loud. I don&#x27;t know what Panasonic was thinking. Additionally, the product did not work out of the box the first several times I turned it on. It randomly came to life eventually and has worked since then, but I have no idea why or if it will continue working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It *does* clip hair quickly and efficiently, if you don&#x27;t mind having the roar of a chainsaw blasting your eardrums.</li>
            <li> I always thought that tweezers was the only thing that worked. I have tried other trimmers with no success. This one works perfect!</li>
            <li> This unit works as advertised.  It does seem to be cheaply made but has worked well the three or four times I have tried it.</li>
            <li> I have had this type before and found them wanting, but this one seems to work much better ! We like it and are keeping it ,</li>
            <li> Good one two yens page have hahhaa oh have using have Joan&#x27;s ghat eh hahahah Yuxuan Zune jab hand ish is. Duh USB eu he Ughh</li>
            <li> My husband liked it very much.  When he lost one before, my husband asked me to buy the same brand.</li>
            <li> This does every thing promised with ease. It is small enough to pack in your shaving kit and easily washed. Easily worth the price I paid.</li>
            <li> my husband loved this! Said it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. Said it was kind of loud especially in his ears but as long as it works we&#x27;re happy.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect that I&#x27;d have to remove the head and blade to clean, but it will probably make it last longer. Great cutting angle and performance.</li>
            <li> Works perfect, very good deal!</li>
            <li> I can cut my ugly nose hair whenever I have to without painfully pulling them out.  Also,it is very easy to clean with water.  I would definitely recommend this product to anyone I know.</li>
            <li> A very nice product, with good workings, and good results.  It is adequately built, works well, and cleans up very easily.</li>
            <li> This seems to work okay, haven&#x27;t used in wet applications yet, however seems to work about the same as another brand bought at the drug store - just a little fancier design.  Seems like an okay product for the price.</li>
            <li> It works very well. The rinse feature is nice but it takes reading the directions to understand how to use it properly. Its a bit quieter than my previous Panasonic.</li>
            <li> Works fine so far. No burning smell and no pulling. On off switch big and useful. Cap to protect blade snaps on nice.</li>
            <li> Great close cutting but once you remove the top and try to replace the blade, it becomes noisy and doesn&#x27;t work. This happened with two different units so I will never buy this again. Only recommended if you never plan to replace the blade.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have had other manufacturer models of hair trimmers, and this one by far is the best. It has worked great and we&#x27;ve had no problems at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great product!</li>
            <li> It really is a good product. I have not had it for very long, but it works very well.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a solution for those pesky nose hairs... this works like a charm and is fast and easy to boot</li>
            <li> This is a really nice trimmer.  I have yet to use it in the shower or on facial hair so i can&#x27;t really comment on that part.  However for my nose hairs it works great.  My old trimmer was slightly irritating and painful.  I assumed it was par for the the course.  With this trimmer I don&#x27;t feel a single pull or pinch in my nose and it works wonders.</li>
            <li> best nose trimer i got ever all my other ones where cheap did not last long i bet this one last me for years</li>
            <li> Works as expected, never hurts</li>
            <li> Works great, gets in all the tiny areas you don&#x27;t need hair. Has a tendency to pull sometimes and that&#x27;s not fun. Maybe it&#x27;s just the blades going dull</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s doing the job. No noise and no plucking feel. I&#x27;m still figuring out the cleaning instructions but I presume it should not be too hard.</li>
            <li> A thousand times better than the junky ones at Walmart.&lt;br /&gt;For old folks who are growing hair everywhere, ears&lt;br /&gt;nose, it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product for removing nose and ear hair. It is easy to use. I wish I had discover this years ago.</li>
            <li> Worked better than expected. Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs at all.</li>
            <li> I debated and compared a whole slew of products before ordering anything.  I tried to figure out what the BEST choice would be.  It seemed like I was going to have to take some degree of a chance regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I&#x27;m so happy that I bought this.  It&#x27;s so convenient and does a good job, quickly.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> Works very well, but we&#x27;ll check back later to see how it endures.</li>
            <li> Works great... not quite as robust as I expected, or as powerful, but generally meets or exceeds my expectations in all other areas.</li>
            <li> this is great. it works. but tickles my nose. can be rinsed by water. worth the $$$</li>
            <li> My husband has tried most of the other nose hair removal tools around, but they all hurt him. This doesn&#x27;t hurt and does a good job on the nose and ear hair. He now looks tidy and handsome.</li>
            <li> This product worked well for about 7 months. Then it suddenly died, tried replacing the batteries, but still no help.</li>
            <li> I ordered this for my husband.  He needed something to get in to those hard to reach places like his ears and nose.  He loves it.  I ordered my son one as well.</li>
            <li> Works great, good price</li>
            <li> Update - It failed quickly, not sure if I will buy it again.  I had an old clipper that worked but not that great. This one really works, for nose hair anyway. Keeps my nose from itching during the day.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is not good as the reviews show.  Since I bought it I will use it till it stops working.  It does not cleanly remove the nose hair.  You have to make some serious effort to get the job done.  I am told there are other trimmers in the same price range that will do much better job.</li>
            <li> Fantastic trimmer for brows, nose etc. the price is incredibly for something built so well and that actually works extremely well.</li>
            <li> The trimmer blade started rubbing the cover after several uses and stopped functioning. Won&#x27;t buy it again. Didn&#x27;t expect this from a Panasonic product.</li>
            <li> STILL THE BEST AVAILABLE AND STILL ONE OF THE CHEAPEST.</li>
            <li> Breaks after return period is up and warranty replacement and shipping is more than buying another, but who wants another that will only last 32 days?</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this trimmer!!</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer works like a charm.  I have had a rotary before but it did not work as well as this one does.  It makes stray hair disappear quickly and with no discomfort.  I am very satisfied with the purchase and would buy from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I think this is probably the best equipment on the the market for a man to have.  It is easy to use and to keep running right.</li>
            <li> Best ever and very quiet.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Noste, Ear &amp; Facial Hair Trimmer does as described and is easy to clean. You do need AA batteries to run the trimmer. The product is small and easy to take with you when traveling.</li>
            <li> Does a good job, easy to maintain and does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Arrived on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER works well with a great angle.  I&#x27;ve used others but this trimmer rates up there with the best.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately with age hair seems to  grow better  in some places that we don&#x27;t want to.My last one lasted seven years  and hoping I&#x27;ll get the same amount time out of this. Product works very well, would recommend.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best nose trimmer I&#x27;ve ever purchased. Prior to this purchase I used a Waher Lithium Ion nose trimmer and nose hair scissors. So far the panasonic trimmer has been a painless and easy to use/maintain. This is my second one as I broke my previous one by dropping it on the floor but it was my fault I should of had the protector attached to the blade tip. The blade is the most expensive part of the trimmer according to panasonics website, its just better to purchase a whole new one on amazon.</li>
            <li> This is my first nose trimmer and I was pleased. For me the hair would bother me and the trimmer helps. Pretty easy to use and works well enough. Cleaning it can be a bit on the difficult side, but it does well enough at trimming so I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> my boyfriend liked it :D no complaints, and a very nice price!!</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend, he loves it.</li>
            <li> Works really well. I get stupid and annoying nose hairs growing gradually over the course of like 2 weeks so this is perfect for that. Easy to use. Hair is contained by the device as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> My wife reminds me that I&#x27;m getting old. She pointed out that I was loosing hair where I should have it and growing hair where I shouldn&#x27;t have it. This makes it easy to take care of the hair in the areas where it shouldn&#x27;t be growing, yet it doesn&#x27;t do anything to bring back the hair that is falling out where it should be growing.</li>
            <li> It simple to use and knives inside very good, they cut hairs carefully.  I like this simple and good work&lt;br /&gt;i</li>
            <li> Trims nostril and ear hair very comfortably. Lasts a long time on one battery.</li>
            <li> Slick little trimmer. Does what it is meant too do, trim away in those impossible places - ears and nose.</li>
            <li> Does the job. Not powerful enough</li>
            <li> Does not pinch, pull or cut. It&#x27;s easy, quiet and quick. Highly recommend. Works way better than some other ones that really pull and pinch, and it cuts down super close to the skin, you can actually press pretty hard on the skin and it still doesn&#x27;t cut.</li>
            <li> Slim sized tool that fits expectation of what it is supposed to do. Easy to clean up. Does not completely drain the battery even if left unused for a while.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and clean.  No pain at all! Much much better than my manual one from ZWILLING.</li>
            <li> Best I&#x27;ve seen! Works great and worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My husband liked this trimmer enough to order it a second time when the first one broke.</li>
            <li> I bought it abt 9 months ago and never cared to post a review, just ordered a new hair clipper and saw this was the #1 in the clipepr/trimmer categories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a reason why it&#x27;s ratd #1, it is #1 in my experience. And I ahev used a few in the past (Philips Norelco usually..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is the quietest nose hair trimmer I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;2. It&#x27;s contoured just right to be not uncomfortable as well as be effective&lt;br /&gt;3. It works for months... I use every week and had to chaneg batetry maybe only once in last 9 months since I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to write in cons about whatsoever.</li>
            <li> No more worry about the snout</li>
            <li> Works better than I expected...easy to clean and easy to control.  Better than many I have purchased in the past.  Great buy for the money.</li>
            <li> Gift for my Wife.  She is very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent. B n m r h b. Bg  g  h  v  b  v  v  c  f  g f  g h g</li>
            <li> Great little trimmer.  Quiet and more powerful than I expected.  No pulling of hairs that I have experienced from other units. The rinse feature is a plus.  Good product at a good price.</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer works very well. I&#x27;m pleased with it. It does a great job. I highly recommend it. [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]]</li>
            <li> This product was delivered in retail packaging and needs one AA battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression was it seemed well constructed and simple to use. Of course, you should do a once over on the instructions since it has moving parts next to your face. The instructions are pretty clear there is an on/off switch and a dial indicating operational or cleaning mode. The blade comes off and is replaceable if it fails later. Honestly, the shipping would probably warrant just buying a new unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After my first use. Trims hair really well and my girlfriend approves. It got a little warm after a couple minutes but not a major problem. No hair was snagged or pulled by the device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all: Very easy to use/clean.</li>
            <li> nose, ears&lt;br /&gt;works great&lt;br /&gt;nothing more to be said except:&lt;br /&gt;if you buy one you will love it.&lt;br /&gt;older technologies of this same type i found to be crap. Not this one. well made. sturdy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product...does what it says it does and does it well!  Get rid of those nasty nostril hairs, ear hairs, and for that matter, any other little loose hairs that are where they should not be.  Panasonic quality!</li>
            <li> Works great and shaped like a banana to fit in your hand.  blades are super sharp and trimmed all down to the root.  overall happy with the buy and price was low.</li>
            <li> Bought this as a gift and was so disappointed to find out that while this worked really well for about one month until it didn&#x27;t work at all....</li>
            <li> Hey, it always helps to add one more positive voice to the chorus, no?  I am very happy I bought this!  It makes short work of bothersome ear and nose hairs, and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all!  I have to confess, I was a little bit worried about being brought to tears as a gadget ripped the hairs out of my nose, but thankfully, this trimmer takes care of them quickly, without any pain at all.  It runs on 2 AA batteries, which are still going strong after nearly 6 months of periodic use.  My advice: buy this trimmer if you are looking for something to keep your ears and nose presentable!  It is affordable, and works admirably!</li>
            <li> I love This Trimmer, It Does the Job Every Time - &amp;#34;Works Great!&amp;#34;  A+</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Works great!</li>
            <li> With hundreds of other reviews, I don&#x27;t have much to add.  This machine feels good in the hand and does the job well.  So I&#x27;ll just add one hint:  When I first got it I put a new but apparently defective battery in it and almost returned it for the painful snags I encountered.  Tried another battery and it worked fine.  Reminder to myself (and anyone else):  to avoid pain, replace the battery at the first sign it&#x27;s slowing down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a nose hair trimmer before and wasn&#x27;t pleased with it, as it seemed like it did more pulling than trimming, so it mostly stayed in the drawer and I used a pair of scissors. The Panasonic was on sale on Amazon, on a Lightning Deal, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to extol its virtues to the skies or pretend that it&#x27;s any more than what it is: an inexpensive gadget that basically does just one thing and does it pretty well. It gets the job done, with more cutting than pulling (but still the occasional &amp;#34;ouch&amp;#34; every now and then, so not perfect), and it&#x27;s easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer runs on a single AA battery. The manufacturer claims 90 minutes of battery life, a claim I take with a grain of salt, but the battery life is still strong after several uses, so clearly not something I&#x27;m going to have to change every trim or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that it&#x27;s reasonably priced and gets the job done. I do have some concerns about the long-term effectiveness of the trimmer but for now, anyway, it&#x27;s fine and I can recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great!It&#x27;s great that it is waterproof. Easy to keep clean and working at it&#x27;s best. Haven&#x27;t had any problems</li>
            <li> very easy to use does not pull hair just cuts it smooth and close , very easy to clean .</li>
            <li> This product does a very good job.  The shape/curve fits my hand perfectly.  I use it for nose and grooming my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This is a great item, I had their original trimmer for over 20 years until it finally gave out.  This new unit is for wet use also, a great improvement.&lt;br /&gt;Nick Trikouros</li>
            <li> I am allways looking for that product that will do the job...nose and ears. This is the one. It&#x27;s ease of use and quality construction does it all. I recommend it to both sexes.</li>
            <li> BEST I HAVE EVER USED.</li>
            <li> It only worked for about 3 times, ten it stopped working. Of course it was after the return period has expired. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> At first when I saw this I laughed. Then I thought hey, why not. This thing is great, it helps me breathe more easily and takes care of unsightly nose hairs without the pain of plucking. I was worried about a spinning blade in my nose, but I haven&#x27;t been nicked at all it seems pretty safe as long as you don&#x27;t jam it up your nose way too far :) Great value wish I had discovered it years ago.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and it&#x27;s nice to hold.</li>
            <li> I like  this one. Cuts good.</li>
            <li> Just as good as the top-top ones, but for a very reasonable price.  Easy to use and clean, simple, looks nice.  I especially like how it stands tall on its own.  Totally painless yet very effective, and has does a great job in the couple months since I bought it.</li>
            <li> Nose and Facial hair trimmer. This product is the best one I have ever used. Well worth the money. OK</li>
            <li> Works well just be careful it will cut you if you tilt it to close</li>
            <li> Works just as advertised.  Cleans up very easily.  I am quite satisfied with this product. I would suggest this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer is great!  It doesn&#x27;t tug/pull your hairs as you trim them and it&#x27;s very quiet and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Worked well.  My husband was pleased.</li>
            <li> heats up pretty quickly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work very well in clipping the nose hairs. My old one was better, but I bought this one thinking it would out perform the old one. But it didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I had a vacuuming kind by Panasonic before and it was good, but we misplace it.  So, I decided to try this one because it was cheaper.  I found out that this one works as good as the other one.  I will buy again.</li>
            <li> This guy is a wonderful tool!  I purchased it as an impulse buy due to all the great reviews.. it replaces a Philips Norelco that I&#x27;ve used (and hated) for about a year.  This Panasonic is lightweight, ergonomic, and very quiet!  It seems to clip hairs that my Philips would miss.  I&#x27;m very impressed with this trimmer and I think you will be too!</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well, and much better than my Phillips (linear) trimmer, or any other trimmer I have ever owned.  Up my nose, or in my ears, this trimmer trims closed and more thoroughly than I have ever experienced.  Sorry, you may not borrow it.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised how well this trimmer worked.  No pulling or ripping out the hairs.  Easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> The best nose hair clipper I have used to date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lost my last Panasonic clipper that I had for almost 10 years!  This is basically the same design, but it seems like it has just a little less power than the old model - Still adequate though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really does trim nose hair nicely.</li>
            <li> Works well for those hard to pick places. :-)</li>
            <li> Tried some others, this one actually does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. Simple operation and easy maintenance.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, use it everyday.</li>
            <li> Very useful.  Works great.</li>
            <li> easy to use, very good to cut, amazing product</li>
            <li> it sometimes does work...poorly constructed...the battery contact is not good, thus it takes a few tries every time you want to use it</li>
            <li> So good so far. I use this for Nose and ear. not sure exactly how you would use it to cut facial hair and I&#x27;m not willing to try it out. I have another crappy phillips norelco item to do that with</li>
            <li> My husband had some fancy nose hair trimmer but it died. Based on the reviews I bought this one as a stocking stuffer type gift. He still talks about how great this trimmer is a year later. It&#x27;s the &amp;#34;best nose hair trimmer&amp;#34; he&#x27;s ever had. He&#x27;s not growing trees in his nose but he does have to trim regularly so he knows what he&#x27;s talking about. He doesn&#x27;t really rave about anything but this nose hair trimmer made an impression on him so that must mean something.</li>
            <li> Died after first battery change...</li>
            <li> Ordered this trimmer for my Dad in April of this year. As of today&#x27;s date it will not work. A very small part  that makes the trimmer part move (like a gear) has broken and we can&#x27;t fix it. Buying another with a 100% money back guarantee. Appears it is better and hopefully it comes with a warranty? I&#x27;m an avid Amazon buyer and am surprised they would sell such a POS.</li>
            <li> Panasonic sent me this trimmer after my previous Panasonic trimmer stopped working while under warranty. I paid shipping to send it out. This trimmer works great at first but it ceased operation on me in under 2 months (used 2-3 times per week). I took good care in storing it when not in use, never used or washed it in water, and don&#x27;t recall ever dropping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic would not pay for me to ship it to there factory for repair despite this unit still being under warranty and the previous one breaking as well. I will not be buying anymore Panasonic trimmers and possibly Panasonic products as well.</li>
            <li> Works good and is handy if needed to take traveling.</li>
            <li> Works great, very simple no pain. Only complaint is after i use it, I have to take a Q tip and get rid of the all excess hair that sticks in my nose.</li>
            <li> Works better than any nose trimmer I&#x27;ve seen before, really like.</li>
            <li> Works, but its cheap and finicky. Can someone make a good one of these already?!</li>
            <li> Loved it some much bought two more for my family.</li>
            <li> have had different ones before that hurt, these don&#x27;t. you can wash the tip, its small and portable. great product.</li>
            <li> this was a gift and the recipient was very happy with it</li>
            <li> Loving it so far. Hacks away at my nose hairs and gives a clean cut. Always nice when its not expensive as well.</li>
            <li> This item is easy to use, light weight, and super easy to clean.</li>
            <li> This was great when I first used it.  After about 5 uses, I noticed that it started pulling on my hair, instead of cutting it.  At first I thought it was just the battery, however even with a new battery it pulls the hair out...which can be very painful, especially in your nose!</li>
            <li> Nice design my only problem was that it would not work with the battery seated correctly, it would work with the battery almost completely out of it&#x27;s bracket ( don&#x27;t remember how discovered that ), then you couldn&#x27;t put on the bottom battery cover. Like the contact was applied wrong. Returned it and had a replacement shipped, same problem!</li>
            <li> It worked great - ONCE! Then it died. Not a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Best option for doing it right!</li>
            <li> best one i have ever bought</li>
            <li> I hate that I need it but I do. If it ever breaks I&#x27;ll replace it.</li>
            <li> Hey, it works!  It&#x27;s inexpensive!  I could even understand the instructions: put in battery, turn on, cut hair!  I&#x27;m happy!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t realize it wasn&#x27;t rechargeable and required batteries when I made the purchase, however this was likely my fault as I ordered it from my phone. As a side note batteries ARE NOT included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Operation isn&#x27;t bad for the price, but it doesn&#x27;t feel all that durable or well constructed. Also the instructions aren&#x27;t all that clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to keep it for now and see what happens, but if you&#x27;re looking for something high quality I suggest looking elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Best personal hair trimmer I ever owned.  LOVE it.  Especially for those pesky nose hairs men often get.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> My son recommended it and its working better than I thought it would having had several over the years that simply did not do the job.</li>
            <li> Works a little slow compared to a past unit I had, even with a fully charged battery.</li>
            <li> When you buy one of these, you know you&#x27;re getting old. There is nothing cool about walking around with daddy long legs hanging out. Not cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device works great - it is easy to clean - and can handle a wash without breaking.  This is a great buy.</li>
            <li> Works as expected and worth the price</li>
            <li> It works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> This is my second Panasonic unit.  I had the previous one for many years and the excellent performance and durability influenced me to buy another when the original finally wore out.  The new model is basically similar to the old and yet has excellent improvements to the previous design.  The new unit is quieter, curved to fit the hand and more easily cleaned.  I am very favorably impressed and pleased with the new generation product.</li>
            <li> Very light and easy to use</li>
            <li> Hasn&#x27;t pulled any hairs for me yet. Easy to clean. Sometimes it misses a few hairs, and for some reason, can have trouble with getting those lone hairs that are crazy long. I have to put the trimmer in and kind of mash it around for a while to make sure I get every hair. Overall does the job though, and much better than the no-name brand one that came with my travel kit.</li>
            <li> This is the best! I love it and I am a happy customer!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with purchase of Panasonic trimmer so far. I find that it work very well and no pulling of hairs or any other discomfort. I have only used a couple of times so far. my only concern would be how long blade will last. It is ergonomic and easily reaches all areas needing trimming.The trimming shroud does get very warm,not hot. Must use blade cleaning setting for longer blade life. It is very quiet. Now I just have ti find a place to hide from my two college age sons.</li>
            <li> Not a bad trimmer.  It takes a little bit of effort but does a fair job.  Easy to open and clean.</li>
            <li> This is an early review and may change in time should reliability turn out to be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very nice, affordable trimmer. it doesn&#x27;t come with some of the attachments other trimmers do, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good trimmer for unattractive hair in the nose you&#x27;ll be happy. It works better than others in this price range.</li>
            <li> Best nose hair clipper I&#x27;ve ever owned...and I&#x27;ve owned a few. Easy to clean, quiet and runs a long time on one battery. A great gift. I highly recommend this clipper.</li>
            <li> About time someone made one of these that actually worked. Very effective and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use, no pulling, precise.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a gift....I&#x27;m guessing it works great since he hasn&#x27;t said anything</li>
            <li> Good nose trimmer. Well shaped ergonomically!</li>
            <li> This is one nifty little trimmer. Didn&#x27;t pull one hair or nip the skin at all (ear and nose). If this trimmer only lasted 6 months I&#x27;d buy it again and again.</li>
            <li> I found this trimmer to be just short of okay. The build quality etc seem to be alright, but generally it seems to be underpowered. Generally the item seems a bit inefficient and collectively more time consuming that manual options such as scissors etc.</li>
            <li> It is a great design but after about 2 months it just died. I bought another just in case it was a fluke.</li>
            <li> Love, ordered it for my son to use in nose and in between eyes.  I tried it on my light blonde hairs on upper lip.......Loved it.  I am a hairstylist and have removed hair by tweezing or wax, which is time consuming.  this little trimmer took the few stray fuzzies away with out all the hassle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve hit the age when those nose hairs start getting really straggly. Great little tool for those grooming needs. I also use it for eyebrows &amp; such.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied. Works better than expected.</li>
            <li> Great for the price, durable washable.</li>
            <li> seemed OK. nothing spectacular</li>
            <li> The key for a good personal trimmer seems to be enough power. The Panasonic ER-GN30-K uses a single AA battery as opposed to cheaper brands I have used in the past which rely on a single AAA battery.</li>
            <li> Great design and quality. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Does the job wonderfully, easy to clean, small and compact, great product. Would give 5 stars, but after a year they seem to just break- which is right out of the warranty time zone. Whatever, though- works great for the time it does work, and its not that pricey to replace...</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve had.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great.</li>
            <li> works great, very effective, no pinching!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm. My husband no longer runs from me when I say I have to trim his nose and ear hair!</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and does a great job on ear and nose hair!</li>
            <li> I have a very happy nose now</li>
            <li> This trimmer arrived on time. It works well. I like that it is quieter than my previous trimmer. The only downside is that it is not rechargeable.</li>
            <li> This is works great.  Easy to use and does what it says.</li>
            <li> Works o.k., slow for my liking...</li>
            <li> Works well at a really cheap price</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how many people reviewed this thing favorably. (!) My previous trimmer, a no-name brand I bought at WM for under $20 trimmed well and lasted 7 years. I thought this one would be even better with the Panasonic name and all the glowing reviews. All I can guess is that the majority of people reviewing this had nothing to compare it to. Mine quit working entirely after 4 months and just a few uses. When it did run, it was quite inefficient at cutting hair in the areas it&#x27;s designed to handle (nose &amp; ears). I had to go over an area repeatedly, with pressure, to get it to trim the hair. It took many passes whereas my previous trimmer cut the hair on the very first swipe with no extra pressure required. Not recommended.</li>
            <li> Works great.  used it in and out of the shower.  Easy to clean and only needs a single AAA battery.  Useful, inexpensive, should have bought one sooner.</li>
            <li> Love this device. I used small scissors for years, but never again! This is easy to use, easy to clean, easy to swap out the battery. Makes what used to be a most unpleasant chore into a quick and easy task which takes no time at all.</li>
            <li> works great for nose hairs and ear hairs, doesn&#x27;t pull like previous one I had by another manufacturer</li>
            <li> good quality for the price.</li>
            <li> It does the deed and it does it well. Takes 1 AA battery. What else could you ask for?&lt;br /&gt;Shove this sucker up your nose and watch the magic pour from nostril heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hair free. Booger free. Life free.</li>
            <li> Great buy. So easy to clean up and those nasty itchy nose hairs are gone in a breeze. Can also be used to spot trim facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5/5 would trim beard and nose with it again</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been a fan of the rotary style nose hair trimmer but this one had changed my mine. It is fast, quiet, powerful and effective. It is also easy to clean and compact. It is also well made. Kudos to Panasonic!</li>
            <li> Trims nose hair well, also works on hair in the ear. Won&#x27;t work on any hairs on my face.</li>
            <li> Sooo much better than the flat blade style trimmers.  Greatest thing since sliced bread.</li>
            <li> Husband is satisfied and so am I cause I font have to trim nose with scissors he can do this himself</li>
            <li> I read the other reviews and thought this would be great for trimming nose hair. It works okay, but did pull some hairs and I had to go over an area several times to get it all.</li>
            <li> So far so good, seems to work well.  Limited use thus far, but best trimmer of this sort I have ever had.</li>
            <li> Better than i expected shipping  wasn&#x27;t  bad ,have used  it on several  occasions now no complaints. I would  recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Great works really nice I have other ones ( 1  ) and this works really nice</li>
            <li> It does what it&#x27;s expected to do !  ...so i&#x27;m happy !</li>
            <li> No more pain trimming those Picasso style brush nose hair! As you get older(especially male), you(not me) start losing hair on your head and start growing hair from your ear, nose, b** crack and every where else that you did not expect, it&#x27;s like terraforming after a certain age, WTF! Anyway, with this, as long as you have good batteries in it, it will un-terraform the landscape easily without pain, to get rid of the extraterrestrial plants here and there, just make sure to clean and change the battery on a regular basis, so that it will work at its best.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean works as expected</li>
            <li> Works well and is painless to use.  Recommended.</li>
            <li> It works, kind of. It wont remove all of the fine hairs, but it does its job at making it so that you have no visible hairs. Its worth keeping for the low price.</li>
            <li> Typical Panasonic product; works great</li>
            <li> Love this new trimmer.  It beats my old trimmer by a mile.  Very effective even in the ear area.</li>
            <li> Very nice and it arrived on time, great for gift giving, for the holiday season .</li>
            <li> I’m a hairy woman. I look like a monkey! Anyway, thanks for this nose, ear and facial hair trimmer. I can’t go outside without trimming my facial hair, seriously.</li>
            <li> Great purchase so far. Easy to use and clean. So much easier than any other method that I&#x27;ve tried of managing nose hairs. I have to admit that it tickles a little bit until you get used to it. But you&#x27;re causing slight vibrations to your nose hairs as they cut, so what do you expect.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t pull often, cuts the hair close enough for me.  Gets rid of the hair sticking out of the nose.  GF approved.</li>
            <li> Everything it was supposed to be, no unexpected surprises. Very happy !</li>
            <li> Received the item on time but did not work right out of the box. Returning for a replacement.</li>
            <li> Works well. Strong cutter, doesn&#x27;t tickle and seems well built.</li>
            <li> Works great as long as the batteries are fresh. Nothing hurts worse than getting a nose hair tangled in this trimmer due to slow motor.</li>
            <li> Works very well. For the price you simply can&#x27;t beat it. I noticed no pulling or tugging (yet), so I am very happy. Also, I love being able to clean it by running it under the tap. Brilliant!</li>
            <li> Works great and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this trimmer a few weeks ago and it has been working fine!! I would recommend this product to any body.&lt;br /&gt;The seller was respectful and the shipping was fast! no worries and like I said it works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Great little gizmo at a very good price. Much better than the Conair purchased at our local pharmacy. Arrived on time and in good condition.</li>
            <li> works as advertised....</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut as much as I would like. It just takes more time to do the job. So, overall, I am satisfied</li>
            <li> Not much to say really. It trims my nose hair....</li>
            <li> works awesome just a little scary putting something in you nose but makes me look so much better.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised.  The price was right.  There isn&#x27;t much more to say about it.</li>
            <li> Excellent - works very well!  Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Read the reviews, looked at others, trust Panasonic...</li>
            <li> works and can use to in a inch when no time to pluck stray eyebrow hairs</li>
            <li> This is a well-made bathroom utensil, and is likely to last much longer than previous one I have bought.</li>
            <li> does the job as advertised</li>
            <li> decent product for a decent price</li>
            <li> I love it, it is the best nose trimmer ever</li>
            <li> Works great, cuts the hair clean and has yet to pull or hang up on hair. Easy clean too.</li>
            <li> Works great. Did exactly what its supposed to. Easy to use with clear instructions.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for any guy. It can be used in so many ways, and it is an easy addition to any grooming routine. Can be cleaned and maintained easily which is always a plus.</li>
            <li> This trimmer exceeded my expectations by far. Been using it for a while, and it works great. Given that it was dirt cheap, I think it was a great deal. It&#x27;s even washable so I use it while taking a shower. Only minus is that it has no cord, but runs on batteries. I hate having to buy batteries cuz it&#x27;s always a mess storing them and so on..</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product.  I&#x27;ve been buying the old style trimmer for years and they always quick working.  This one has been going strong for over a year. It&#x27;s easy to clean after use and does an amazing job! Also works will on ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you buy this you will never use another type trimmer.</li>
            <li> this was a gift for my husband. i read all the other reviews to decide on which model/brand to buy. he seems to like it and use it. I have not heard any complaints from him and he usually shares what he thinks ;o)</li>
            <li> I wanted to use this tool to cut hair in nose, but I found my nose is itching because of the shaking hair. Not that useful</li>
            <li> Replacement for trimmer I have had for several years.  Compact, ergonomic and quiet.  Excellent performance on all types of trimming.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works much better than the last one I had....didn&#x27;t even realize the last one wasn&#x27;t very good until I got this one!!</li>
            <li> This unit is average in its ability to perform expected task.  Satisfactory but not the best trimmer I have had in the past.</li>
            <li> I seriously use this for everything. Nose, eyebrows, facial hair, even my back! Haha sounds gross I know. But this thing is powerful and actually pretty quiet. For the price I paid, I feel really satisfied. Also very safe, never pinched or pulled any hairs.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend is so happy with this product</li>
            <li> As I age, and watch the hair transfer from the top of my head and into my nose and ears, I am thankful that this great product is on the market. It works fantastic, is easy to use, and is easy to clean. It helps me look better and feel better about myself. Just a warning though, the hair seems to grow back in record time. But it is a great product and you won&#x27;t mind using it more.</li>
            <li> The nose/hair trimmer exceeded my expectations. It did not pinch, it did not pull.  It provided clean and precise cuts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet, effective, and gentle on even the nose hairs. Completely satisfied with this purchase. You won&#x27;t be disappointed with this one.</li>
            <li> Cadillac of nose hair trimmers. I&#x27;ve been trimming my nose hairs since high school and have owned three or so trimmers. I had become so accustomed to my trimmer catching and snaging hair that I assumed pain and tears were just apart of getting rid of those hairs. I&#x27;ve never she&#x27;d a tear using this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is our third one and the best so far. Much better than a Wahl version that we had bought at a store. Easy and comfortable to use. Closest clipping.</li>
            <li> Fun to play with it on hubbys ears and nose hairs. I used to pull them out with the tweezers but I can&#x27;t see them very well anymore. This works great.</li>
            <li> Works and isn&#x27;t painful....very sturdy and cleans quickly.  It&#x27;s a keeper!  Protective case is very nice too.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> Received the item neatly pack, been using it for more than a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
            <li> Well made.  Arrived promptly. Just as described. Highly recommend. A+++++</li>
            <li> The panasonic trimmer really does the job well. No complaint so far after 2 months of usage. Easy to clean and maintenance.</li>
            <li> I just got it and it worked fine the firs time I used it.  It beats cutting the hears with a scissors.t</li>
            <li> But it sucks battery life, just a bit too faster than what I would like.  Say us men admit to using such an item once a week, then the single AA battery will last about 2 months or more, effectively.  So say 6 battery&#x27;s a year.  I think we can live with that, even though we might not admit the use of such an item.</li>
            <li> My husband likes it so therefore I give it 5 stars. I like that he likes it, so I&#x27;m also giving it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> While I purchased this for ear and nose, it works great for detailing a goatee. It is easy to clean and runs for weeks on a battery.</li>
            <li> A mi marido le encanto, es muy útil y practico... Ademas de ser pequeñito, fácil de llevar.. Llego en el tiempo que lo esperaba!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work. Returned them both.</li>
            <li> My husband asked me to get one of these, and I had to try it myself!  It works so much better than our old one (which died), and the price was reasonable, too.  Given the better quality of this model, I expect we&#x27;ll be using it for quite a few years.</li>
            <li> Not a game changer, but it works with a little patience.</li>
            <li> Have a drawer full of hair trimmers and this is the best by far at a very reasonable cost.  Have ordered 3 of these already.</li>
            <li> It does the job, but make sure the battery is good or it can pull on the hair some times.</li>
            <li> But now this is made easy for nose hair trimming this is magnificent. Feels a bit funny when using it the first time</li>
            <li> Works very well, no pinching!  Quick shipping. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Really disappointed that after getting two of these units, neither one of them worked.  Sent both back and will look for another alternative.</li>
            <li> I know  - - - just can&#x27;t believe I&#x27;m at the age where this isn&#x27;t a gag gift. I actually need one. This works. I can&#x27;t figure out how but it works! One of the few things I&#x27;ve purchased of late that does what it says and how it says without me having to finagle something. LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Great little device to get rid of unsightly hair. Even bought my teenage son one.</li>
            <li> Not perfect, need to go at it a few times until the job it done. But for this price, what could I ask for. It does the job fine and it is small. Does not pull any hair, leaves all clean.&lt;br /&gt;I am fully satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is the best for its purpose. Efficient and painless</li>
            <li> Well made and sturdy.  Thing thing is way better than the cheapo one that it replaced.</li>
            <li> As advertised works well</li>
            <li> All mens need this product and you won&#x27;t regret for sure. I stronly recommened this product to go for it.</li>
            <li> Husband likes this hair trimmer. He uses on his nose hairs and his ear hairs. Pleased with this purchase. Yep!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best nose and facial hair trimmer that I&#x27;ve found.  I did a lot of research on the internet prior to purchasing this and I&#x27;m glad I did.  The cutting blades have plenty of speed and it does a fine job.  It also is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Bought for my husband. He likes it a lot. Works great!</li>
            <li> A simple yet effective tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Good battery life&lt;br /&gt;* No pain pluck&lt;br /&gt;* Water doesn&#x27;t seem to bother it&lt;br /&gt;* Quiet&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;* Low cost</li>
            <li> Love this Panasonic Nose and Facial Trimmer! This is the one to buy. Don&#x27;t look any further!</li>
            <li> very good. I strongly encourage to buy it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Feels solid unlike the last cheap-o I bought. Water proof. Cap is great, a lot of power :)</li>
            <li> It is good enough at what it does.  It really should be more powerful and cut more closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic, once upon a time, made outstanding nose hair trimmers (most especially the Panasonic ER112).  Unfortunately, their current models run from poor to OK.</li>
            <li> Very happy with trimmer.  Easy to use, gets job done.  I would def recommend this product to someone looking to purchase trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very nice! I recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Just received it- in great shape. I still need  a fresh AA battery to get the fill effect, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> Original review:&lt;br /&gt;After trying a couple other nose trimmers out there, this one proved to be the best.  While others may have been a bit more powerful, they also vibrated too much and pulled the nose hair, which was extremely painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer has almost no vibration (a good sign in small electric motors) and does not pull at all.  The fact that it&#x27;s washable with soap and water is a great feature, which helps avoid infection.  Overall it&#x27;s an excellent product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Note that this trimmer is about 30% smaller than it looks in some of these pictures, like the one&#x27;s held up to the man&#x27;s face. This actually might work in its favor, to get to hard-to-reach places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/29/14:&lt;br /&gt;Well now I&#x27;ve bought two of these, and both of the motors have turned out to be garbage. In both cases they worked fine at first, but they soon began making whirring noises which became louder and louder. Eventually they ground to a halt. New batteries didn&#x27;t help; they were simply drained of energy very quickly. More rubbish for the trash heap. I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the fault of the Chinese for making such worthless products; then again if we didn&#x27;t continue to buy their trash, this would quickly become much, much less of a problem.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer, but Panasonic recommends the blade be replaced every 3 years. The replacement blade (part number WERGN30K1058) is $13.63 from Panasonic</li>
            <li> It is what it is supped to be and works perfectly.  I would recommend this product to anyone that needs it.</li>
            <li> Hey, and I thought all nose hair trimmers were junk.  This little jewel really does the job.  If it ever quits, I&#x27;ll be sure to let you know.</li>
            <li> it works well and does what it is supposed to do, no more no less, not sure what else to say.</li>
            <li> Great product, worked as intended. Need to buy batteries separate, which tend to be a bit expensive as they are bought in packages. Satisfied!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what more to say: this works very well.  It does everything they advertize, including wet cleanup.  So if you need a good nose hair trimmer at a decent prices, this product is a great option.</li>
            <li> Great! It works perfectly and I can rinse it clean before cleaning it with alcohol.</li>
            <li> So I had just managed to burn out the second of my nose hair trimmers, and I was resorting to scissors, which is scary both because there&#x27;s something sharp and pointy in your nose and because it&#x27;s really hard to get the right angle to clear out those hairs. I had had this item on my wishlist for a while. My first time using it, it was very successful at clearing out all that extra hair up there. I didn&#x27;t feel like I had a lot of clippings stuck up there either, like some other brands (where you blow your nose and you&#x27;re getting little pieces of hair in your snot for the next week). So, really like this product. No idea how long it will last, but it&#x27;s good in the meantime. The batter does seem to go in backwards, though.</li>
            <li> This has been the best trimmer Ive owned by far. Its a few bucks more but well worth it! It doesnt get hot. Seems like it will last and you can wash it out with water.</li>
            <li> This little trimmer works great, I&#x27;ve owned several an none have had the horsepower this one has. It also has a wet/dry setting so you can take it into the shower.</li>
            <li> I have never had an ear and nose hair trimmer that didn&#x27;t stop working within a couple of months.  The Panasonic ER-GN30-K appears to be no exception to the rule.  I bought it because it has an on off switch instead of a twist on off mechanism like other nose hair trimmers.  However, it seems like the trimmer is going out too.  At this point, it still works, but I have had to try turning it on and off multiple times before it will start.  That seems to be the modus operandi of the other trimmers when they are going out.  When I got it, I thought it was great.  But not so much now.</li>
            <li> This is the same looking model that I seen in so many advertisements and reviews. This was my first nose trimmer I purchased and will be the last. Does everything I need it to do and then some. I&#x27;m not old or anything, but there are some times that my noise hair tickle or makes me feel like I have a hanging booger, which makes me paranoid. Just needed a nose trimmer. Trimming the nose only takes seconds. Cleaning is easy with just running it through the faucet. Even came with batteries!</li>
            <li> I like it! it&#x27;s been a few months since I&#x27;ve had it and it still works! I would certainly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have no complaints with this product at all.  Works extremely well. Easy to use.  Easy to store.  I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> This thing was used about 5 times and then it quit.I cannot blame it on excess hair removal so that leaves a lousy product as the answer.</li>
            <li> Gave as stocking stuffer gifts and have heard good feedback.</li>
            <li> Got 2 uses out of it before something happened with the blade.  Now it makes a terrifying grinding noise.  I&#x27;ve tried removing and re-installing the blade multiple times but the problem persists.  Will try contacting Panasonic and hopefully they take care of it under the warranty.</li>
            <li> This product works great and affordable!  It&#x27;s a little lighter weight than I expected.  It takes batteries which is a little different than the rechargeable one I once used.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband and it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;A great price!</li>
            <li> Superb working and machine parts r 100% genuine n highly advanced state of the art design makes comfort to come in ur hands. Whats on the top is that its an amazon item. Amazon is fabulous in regards of respect and to fulfill needs of the consumer. I recommend you to shop always on amazon coz it never disappoints u in any case n situation. Guarantee assured is the other name of amazon.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again, it heats up fast and doesn&#x27;t do a great job. I really got to jab it around in my nose to get the hair out and then it starts feeling hot!  Maybe I need a weed whacker instead.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this trimmer. It was a nice change from the inexpensive trimmer from Remington that I was using.</li>
            <li> This makes a great gift for any man really....all mean could use grooming tools at some point. Its good for those nose hairs and if the main has hair growing in his ears as well.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for fourteen months. it is working great, not pulling.</li>
            <li> I had a rechargeable hair remover for long time but it didn&#x27;t recharge anymore.&lt;br /&gt;This requires a battery but I can replace one to have a full power.&lt;br /&gt;It works as it should do.</li>
            <li> It works well and does pretty much what you expect and want it to. Nothing really to complain about. It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> Once I learned to use it I am pleased.  It cuts hard to reach hair in ears and nose much better than scissors.</li>
            <li> First time i buy a panasonic article and doesn t fill my expectations! It worked well&lt;br /&gt;Like 5 or 6 times.after that the thing stopped working. Was always kept in its box and never used it wet.In my opinion i would not recommend this trimmer to nobody at all! Don t buy it!</li>
            <li> Such a good product, but very VERY cheap design. Dropped it once and now it clanks. So, don&#x27;t drop it and it&#x27;ll do everything you need it to.</li>
            <li> Zaps the hairs.  I use a rechargeable battery and they last several uses.  Seems to be as good as new aver several uses.  The blade end seems water resistant and I rinse it off as I use it.</li>
            <li> Features I like, does not cut too close (avoids in grown hair), easy to use, quite, very easy to clean (great feature), long lasting battery, does not take up a lot of room in travel case...I would buy again...</li>
            <li> Works very good and quite. Seems a little cheaply made.</li>
            <li> I have used this product twice and it cuts very close and runs very quiet.  Clean up is very easy and quick.</li>
            <li> A great price for a simple unit. I find it very easy to use and clean because it can get wet. I have used it  minimally over the past year but blade seems to remain sharp and it causes no discomfort during use.</li>
            <li> Tickles! Also very finicky about cleaning. Must clean thoroughly after each use.</li>
            <li> Great price point for such a great product. If your looking to get rid of those annoying nose hairs this product is for you</li>
            <li> This thing works really well. I&#x27;ve had it for a while and it&#x27;s easy to just clean up a couple spots here and there whether it&#x27;s your nose, ears, or whatever. Cuts close and it&#x27;s easy to clean. Battery lasts a while too.</li>
            <li> My second Clipper. My son took the first one. Great little clippers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this nose hair trimmer in February.  At first, it worked ok but not great.  Within a month, it was working sporadically.  I should have returned it then, but I figured that I would just put up with a mediocre piece of equipment, which I did until around a month ago (May).  At that time, it stopped working, but after around a week, I tried it again, and it worked, albeit, barely.  At this point (June 24), it doesn&#x27;t work at all.  I tried to return it, only to find that I couldn&#x27;t.  I buy a lot through Amazon.  This is the first time, after many thousands of dollars of purchases, that I really feel that I got ripped off.  I took excellent care of the device.  I used as instructed.  I never dropped it -- not once.  And I am left holding the bag.  The only part that is ok is that I guess I can afford the loss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has a reputation of customer satisfaction.  While the item was not good, Amazon really stepped up to the plate.  I wrote an email to Amazon and within 24 hours, I was issued a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My conclusions:  I would not recommend the item to anyone.  I do strongly recommend Amazon.  They stand behind the products more than anyone else on the internet.</li>
            <li> used for nose hairs.  Yes nose hairs, and it works great.  No pain, and does a great job. I would recommend it,</li>
            <li> No complaints, just felt like its lacking functionality. Whatever its cheap and solid.</li>
            <li> I have only used it one time and it did the job. I&#x27;m sure it will work well. ask me again next month,</li>
            <li> For the price this something you can buy a few of and leave them in your travel bag, drawer, and your vacation home (if you have one).</li>
            <li> trimmers are light weight plastic on the outside, I had originally thought from the image that the silver part may be made out of metal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband and I each tried the Panasonic ER-GN30-K so we could pool together our thoughts.  We both have never used nose hair trimmers before so it is hard for basis of comparison but based on the experience with this product, my husband thought they were decent, but said he pushed them on his skin and they nicked him a little, but thought that if he was careful they seemed to get the job done as he expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried them I noticed that they seemed to warm up quickly, perhaps from being previously used by my husband.  Since I had never used them I needed to use them longer than if I was just maintaining.  So perhaps if I just use them for touch ups they won&#x27;t get as hot.  I also felt that they completed the job as expected to trim not completely remove the hair as if using a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will post again after using them for a longer period of time, but I wanted to get our initial impression out there for those trying to make a decision.</li>
            <li> Cutting head is poor quality.  Have to bang on unit to get it to spin up to speed then fades again after a few hairs.  Yanks a few hairs out.  Worked better for few months but now replacing.</li>
            <li> Have had this trimmer for 2 years now. I mostly use it for nose hair trimming once a week. Seems to get the job done with minimal discomfort (every now and then it WILL pull a hair though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to eat up the battery fast, but i&#x27;m happy its an easily replaceable one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the &amp;#34;vortex&amp;#34; wash system might sound like a gimmick but it actually works pretty well - still need to unscrew the top, remove the blade shake off the excess water and allow it to dry on some paper towel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;would buy again</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Highly recommend and would purchase as gift too. Love it.</li>
            <li> very simple to use and does a great job.</li>
            <li> Excellent nose hair trimmer.  I haven&#x27;t tried trimming anything else with it but went to town on my nose and it does a fabulous job.</li>
            <li> ZERO STARS, COMPLETLY USELESS SITS IN BATHROOM CABINET , I THINK I WILL TOSS IT IN TRASH I HAVE ALREADY WASTED MY CASH ,TIME TO STOP WASTING MY SPACE  NEEDED CABINET SPACE TOSSED IN TRASH!!!!</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever used.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> This little guy is a champ!  for the price I paid and the work it does.... Bravo!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it in a heartbeat for clearing up those little places that might need some trimming.  I was a plucker before, and this is soooo much nicer.&lt;br /&gt;It sometimes gets a little warm, but I use it once a week or so now so it doesn&#x27;t have to be on very long and thus that isn&#x27;t much of an issue for me.  And I have a good amount of hair.  Not a forest growing out of my nose and ears, but enough to warrant the upkeep, and it gets pretty thick.  This has no problem with any of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 months and going strong.  I expect that if it goes 1.5 to 2 years, I&#x27;ll have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  Heck, I may already feel that I did.</li>
            <li> Great product. Easy to clean and maintain. Works perfectly.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a great job.  The battery last a long time, and the price is perfect.  It does exactly what it claims to do.  The only thing i would change about it if I had a say is to redesign the plastic cap because sometimes it pops off.  But again, for the price, i can live with this.</li>
            <li> I was amazed how well this product worked. I bought it to replace an older, wall plugged nose trimmer and this one works very well. I&#x27;m hoping it lasts many years lol.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t a whole heck of a lot involved in men&#x27;s grooming. Nose hair, however, is something that needs to be tended to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no excuse for excessive nose hair with this inexpensive little trimmer. Switch it on, stick it in your nose, rotate, and rinse. Simple as that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of nose hair trimmers and they all are slow and grab hairs which really hurts. These are MUCH better. It&#x27;s inexpensive, but they seem to cut cleaner and have more speed. Nice design. Washable feature is great.</li>
            <li> Great price, and great product.</li>
            <li> Trims nostril and ears very easily, eyebrows take a little more careful use.  Really like the way it cleans under running water.</li>
            <li> Works really well, doesn&#x27;t pull sensitive hairs as it is cutting and has lasted pretty well for battery life so far.</li>
            <li> Bought my father one, and then decided to get one for myself.  It has lasted amazingly long on its first battery.</li>
            <li> did not work even once, i gifted it to my father in India so could not even send it back but it never worked, never going to buy anything panasonic, I have a norelco trimmer that&#x27;s still going strong after 4 years, bad thing norelco stopped making that model.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work very well.  I&#x27;m back to scissors.</li>
            <li> Trimmer worked great for a while but has stopped working properly. Blade will no longer spin.</li>
            <li> Some folks complain that it stops working after a few uses.  I have had no problems at all.  It just needs to be cleaned after each use. Just rinse the cutter with water and it&#x27;s good to go for next time. Works better than the staright brush style trimmers.</li>
            <li> My husband laughed at me when I gave him this little trimmer but, after he tried it, the birdsnest ear hair has Disappeared, Hallelujah!!</li>
            <li> Trimmer cuts hair close. The blades do have too be cleaned very often. Like that the head is easy to rinse without having to take it apart every time. I do take it apart sometimes to disinfect it though. Overall a great nose and ear trimmer.</li>
            <li> way improved over my 10 yr old one</li>
            <li> I have no complaints about the actual usage of this trimmer.  The only beef I&#x27;ve got is that you should definitely keep some rechargeable batteries on hand as it is very draining on them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really very simple to use, and very easy to clean ... what else would you want out of this little thing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my nose, ears, face, and beard lining. Works pretty well over all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No &amp;#34;pulling&amp;#34; to the hair any more ... and I like how this little beast completely removes all hair ... very well built and the stock battery that comes with it really lasts LONG</li>
            <li> I like it.  This trimmer does its job and does not pinch or grab.  Batteries seem to be lasting.  Glad I got it.</li>
            <li> Works really well and have had no issues at all. We&#x27;ve had several other types but this one really prefer the most. Smooth operation!</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer, which takes a single AA battery. For the money it really can&#x27;t be beat. Perhaps somehow has a rechargeable version.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this trimmer. I especially like the rinse to clean feature, it makes it easily cleaned</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. And it trims all the hair in your nose completely. It&#x27;s annoying that it doesn&#x27;t have a rechargeable battery, but that&#x27;s alright I guess.</li>
            <li> Works as a nose hair trimmer should. Easy to clean and it runs off of 1 AA battery.  Definitely beats plucking.</li>
            <li> Christmas gift for my husband and he loves it. He had one before and it died and now this has replaced it and he is very happy with the product.</li>
            <li> The product worked absolutely great until it stopped 2 months after purchase. I tried different sets of batteries but it refuses to turn on. But during the time it did work, I really liked it. Its got great battery life and gets rid of hair without any pull or pluck feeling. Guess its time to move to a Wahl product.</li>
            <li> Great for old guys who have more hair in their nose than on their head.</li>
            <li> Not that you want to hear about my prior hairy nose and ears but this item works better than any other I have used - A+</li>
            <li> I looked at the options for trimmers and decided that this one had the best chance of providing the service I needed. It has delivered on that expectation at a resonable price.</li>
            <li> Weak and ineffective. As soon as the battery dips it at all, it starts ripping out hair.</li>
            <li> AS we age hair begins to grow more in the ears and nostrils. This product is the prefect answer to this phenomen. It works great and would highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> In the few weeks I have used it, it works fine.  Hoping the blade holds up for a good period</li>
            <li> This is a good nose trimmer.  I really needed one, had been putting off getting a new one.  It is unbelievable how well it works.</li>
            <li> Motor sounded powerful, but did not actually trim very well.  The guard is so high up on the razor that it doesn&#x27;t actually allow it to cut.  Maybe if the hair was really long, but if you are wanting a close trim, it&#x27;s not going to happen with this one.</li>
            <li> BEST NOSE TRIMMER EVER!</li>
            <li> The nose trimmer arrived on time, undamaged and clean. I love this trimmer beacuse it has enough power to trim nose and ear hairs without pulling on them. This trimmer cuts the hairs.  I used a few brands this one is the best.</li>
            <li> Dies after 30 seconds. I&#x27;ve tried 2 different batteries in it.  When it does work for the first 10 seconds, it pulls rather than cuts hair. Piece of garbage. I&#x27;d like my money back.</li>
            <li> This product is obviously..very cheaply made.  However, it gets the job done well!  We have not had any problems. ;)</li>
            <li> Small, lightweight, efficient.  Exactly what I wanted and was expecting from the reviews.  Depending on how long this little warrior lasts, I would definitely buy it again.  SOLD!</li>
            <li> I have been using it for over an year now and love it!! As the top reviewer here mentioned, quite delectably, aging men needs it to keep the unwanted hair in-check. I use it mainly to maintain the hair in nostrils, over the ears a couple of times a month and this product does a great job and keeps it-self clean along the way too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:Does the job really well, looks elegant, easy to clean, battery lasts very long, doesn&#x27;t hurt you and great price!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Nothing at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little note on how to clean: I use a bathroom tissue or a q-tip to clean the hair stuck near the blade, also blow air to remove any hard one&#x27;s and has worked for me.&lt;br /&gt;I got it last year just after Black Friday for a very good price...thanks to Amazon and Panasonic. Would highly recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Thanks  everything expected. Quickly sent and everything was well done. Your an excellent vendor and all should feel good with you!</li>
            <li> Does everything you&#x27;d expect.  However while traveling on airplanes, this thing is turning on by itself.  I keep it in my bath bag (guy kit) so its not secure but not flying around my luggage.  This has happened a couple times and it runs the battery down all the way obviously.</li>
            <li> This works rather well. I am pretty happy the way I am able to get those long hairs that seem to come more and more with age in places hard to manage otherwise.</li>
            <li> Clips extra close, ergonomic design, doesn&#x27;t eat batteries, very quiet.  Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Highly recommend this over other similar products.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better nose hair trimmers I&#x27;ve used.  It does a good job of cutting the hair close without hurting or pulling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 nose trimmers over the years. This is the best one yet. I&#x27;ve had it for the past 6 months and still runs strong. I use it once every two weeks. The blades still seem to be very sharp.</li>
            <li> Trims them nosey hairs just fine. I really loved this trimmer because it doesnt yank the hairs it just trims them. I tell you turning 30 sucks now I have nose hairs?! This trimmer is great, takes one AA battery and seems to last for a while (battery life). I highly recommend this trimmer, very satisfied as I am with all Panasonic stuff.</li>
            <li> This does a really good job of removing nose and ear hair.  My only issue is that I don&#x27;t really understand the wet capabilities and found the instructions hard to understand.  Might just be me.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used. Easy to clean and reaches places other trimmers did not. Only negative is that it does go through batteries quickly, about every month or so with regular use. I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> works well though! love the AA batteries instead of a charger. It is very lightweight and easy to use. I haven&#x27;t tested the waterproof part yet.</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome. My wife uses it to trim her mustache and back hair.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is terrible.  From the outset, this trimmer has lacked sufficient cutting speed, which results in pulled nose hairs.  I have changed the batteries several times, even using Duracell&#x27;s premium line batteries, but batteries are not the problem.  The problem lies solely with this terrible product.  I recently purchased a $10.00 Wahl micro trimmer from the grocery store to replace this Panasonic trimmer and the Wahl trimmer is 10 times better.</li>
            <li> Painfully pulls at your hairs occasionally, but otherwise good.</li>
            <li> I have a drawer full of nose hair trimmers that don&#x27;t work.  This one, on the other hand, does the job quickly and painlessly.  I also like that it is easy to clean the blade.  I remove it, run it under hot water, and blow it dry.</li>
            <li> I have been using trimmers for many years.  I have this and it does not cut well at all.  I bought this actually to replace the vacuum panasonic nose trimmer I had before and this one is terrible.  The Panasonic vacuum trimmer is 10x better.  Neither are perfect but please take my advice and get the vacuum one.</li>
            <li> better than any other that I purchased as it ACTUALLY WORKS</li>
            <li> This is my trimmer. There are many like it, but this one is mine.</li>
            <li> Seems to work just fine.</li>
            <li> It works fine. They&#x27;re not as good as they use to be. What happened to the dependable simple electric nose hair trimmer that lasted me years! They are making them so flimsy these days. It&#x27;s sad. The good thing about this trimmer is the setting to clean through the blades which allows water to go through and exit on the side.</li>
            <li> This was broken as soon as it arrived. I wasn&#x27;t able to return it. No good, waste of money and time. Thanks guys.</li>
            <li> very good product. It slaughters all the nose hairs. This thing has many confirmed kills. Great product and you can use it in the shower. Battery lasts a while.</li>
            <li> We have gone through so many hair trimmers, but this one seems to be durable.  It&#x27;s very quiet and when you&#x27;re using it it doesn&#x27;t tickle or pull. It almost feels like it&#x27;s not working, but it definitely is!  It was a good buy!</li>
            <li> I purchased this as my second nose hair trimmer and I continue to appreciate its quietness, comfort, and ease of cleaning.</li>
            <li> works beautifully. My husband uses it in the shower. Perfect finishing touch.</li>
            <li> Was gentle when removing hair.  It&#x27;s lightweight.  Runs on just one AA battery.  Can clean it wet or dry.  It just works. :)</li>
            <li> this is my second trimmer. its lasted about 3 uses and its starting to pull hair now which is not a good thing. I will be definatly looking for another brand.  My previous remington at the same price lasted way longer.</li>
            <li> Works as advertised. Small and versatile. Hasnt nipped me yet. Quiet. Looks cool. You would be hard pressed to beat it for the price.</li>
            <li> Does what it should do great. Very quiet and easy to clean. Ergonomically very well designed. Ear hair and nose hairs are easily trimmed away.</li>
            <li> Note: I purchased this for my husband and he&#x27;s extremely pleased with it. Here&#x27;s his feedback:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I think of Panasonic I&#x27;m thinking plasma TVs and maybe rice cookers, not nose trimmers. The ER-GN30 is the first trimmer that I have been truly pleased with. It is firm in the hand; very good build quality and just a very well thought out product. This product does not try to be the Swiss army knife of trimmers - nose and ears are its territory. Oh, and the knives are very sharp and precise - nose and ear trimming are not marathon events - short sprint and you&#x27;re done. Your first trimming session will probably be longer than it needs to be, until you see how efficient this weed whacker is.  One other feature I appreciate is that the unit does not sound like a jet engine when you are trimming your ears. The trimmer motor is one of the quietest ones that I have used.  The unit is easily \\&quot;wash/rinse\\&quot; able; set it on the counter for an hour and you can toss in your travel bag. Although the build is sturdy, I wouldn&#x27;t trust it in soft checked luggage. I never check luggage, but that may be changing :-) For home use or road warriors, this is a very dependable companion.</li>
            <li> Working great. Painless hair trimming. Should have bought it years ago. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a series of cheapos (older wahl, etc.) my whole life. That being said, this trimmer is very fast and effective. The washable nature is an excellent idea and keeps it clean as long as you allow it to dry thoroughly. Works well along edges of goatee and mustache as well as rapidly and painlessly trimming the nose.</li>
            <li> Also an update of an older model and very happy with it.</li>
            <li> My Grand daughter tells me that I no longer have hair growing out of my nose, of course she says none on the top of my head either. Works easy &amp; well. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I bought it because of good reviews. I realized why it was good once it arrived. That is, the thickness of the metal protector around the blade, while hard, is very thin. This makes it cut as close as a shave. I saw at a local store other trimmers at a similar price but these all had a much thicker metal end. Talking here about the the thickness of the walls of the metal tube, not about the diameter.&lt;br /&gt;One tip though. When you put the batteries in - roll them several times while they are inside. This will strip the patina off the contacts. Otherwise the unit may have some trouble starting. This is totally normal for any new electrical &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34; where the contact surfaces are completely polished.</li>
            <li> I got this for hubby, when I handed him the package he felt it and thought I had gotten him a vintage Star Wars figure. He felt a little old and hairy when he saw what it was but then he realized, after we hit 40 he complains about stray hairs- well now he&#x27;s as perfectly ear and nose hairless as Luke Skywalker himself.</li>
            <li> I have owned several nose hair trimmers over the years and this one is the best nose hair trimmer ever! lol</li>
            <li> This razor works well for what it&#x27;s worth. But it doesn&#x27;t seem to turn very fast. I&#x27;m not sure if mine is underpowered or if it&#x27;s just the normal speed. And yes, my battery is fully charged. Will keep using it and try to update if it stop working for no reason. If it&#x27;s the normal speed, then it&#x27;s working perfectly because it cut what need to be cut. I keep it hidden because it&#x27;s not the most classy rasor to have.</li>
            <li> Good product. Does the job quickly and efficiently. It&#x27;s a bit noisy like an electric razor but that&#x27;s the only thing I can think of that&#x27;s bad about it.</li>
            <li> This i exactly what I expected. Works great, with a good price. I would recommend this to anyone, and would buy again if need be.</li>
            <li> This is very light, much lighter than my previous trimmer, so I was concerned if it would perform as well.  But it did a great job.  Evidently my blades on my old one had gotten dull, as this did a much better job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are various optional instructions on how to clean it, but I just plan on rinsing it with water like I did with my old one, and if I need to buy another one in a year or so, no big deal.  I have hair clippers, and I don&#x27;t use any oil or anything on them, just rinse with water, and they&#x27;ve held up for seven years now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little bigger than my old one, so it takes up more room in my hair cutting bag, and I don&#x27;t see the point of the curve in the handle.  But the only thing that matters really is how well it cuts the hair and it does that very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVISED ON 10/28/13:  This died on me six months after purchasing it.  Boo.</li>
            <li> This is a decent product. There are certainly much better ones on the market but they are also much pricier. This thing is of okay-good quality. It is worth the money spent if you are looking for an in-expensive trimmer.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and exactly as described.  Easy to use and clean, neat and quiet operation.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best trimmer I have had to date. It cuts close without cutting you. Its very easy to clean and dosent take up a lot of space in the drawer.</li>
            <li> Strongly suggest using Lithium batteries in this product,&lt;br /&gt;O.T.&lt;br /&gt;(as well as Smoke Detectors),change less often, and w/Alarms about triple the life of alkaline.Also for wall clocks.&lt;br /&gt;^They sell them here as most of you know.</li>
            <li> This is my second Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer!  I love it!  It really works, better than I had hoped for.  The first one I bought, a Wahl model# 5560, really disappointed me.  It was hit and miss with it, mostly miss.  I bought it because I have had a Whal mustache trimmer for many years. I love that trimmer. I have never needed to have it worked on or anything.&lt;br /&gt;  I use my Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer for my nose and ear trimming.  It never pulls the hair, any hair that gets in it&#x27;s way is a dead duck, PERIOD!  I even use it to trim my beard around my mouth.The sharp blades are nice and close to the edge of the opening, so I don&#x27;t have to guess how far in to push it before it starts to cut hairs, i can actually see it cut the hairs, as well as hear the cutting. The unit, itself is extremely quiet and really easy to clean!  Thankfully it is most definitely a keeper!  Thanks again, Panasonic, for another great product from you!!!</li>
            <li> My previous such tool ran off a AAA battery and really didn&#x27;t have much power.  This thing works much better and does what it says.  Easy to clean too.</li>
            <li> For 10 bucks, works great</li>
            <li> I used this product once to trim nose hair, and it did a very poor job.  The second time I tried to use it it would not work.  I changed batteries, and it still did not work.  This trimmer is a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after my husband used it one day. Really? His nose wasn&#x27;t that bad, maybe the battery needed to be changed. Nope. After fiddling with it, I got the motor to run then put it back together. It still doesn&#x27;t actually work - just sounds like it does.&lt;br /&gt; Here is the part where I complain that electronics are now made to last only a few months. Think of the landfills in 10 years. Eesch!  I chose this one because it was less expensive then others, but really even if I paid $30 for one it will still break within a year. It is pathetic. Back to scissors.</li>
            <li> I like the product, but was very disappointed that it did not come with a case.</li>
            <li> Well, this thing trims nose hair.  It does what I need it to do.  It doesn&#x27;t pull hairs out.  It has an ergonomic handle.  I dig it.  If you have a hairy nose then buy it, use it, love it. No if I could just get my dad to use one.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and clean (interesting to have multiple cleaning options), works well, compact, performs as advertised. Easy to replace battery.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this trimmer - Works as it was meant to work.</li>
            <li> Have nothing to compare this with as this is the first trimmer that I have ever bought but, however,&lt;br /&gt;it has done everything that I bought it to do and, I might add, with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Should have had one years ago.</li>
            <li> It works pretty good, seems nicely built.  Glad I bought it!  I like the washable feature, seems to really clean it out good.  Smooth cutting too.</li>
            <li> Cool device, it does what it says. Good on skin. No problem, Easy to operate. Good battery life. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I have a problem with certain hairs that grow in places that is too gross to mention. But this trimmer HELPED!!!!&lt;br /&gt;It seems after using this trimmer, I do not get nasil allergies like years before! I don&#x27;t sneeze no more!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Panasonic!!!!</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/Dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer works well for nose and ear hair. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
            <li> I love this nose trim, its very easy to use and a great price you cant go wrong, i highly recommend</li>
            <li> My husband never buy stuff for himself and even when I get things for him he always say either &amp;#34;I don&#x27;t know if it works, or it&#x27;s just okay&amp;#34; to me when I ask him.  But with this one he came  up to me and thanked me to buy it for him and said that it works really well even commented that it probably cost a lot but he doesn&#x27;t care because it&#x27;s well-made.  He&#x27;s not very techie nor handy, and this is simple to use I didn&#x27;t notice him struggling with it for the first time or anything...so I think it&#x27;s a great tool.</li>
            <li> I got this as a stocking stuffer for my husband and he loves it. He&#x27;s mentioned it a few times saying I love the nose trimmer you got. Great price and works well.</li>
            <li> This this works awesome, does a lot of neat tricks&lt;br /&gt;Nose trimming&lt;br /&gt;Mustache trimming&lt;br /&gt;Eyebrow trimming&lt;br /&gt;And the list goes on...&lt;br /&gt;No rust and waterproof</li>
            <li> The best trimmer on the market! Best one rated by Hammacher Schlemmer... I totally agree! Buy one!!!</li>
            <li> Hard to get too excited about a nose hair trimmer so can&#x27;t give five stars.&lt;br /&gt;It does the job and I would buy again because it works.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why it took me so long to buy this. I didn&#x27;t need it as much as some, but I needed it more than most. My breathing has become a revelation.</li>
            <li> Functions as it should. Seems to cut well and cleans easy.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  Easy to clean.  Very powerful..!  I like this hair and nose trimmer.  I will buy another one for a spare.</li>
            <li> This clipper replaced a previous unit that I had lost. It does a great job, and I especially like the &amp;#34;clean with water&amp;#34; feature. I would recommend this product for anyone that wants to groom their ear and nose hairs.</li>
            <li> use it weekly..best trimmer i have had..but it is not something you buy every day..i would recommend it particularly for guys like me who have a wife with a nose hair problem and will not admit it..but she steals it.</li>
            <li> Works good. Cleans easily. No problems so far.</li>
            <li> Works great, nice design, inexpensive</li>
            <li> This is an amazing device.  It trims nose and ear hairs easily, painlessly, and was a great price.  I have used it for a few months now and I can only say great things about it.  The build quality is good.</li>
            <li> I tried the trimmer as soon as I opened the package and it performed well. I like it and I recommend it.</li>
            <li> Purchased as a replacement and find this works better than the old trimmer. It doesn&#x27;t pull and does the job in a few seconds. Batteries seem to last forever.</li>
            <li> This tool is a man&#x27;s nose hair dream come true, for me.  When I got it I had some problems with break in, the tool wouldn&#x27;t work until I disassembled it and cleaned it.  Now it works great, it&#x27;s not for heavy grooming like a beard but nose or ear hair would be fine.  Cleanup is really easy, drop some liquid hand soap in on the closed setting, run for a short time then on the open setting rinse it out.  Over all I think this light duty tool will be able to tame my nose hairs for a long time.</li>
            <li> Another piece of made in China junk from Panasonic.  Yes, I followed the instructions exactly: yes I put in a new AA alkaline battery and yes it was totally dead.</li>
            <li> is not easy to use .&lt;br /&gt;Battery not included&lt;br /&gt;Razor not included.&lt;br /&gt;How i can get razor anyway ?</li>
            <li> does a great job getting my nose hears, i really just shove it up my nose and weed whack it around and i don&#x27;t get cut or any pulled hairs, not much to ask for beyond that.</li>
            <li> Worked great and is very quite</li>
            <li> very useful and good.</li>
            <li> works great. hubby likes it!</li>
            <li> Ugh, who wants to even think about this grooming issue. However, we eventually need to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an OK unit. I thought the slant might make it more efficient, with closer shaves to areas, but it does not. It also gets quite warm after using it for just a few minutes. Seems like I stand there grooming for ten minutes, and still can&#x27;t get at some of those pesky strays!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK if you don&#x27;t have another choice. I had tried several from our local Walmart that were worse than this one, but I liked my old, old Panasonic version better (but it finally wore out, heh).</li>
            <li> Great product and I have not had one issue with this trimmer. Though, I recommend that the batteries be changed out consistently, because if not, it&#x27;ll get ya!</li>
            <li> Does a great job trimming the hair in my ears.</li>
            <li> It worked OK for the first couple months then it got really loud. It&#x27;s headed for the trash. I expected better from Panasonic.</li>
            <li> still going , better than many reviews</li>
            <li> Well made and does a great job.</li>
            <li> does the trick, not much else to add.</li>
            <li> My husband really likes this product for his nose and ears. I am not sure if its a downfall with the product or just how often he uses it but we go through batteries like crazy</li>
            <li> Heats up rather quickly. Packaged perfectly. No other problems.</li>
            <li> Works well for about 2 months then stops.</li>
            <li> I like sticking this up my nose in the morning. It gets all the hair out. Warning, it may dry out your nostrils if u cut all the hair</li>
            <li> This far exceeded my expectations. It&#x27;s easy to use and cuts powerfully.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the unit. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ray Durham</li>
            <li> Works good. Easy to use and clean. Good value.</li>
            <li> when i first got it didn&#x27;t work i had to adjust the battery terminal for the battery to make contact.  other than that miscue has worked well.</li>
            <li> This has to be the best nose hair trimmer I have ever used. A terrific male grooming aid.</li>
            <li> Simple but great product</li>
            <li> easy, convenient and quiet</li>
            <li> This is a very handy personal grooming tool to have. Sure, scissors can do the same but this does make it easier and overall does a very good job. It&#x27;s very easy to load batteries as well as clearing the cutting head. A quick twist and then blow out the clippings - simple. When things are easy to use and easy to take care of they are in an overall sense - good.</li>
            <li> Panasonic you Finally came out with a decent product. You have had some of these made years ago that were not very good.  This one works Great. Keep up with making good products.</li>
            <li> This product worked very well 4 or 5 times, then broke, and I couldn&#x27;t get it to turn on, as if it had no power source.  New Batteries didn&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Works great. Easy to clean</li>
            <li> I tought it was made in japan but my mistake china:( , still doing job</li>
            <li> Works very well and haven&#x27;t had a problem in nearly 6 months.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it works....very efficient. The item arrived on time and was packaged perfectly. This is a great product</li>
            <li> This is a simple tool that works well and doesn&#x27;t cost much. I have owned another trimmer I got from Walmart that worked fine. I am happy to say that this one is even better and still cheap. It is a pretty powerful little tool and I have been pleasantly suprised at how well it takes care of nose hair and eyebrow hair alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also really easy to clean just twist off the head and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great price and a great value.</li>
            <li> Stopped working after 6 months.</li>
            <li> Note, I only use this product for my nose and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years I&#x27;ve used scissors to cut my nose hairs, which has lead to cuts and nicks.  I decided to finally get a trimmer when an ear hair spouted out and made me contemplate my own mortality.  I am getting older now and I must combat this with full force.  So I was searching through nose trimmers and couldn’t settle on one.  I&#x27;ve tried other versions in the past and it was always painful.  I decided to torture myself by reading the reviews; I for one don’t play the odds, I see 95 five star ratings and pay more attention to the one negative.  Of course I’d get the one that doesn’t work or malfunctions and rips part of your nose off.  Alas I settled on this gem solely on the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: The price, seriously we can all afford $12 bucks.  Also, it only works on one battery, so you’re not going to be breaking the bank on it.  The comfort with it is the best, a day later and I have no red marks or cut skin.  I can rub my nose freely without fear of a sharp unforgiving pain, one that I’m sure can only be rivaled to childbirth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It works on a battery.  ‘Now wait, didn’t you list that as a pro?’ Yes sure did, thanks for paying attention. Unfortunately this means the pain and anguish of dying battery will one day lead to an inevitable bloodbath.  Ok, more like a sharp pain and a realization to throw the battery out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: Buy it, it works comfortably and it’s cheap, can’t ask for much more.</li>
            <li> I tried this thing out and it will cut hair, at least for now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the parts on the product that I could see look very cheap.  The removeable blade is made of part plastic and part metal (the metal part does the actual cutting).  This blade assembly looks awfully flimsy.  I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to last very long.  The handle of the unit looks like it&#x27;s made of cheap plastic and attaches to the rest of the unit in a cheap way.  I&#x27;ll be surprised if the handle even stays attached for very long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I would recommend buying it at all.  I won&#x27;t take the trouble to return it unless it fails completely right away, but I would never buy anything else like it again if I could help it.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Does its job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;*Easy to clean.(wet or dry)&lt;br /&gt;*Great design&lt;br /&gt;*durable&lt;br /&gt;*easy to use&lt;br /&gt;*portable&lt;br /&gt;*minimum noise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li> It works good. does the job its supposed to do. It was a good value for its money. I still use it . I would recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> Very happy with item - works as described - glad I finally got around to purchasing it! Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be &amp;#34;Anonomous&amp;#34; so I can talk in public about nose hair!  I had hairs tickling the inside of my nostrils for years.  I tried to ignore them, pull them, clip them with cuticle scissors.  Never got the job done well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought this on a whim.  30 seconds after I started using it, I was done!  Tickling gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then the ears.  Quick, easy, perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best $13 bucks I&#x27;ve spent in a long time!!</li>
            <li> Great Experience.Prompt and correct delivery.</li>
            <li> Great product! There is no pain or discomfort and it can be easily cleaned. Yes, I totally recommend it :)</li>
            <li> I had another brand version that I had lost and was not super excited about this one.  However, this product is very good due to speed and power of it.  No heat, and not pulling.  Just trimming</li>
            <li> No complaints. Feels good in your hands and in general, glad I bought it. Would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> second one I bough and last one, stops working after 3-4 months of use.</li>
            <li> I have used many types of trimmers and this is the best one I&#x27;ve ever used. Blade is sharp and trims very close and doesn&#x27;t pull or cut skin. Use a fresh alkaline battery for best results as cheaper ones slow it down. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This item works fine but it wasn&#x27;t what I expected. (My own fault)  It takes a long long time to do what I want to do with it.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, but requires patience if you do it once a week. It can be cleaned using water very easily. It&#x27;s battery life is good 9running on the same one for 3 months now). It&#x27;s safe and you won&#x27;t feel uncomfortable or get teary eyes.</li>
            <li> This freaking nose hair cutter tickles my nose! I&#x27;m not sure what is happening, but I think it might be pulling my nose hair or shocking my nose! I get sudden pain occasionally from it cutting my nose hair. My only advice is to get as far away from this product as possible. There are better products out there that I had in the past, like Remmel? I think that&#x27;s what it is called, but I got it from Walmart. Although it didn&#x27;t last more than a year or two, at least it didn&#x27;t give me weird pain and unpleasant tickles in the nose. This is one of product with positive high reviews, but poor product.</li>
            <li> The lion tamer of facial hair.  This thing mows down and takes no prisoners.  Your wife and homosexual boyfriend will both thank you.</li>
            <li> It works as it described.&lt;br /&gt;Price of the product matches with its value. Wish it was design to carry two AA battery. But one battery also works good.</li>
            <li> Bought this at mass retail. Does a great job, but didn&#x27;t last. Then again, for the $20 I paid at the time, guess almost two years isn&#x27;t bad...par for the course given the quality (or lack thereof) of things these days.</li>
            <li> Until I purchased this product I have been using sizzers to trim nose hair.  Tired of sizzor cuts?  Get this product.  This Panasonic trimmer lives up to its high reviews.  It is awesome.  Easy to use.  Trims hair quickly.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Its ok. I find it has a hard time getting ear hair.</li>
            <li> Been using it for two months now, and it&#x27;s still working great. Good grip and very quiet motor. Unless you jam it directly into your ear (and why you&#x27;ll want to that, I don&#x27;t know) all you&#x27;ll hear is a soft hum.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and decided to give the Panasonic a try.  It does its job very well!</li>
            <li> weak,no power, useless,other reviews are WRONG, this has to be the second worst unit I have ever had. (remington worst)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jams and stops,blade is is a toy.</li>
            <li> Great trimmer, plenty strong for tougher hairs, no snagging, might buy another one for the future.</li>
            <li> It does what its supposed to do!</li>
            <li> I have only used it once but it was good and no complaints thus far. I would recommend it to anyone looking</li>
            <li> Trims perfectly... No nicks or scratches</li>
            <li> This thing will weedeat all the hairs out of your nose with no problem.  Does not grab / pull but only cut.  Also nice to be able to rinse it out when your done beofre putting it away.</li>
            <li> This product trims nosehair better than other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried. The first time I ordered it, the rest of my order came in but this product didn&#x27;t. I guess the warehouse guy was asleep that day.</li>
            <li> As we age, we sprout hair in the least sexy places.  This keeps it in its place, which is gone.  Just do it.  Works as advertised.</li>
            <li> You cannot find a better trimmer that is as efficient, quiet &amp;amp; gets the job done than this one!&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many and this one beats them all in all categories!&lt;br /&gt;My last Trimmer is Twelve years old and was purchased at a Base Exchange where I had very little variety to chose from!&lt;br /&gt;Yet it is quite similar for the age. You will see it in the photo along side my new Panasonic Trimmer! I will never own another brand!</li>
            <li> It appears to be much better than the last trimmer I had, but have not used it but a few times.&lt;br /&gt;Will give it thumbs up for now.</li>
            <li> Works great and as expected.</li>
            <li> Great at what it does. Love the cleaning system</li>
            <li> product works well but feels a little cheap. I like it but i do not think it will last very long.</li>
            <li> Great product, works well! Highly recommended. Is very precise and fast. Easy to pack for travel and isn&#x27;t heavy. Had it about a week.</li>
            <li> Had a hard time finding a product that would take care of the nose and ear hairs my 66 year old body was experiencing.  Can&#x27;t stop them from growing, but now have a reasonable way to remove.  Tried several other &amp;#34;similar&amp;#34; products, but none work as well as this brand.  jc</li>
            <li> Not sure what you can say about an inexpensive device like this. It works. It does what they said it would.</li>
            <li> This worked fine but after 9 months of light use, it just stopped working.  New batteries did not solve the problem. Time to try a different brand.</li>
            <li> My husband says this works perfectly.  No worries about cuts or nicks.  It does the job as described.  Good purchase</li>
            <li> Disappointed, after so many great reviews. Not able to get it to actually work. At least it didn&#x27;t cost a lot, otherwise I&#x27;d be upset.</li>
            <li> A not bad as we put in maind the price paid... I was expecting something batter but so far its okay</li>
            <li> Very good product. Too bad it didn&#x27;t last long. 2 months and then broke up for no reason.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used several trimmers and while the blades eventually become dull and render the trimmer useless, Panasonic makes the best trimmers.  They do a very good job cutting hair although one must move slowly and I don&#x27;t have a major nose hair issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One must change the angle of the trimmer frequently but that has been the case with all trimmers.  The Panasonic has a very high velocity of blade spin making a pulled hair very rare.</li>
            <li> I am satisfied with this wet/dry personal shaver, but wish it cut hairs a little closer than it does.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Works on ears and nose. Stays charged for a long time. Still works 2 years later!</li>
            <li> The unit stopped working after less than 10 uses.  I used it for maybe less than three months.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> A bit bulkier than expected, when compared to another Panasonic hair remover I had owned before, but works fine</li>
            <li> Yes, it is as described. I like it.</li>
            <li> Good, good and good. It&#x27;s really easy to clean too. I used three different products but this is the best one so far.</li>
            <li> This is the second one I have bought.  Works OK</li>
            <li> Disclaimer: I bought this through other&#x27;s account so I&#x27;m not marked as &amp;#34;Amazon Verified Buyer&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve bought it for a few weeks, and by far it works pretty well: clean enough, quiet, won&#x27;t hurt me, and inexpensive. It has clean feature but I haven&#x27;t got a chance using it.</li>
            <li> works well for the nose, long lasting battery. Its simple and ready to use. A recommended product for a mans grooming kit.</li>
            <li> Just about right for the price and actually it is exaclty what I was looking for, it was a gift for my brother and he loves it. Thank you very much.</li>
            <li> I have had a few of these before, but this one you can clean with water, and it&#x27;s been great so far. Why I say &amp;#34;so far&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;is because the actual &amp;#34;razor&amp;#34; that cuts could rust, or simply get dull, but I do like this one, and if it lasts it will out do the others, and Panasonic is a solid company.</li>
            <li> Does not do even a decent job.  DO NOT BUY!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great product enjoyed very much quieter doesn&#x27;t hurt my ears with the  noise</li>
            <li> I bought the same nose trimmer 15 years ago from Panasonic. This new version is a little more stylistic, but it has the same quality as my old one. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great. Never had one before and nothing to compare it to.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product and only got to use it once.  I washed it out, and put it away.  When I tried to use it a second time, the blades wouldn&#x27;t spin.  Device just got really warm.  Returned it and Amazon issued a refund (hassle-free, thanks amazon).  This doesn&#x27;t seem to be a common problem, but I just thought I&#x27;d share my experience with it.</li>
            <li> I am happy with the performance of this product. It functioned as intended and performed as advertised. Whisked the nose and ear hairs away without a problem, and that&#x27;s why I bought it...so I&#x27;m happy. Recommend.</li>
            <li> Works!  Cleans nicely by switching to water cleaning mode, works great.  I had others, some with C batteries, but this unit works best.</li>
            <li> Who really wants to acknowledge a nose hair trimmer as an essential grooming tool? However, this thing is a beauty. Small, effective, and really well designed.</li>
            <li> great item for the price. Gets job done and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this purchase, a great trimmer and good price...It does a superb job !&lt;br /&gt;  Buy this Panasonic , it has a dual edge  blade  a must for a good and precise  cut .&lt;br /&gt;  and stay away from those cheap trimmers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Amazon !!...it supposed to come in five days but came in  three days ..What else can i say ,You have  another loyal customer</li>
            <li> Works well, but it doesn&#x27;t feel strong or like it is going to last. Have used it a handful of times and no problems yet. As long as it holds up it is worth the price.</li>
            <li> Works great, does what it&#x27;s supposed to…</li>
            <li> This trimmer works much better than my old one</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made in China, but with Panasonic&#x27;s name on it, it has to meet higher engineering and manufacturing standards than most made-in-China junk. Replacement blades are supposedly available, but I couldn&#x27;t find any part numbers on any websites. But, for $12.48, it&#x27;s not a big deal. The trimmer does what it is supposed to do and will probably do so for several years.</li>
            <li> at a low price, it is reasonable effective in solving problems that aren&#x27;t easy i.e men&#x27;s nose hair.so far, it has been durable.</li>
            <li> Seems so be effective at removing unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Works great so far. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Man Ive had two Ear and Facial hair removers. On from Sharper Image, And the other for a no name company.&lt;br /&gt;Both can apart and stopped working. The&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ER-GN30-K is the best.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s designed and made externally well.&lt;br /&gt;And has lot&#x27;s of power to spare.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is so easy.&lt;br /&gt;And I like the curved handle.&lt;br /&gt;The is the best deal and quality to match.</li>
            <li> is a ok item still too much money as a bundle deal,should be less as a bundle deal wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> This  &amp;#34;baby&amp;#34; is the real McCoy....cuts through hair w/o pulls or tears. Anyone writing bad reviews must have silver-back gorillas as first cousins !!</li>
            <li> Great product. Works as expected. Bought this to replace a more expensive one that broke and this works just as well</li>
            <li> It cuts better than the 4 other brands I tried.&lt;br /&gt;I only wish I could find one that cuts even better.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other nose hair trimmers, so I can&#x27;t compare it to others in terms of speed/battery-charge/ease-of-use, but it definitely works.</li>
            <li> My wife commandeered mine, so now we have two of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works great.  Removes small hairs from small areas inaccessible to scissors, such as ears canals.  My wife uses it for areas where there are small, difficult to get at, unwanted individual hairs (such as eyebrows - what were you thinking? haha).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit does get warm with some continuous use, but this normal, just in case you were wondering.  In fact, it feels good in the ear. hahaha</li>
            <li> I put the battery in this and tried to use it and the tip fell off.  Now I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s together again.  Can&#x27;t really see how this works and it doesn&#x27;t do a good job cutting the hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby, but have enjoyed using it myself! As others have stated, its quiet, easy to use and to clean, &amp; doesn&#x27;t pinch! Its light to handle, &amp; the construction is just right - simple; cap fits well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nose hairs were easily banished, &amp; I used it for a chin &amp; upper lip cleanup - perfect! We&#x27;ve had the trimmer for 3 weeks; I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll put it to many more uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Service was fast too!</li>
            <li> Nothing worse than tiny nose hairs blowing around in my nose as I breathe.  This tool cuts them out easily and cleans easily.  I got one for the car too.</li>
            <li> This thing is a little champion. I was using a less sophisticated nose trimmer, which was decent, but required turning and angling to get at the nasal hairs. The Panasonic makes the job very easy. Panasonic is an amazing company.</li>
            <li> I guess OK ; never had/used one before.</li>
            <li> Solid product that works as expected for a good price. I recommend.</li>
            <li> I like it&lt;br /&gt;is a very good product,&lt;br /&gt;ship fast.&lt;br /&gt;and get the job done, you will not be disappointed, when you tried it.&lt;br /&gt;plus you dont fell it pulling  your hair.</li>
            <li> First, this groomer is powerful enough to get the job done. This is the first time I&#x27;ve used a trimmer and I love it. This works well, better than the mangroomer one I had before</li>
            <li> Fabulous little tool, no longer do I have ugly hairs coming out of my nose. This tool gets up into the nostril, clips the hairs before they can be seen. It&#x27;s easy, painless. And for a mere $12, can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> It meets the expectation and good price. It has been working fine a few months since purchased, and I was satisfied. But it totally stopped to work and now out of warranty. I&#x27;m trying to replace it, but hard to reach the manufacturer. How can I move forward?</li>
            <li> This trimmer worked great.  Removed easily and painlessly. Bought another for a gift.</li>
            <li> Arrived DOA, I reserve judgment.</li>
            <li> Excellent&lt;br /&gt;Great price</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this may way work well for nose and ears, but if you&#x27;re looking for a good bum hair trimmer GET SOMETHING ELSE! Let me tell you, this is an awful bum trimmer. It pulls and rips like it hates you because you&#x27;re late with its money. I&#x27;d give this 0 stars, but 1 is the lowest like how my bum feels now because of the violent thrashing it just took.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signed: my sore bum</li>
            <li> This is the second one that he has had over four years.  I, actually, dropped the other one on accident while cleaning off the counter and dented the end.  Thank goodness he is now back in action.</li>
            <li> I left it with original pack for couple of weeks, then I started using it.&lt;br /&gt;It is not working after one week, changed battery but still not working.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It works well enough, but it seems like it&#x27;s struggling after a few uses. I have pretty bodacious nose hair, but that&#x27;s why I need this tool in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wont be surprised when it gives up the ghost.</li>
            <li> It worked well for about 6 times, then just stopped working.  Research on the internet reveled this to be a common problem.  Although i had recently purchased it, Panasonic said they would fix it only if i paid the shipping to Texas, which would have cost a significant percent of just buying one from another manufacturer.  So, bad product, bad service.</li>
            <li> Great product.  Arrived fast and works as advertised.  I would buy again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband when his old one finally died after 15 years.  This one is great.  Hubby says it works great and the price was good.  Hope it lasts as long as the last one.</li>
            <li> Only used once, but did a good job. Definitely a good price. All the ones I have previously bought cost about $20 and the batteries wore out fast.</li>
            <li> Works well. I like the rotary action but wish a device could have a combination of rotary and &#x27;scissor shave&#x27; action.</li>
            <li> Simple , does it what it promises. Takes me 10 seconds to  clip hair - and another 10 secs to clean the device. Perfect.</li>
            <li> Perhaps it is just because my old hair trimmer was crummy, but this one is SUPER!  Also, it&#x27;s so much quieter—which is really helpful when trimming the ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is powered by a regular battery; which is SUPERIOR to the units with a &amp;#34;charging base.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Worked great at first.  Problem is it died after the second use!! Tried replacing batteries a couple of times and managed to get started again just once but, hasn&#x27;t worked since. Not sure if I got a lemon or, just have unusually strong nose hair.  Needless to say its going in the trash.</li>
            <li> As good as advertised.</li>
            <li> I am a man and I have nose hair. THERE I SAID IT!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate having a long hair or two stick out of my nose. I look like a hobo. I bought this to take care of that. Previously, I would actually be able to grab that lone long hair with tweezers and pull it. But my GOD that hurts!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing works and so far the battery lasts pretty good. But the overall &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of my nose hair is now weird. I imagine that girls shaving their legs feel this way before they get used to it... As the hair grows back, if you scratch your nose (or lets be honest, go digging for gold), you&#x27;ve got these odd little prickly hairs in there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it, but prepare to adjust to those little hairs looking &amp; feeling weird if you don&#x27;t use it constantly.</li>
            <li> Works great and for $9.99 its a steal. This is a great product, much better compare to Wahl and Remington when it come to quality.</li>
            <li> Exactly what was needed. Very satisfied with product.</li>
            <li> I can easily say this is the best, in this price bracket anyway, trimmer I have ever used.  Easy to clean, great instructions....</li>
            <li> My only regret is not buying one sooner.</li>
            <li> Works very well for an inexpensive item.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like a million samurai ninjas slicing up your nose forrest.</li>
            <li> Works great, keeps those unsightly hairs in check. Take that unsightly hairs! I cut you! I love that it runs on a AA battery and doesn&#x27;t need to be charged.</li>
            <li> This little guy is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve found yet. Won&#x27;t pull your nose hair.</li>
            <li> I use and like this. I like the fact that I can get in close tight spots and don&#x27;t have to worry about getting cut. It&#x27;s comfortable to use. I only gave it 4 stars because it doesn&#x27;t always trim that close and it lacks power. One pen light battery isn&#x27;t enough to really make this work to it&#x27;s full potential. It seems to sound like its struggling to cut. Over all it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much fun to use!</li>
            <li> I have used many trimmers and i will say that this one is  the most comfortable, but they still just dont seem to do as great of a job as they all claim to do. Of the rest that i have used, this is probably the best. Still doesnt live up to my, apparently high, standards though.</li>
            <li> Husband loves it and may buy one for myself.</li>
            <li> Very efficient and light.....easily cleaned and washed!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Cleaning too complicated and time consuming.  Never used them...  I returned product after learning how tedious and time consuming cleaning would be.  I&#x27;m using another brand that&#x27;s very good, powerful and battery will probably last 4-6 months.  Cleaning this other brand is as simple as wiping it on cotton towel and your done.</li>
            <li> Crap, stopped working after a couple of uses. One of my worse purchases from amzn.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, transaction, and delivery!</li>
            <li> I like this way this works, but can&#x27;t give it five stars because the previously one died before I thought it should. Replace batteries, made sure the contacts were clean---still no go, so had to replace it.</li>
            <li> Lasted me 9 months but now won&#x27;t turn on, even with a fresh battery. After calling, Panasonic will fix it under the two year warranty, but they won&#x27;t cover shipping to them, so it&#x27;ll be just as expensive to ship as it is to buy a new one. Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Worked great for 1 year. Blades are Starting to lock up. Would recommend another blade. Or just buy new for 20 bucks. But it did it&#x27;s jobs.</li>
            <li> This thing rocks. It&#x27;s cheap, but only in price. I&#x27;ve had mine for a couple years now and it works great. Easily washable and great battery life. I&#x27;d buy another in a heartbeat, if it ever dies.  Update: It died after 3.5 years. Not sure what happened, it was just dead. I bought another because it&#x27;s still the best one I&#x27;ve used. Never pulls a hair.</li>
            <li> Item broke after a few months of use.</li>
            <li> This is junk.  If I could, I would give 0 stars. I turn it on, nothing happens. Sometimes after I smack it against my hand several times it will start or if I take the top off it will start and I then put the top on after. I then try trimming.  When it comes in contact with a hair, it stops and pulls and tugs on the hair and then may slowly and painfully pull it out. It is less painful to quickly pull the hair out with tweezers. I called customer support and was told to mail it to a service center? That will cost half of what I paid for it.</li>
            <li> The product does everything it advertises -- just hope it lasts a long time.  It is simple to use and simple to clean.  It does not pull or cause any nicks.  It is a blessing not use a small scissors again!!  I highly recommend this product for the results and the reasonable price.</li>
            <li> It does what it says. Gets those nose hairs without hesitation.</li>
            <li> Met all expectations. More quiet and easier to handle than an older Panasonic model I owned. Also packs better in my travel shaving kit.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer of this type that I have ever owned.</li>
            <li> Trims hairs well. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer it is a battery eater though</li>
            <li> This is my second trimmer, after the first bit the dust after long use.  I have tried several trimmers, and this is the best I have found.</li>
            <li> Battery (I believe one &amp;#34;AAA&amp;#34;) drains very quickly. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d purchase again if given a &amp;#34;Mulligan&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It worked well. I used it about once a week. It only lasted for about six months though. It just stopped working one day. I would pass on this item if I were you.</li>
            <li> its decent for the price. I wish it was not battery powered.</li>
            <li> Good quality build, but doesn&#x27;t seem as powerful as I&#x27;d hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;Also doesn&#x27;t have anything for sideburn trimming or moustache grooming.&lt;br /&gt;Ear Hair, Nose Hair, that&#x27;s it.&lt;br /&gt;On that front it does it&#x27;s job well, but I&#x27;ve had little knock-off non-branded trimmers do the same thing for half the price.&lt;br /&gt;If this one lasts twice as long as those, then it might earn another star... Time will only tell.</li>
            <li> I had another trimmer with an exposed blade. I had to be very careful not to hurt myself. This one is safe and it never pulled the hair.</li>
            <li> Had my doubts but this this is AWESOME.  Much better than an older style I had.  Great buy.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but I&#x27;m not sure how long it&#x27;s going to last for. Also, sometimes it&#x27;s pulls nose hair a little bit, so be prepared for that.</li>
            <li> Over the years I have used several other trimmers, including Conair, Remington and Wahl.  This one is by far the best I have ever used.  It cuts closer than any other I have had.  It&#x27;s quieter, cleans easily and handles nicely.  I have not needed to change the battery.  Other units I have used needed battery changes at least weekly.  I&#x27;ve had it about two weeks and I plan to order another just in case something happens to this one.</li>
            <li> Goods as described, fast delivery! I rather!</li>
            <li> tried a million different models and brands but this was the best.  It gets the hair every time with no pulling or pinching.</li>
            <li> Never owned a trimmer before. It works ok. Misses a few here and there. Have to go over a few times. Will see how durable it will be. Fairly cheap so I didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
            <li> The trimmer died after a couple of weeks. I changed the batteries but that wasn&#x27;t the issue, the issue was that it just doesn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> Functional, reasonable priced. Seems a little fragile, I am always afraid of breaking it. But, it works and i&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Lightweight, sturdy and easy to use and clean.  It seems very safe and is comfortable. Fact is, it is kind of amazing how well it works.</li>
            <li> This thing works well, and is a good price. I have used mine about 6 times so far and I still like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine a year and it&#x27;s still going strong.</li>
            <li> This is the best i have owned.Quiet and soft to both ears and nose.&lt;br /&gt;The tip  feels so soft you hardly feel it.(unlike those cheap noisy ones)&lt;br /&gt;I use it mostly for my ears(dry mode not in the shower),last thing you want in your 50&#x27;s-60&#x27;s is a buzz of high decibels taking out what little hearing you have left.&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed and even more,at this price makes it an affordable must have&lt;br /&gt;My advise is try it,you wont regret it</li>
            <li> This item was purchased as a gift for my Mother. She has yet to use it so I can not comment on its operation. I will say the item was received quickly and packaging was ample to keep from shipping damage.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t review the packaging and shipping as I did not order this product from Amazon, I simply saw it in my mom&#x27;s cabinet and decided, hey why not? I have nose hairs so why not use it? And I did. And I&#x27;m so glad, I had long nose hairs as I&#x27;ve never trimmed them before and I&#x27;m lucky my mom had this, it worked so well that I just had to take some time off from my Saturday and review it, and plus, the best part of this trimmer, NO PAIN!! 😄</li>
            <li> finally !!! something reliable I can use anytime, great product</li>
            <li> Had one for years and it quit working. I am very pleased with this one...</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a powerhouse. It&#x27;s been working great for over a year. Easy to clean too. It wasn&#x27;t very useful for my ears, but I bought it for my nose.</li>
            <li> Excellent item. Would recommend this. Prompt shipment.</li>
            <li> This is a great product and so easy to use.</li>
            <li> it works great and gets the job done. its not painful at all no pulling very portable! the best part is its so easy to clean! its a matter of seconds! I would recommend this product all my friends</li>
            <li> It came quickly.  Shame on Pansonic putting its good name on a cheap thing from China, no battery and I don&#x27;t have any way to get to a store for batteries for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was terrible, almost impossible to open, but shears, not scissors finally did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions failed to say batteries were not supplied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep it and HOPE I can find batteries, find out how to insert them and try to resolve no more China stuff.</li>
            <li> Every low-cost nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve tried pull the hairs out rather than trimming. Then comes this nifty gadget which does the job perfectly. No pain, all gain, easy to clean. Now people look in my eyes instead of drifting down to those unsightly fibers coming out of my shnoz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about this mange...</li>
            <li> Have had some of these prior to this one, but it is the best. I like the fact it is not rechargeable but uses a AA battery.</li>
            <li> This is the second Panasonic trimmer I have purchased - the first one I dropped five feet onto a tile floor directly on the head. It still worked but was bent enough to cause a lot of noise and I couldn&#x27;t get the hardened steel head aligned back out properly due to the close tolerances with the blades inside. So I bought another one since they are actually quite inexpensive. I use rechargeable batteries and they seem to work just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is pretty quiet, does a good trim on nose hair, the errant eyebrow hairs, inside my deep chin dimple and the occasional trim around the edge of my ears. It is ergonomic, has a nice cover to protect the head, can be washed under running water. I recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> its ok.  i got a free Remington one that works way better.</li>
            <li> I was affraid of buying an article like this. I was affraid to be hurt. I have used it for a couple of times and I&#x27;m complete satisfied with its performance. It&#x27;s easy to use; safe; light; and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> I use this for trimming nose hair and occasionally eyebrows. It gets a close cut, without ever cutting your skin. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean!</li>
            <li> The Trimmer while not perfect is still deserving of a very good rating. I would definitely recommend this product to everyone.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really work as well as described. I&#x27;m a normal 3rd generation Irish Californian American with probably less hair than my New York counterparts. I am still waiting for the perfect nose hair/ear hair trimmer. I know scientists are working on curing AIDS and Cancer but if they could just take one week and work with engineers to design a better nose hair trimmer the world would be a better place.</li>
            <li> Heck, never thought I&#x27;d NEED one!  Nose hair is one of those things dad never said anything about...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well, is of good build quality, and so far is the best nose hair trimmer I&#x27;ve used (I&#x27;ve tried two electric and three manual prior to this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only &amp;#34;warning&amp;#34; I&#x27;d give is that the first couple of times I used it, it felt almost like it was shocking my nose - it wasn&#x27;t electrical to be sure - probably just because it happens to be much more powerful than any others I&#x27;ve used before.  That feeling stopped after the second or third session, once I got used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Huh... never thought I&#x27;d write a review for a nose hair trimmer, either(!)</li>
            <li> So far I have nothing to say bad about this product. It really is water proof. And it really does cut and clean out nose and ear hair very fast and easy. Works great and very glad I purchased it. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and clips nicely. I have another brand that&#x27;s noisy and tugs on the hair for time to time. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome addition to my line of personal hygiene gadgets and bathroom showcase.</li>
            <li> Works as described, worth the price.</li>
            <li> Awesome!  Best nose trimmer I&#x27;ve ever bought .. very powerful and easy to clean!</li>
            <li> For some God-Only-Knows reason, when I hit the age of 40 the &amp;#34;grow ear hair&amp;#34; gene in my body decided to kick into overdrive. Kinda gross-- If I hadn&#x27;t been trimming on a regular basis I would have enough ear hair now to easily braid them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those small grooming scissors were terrible at getting at any but the longest of hairs and was very awkward and sometimes painful to use.  I&#x27;ve tried several other models of electric trimmers bought at local big box stores, but while they did OK starting out, they tended to fall apart after a few months of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much to my joy, I&#x27;ve found that this bad boy really gets the job done!  The ear hair gets chopped and I can open it up to clean it out without worry if it will ever get back together again.</li>
            <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to and it easy cleaning. Absolutely no issues. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and very effective.</li>
            <li> i needed a new nose trimmer. i chose this panasonic to do the trick for me.  it was a good choice.  this nose trimmer does a great job and the price is great.  i would highly recommend this nose groomer to anyone looking to buy a groomer, go with this one and you will have no regrets!</li>
            <li> I personally bought this for nose hair and nothing else&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use traditionally small scissors to cut my noise hairs but i would never get all of them and them i would leave them &#x27;&#x27;spiky&#x27;&#x27; so it wasn&#x27;t all too effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This device trims the hairs perfectly and its pretty safe unless you really dig the device so close to your skin. It only requires 1 AA battery which would last you a while unless you are a hairy person who grows nose hairs like a jungle. I personally only use this once a week  other males who are as hairy as bears may may to use it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I figure this would work perfectly for people who grow a lot of hair in ears i have yet to give that a try because i actually lack hair there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device for only $10ish is a good investment to get rid of nose hairs, however this does get fairly hot in the first  90 seconds orso.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is a simple as rising the head and lower body with a bit of water and soap and then i just simply brush off any extra hairs with the small brush that was included in the box</li>
            <li> Works great...and inexpensive</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for at least a year and use it about once a  month.  So far it&#x27;s held up pretty well on the original battery.  I use it primarily to cut nose hair and it gets the job done. It seems to take a while and you really have to rotate it around to get all of the hair which is why I only give it 5 stars.  It also works well on ear hair.</li>
            <li> Good product.  Does the job as expected and it comes at a great price.  I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Have used a few trimmers in my day and this particular trimmer stands out so far as being designed to be the most useful of the bunch. I really like the way it comes apart for easy cleaning. It is efficient and affective and easy to use and feels more stout in the hand than most trimmers I have used in the past.</li>
            <li> Good product. Works well</li>
            <li> Works great and holds a charge for a long time.</li>
            <li> This REALLY does the trick!!</li>
            <li> Works well.  H2O auto-cleaning feature is a nice added bonus. .</li>
            <li> Silent, smooth, and does not hurt!  This is my second Panasonic trimmer. This replaced the one that I broke when dropped.</li>
            <li> So far no issues, battery life seems really good, tip comes off easy for cleaning</li>
            <li> This is a very nice trimmer. Does not pull at all , is simple to clean, and is rather quiet for something you jam up your nose. Which One can do with out fear as this will not pinch or pull. Might have a slight oil smell at the start but after a couple uses it will fade away. Byproduct of a new item.</li>
            <li> stopped working after few weeks</li>
            <li> Just works, would purchase again!</li>
            <li> Felt very cheap when i first got it. The power was pretty weak, changed batteries and still didn&#x27;t work that well. It got the job done so I kept using it. Should have returned right away because within about 3 months it just stopped working completely.</li>
            <li> Good value.  Does the job I purchased it for... nose hair.  Never has nipped or cut me.  Still on first battery.  Wish I had gotten one years ago.</li>
            <li> It really works well.</li>
            <li> Cleans up easily and battery life has been great</li>
            <li> somehow it is  not like one I had before... but it works...&lt;br /&gt;so it is ok..&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied..&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#62;L</li>
            <li> Buy it NOW. Its cheap and works very well and is well built and it is like $10</li>
            <li> These trimmers arrived on time and as described.  I am quite impressed with their quality.  The cutting is sharp and accurate.  The trimmers have a quiet operation.  They are also easy to use.  The quality feels as if they will last a long time.  I would highly recommend these for anyone needing to trim facial hair.</li>
            <li> Takes some work to get the hair out of the nose but it does get most of it out. For the hairs that lie flat against the skin inside the nostril, like mine, it has a hard time getting to them. I usually go all over as much as I can and it gets most hair out. It does a good job. I haven&#x27;t used it in the shower though. Not sure I want to test the wet/dry feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Batteries seem to last long. I&#x27;ve had it for a few months and used it a few times. The battery I put in (uses 1 AA battery) has lasted the whole time and it seems like it&#x27;s going strong still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can be a little difficult to clean. I usually shake it out but maybe rinsing it would be easier. Haven&#x27;t tried that though. The top end of it comes off easily when you twist it off to clean it. But it does stay on very well when using it. Most hairs get pulled into the top part. Some get whisked out and about but it&#x27;s not messy. Just shaking it out with the top part off usually gets all of it out but the blade can pop out when you do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I&#x27;m pretty happy with it.</li>
            <li> Compared to cheap Chinese one I had:&lt;br /&gt;1. A lot more acoustically pleasing -- not so loud..&lt;br /&gt;2. Actually cuts the hair instead of pulling it out -- no pain at all&lt;br /&gt;3. Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to use exclusively on my disgusting nose hair. Let me first say that I used to wax my entire body once a month to include my nose but the cost was astronomical. I wasn&#x27;t expecting any trimmer to come close to what a waxing job can do but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer works fantastically!!! I was truly impressed. It didn&#x27;t hurt and got the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions state that the trimmer may get warm as it is used. In my case (probably due to so much hair) the trimmer did indeed get warm but it wasn&#x27;t uncomfortable or anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed the trimmer as stated by instructions and was pleasantly mortified by all the hair that washed down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will most likely purchase one for all my family members for Xmas.</li>
            <li> This thing is pretty nice. Gets in to spots in my nose and ears that other trimmers could not reach. I really like that it can be washed out in a few seconds. Also looks like the blade can be replaced. Hope it doesn&#x27;t cost more than the unit itself.  Update: noticed that if running for a while the units motor starts to drop rpm speed. I have to shake it every so often to get the rpms back up to speed. Not really sure what thats all about but for now I can live with it.</li>
            <li> battery always get acid everywhere, tip clogs slows the speed</li>
            <li> Best nose and ear hair trimmer.  My husband loves it.</li>
            <li> Works, better than in store ones</li>
            <li> I loved this so much when I received this as a gift that I bought this for someone else as a gift!  It is so easy to use and it never grabs the hair.  Easy to clean and is great quality.</li>
            <li> A very fine substitute for pulling nose hairs.  Ouch....  Once the hair that used to be on my head, somehow decided to migrate to my nose and other places, I was needing to find this item.  I can&#x27;t add to the discussion of durability but for the time I&#x27;ve had it, I wouldn&#x27;t send it back.</li>
            <li> excellent product. true description.</li>
            <li> Great value, quality, and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Pulled nose hairs too much</li>
            <li> Absolutely horrible product.  Has done nothing but cut up the interior of my nose over and over.  Even the lowest setting is not good.  I do nit recommend this to anyone unless they enjoy pain and agony.</li>
            <li> Excellent item.  Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Were do I begin. Well this little guy is light, quite, and fairly easy to clean. However, after my first use the trimmer will suddenly die and stop working (snagging on skin and on hairs) and doesn&#x27;t seem to pick up small fine hairs. But as far as cutting the hairs, it does just fine.</li>
            <li> this is the one grooming device every man should have. to all my fellow men get this superb Panasonic and be sexy once again.</li>
            <li> Am returning my second one with the same problems.  It is under-powered and or has a short.  The result is that it pulls hair more the cutting it, which can be/is painful?  I had an earlier version which was fine, and am baffled by all the glowing reviews on this one?  It is over-hyped crap.</li>
            <li> My first nose hair trimmer, works great.&lt;br /&gt;Does tickle tho.</li>
            <li> Great product. I had my last one 10 years before buying a new one. I would buy it again</li>
            <li> Sturdy and works as advertised.</li>
            <li> It stopped working after a month.  I got maybe 5 uses out of it and then noticed there was a battery leak.  Even after replacing the battery, it started working intermittently and eventually died.  I am not looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> blade wears out in a couple of wks . 2nd one I&#x27;ve owned MUST be something better out there</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t even work when I got it, fit wonderfully in the trash.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good trimmer, a little lite n very&lt;br /&gt;Quite, easy to clean, recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing, works perfectly up to expectations.</li>
            <li> Great price, love this</li>
            <li> Works pretty good for average size nostrils. Nothing I can really complain about. And it does use standard batteries, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> I just received this product and tried it for the first time. I&#x27;ve never used one before and can&#x27;t compare it to any others. It is simple to use and seems to work just fine. It&#x27;s pretty quiet and makes way less noise than my beard trimmer. I don&#x27;t know how long it will last, but so far so good. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> like the water clean out fearure</li>
            <li> It gets the hair in the center, but some nose hair on the side on the outer doesn&#x27;t get caught into the cutter.  Also, the trimmer pretty much wants to YANK OUT your hair rather than cut.  You can feel it trying to pull.</li>
            <li> I use this for those pesky nose hairs that my wife likes to pull out with tweezers.  This is a ton less painful.  I&#x27;ve used t three times in my nose and it works as advertised.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt, the hairs cut very easily.  It&#x27;s super easy to use.  I LOVE that it&#x27;s washable so it&#x27;s quick to clean.  I&#x27;d highly recommend this to anyone consider using tweezers instead!</li>
            <li> great...does work GREAT</li>
            <li> The first time I used it was like using a new lawn mower on a lawn that hadn&#x27;t been mown in months. And the trimmer went through it all like a hot knife through butter.  It can also be used to remove excess body hair, but it takes a long time.  It took me four hours just to do my girlfriend&#x27;s back.</li>
            <li> better than most of the similar products that i had used.</li>
            <li> Do the work not great though.</li>
            <li> Great product, work as intended. No complains so far!</li>
            <li> This thing is great.  Works well and is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Good quality trimmer. Easy to clean and trims to the roots with no pulling.</li>
            <li> I felt so old when I HAD to buy one of these :-(  But, I totally love this. It works great.</li>
            <li> This unit works very well, zips away unwanted hair quickly and cleans in a snap!    Rating of the Panasonic vs my old Remington Wet/Dry  Panasonic 10  Remington 0    Save time, Save money, Look Good!</li>
            <li> Does just what it&#x27;s suppose to do.</li>
            <li> Works great , does a good job</li>
            <li> Wow. No more pain. Fast and easy. Best money spent.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly,  cuts without pulling.  Decent for the price.  Still looking for the trimmer that cuts closer.</li>
            <li> Best quality for the money ever</li>
            <li> what to say.. easy to get those pesky nose and ear hairs out !!!</li>
            <li> Work as good as a 13 dollar product should</li>
            <li> Seemed to work pretty slick so far. Quiet and clean</li>
            <li> Does the job but has a funky smell.  Perhaps a oily smell, if that make sense?  I have to hold my breath when I use it and quickly clean out my nose before taking a breath in, or else I get sickened by the smell.</li>
            <li> this item is a piece of junk.  I used it 3 or 4 times and it stopped running.  It is cheaply made and you should think twice about buying it</li>
            <li> excellent- this is that- what i wanted. Thanx amazon</li>
            <li> Works well , good little trimmer for ear and nose hairs.</li>
            <li> I am a woman and I use this for my nose hairs and eyebrows too. It works really nice. Very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Works even better than expected. Bought a second one</li>
            <li> After a few uses the blade popped out of its place. It makes a grinding noise, cuts the skin on the inside of my nose and won&#x27;t trim effectively. That&#x27;s what I get for going with the lowest cost option.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t last long,  but I was using it to trim the hair in my poodle&#x27;s feet, which is not what it was designed to do.</li>
            <li> This worked great.  For about 2 weeks.  Now that it&#x27;s outside of the return window (by about a week or 2), I tried to use it and it won&#x27;t turn on.  4 different, new, different brand batteries tried and still nothing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s convenient, quick, not messy, and the rotating blade doesn&#x27;t catch skin.  So far it works as expected and is a very handy item.</li>
            <li> solid but takes a while to shave all hair from nose...should work quicker</li>
            <li> Lasted less than a year with weekly use.  While it worked it did what it was supposed to do.  Replaced it with a Wahl cordless trimmer with the ear and nose attachment.  That works great and is worth shelling out the extra money for.</li>
            <li> Male member of the family appreciates this item, highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I thought that by purchasing a Panasonic device, it would last a fair amount of time. I was wrong. This stopped working after a year of light use. Has always been cleaned. Other reviewers have commented on the poor design of this unit. Now I&#x27;m back on Amazon looking for ANOTHER one of these - this time will go with a different brand.</li>
            <li> Works well. crisp trimming of nostril hair.</li>
            <li> This is a 5 stat product in that it works great and it&#x27;s cheap.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it tickles (really tickles) when used for nose hair.  But I think that&#x27;s just part of the design, so no stars taken away.</li>
            <li> Not bad. Nothing extraordinary. It does the job, doesn&#x27;t hard, but it is as ordinary as ordinary can be.</li>
            <li> The best.&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it about 2 months and it works great... just as advertised!</li>
            <li> Works very well.  I like the feel of this and its easy use.  Well built and a good buy.  Bought as a belated Christmas present for my 28 year old son.  It was exactly as described.  Would buy this item again.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works well for my nose hairs. I have not tried the ear trimmer, but so far so good. Price is right for what it does.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had better trimmers. This one chews through a batter pretty quick.</li>
            <li> Gave as a gift to my husband (he asked for it). He seems to love it. Said it works very well and that it doesn&#x27;t tug or pinch when he&#x27;s using it.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sticking it up MY nose, but that&#x27;s just me!</li>
            <li> I am in my sixties so I have plenty of unwanted nasal and ear hair. The circular cutting head on this trimmer is amazing! It&#x27;s fast and leaves nothing behind. The head needs to be cleaned after each use but the brush that comes with it does a great job. This is a great product!</li>
            <li> Have owned this for a month and the product works as described.  Easy to clean and have had no problems.  Was hoping it might be a little closer to the skin line but perhaps that puts too much of a chance to suffer a skin abrasion.  Never have felt one hair get pulled and it has worked painlessly.  Bought two waiting for this to fail but the second one is still in its plastic shell.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it often but it works well.</li>
            <li> This might be the best $15 I have ever spent in my life.  It works, it&#x27;s awesome.  Should have bought one of these 20yrs ago.</li>
            <li> I have developed more nose hairs after 40 years old than I really felt comfortable with.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried off  brands and AS seen on TV. None really did the job as these do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This actually cuts the nose hair close and it is easy and non-irritating. And it does it fast. No need to keep going over the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend these .</li>
            <li> Great product, high quality, I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is a fairly good device that&#x27;s made pretty well. The real issue I have with it is that it&#x27;s tough and time consuming to clean. You just can&#x27;t use the brush they give to clean it well. It has to be taken apart and this is usually a project. It&#x27;s not easy following the instructions as they make it more complex than it really is. It does a good job at cutting hair though. I&#x27;ll keep it but not really thrilled with it.  Richard V.</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer. It does a good job cutting hairs and not pulling them out.</li>
            <li> The older I get the more hair grew where I didn&#x27;t want it - and fell out of where I did want it.  It&#x27;s the same for many aging men, but I lived with it, using scissors as best I could because I remember trying a nose hair trimmer a LONG time ago (and the pain associated with pulled hairs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I met someone my age and (don&#x27;t ask me how the topic got around to nose and ear hair), but I commented on how well \\&quot;groomed\\&quot; they were.  Although they mentioned another brand of hair trimmer, I ended up (through Amazon reviews) selecting Panasonic.  Admittedly, the initial \\&quot;mow\\&quot; takes longer than subsequent trimmings - but I will never do without it again! HIGHLY recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Keep extra batteries on hand.  Although I&#x27;ve yet to experience it, I&#x27;m told that when the batteries get low you will experience the painful pulled hairs of \\&quot;old.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> The angle is really very helpful and the blades do a better job than my previous trimmer, getting down to 1/64&amp;#34;.  That can make a big difference when you&#x27;re past 40 and need to trim regularly!</li>
            <li> After a few months of use the unit makes too much blade noise to put in your ear.  That sucks, need new blade but can&#x27;t buy one.</li>
            <li> Works well,  Runs on two AA batteries, so not plug in capability. Easy to use, easy to clean, small to store.</li>
            <li> I have unfortunately grown nasty nose hairs. I&#x27;d bought a WAHL brand nose trimmer in the past and it hardly did a thing, if at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this nose trimmer only once, but it got any hairs, for sure and right away. The price is right because it gets the job done!! Happy, happy indeed. I feel like a true lady again, lol.</li>
            <li> Have tried a lot of inexpensive trimmers and they failed quickly or simply worked poorly...sometimes both! This trimmer seems to be a similar design to the others but it works and continues to work...have had it for several months. Recommend it.</li>
            <li> This item works great!  I had a little trouble receiving it, but it was worth the wait and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> Easily gets rid of nose and ear hair. It&#x27;s easy to clean and well worth the price.  A lot better than plucking and cutting.</li>
            <li> Very smooth and quiet operation.</li>
            <li> This one works!!! The 3rd one I have tried other two not very good results...quality product...Perfect seller service</li>
            <li> I have been using this since last 1 month, Its quite good with its price range, Although maybe I guess I have some hard hairs so I had to go for 2-3 rounds on ears and nostrils, But it is a god product no complains so far :)</li>
            <li> Well made.  Easy to clean.  Very effective for nose and ear hair.  Runs well with single battery. I have owned device for several weeks and have had no problems or issues.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no complaints. Build quality feels like it&#x27;s worth $200 or more... the aluminum(?) + weighty feel in hand makes it feel superbly crafted. And, it gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer.  It will rip the hairs out of you in the most unpleasant fashion.  I just used it, and now I have a nose bleed.  I angrily threw it in the trash can and am now going to buy a better one.</li>
            <li> This is my second trimmer and a definite step up from the previous one. The speed is high, cutting ability is excellent, and comfort is top notch. I have not had even a hint of catching or tearing. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me a bit long in the tooth, and your body hair has run amuck, check out this dude right here. I use it so my wife isnt trying to pluck one of those wild hairs out of my nose! Also, let&#x27;s not forget our ears! What was mother nature thinking, fIlling up our cavities with bushes? This unit makes all those cheapo devices look just like that. Cheap! Panasonic knows noses my friends, this dude won&#x27;t pull the hairs out, just cut em off! No pain, you have lots to gain!</li>
            <li> This is my third nose hair trimmer, but actually the first one that works ...&lt;br /&gt;The first two were kind of working, but the annoying part was that they were irritating my nose.&lt;br /&gt;The Panny is much better, happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Clipper is much better than my old one. Also easy to clean.zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz .  .. .kdowoif akdjfkjowew  woijer  joiaoije dd  words&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clipper is much better than my old one. Also easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clipper is much better than my old one. Also easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;repeated word don&#x27;e count&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to bad</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer as a replacement for an underperforming trimmer. This trimmer uses rotary technology. It is an outstanding performer. It does not pull nose hairs and is effective at removing both nose hair and ear hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want an effective trimmer, buy this unit.</li>
            <li> This is just what I was looking for. It does the job of trimming nose hair as well as other hair.</li>
            <li> Very nice trimmer, works well in nose and ear.  Big improvement over my old Norelco, I wasn&#x27;t sure it would be much better but it is.</li>
            <li> Been wanting/needing these for a few years... work well (not painful) and love the water cleaning!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in July 2012, dead by December - changed the battery, no help. It just completely died on me after using it probably less than 10 times.</li>
            <li> Like another reviewer said, &amp;#34;as we get older we tend to grow hair in places we don&#x27;t want and lose hair in places we want to keep it.&amp;#34; The price compared to the result is amazing. In less than 60 seconds I had those pesky nose hairs that were hanging out of my nose completely trimmed back. Great product for a great price!</li>
            <li> As I get older I&#x27;m starting to get the unwanted hair in my ears ans nose. This handy little trimmer trimmed it back with no irritation. I like it!</li>
            <li> I never had one and thought it would be good, does some of a good job but isn&#x27;t that great.</li>
            <li> For the price this is about what I was expecting, and it does a great job of cutting in the hard to reach places. My only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t cut deep enough to take care of facial hair.</li>
            <li> Work really well. Gets a little warm after it has been on for more than a minute but does a great job trimming without pulling or snipping.</li>
            <li> I bought this nose hair trimmer because I wanted a well made product that will last and this seems to be very sturdy and does a good job at trimming.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of the Panasonic brand.  It does not do its job well.  It is slow, the  cutter gets hot and it doesn&#x27;t cut close.</li>
            <li> I walked in one morning on him taking a pair of scissors to his nose....I freaked and got him this...He loves it!</li>
            <li> I needed an updated product and this sufficed nicely!</li>
            <li> Worked fine for the first 2 months.  then stopped working.  I replaced the battery but still nothing.  put the old one back in and it worked.  next time i went to use it, again: nothing.  Banged it several times and it kicked into working.  Next time i tried, again: nothing.  Banging, changing battery, nothing worked.  i&#x27;ts useless.  Ugh!</li>
            <li> i use it on a regular basis... please thank whoever invented this product... i hate to even imagine not having it</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son. Works well he needed it. Teenager starting with the nose and facial hair  he really likes it would recommend d</li>
            <li> Still working, I guess this is as good as it can get as if you got any more of a &amp;#34;take away&amp;#34; area you could do some unsightly damage .</li>
            <li> It did not come with a charger or battery and it eats my batteries.  Instructions were not clear.</li>
            <li> Feels good in my hand.  Cuts Great!  Way to go Panasonic! I&#x27;d definitely recommend this so someone else. Keep up the good work!</li>
            <li> This is a well-designed unit. It&#x27;s quiet when it&#x27;s in operation; and it also disassembles for easy cleaning, which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> Works great wet or dry!  No issues to report.</li>
            <li> Trimmer worked as expected but when I set it upright in medicine cabinet it would fall out onto the floor, a lot.  My old one did not.  It might be the angled off top that causes it to fall, often.  Then with the repeated bangs on the floor it did not trim as expected.</li>
            <li> What can I say? The nose hair and ear hair aren&#x27;t a problem anymore. Takes a few seconds. Great little gizmo for problems we don&#x27;t like to tallk about!</li>
            <li> Works great! Just what my Dad had asked for. Arrived quickly. The only hassle is opening the clamshell packaging. A hassle no matter what the product.</li>
            <li> Excellent trimmer ! Works much better than my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> This was a Xmas gift for my husband, and he is very pleased with it.  He would recommend it very highly.</li>
            <li> Works for all intended purposes.</li>
            <li> Works just fine. My husband no longer has nose hairs poking out of his nostrils. What more can you ask?</li>
            <li> I just bough this one week ago and I like it so far, no complaints. I recommend this product !</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to give it 5 stars until I&#x27;ve had it for a good while. That&#x27;s because I&#x27;ve had about 4 different brands of &amp;#34;personal&amp;#34; trimmers that all started out great but then failed within a few months. So, I like how it performs, I like how easy it is to clean...you just turn the dial at the top which opens a port where water can be discharged after flowing into the tip, or flow water into the port and it&#x27;s discharged out through the tip. That&#x27;s a cool feature. It also does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, cut nose hair, without any problem. So, let&#x27;s just see if it lasts.</li>
            <li> It works and does the job at trimming. I use it for my eye brows, nose, mustache, chin hair. It&#x27;s very useful.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t grow hair on my head any more but I can sure grow it in my nose &amp; ears.  When this arrived, I put a battery in it and set out trimming nose hairs.  It worked superbly.  Now everyone asks why I shaved my mustache.,,</li>
            <li> This trimmer runs for a long time on the battery, trims close, is comfortable to use, and has a nice clean-out feature.  I should have bought one of these years ago.</li>
            <li> Arrived quicker than was expected and the Panasonic hair trimmer is the absolute best I&#x27;ve ever had especially being so cost effective.</li>
            <li> The Best I found, So Far</li>
            <li> Works  &#x3D; can&#x27;t say much more than that.</li>
            <li> The first machine I received was defective.  I returned it to Amazon and I received another one in just days.  The replacement works great, although I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days.  Thanks Amazon for taking care of this so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Following is the experience I had with the first machine I ordered.  \\&quot;The machine comes on fast for about 5 seconds and in the next 2 seconds it nearly stops.  It seems like it would be a battery problem however,  I did put a new battery in initially and have replaced them twice more.  I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s going on but I&#x27;m going to try and return it. I&#x27;m hoping this is just a fluke and that I can get it replaced through Amazon.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I have been thoroughly impressed with this hair trimmer. GREAT price and it does exactly like other consumers have indicated. I was looking for something that did not do that &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; when it chops hair. This product delivers. It worked so good that I bought one for my dad for Christmas. He raves about it being the best nose hair trimmer he&#x27;s ever had. Great product and works like a charm. Can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
            <li> I know I&#x27;m about twenty years too young to be using one of these, but I&#x27;m still wondering how the hell I ever lived without it.</li>
            <li> Much like some of the other 1-star reviews, my trimmer failed to work properly even on the first use. Using fresh rechargeable Ni-MH batteries, the motor would spin nice and fast once turned on but then quickly slow down to a stop within 3-4 seconds. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Be careful. The literature states that this product is just to cut the hair immediately inside the nose. Thats what it does.&lt;br /&gt;I made the mistake of trying to get further back in my nose and nicked myself. Pretty painful.  So, Just inside the nose, no further. Read the literature. If you follow that advise, its a good product.&lt;br /&gt;The top comes off for cleaning. Just pop it off, rinse, reinstall.</li>
            <li> works great, should have gotten this one a long time ago :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad Christmas 2011, and he really likes it. It&#x27;s easy to use, easy to clean, and a nice size to travel with. I also tried it for small touch ups on the face and want one for myself. Be cool if there were different heads to use but no big deal. Makes a great gift for men, and women too in fact, def recommend.</li>
            <li> Nicely priced and it works.  I am very happy with this item and can happily recommend it to anyone looking to clear the forest from their nasal passages.</li>
            <li> Just what can you say about a nose hair trim? It works great, cleans up easy. It&#x27;s much nicer than many others I had. Will need to see just how long it last.</li>
            <li> This is only the 2nd nose hair trimmer I have purchased or used but I have to say that this one works very well so far. it does a much better job on the first go round.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought about 4 of these. Great for the price and works efficiently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note of warning. If you drop it, and one of the the &amp;#34;blade&amp;#34; guards bends inward, you&#x27;d have to get another trimmer. The blade is very thin and spins around inside the blade guard. If one of the metal guards bends inward to the blade....good luck getting it out. It makes a loud grinding nose as the blade hits the guard and doesn&#x27;t cut well after that. So just keep the plastic guard on top of the trimmer and don&#x27;t drop it. Great trimmer then. : )</li>
            <li> It works really well, but for some reason it stopped working after not being used for a while, it lasted about 2 years. I bought another one though because of how well it works.</li>
            <li> I needed a trimmer that would work well. The trimmer works great, and I would recomend this to others. Great Product.</li>
            <li> According to my husband: This trimmer is easy to use, does a great job, and does not hurt. He says it is like magic. Since purchasing it for him I don&#x27;t have to get trimmers out and help him trim nose and ear hairs - he grooms himself without me reminding him to do so :).</li>
            <li> This is one I keep in my kitchen (I know, it&#x27;s a little weird.) I have horrible allergies in the winter, and my nose hairs tend to crust up with all sorts of unpleasantness. I pop this bad boy in to trim out those offensive hairs and then use soap and water to wash. One batter has lasted me a month so far. No complaints!</li>
            <li> Hi, this product works fine. No more hair in my nose and ear. Clean shaving. Good product. Works good so far..</li>
            <li> This handy device takes care of a very personal matter.  Unlike others I&#x27;ve owned, this one is dependable, does an excellent job of ridding one of hair in nostrils as well as in ears and is quite and quick.</li>
            <li> Very good cutting and very quiet.  Seems easy to clean.</li>
            <li> No more painful plucking!</li>
            <li> Works great for trimming nose and ears hair.</li>
            <li> If you are even considering getting a trimmer get this one - I was a little apprehensive about any pulling or irritation but this trimmer does a wonderful job removing the unwanted hair with NO pain. Now that I have it I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t get one sooner.</li>
            <li> great trimmer. works we or dry. I trim my nose and ears with it.</li>
            <li> Great design, ease of use and ability to keep clean and extremely quiet without the hair pulls or snags I&#x27;ve experienced with other similar products.</li>
            <li> I finally decided to buy this for my husband as a joke, and he was the most excited for this gift over any other gift! Months later, he is still raving about it!</li>
            <li> The best nose trimmer that I have ever used and highly recommend it because it has two cutting blades.. I just threw out my two previous ones.</li>
            <li> It does the job, not a lot of noticeable difference between it and a cheaper trimmer, except the build seems solid and it is easy to clean. I have to admit sometimes I like yanking out nose hairs with my fingers or a tweezer though.</li>
            <li> Good price! Good quality!&lt;br /&gt;My boyfriend loves it!&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to use and clean! Also convenient to use! You could buy it!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is powerful and does a great job with nose/ear hair.  Found as I turned 50 hair started gorwing faster out of my nose and ears than on the top of my head and this trimmer keeps everything in check.  Much more powerful than other cheap trimmers I have used in the past.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Very accurate trimmer but tricky on the eyebrows. I have been using different brands of trimmer in the past and I hope that this will be the last one. I really love this product.</li>
            <li> This is the best little trimmer I have ever owned. It also has a wash out feature that is very handy. Keeps you looking good.</li>
            <li> Just not powerful enough.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a cheap conair trimeer I had. WOW, what a difference! It&#x27;s comfortable to use and I like that it can be cleaned under a facucet when you&#x27;re done. Good price, good product</li>
            <li> This is a handy gadget that works well.  I am pleased with the purchase.  It cost about the same as the one we had before but is made to last</li>
            <li> works great , gets where scissors wont</li>
            <li> bought this for my husband, he loves it, painless and effective.</li>
            <li> Not as good at cutting as my last trimmer. Mediocre.</li>
            <li> Finally, one that works as advertised! I purchased a Phillips Norelco locally, and it was junk! Could pass over the same spot several times and it wouldn&#x27;t cut anything. I threw it away, and bought this Panasonic. Very efficient and I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I gave up on electric nose hair trimmers a few years ago.  They just never seemed to work very well and it took just as long as using scissors, if not longer.  I think that since these cut on the top and side it really improves the performance.  This unit also seems to have enough power and doesn&#x27;t stumble as you use it.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I needed.  Easy to knock out that unfortunate nose and ear hair, without any pinching or pain.  Easy to clean, easy to store, cheap; there&#x27;s nothing bad to say about it</li>
            <li> good stuff as I expected, thanks to seller</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few similar nose/ear trimmers, but this is definitely the best ever. Highly recommended. Grab one from Amazon!</li>
            <li> Works as advertised and easy to use. Battery life seems a bit short but I&#x27;ll keep using it. Would recommend, especially for the fairly low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up: died after a few weeks and new batteries didn&#x27;t solve the problem. Because of the price point, I&#x27;m not overly concerned, but a nuisance to now have to go find another (different) one.</li>
            <li> I used to get the budget ones from the store. This cost a little more but works great! I had an old style Panasonic that lasted for years and expect this one to last too.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to address the personal grooming needs that appear as one crowds forty.  All of the reviews were strong, so I expected this to work well.  No joy: For three minutes it worked like a charm, but then its motor slowed as though the battery were dead.  Replacing the battery did not help, and so my morning manscaping turned from an efficient exercise into a slow torture of ear and nostril hair being dragged from my flesh by a slowly rotating blade.  Not sure if I just got a bad item, or if this is Panasonic&#x27;s way of getting men to man up and go back to tweezers, scissors, whisky, and cigars.  Either way, this this not meet my needs.</li>
            <li> my dad really enjoys this shaver. it works well and he has had it now for 4 months. he never used it wet so im not sure how that will work.</li>
            <li> Works well but the top of device is difficult to take off for proper cleaning after use.  Otherwise a decent value</li>
            <li> I had one of these trimmers that I bought at Bed Bath and Beyond for the same price, and it was half the quality.  This trimmer works very well and has a nice solid feel to it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure most people are familiar with the cheap, $5 or less nose hair trimmers that fall apart and rip the hairs out.  Often people can go through several of these types of trimmers in a year and not think much about it.  Save yourself the time and aggravation and just get a decent nose hair trimmer.  The Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex is just the right one to consider.  At around $15 it won&#x27;t break the bank but at the same time is is made with far more attention to quality and utility.  The trimmer is a wet/dry model that with a simple turn of the head will shave with wet (i.e. in the shower or at the sink) or dry.  The cutting action is far superior to cheaper models, with hair being caught and ripped out far less often.  In fact in over a month of use I can only think of one time a hair got yanked out by this trimmer, an outstanding track record.  My only worry is that while the device is clearly of higher quality than the cheap throwaways I have used in the past, it does seem to utilize the same type of cutting mechanism, and I worry that in time this may begin to rip out hairs just as frequently as cheaper trimmers.  That said, it is clear that even if this trimmer does lose it&#x27;s edge, it will still have lasted longer by far than it&#x27;s cheaper brethren and in the meantime I would have had a far superior trimming experience.  Due to the concern over long-term durability, I give this four stars, but still recommend this product highly.</li>
            <li> This trimmer makes it very easy to take care of unwanted facial/nose hair.  Also, it is easy cleanup with a little soap and water rinse.  If you purchase, I think you&#x27;ll agree that this product is worth the small cost.</li>
            <li> This is my fourth order. I returned the others.  I finally found the one that  works great!!!</li>
            <li> Nose, Ear, Eyebrow, basically anywhere between your forehead and chin it will give good accuracy trimming or lining. I felt no pinching or pulling of my hair in any section of my face probably because it runs on one AA battery, either way completely pleased with no regrets of this purchase recommended for all.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Better than my old one.  No irritation. Really gets hair, but have to run a few passes around the nose.  I like the wet feature.</li>
            <li> It will work for what I need it for my nose not like I  thought  though</li>
            <li> Calms the savage beast. Cuts close, no tugging or tearing, no bleeding, cleans up easily. Can&#x27;t go wrong.   ******One caveat - if you put this in your travel kit, remove the battery, or run the risk of arriving at your destination with a dead battery. The on/off switch offers little resistance when jostled back and forth, as in luggage getting tossed around by baggage handlers.******</li>
            <li> Best one that I have found. I seemed to go through 3 of these a year, and thus far this one has held up excellent</li>
            <li> I had a cheaper rechargable trimmer and it had horrible battery life and it made my nose itch it also required a charging station and another outlet. This trimmer is perfect. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve had to change the batteries once, which was my biggest concern. Also I now have another outlet free. The trimmer feels gentle, its easy to hold, and its super quiet. This is perfect. I just keep it in the medicine cabinet and use it when I need it.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a lousy Remington version.  This works great to trim nose, ear, eyebrow hair.  Just buy it.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have ever had. The others I have had would pull out the hair and it would be very painful. This one works like a charm and does its job. Just move it around and it will clear the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is a breeze because of the water option.</li>
            <li> Received a very damaged product. Top screen above the speaker was dented, and after pairing with my phone, there was simply no audio, even after turning the volume up. Nothing. Thanks for the defective product. Will be returning for a refund.</li>
            <li> Getting old sucks...This is the best trimmer. Better than advertised. It does not leave any hairs behind. it is a great product.</li>
            <li> An ease to put blade In and a breeze to use-great product at a great price- efficient and effective - get this</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really exactly what I was looking for. Good for ears and nose hair. I no longer look like 40 going on 60. :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer three times, but so far, it works perfectly.  There&#x27;s no hair pulling and it does a thorough job.  It arrived in a timely manner too.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband who said he didn&#x27;t need them as he preferred to trim any unwanted hair with sissors I now see him use them almost every day so I would say they have his approval.</li>
            <li> This unit will trim your nose hairs, but it is very poorly build, overall a terrible quality. I cannot believe that Panasonic will put their name on such a poor piece of junk.</li>
            <li> Does the job.  Not HUGELY impressed.  Its Ok</li>
            <li> It trims and shaves nicely. seems built fairly cheap but has held up well so far. It is fairly easy to clean also.</li>
            <li> So far a great product.</li>
            <li> Works well and tickles while it works. Have fun..</li>
            <li> The design is ergonomic, making it very easy to handle. Only use it on nose, works very well.</li>
            <li> My old man groomer broke and I was looking for a replacement. My old trimmer (man groomer) used to pluck hairs and it was painful. But it did a great job trimming. So when I was looking for a replacement I was looking for something that doesn&#x27;t pluck. I found this on amazon and read great reviews. The reviews are correct for the most part. This does not pluck hair. No pain whatsoever. Perfect. But the downside is that it doesn&#x27;t trim finely enough. I still feel hair in my ear when I place my finger. That&#x27;s why I called it a perfect trade-off because it doesn&#x27;t hurt but it doesn&#x27;t do a perfect job trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was looking for something that doesn&#x27;t hurt, it fit my needs. So I would have given it 5 stars. But took out 1 star because it doesn&#x27;t perform its primary function of trimming very well.</li>
            <li> Slow process. I wonder whether there are more efficient products out there. Expect to go over the same area a few times.</li>
            <li> im breating better now and keep my ears clean this is nice to have</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I use it and love it. Worth the buy. Fast shipping. No complaints whatsoever thus far.</li>
            <li> This product works great, just be careful how you use it. Using it to trim facial hair from side burns, eyebrows, and other surface areas is fine. I used this to trim nose hair and I found out the hard way, the hair in your nose is there for a reason. I must say I am a little embarrassed, but if one person can avoid my experience that&#x27;s ok. Evidently, I was not as careful as I should have been and remove to much or to close or both. About a week after I used this product to remove my nose hairs, my lymph glands in my neck swelled. I cannot be 100% this was the cause, but after speaking with health professionals, they also believe it could have been. This waxing and waning of my glands continued for a month. I first time they swelled, the glands were so tender, I didn&#x27;t want to touch my neck. Then they would go down and in a couple of days swell again. Each time the pain would decrease. But, this continued for a whole month. My doctor gave my an antibiotic, but fornutately said not to use unless I really needed it. I went to my trusted Health Food store and purchased coloidal silver. I had worked so hard to get my intestinal flora in good shape, I didn&#x27;t want to kill the good bacteria, if I could avoid it. Anyway, it worked. No antibiotic. Just BEcareful! Don&#x27;t be stupid like I was because I must say I was a little scared. I will go back to using scissors for trimming nose hairs!</li>
            <li> Best ear/nose hair trimmer out there. Works great, quick, comfortable and reasonably priced. Previously had a Remington trimmer, and this is much better.</li>
            <li> Works extremely well...great for ears and nostrils.</li>
            <li> It is just a so-so product.</li>
            <li> Nothing fancy, but better than anything less expensive.  Works great for me.</li>
            <li> As embarrassing as it was to order a nose hair trimmer, it is even more so to report that it is difficult to use and not very effective.  The first time I used it, it worked OK, and I used it on my eyebrows and other places with embarrassing hair growth.  I cleaned it per instructions and put it away.  The next time I used it, it barely did anything.  It was also unclear from the directions, exactly how one is supposed to hold it, in order to trim nose hair.  [this is so embarrassing] Am I holding it wrong?  Is there some trick to it that I missed?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few trimmers and most always with disappointing results. Most all of them have a cheap feel to them and tend to be a bit loud (cheap motors).  The Vortex is definitely an exception and the best I&#x27;ve seen so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unique to the Vortex is a spinning cutter and cone shape, which both contribute towards its better than average job. Contrary to other devices of this kind, it has a powerful, smooth running and quiet motor. That is very unusual with trimmers, and a welcome change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another attribute of the Vortex that is different, yet at the same time brilliant, is a small ring near the cone tip that when twisted, opens a small hole where you can run water through to clean it.  The water runs out of the cone tip and takes with it any debris inside the cone cutter.  I add an extra measure by substituting some isopropyl alcohol for the water and cleaning with that.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is recommended, but I feel it does a better job keeping it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this one comes highly recommended.</li>
            <li> great product - trims very close to the skin</li>
            <li> This nose hair trimmer has a cheap feel to it.  The cutting action is acceptable, but I am not excited by the construction quality.</li>
            <li> I had a Phillips trimmer that was a different design which cost me $20 and was just awful. This is such a bargain, and it works so well. Very pleased with my purchase. If it brakes, I will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This is a decent nose trimmer for the cost. My husband says it works better then his old one. I would recommend this product. I dont think you&#x27;d be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised by how close this rotary trimmer cuts hair. I&#x27;ve used other rotary trimmers for nose hair before and they left stubble or short fuzz. This Panasonic model cuts very close, pretty much right down to the surface leaving no discernible hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tweeze my nose hair sometimes, and while it&#x27;s not really painful it does put my sinuses on overdrive which makes my nose run and my eyes tear up briefly. No big deal, but this trimmer avoids all the mess and it&#x27;s fairly easy to clean, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to read the instructions for cleaning.</li>
            <li> Takes care of those pesky nose and ear hairs</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is great for those embarrassing little hairs that ladies sometimes get on their face, ears, nose, etc.  It even helps out with the eyebrows when you dont have time to pluck every little hair.</li>
            <li> veey easy to use and he batteries last for loooooooong!!!</li>
            <li> No way, this is a waist of money, worked for 35 days.</li>
            <li> The size is nice (smaller then I thought it would be from the picture). While I am not really hairy I do have some weird long stray hairs that poke out every now and then from my nose and my friends will give me a hard time about it (at least they tell me instead of letting me walk around clueless) so I started just pulling them out but it&#x27;s hard to get them all and keep up with  (and it hurts and make me sneeze), Now with this trimmer I can just give it a run every time I shave and will never have to go through the humiliation and shame that stray hairs can bring. I just wish i had purchased this a long time ago but was always thinking it would be a waste of money and not work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a dozen purported Nose and Facial Hair Trimmers.  The Brookstone and Sharper Image products were awful, and didn&#x27;t do the job. This one is AWESOME.  I would give it six stars if I could, but Amazon won&#x27;t let me.  Don&#x27;t even consider another product.  Panasonic makes the best one of these.  Buy two if you&#x27;re smart.</li>
            <li> This did a good job without leaving me with a bloody nose, as has happened before with cheaper ones.  It&#x27;s easy to clean if you read the instruction book - you just take apart the top few pieces.  Inevitably, these things have died on me - so if it does, I&#x27;ll post an update.</li>
            <li> My nose has never felt better! I feel like I&#x27;m no longer trying to breathe through a thicket.</li>
            <li> Used it primarily to cut hair popping out from nose. Does the job perfectly. Requires 2 AA batteries, which are not included.</li>
            <li> Easy to operate. does the job!&lt;br /&gt;Simple and good! great price!</li>
            <li> Bought to replace an older model (I lost) that looks similar but is no longer made,  Was skeptical give the negative reviews, but have used it several times and works great - closer cut and much quieter than my older unit for nose and ear trimming.</li>
            <li> Does the job well as it promises. This is a great product for a good price. I do surely recommend it.</li>
            <li> FIVE STARS DEAL!!! ★ ★ ★ ★ ★</li>
            <li> What can I say?  It works really well; it&#x27;s not the first trimmer I&#x27;ve gotten, but it&#x27;s the best one so far (OK, I&#x27;m pretty cheap).  Just be sure to use a fresh battery... it&#x27;s not pleasant while using a weak battery.  Just trust me.  Used for ears, nose, eyebrows... no problems, works great.</li>
            <li> I encouraged my husband to get this to take care of his nose hair as he always gets sneezy when he would try to use a scissors. He LOVES it. Within a few minutes he is well groomed-and barely sneezy. Lol</li>
            <li> Works well but breaks easily. Don&#x27;t dare drop. My older one&#x27;s blade got screwed up so it wouldn&#x27;t spin properly. Bought a new one, and the motor switch was faulty... and Amazon would not ACCEPT a RETURN of the faulty item. Probably because so many get broken, unless Amazon is just mad at me. Fortunately I put the old base with the new blade head, and got one working trimmer.</li>
            <li> Having heard about trimmers for decades, I thought &amp;#34;why use them when scissors will do the same thing?&amp;#34;.  The older I get, the more time I need to groom. The low price point lured me into trying it out and wow, how much easier and more efficient this is!  It&#x27;s compact size and easy cleaning saves me time and the anxiety of cutting myself.  Do yourself a favor and join me in moving out of the dark ages.</li>
            <li> Works good, could use an extra battery (seems a bit weak on power)</li>
            <li> I ordered this product and used it for a few times in a year. It worked okay, though not amazing, each use to significant I&#x27;m to be thorough though it was painless. After that it quit working. I recently contacted Panasonic for a warranty replacement, which they were able to offer but we&#x27;re not able to send a call tag. For such a cheap items shipping would be more than it is worth. Miraculously, the day I called for the call tag it started working again so I will live with it until it dies again, then throw it out.</li>
            <li> One of the problems I&#x27;ve had over the last thirty years of riding is that after a few hours, nose hairs start tickling my nose.  And once one starts, I SWEAR that others join in the fun.  Not cool.  That said, I&#x27;ve always view trimmers as a great way to slice/dice your nose guts....and have stayed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT...curiosity finally got the best of me after a particularly long day of riding (and itching), so I went to all kinds of sites to read up on resolving this....and the Panasonic consistently was the recommendation.  So I pulled the trigger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First use was with GREAT trepidation (again, think nose guts)....but, to my relief, I did NOT slice/dice my nose - what I DID do was tickle the crap out of the inside of my nose. That took quite a while to get used to (not sure I have yet)...but I will say that using this before a ride has made a HUGE difference in the nose tickles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is a piece of cake, and you can throw it in a drawer with its cover or just leave it boldly on your sink (which is what I do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ONLY real downside has been that it&#x27;ll go throw a AA battery in about two trims.  Not a huge ding, but I gotta believe that there&#x27;s a more efficient motor out there.  But, I also gotta admit that I had to pick between sub-par battery replacement vs nose guts or nose tickles, I&#x27;d be buying cases of batteries.  Jus&#x27; sayin&#x27;.</li>
            <li> Definitely more \\&quot;heavy duty\\&quot; than the 2 or 3 other similar products I&#x27;ve tried in the same price range. Only had it for a week. The bad reviews I read didn&#x27;t seem to be about the product&#x27;s performance, just about it&#x27;s reliability; seemed to stop working in a few cases.  All products tend to have a small percentage of defects, so I don&#x27;t know if this one will last as long as I expect it to.  If it does, I doubt there&#x27;s a similar product in the same price range that&#x27;s any better.</li>
            <li> The blades and tip teeth are really fine. This config prevents hair from being pulled out by the roots as some grooming tools do with course tips.</li>
            <li> Well constructed.  Nice finish.  Just as advertised. I would recommend this to others.  Well packed and easily assembled with the tools provided.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this. He uses it often. He hasn&#x27;t complained about it yet. His last one broke and this one has worked pretty well since we got it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a while now. It does pull the nose hairs a tad and I wonder if the blade is getting dull. It goes through the battery quicker than I think it should but I do use it a lot. All in all I think it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> This is a fine tool. It replaces a very old Windmere unit that until now I didn&#x27;t truly realize just how ineffective the old one was. This Panasonic is far better.</li>
            <li> What a terrible product.  When it was working, it didn&#x27;t do a  very good job and then it stopped working completely within six weeks.  Conveniently, it was a few days after the return period from Amazon expired. Fortunately, Amazon demonstrated a great level of customer service; graciously giving me a full credit refund. This is one of the reasons that i try to buy from Amazon.  I know I will be treated fairly.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I have always used an old Remington nose hair trimmer and once i switched to this one their is no going back man this thing gets allot more hair than the Remington.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and get razor bumps easily, I use it to trim my nose and facial hair. It works well and is easier to clean.</li>
            <li> this thing rocks, im suave as bob now that my nostrils are smooth as a babys brass</li>
            <li> ok product it came quick</li>
            <li> Really pleased with this grooming device. I may be an old fart, but at least this device will help me be a well groomed old fart.</li>
            <li> This unit was purchased to replace an older  unit.  Liked design of old unit and found tis to be the only one with this dexign. Works better than replacement.</li>
