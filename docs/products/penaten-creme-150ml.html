            <li>SHE WAS RIGHT!</li>
            <li>IT WORKS FANTASTIC, WAS WORTH</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this cream on my German Shepherd&#x27;s lip fold pyoderma and some hot spots in her leg and armpits, which is cleared up very nicely.  </li>
            <li>It cleared up a diaper rash just as quickly as a prescription cream did.</li>
            <li>Aside from the other astounding reviews that I&#x27;d agree to about this miracle-in-a-can, I&#x27;d also like to add that the stuff lasts you forever!</li>
            <li>Her diaper rash was visibly better in a day and within a week it was completely gone!</li>
            <li>but in the end was worth it.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li>Be forewarned, if you&#x27;re using it for chapped lips or cuts, it&#x27;ll be nice and white (like sunscreen).</li>
            <li>The delivery took a couple of weeks, but it seems worth the wait, and this is a large quantity of cream.</li>
            <li>Have been using it for years and first found it on a trip to Germany</li>
            <li>I grew up with Penaten as the go to first aid cream for skin irritations.</li>
            <li>If you want any German products, I would for sure go with this seller.</li>
            <li>I try putting Penaten Creme on first when I have any sort of redness on my skin.  </li>
            <li>So glad to have it back in our linen closet.</li>
            <li>I thought back to this cream my Grandma used to have at all times in her Kitchen and Bathroom and decided to try googling for it and am truly glad I found that it still exists and still comes in a tin.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>THIS STUFF CURED IT FAST.</li>
            <li>It really works.</li>

            <li>It&#x27;s a very well known cream in Germany.</li>
            <li>Fixed up my dogs lip right away.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I thought the price was high</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and thick creating a protective barrier on your baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also fantastic to use on other abrasions and sunburn.</li>
            <li>I can now keep a tin in my house to continue the tradition started by mom as well as give it as gifts to new mom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It’s thick, smells good and instantly soothing on hurt bottoms.</li>
            <li>Penaten Creme is a family favorite for babies tushies, chapped lips, anything really that needs a little something extra..</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t sting the child like some zincs do and it literally will clear up any rash in a day!</li>
            <li>It will clear a rash in just one day!</li>
            <li>So even if it costs a little more than the other brands, it lasts longer (on top of all the other perks everyone else has been saying).</li>
            <li>The seller of this &amp;#34;wonder cream&amp;#34; is super efficient, and extremely customer-friendly.</li>
            <li>As mentioned before it will literally clear up a rash in a day.</li>
            <li>After a couple applications my dog&#x27;s mouth is clear.</li>
            <li>It may be also applied to sensitive parts and mucosa.</li>
            <li>can when our daughter was born and still have most of it left a year and a half later.</li>
            <li>I normally use it overnight on cuts or facial excema</li>
            <li>Cost a little more than expected to spend</li>
            <li>This is the only cream that would clear up his redness and rash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently using it on a popped blister on my hand and in two days, the rawness of it is nearly healed.  </li>
            <li>but it was a huge quantity of this item... and to make matters worse</li>

            <li> Penaten Creme is a family favorite for babies tushies, chapped lips, anything really that needs a little something extra..</li>
            <li> Penaten Creme is good stuff.  I would give it 5 stars except that the fragrance is different from an earlier container (several years earlier -- it lasts a long time) and just bothers me.  The smell bothers me.</li>
            <li> Works wonders! Purchased it for my son&#x27;s diaper rash and it worked so well I&#x27;m going to buy a second jar for my nephew.</li>
            <li> Works on all types of skin irritations. Diaper rash and cracked fingers in the winter.  It doesn&#x27;t take much.  It&#x27;s greasy but great stuff.</li>
            <li> My favorite Crème of all time and I have been using and recommending it for over 40 years.  It has healed cuts over night in many instances.  Thank you,  Carol Grinstead</li>
            <li> I have known about Penaten Crème since I was a child growing up in Germany. This is the best cream for a baby&#x27;s bottom. I wished that it would have been available for all my children,</li>
            <li> I honestly believe this stuff might be made of magic. There is no diaper rash too strong for this and no skin irritation that can&#x27;t be soothed with this.</li>
            <li> One of the oldest (invented in 1907) and most proven baby cremes in history. Penaten had many copiers (e.g. Butt Paste) but is still unsurpassed. Basically a zinc oxide paste it has many additional salve ingredients which make it superior. As mentioned before it will literally clear up a rash in a day. It is sticky enough so it stays put and protects the irritated areas. Try it and you&#x27;ll agree. I grew up with it 50 years ago and so are my kids.</li>
            <li> This is the best.  Have been using it for years and first found it on a trip to Germany</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. I have used it for all of my 4 children and give it as gifts. It has a pleasant smell, wipes easily, relieves discomfort and speeds up healing. I highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this cream during years and it helps to relieve any irritation or damage in the skin, and also protects in case of stings or injuries. It may be also applied to sensitive parts and mucosa. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> My dog had a raw irritation on his jowls and this cream cleared it up completely.  I&#x27;m currently using it on a popped blister on my hand and in two days, the rawness of it is nearly healed.  This cream lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Aside from the other astounding reviews that I&#x27;d agree to about this miracle-in-a-can, I&#x27;d also like to add that the stuff lasts you forever! We bought the 150ml can when our daughter was born and still have most of it left a year and a half later. So even if it costs a little more than the other brands, it lasts longer (on top of all the other perks everyone else has been saying). Just a dab will do ya!</li>
            <li> I HAD HEARD THROUGH CO WORKERS THAT THIS PRODUCT WAS GREAT. MY GERMAN SHEPARD HAD DERMATITIS ON HIS JOWLS THAT BLED AND BECAME SCABBY LOOKING. THIS STUFF CURED IT FAST. AMAZING!!</li>
            <li> This product is a must have if you have children in diapers.  It&#x27;s the cure all for even the hint of diaper rash to the most severe.  It doesn&#x27;t sting the child like some zincs do and it literally will clear up any rash in a day! I&#x27;ve used this product with all 3 of my children and wouldn&#x27;t be with out it.  It&#x27;s also fantastic to use on other abrasions and sunburn.</li>
            <li> Blog recommended to use this creme for healing chapped lips/joules on my German shepherd.  Great product!  Worked instantly and was healed in under a week of use.</li>
            <li> Used this product on my dogs lower lip.  Read somewhere online that it was good to help with the dryness of dogs lower lip.  Cost a little more than expected to spend but in the end was worth it.  Fixed up my dogs lip right away.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the best cream for babies, keep them protected all day avoiding diper rush my baby has the skin so sensitive and is perfect for him.</li>
            <li> I used to have a foreman that was German. On one of her trips to Germany she brought a can of this for me to try.  It worked great for rashes, cuts, and much more.  I finished my last can and as so happy to find it. If my dog gets a cut or a sore I use it on him too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, worth waiting for...took a month!  I used this when my kids were born in Germany many years ago.  Great for rash, alll kinds, any irretations....wonderful!</li>
            <li> There is nothing better on the market then Penaten Creme. It’s thick, smells good and instantly soothing on hurt bottoms. I won’t use anything else on my baby.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream for preventing and treating diaper rash. It&#x27;s nice and thick creating a protective barrier on your baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
            <li> ORDERED THIS CREAM AFTER A FRIEND OF MINE GAVE IT PRAISES.  TURNS OUT SHE WAS RIGHT! IT WORKS FANTASTIC, WAS WORTH THE WAIT IN THE SHIPPING FROM GERMANY</li>
            <li> This creme is wonderful.  I used it over 30 years ago when my German mother-in-law recommended it for my baby son&#x27;s diaper rash that I couldn&#x27;t get healed.  It&#x27;s still great after all these years for a lot of skin issues such as heat rash, diaper rash, rashes caused by yeast, etc.  I&#x27;ve even used it to help heal minor burns or insect bites.  I love it.  The only problem is that it&#x27;s hard to wash off (that&#x27;s why it works so well).  You have to usually wipe it off with a wash cloth and then use soap &amp; water.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream out there. My son has always had diaper rash issues and nothing worked! Trust me I tired everything!!! This is the only cream that would clear up his redness and rash.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Cairn terrier&#x27;s scabby lip problem. It really works. After a couple applications my dog&#x27;s mouth is clear. The cream is heavy, thick and pasty but not too greasy. My dog did not seem to lick it off. I guess it is sticky enough to resist an obsessive terrier. The cream is white and looks like zinc oxide. The delivery took a couple of weeks, but it seems worth the wait, and this is a large quantity of cream. I doubt I will need to reorder - ever.  I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I grew up with Penaten as the go to first aid cream for skin irritations. I can&#x27;t find it in stores and love that I can get it through&lt;br /&gt;Amazon! I can now keep a tin in my house to continue the tradition started by mom as well as give it as gifts to new mom&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The seller of this &amp;#34;wonder cream&amp;#34; is super efficient, and extremely customer-friendly. If you want any German products, I would for sure go with this seller.</li>
            <li> I have used this product in the past and it is the BEST healing cream.</li>
            <li> I try putting Penaten Creme on first when I have any sort of redness on my skin.  Usually the trouble spot is gone overnight.  I also use it when I am getting little pimples on my face.  It makes them go away.  It is magic.</li>
            <li> great product, used it when we livedn Germany, so had to have it for first grandbaby!  Also great for adult rashes.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING...that&#x27;s all you need to say. My daughter is 3 and we still keep it around. Clears any issues up in a day or two. Even paid extra one time for same day delivery and it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
            <li> Have used this creme for years but were unable to find it recently. So glad to find on Amazon. This creme heals, softens &amp; really works on everything---sores, scrapes &amp; cuts, poison ivy, burns-----it&#x27;s just the best we have ever found! It&#x27;s definitely our &amp;#34;go to creme&amp;#34;. So glad to have it back in our linen closet. Have recommended to others, it&#x27;s just been hard to find.</li>
            <li> The best cream ever. The whole family used it, not just a baby</li>
            <li> worked as advertised and ordered. no problems. used this cream for years for a variety of skin irritations. wish it was sold in the usa.</li>
            <li> Great product for diaper rash</li>
            <li> I literally grew up using this stuff, My Grandma&#x27;s best friend was from Germany. This stuff not only works for rashes but works wonders on burns. I literally trashed my Thumb with a firecracker when I was 12, my Grandma cleaned it up and slathered it with the Penaten Cream, I am now 34 and can&#x27;t tell which Thumb I even did it to. That&#x27;s how good it works!&lt;br /&gt;I was just sitting here thinking about the rash cream I had to use earlier today, I don&#x27;t use the stuff often so it sits and when I went to use it, it was watery and nasty. I thought back to this cream my Grandma used to have at all times in her Kitchen and Bathroom and decided to try googling for it and am truly glad I found that it still exists and still comes in a tin. I will definitly be ordering 2 myself when I get paid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the person who bought 2 containers trust me, you be glad you have it. It even works wonders on a sunburn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this cream on my German Shepherd&#x27;s lip fold pyoderma and some hot spots in her leg and armpits, which is cleared up very nicely.  A better alternative to antibiotics and steroids.</li>
            <li> This is the best diaper rash cream ever!!! It will clear a rash in just one day! My 4 days old baby had a bad diaper rash I tried desitin cream, A&amp;D, the butt paste nothing helped until a friend recommended penaten cream. Works as a miracle!</li>
            <li> I thought the price was high but it was a huge quantity of this item... and to make matters worse I had ordered two containers and rather than return them I now have a lifetime amount of Penaten creme.</li>
            <li> My mother grew up in Germany using this stuff.  She used it on me as a baby and has always had some on hand. Now my sister is using it for her baby.  If something has been around for 100 years, there must be something good about it!</li>
            <li> If your baby&#x27;s butt is red, irritate and/or bleeding... this stuff will stop all of that and help the healing process. This is the only cream I have used that doesn&#x27;t smear off open wounds.</li>
            <li> This is the best over the counter diaper rash cream I have found. It cleared up a diaper rash just as quickly as a prescription cream did. Excellent stuff!</li>
            <li> I have been using this all my life. Introduced to me by my mother before I knew what it was. My mom is from Europe and let&#x27;s just say that Penaten Cream is to her what Windex was to the dad in the Greek wedding movie. If you have an ailment, cut, scrape, itch...put some Penaten Cream on and it&#x27;s gone in the morning. My relatives in Europe use it It&#x27;s a very well known cream in Germany. Used a lot for diaper rash. I think it&#x27;s formula contains witch hazel extract. It has a pleasant smell. Be forewarned, if you&#x27;re using it for chapped lips or cuts, it&#x27;ll be nice and white (like sunscreen). I normally use it overnight on cuts or facial excema I get in winter and my skin heals up after a few days. Definitely a great product that will stay in my family for generations!</li>
            <li> This stuff works wonders. Stays on longer than other similar products</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product that I have used first on my daughter, then my granddaughter and now on my great-granddaughter!  I&#x27;ve recommended this product to many, many other people and they report great satisfaction with Penaten Cream!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t often write reviews for products, but this one is I just had to. It was recommended to me by a friend when my daughter got a really bad diaper rash with an open sore. I ordered this hoping it would work when everything else didn&#x27;t seem to help. It worked wonders. Her diaper rash was visibly better in a day and within a week it was completely gone! A little bit goes a long way and I still have almost all of the tin and still use it when she get the occasional diaper rash.</li>
            <li> Used as diaper cream and works excellent</li>
