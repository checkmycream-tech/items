            <li>So happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It still smells great</li>
            <li>It smells great, and it makes a great gift - although the lady I bought it for says she has smelled it on others, which somewhat takes away the \\&quot;surprise\\&quot; factor for me, as a gift-giver.  </li>
            <li>I despise floral fragrances and am so happy to find something that doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a rosebush.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with this purchase...</li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>What a great price through this retailer...</li>
            <li>that people aren&#x27;t just being nice when they tell me no and that it smells awesome and ask what it is.</li>
            <li>and I am happy</li>
            <li>Get tons of compliments all the time about how great it smells.  </li>
            <li>A great anytime perfume for day or evening.</li>
            <li>Did I mention how great it</li>
            <li>This is one of the best perfumes I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I own a LOT.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a happy, calming, girly scent.  </li>
            <li>It smells great</li>
            <li>The product was nicely packaged and I received in perfect shape.</li>
            <li>IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFUMES I OWN</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>

            <li>It is very nice producte</li>
            <li>It goes very nicely with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>It was very cheap and not a knock off and the stain power is wonderful!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>and oh my does it smell amazing!</li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>Good value and great service</li>
            <li>Awesome smell!!! :-)</li>
            <li>they think their mommy smells wonderful! :)</li>
            <li>Never met a person that hasn&#x27;t liked it yet !</li>
            <li>and I am thrilled!</li>
            <li>girlfriend love it and great speed when sent!</li>
            <li>it has good staying power and smells great....</li>
            <li>Love love this perfume!!!</li>
            <li>it smells of vanilla, berries, and cotton candy with a not so pleasant musk scent ( depending on your taste in scent)</li>
            <li>This perfume is very sweet and delicious!</li>
            <li>Wonderful, beautiful, sexy, romantic.. flawless.. best money</li>
            <li>But im happy to say, Its completely authentic !</li>
            <li>My bottle arrived in excellent condition, brand new and unused, well packaged and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li>but it has a place in my fragrance wardrobe, like a rhinestone clip or bright scarf.</li>
            <li>It also smells wonderful and is as light as air when you apply to your skin.</li>
            <li>Someone who smelled it has started calling me Candy (although he said it doesn&#x27;t taste as good as it smells) and someone else always tells me it smells like toast when I put it on.  </li>
            <li>good</li>
            <li>Everyone keeps telling me how good I smell.</li>
            <li>Good for grownups if your chemistry can handle vanilla scents.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly one day I found it at Amazon by accident.</li>
            <li>It smells so good, like cotton candy or cookies or something.\\&quot; \\&quot;uhhh...</li>
            <li>Smells like to me: a bit of burnt sugar--in a good way, like caramel, a hint of cotton candy and some raspberry scent tones in it.</li>
            <li>And to get this size for so cheap was awesome!</li>
            <li>I agree with the spray in air and walk thru, but what I find is a good idea</li>
            <li>, spray 2 spritz into my hand, add a good amount of  unscented, good quality lotion, rub of towel blotted skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so noisy at the Fair and all your friends are there.</li>
            <li>Good amount of product for money.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>This fit the bill perfectly!  </li>
            <li>I get compliments all the time about how good it smells</li>
            <li>In a good way.</li>

            <li>Love this perfume!</li>
            <li>(men love it too!)</li>
            <li>the seller was accredited, so it means much more!</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;you will (all) love it!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I have received so many compliments on this smell!</li>
            <li>It is the perfect mix of soft, pleasant scents without all the floral scents and though others may disagree, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s youthful at all.  </li>
            <li>I just received it in the mail today and it is amazing.</li>
            <li>it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Free shipping is great</li>
            <li>Everyone comments on how amazing i smell</li>
            <li>This stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li>This perfume smells amazing as everyone else has said.</li>
            <li>The staying power is amazing.</li>
            <li>HAHA Best ( and strangest)</li>
            <li>so if this ever gets popular she&#x27;ll choose something else.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will never wear another kind.</li>
            <li>I guess I should have known that, seeing that it&#x27;s the top seller in fragrances on Amazon, but she seems really, really happy, so that makes me glad.  </li>
            <li>Plus...(fill in this area with your own imagination.)</li>
            <li>and she says she receives many compliments that she smells good..</li>
            <li>So I got my own bottle.</li>
            <li>you Anazon, for good customer service!&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li>Every time that I put it on I get complimented on how good I smell, and who doesn&#x27;t love that?</li>
            <li>But after a minute or so it settels into a warm vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>and I think will be particularly nice in the summer</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li>I found that I cannot even return the item as it is deemed \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>So many people (including strangers) tell me how good I smell when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s best not to wear too much of this stuff, if any at all, to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The scent is so nice</li>
            <li>Sooooooooooooo many beauty gurus on Youtube said how good this smelled.</li>

            <li>Smells great and last most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others.  </li>
            <li>As a rule, I like fragrances that are clean and sophisticated.</li>
            <li>excactly how discribed..Recieved very quickly... will order again when it comes time...</li>
            <li>It came very quick too.</li>
            <li>This perfume did not have QUITE that strong of an alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>It has a sugary smell with strong hints of vanilla and cotton candy, and it lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li>I am someone that doesn&#x27;t like a strong scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think the scent was as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m one of those people that get headaches from strong scents.</li>
            <li>or I just can&#x27;t stand a strong floral smell.</li>
            <li>This perfume is sweet but not too sweet and kind of reminds me of cotton candy spray I used to wear in grammer school.</li>
            <li>This is a light, clean fragrance, yet fun rather than sophisticated and a nice change.</li>
            <li>but it doesnt have a strong smell</li>
            <li>After a bit, the strong smell fades into something that smells like sugar cookies.  </li>
            <li>Smells like strong alcohol/chemicals.</li>
            <li>Is okay.make me headache though.to strong for me</li>
            <li>The pepper part of the scent is too strong for me.</li>
            <li>It stays on well and the smell is strong.</li>
            <li>I BELIEVE SHE LIKED IT VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li>I love when women wear perfumes that have a fruity or sweet scent as opposed to a musky or floral scent.  </li>
            <li>The smell is sweet and age appropriate, she never leaves the house without putting it on.</li>
            <li>Sweet, sexy and flirtatious.</li>
            <li>I love a sweet smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>this started being popular when sephora first started carrying this fragrance...</li>
            <li>Lovely girly smell, not too sweet.</li>
            <li>I love this smell, it is a sweet cotton candy vanilla scent.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not overly sweet and lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more sweet and sugary than foody.  </li>
            <li>this is the first perfume i have bought that my sons father really liked...</li>
            <li>The bottle is beautiful and BIG!</li>
            <li>I smell sweet like cotton candy, but it is not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li>I recommend it for all of you who love vanilla and sweet scents.</li>
            <li>Most people say it smells sweet and sugary</li>
            <li>but i get more of a sweet spicey smell.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The prices on Amazon are hands down the best prices.</li>
            <li>But, as it turned out, it was actually exactly what I was looking for with the same great scent!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t do any good to get a good deal if it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li>Great product, fast delivery, exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li>When I hear Pink Sugar, I think sweet and delicious like cupcakes.</li>
            <li>It is not to strong, nor light.</li>
            <li>A super value too ordering through Amazon!</li>
            <li>This smells exactly like the real perfume, both me and my girlfriend love it!!  </li>
            <li>it doesnt smell all perfumy more of a sweet clean candy smell..</li>
            <li>Anyway, this perfume is great and it only takes a little to smell so wonderful all day.</li>
            <li>I am a huge vanilla and sugar scent fan.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is amazing, there is really nothing else out there quite like it.</li>
            <li>a fun, flirty scent :)</li>
            <li>The scent is addictive and always makes me feel energized and happy.</li>
            <li>so i can enjoy the fragrance all day.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li>also they wrapped it in a bunch of bubble wrap to secure it</li>
            <li>This perfume is a fun, playful, and sexy fragrance.  </li>
            <li>It had free shipping and arrived in 2 days ....</li>
            <li>When first applied it has a nice sort of &#x60;spicy&#x27; undertone that gradually disappears to leave a light, sweet cotton candy scent that is noticeable without being in any way overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Real deal folks, price is amazing.</li>
            <li>I bought it, received the free shipping, and received it a couple of days later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Go light on it.  </li>
            <li>The perfume is amazing and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li>Light, sugary...</li>
            <li>great buy, for any female, as a gift idea.</li>
            <li>Well, that was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Again - the product if working properly is awesome.</li>
            <li>This perfume is fabulous.</li>
            <li>for a fraction of the cost of the legitimate one ($60) &amp; free shipping, why the hell not?</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for everyone, but if you&#x27;re into that candy shop smell, this will fit the bill.</li>
            <li>Amazon offered it at a lower price with free shipping.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>It smells so cheap.</li>
            <li>but the smell is not that fantastic</li>
            <li>I wish I liked it as much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s has such a great smell.</li>
            <li>It smells cheap</li>
            <li>It is light and stays on all day.</li>
            <li>Service great and love Pink Sugar</li>
            <li>I would have to say that the top note is my favorite, however you smell absolutely irresistible with this on.</li>
            <li>If you like soft, warm scents, you will love this perfume.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect summer scent and, HANDS DOWN, Amazon has the best pricing out there (I&#x27;ve payed triple at Nordstrom in the past).</li>
            <li>While this fragrance certainly lasts a very long time (which is great!), the scent is just a tad too strong for me.  </li>
            <li>Too strong, too sweet, smells cheap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that as the day goes on, Pink Sugar evolves into a rich, textured sweetness that is all the while fresh, delightful, and inviting.  </li>
            <li>Ok I was very hesitant about purchasing this perfume because I read many reviews saying the packaging isn&#x27;t the original and</li>
            <li>I think the price is right, and I plan to buy more when this bottle is finished.</li>
            <li>I would say test the fragrance before you buy, though...just to make sure that it is right for you.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes you feel quite sexy and men notice it right away.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is sweet and strong but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li>Try it on first Ladies!!</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li>Though, not a scent I&#x27;d recommend for an older gal - really more appropriate for a pre-40 woman.  </li>
            <li>It is not two strong everyone always complements me that I smell good enough to eat!</li>
            <li>If you want a unique scent get this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this since it first came out, people stop me and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing -mostly women</li>
            <li>I get a lot of compliments on this, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li>I should know better and just go to Amazon.com first.</li>
            <li>Very girly! : )</li>
            <li>This perfume is not overbearing and has a light sweet scent.</li>
            <li>I was excited to see this on here.</li>
            <li>I first tried this at Sephora and fell in love.  </li>
            <li>but it smells fantastic, sugary and sweet.  </li>
            <li>It is a light, sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure of purchasing this.</li>
            <li>you get alot for the price so its def worth it!</li>
            <li>Not the original.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying out!</li>
            <li>I love you Mr. Ellis Thanks!</li>
            <li>very girly and sweet!!</li>
            <li>Vanilla is the most obvious note, however on me the perfume takes on a warm caramel citrus scent too.</li>
            <li>My sister was visiting for a couple of minutes, and when she left I walked into the room she had been in and smelled the most amazing perfume.</li>
            <li>fantastic embraceable sexy sent and everyone always wants to know what it is.</li>
            <li>Overall I am happy with my purchase, arrived super quick and I would recommend this</li>
            <li>Long wearing, great size, the service was quick.</li>
            <li>The smell is super sweet and very pleasant, it may be a little too sweet for some people</li>
            <li>The top comes off easily, revealing a fragrance bottle wrapped with a piece of white cardboard to keep it safe.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t worn it around anyone to see what anyone else thinks about it, so I&#x27;m hoping it will grow on me once I&#x27;ve worn it more and if it gets good reactions from other people, and</li>
            <li>I save it for special occasions.</li>
            <li>All of my shoes tend to be flats with the occassional 2\\&quot; heel that I need for a special event.  </li>
            <li>Vanilla, musk and bergamot give this perfume a special notes.  </li>
            <li>\\&quot;Compliment City\\&quot; is right around the corner!</li>
            <li>Pink sugar is a happy smell.</li>
            <li>I am so happy with my purchase of Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li>as for those who say its too sweet smelling: ur buying a perfume called \\&quot;pink sugar\\&quot; lol what do you expect?</li>
            <li>Nice sweet soft scent.</li>
            <li>This smells so sweet</li>
            <li>Many factors can affect a perfume, the main one being strong heat/light, causing it to lose its fun scent, leaving the remains of a rubbing-alcohol smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true what they say, a way to a man&#x27;s heart is through his stomach.</li>
            <li>Some women had reviewed it as being really really sweet, like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li>Light scent, yet so fun and yummy smelling.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand the popularity of this product nor how anyone finds that to smell sweet.</li>
            <li>I love this scent and the price is very affordable.  </li>
            <li>I bought a full size bottle, and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li>It is sweet smelling, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>your body chemistry works well with sweet smells</li>
            <li>It smells so sweet and yummy.</li>
            <li>but it seems nearly embarrassing to wear on its own at my age.  </li>
            <li>It was labeled on the manufacturer label as a Tester, and it had full fragrance in a full bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll go through it fast with how much I love it.  </li>
            <li>2 hours after applying, it still retains that sweet note--</li>
            <li>very flirty, smells a bit like cotton candy :)</li>
            <li>It is however a sweet scent.</li>
            <li>Not kiddie candy smell but a sweet sweet smell</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sweet like vanilla and cotton candy nothing like it.</li>
            <li>This is sweet, overpowering sweet</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good one though, if you&#x27;re a teen like me.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that I sometimes put some on before I go to bed</li>
            <li>No burnt notes for me, it&#x27;s not so sweet</li>
            <li>Even guy friends will comment and say mmmm what is that sweet smell..</li>
            <li>Being sweet</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not the true Aquolina brand</li>
            <li>It is a vanilla like sweet smell.  </li>
            <li>It smells like cotton candy so don&#x27;t buy it unless you like a sweet smell.</li>
            <li>This is sweet, but not like the fruity gunk</li>
            <li>If you like smelling like candy and all sweet, this is a must have.</li>
            <li>It is extremely sweet smelling (just like cotton candy).</li>
            <li>It is definitely a sweet smelling perfume.</li>
            <li>I can even smell it on my clothes after a full day of wearing it.</li>
            <li>this perfume def isn&#x27;t for you if you don&#x27;t like really sweet smells.</li>
            <li>I bought it because I was looking for a sweet vanilla sugary smelling scent, this is not that.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>But this does NOT smell like sugar in any way.&lt;br /&gt;Not a sweet smell at all.</li>
            <li>Not to sweet at all.</li>
            <li>Sweet without smelling like cotton candy</li>
            <li>smell sweet, like vanilla!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>It sweet.</li>
            <li>I wear it, people constantly tell me how good it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you like the smell of vanilla or freshly baked goods you will enjoy this sweet scent.</li>
            <li>I loved this at first for winter - the licorice and warm vanilla smells are great for the cold Boston winters.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice soft sweet (cotton candy) scent</li>
            <li>The cotton candy finally comes out on top of the scent, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less beautiful, it still smells like something a strong, powerful, sexy woman would wear.</li>
            <li>I bought the Pink Sugar EDT Spray because I just love it!!</li>
            <li>Smells great on other people...</li>
            <li>Great price compared to other places.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so happy with Pink Sugar!</li>
            <li>I purchased the 1.7 ounce bottle from Sephora, and since I was using it every day I ran out quickly.</li>
            <li>I got here so quick</li>
            <li>I have gotten many compliments on it from women but actually seemed to receive more from men...</li>
            <li>Luckily, I found the product on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so perfect for springtime, and at such a low cost, you would be foolish to pass it up.</li>
            <li>It arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Pink Sugar has a sweety-spicy smell and it is perfect for an adult.</li>
            <li>and it smells way better than the high end perfumes.</li>
            <li>Pink Sugar is a really pleasant and sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>Pink sugar is amazing!</li>
            <li>It is is suitable for an adult as well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great everyday fragrance, light, fun</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping also!</li>
            <li>but not so sweet that it doesn&#x27;t have an uplifting, fresh feel to it.</li>
            <li>I expect my man to pull me into his arms and take a good long sniff when he smells me wearing this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Right off the top what I smell is black pepper, which I found really appealing, since I love pepper.  </li>
            <li>To me the initial scent is sweet, almost citrusy but that quickly fades into a mix of warm sugary goodness.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get such a great price, but as the old saying goes, &amp;#34;you pay for what you get.&amp;#34</li>
            <li>Depending on how strong you perfer your perfumes: usually my wrists, the back of my neck (where people hug me), &amp; a light mist all over does the job perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink</li>
            <li>This perfume smells sweet, sexy, and young.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s sweet and light in the beginning, much like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li>It has a sweet and soft scent that you will LOVE.</li>
            <li>way.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on bright and clean, with a bit of sparkle to it, like sugar cookies with pink sugar!  </li>
            <li>This stuff Smells exactly just like cotton candy!</li>
            <li>Does not even smell close to the real thing!!</li>
            <li>Ordered and my perfume just arrived, could not be more pleased, this perfume is not only in a pretty bottle</li>
            <li>I can only say that I love this fragrance!</li>
            <li>the smell is exactly on point to the original.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future I love it so much!</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not fake!</li>
            <li>Wow the product was exactly what I wanted and it was an excellent price and buy for the other prices I have seen.</li>
            <li>I first smelled this at Kohls, sprayed it onto one of those paper things and initially thought it smelled nice, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>It has an amazing smell and its the only perfume</li>
            <li>I think it smells far better than just toast.  </li>
            <li>This smells a bit like the old \\&quot;Love</li>
            <li>I lightly sprayed my wrist, thought it was okay, and soon after left the store.  </li>
            <li>I was very pleasantly surprised :)</li>
            <li>Big bottle, nothing more to say except it is fantastic</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s well worth the money and the 3.4 ounce</li>
            <li>I was surprised to see such a great price on Amazon, so I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li>Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li>Pink sugar will leave you smelling good for hours.</li>
            <li>The smell is better suited for a young girl</li>
            <li>I think it all depends on the kind of scents you like and what your personal style is.</li>
            <li>One of the guys said I was like a &amp;#34;walking jolly rancher&amp;#34; and it made me smile for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li>Men love when I wear this and can&#x27;t comment enough on how much they love it.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a warm, sugary scent, reminiscent of cotton candy and vanilla.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure about young girls wearing it since it does have a sweet-sexy, alluring scent.</li>
            <li>I was told this is not the genuine product more than likely.</li>
            <li>It was well worth it</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you like sweet candy scents!</li>
            <li>After a few hours, it fades in a very warm and yummy scent, like a mixture of brown sugar and vanilla.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It was not too long before I ordered this perfume, and all I can say is that I&#x27;m in LOVE with this heavenly scent!  </li>
            <li>I also think that Pink Sugar isn&#x27;t just appealing for teenagers--but for anyone who is interested in a playful, yet sophisticated fragrance that smells</li>
            <li>I love pink sugar, it&#x27;s a light sweet scent.</li>
            <li>This is the real brand, full sized, packaged really well and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li>I just love the light, slightly sweet scent of Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li>or it wasn&#x27;t the right version.</li>
            <li>But it&#x27;s usually right after I spray it</li>
            <li>I waited patiently to order it online though, instead of right then and there.</li>
            <li>A 1 ounce bottle was $40.00, and I right away knew that it would be cheaper online.</li>
            <li>I got the right one</li>
            <li>I called her right away to ask what it was</li>
            <li>and I noticed something was off right away.</li>
            <li>I sprayed it and it smells right,</li>
            <li>Very soft, sweet brings out the playful side in you!</li>
            <li>At first, it smells really sweet, but there is this really chemically, musky undertone that just kills my  nose!  </li>
            <li>I recommend this product to any female that love a sweet smell.</li>
            <li>:) the licorice scent is very strong at first but after a little bit goes away.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely not the most sophisticated fragrance in my collection, but on some days when the mood is right I love using Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended if you enjoy smelling like candy and vanilla~</li>
            <li>Less than a week later I had my order and was very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>I really like this sweet cotton candy smell...</li>
            <li>A spiced hot sugar freshly spun.  </li>
            <li>If you are smelling too sweet, you may be putting on too much.  </li>
            <li>It is not overpowering or sickly sweet, and people who are VERY picky about perfume said they like it.</li>
            <li>It is a nice blend of cotton candy and other sweet fragrences.</li>
            <li>It has a very strong initial scent at first.  </li>
            <li>this is one of my favorite scents and was priced more reasonably than other places where i have seen it on sale.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for everyday wear, as it is also very affordable.</li>
            <li>It was shipped to me super fast</li>
            <li>Also the bottle leaks from the top it drips all over the place soo much wasted product there is more on my vanity than myself.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this, I didn&#x27;t usually wear perfume, but now, I make sure to always spritz some on!!  </li>
            <li>I found Pink Sugar when I was in Paris shopping and fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li>Alright so I bought this a perfume a year and a half ago, I LOVED it at first.</li>
            <li>For it came super fast and smells heavenly ;)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very much a \\&quot;pink\\&quot; scent.  </li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s just say it was very appreciated</li>
            <li>Not to mention the shipping was very fast despite the fact it was not prime eligible.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very, very fast.  </li>
            <li>I originally sampled this fragrance in Sephora a few months ago and liked it, yet didn&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
            <li>I was scared it would not smell like the real deal, but it does and it in quite large, true to there word.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light enough to not overwhelm, but has just the right amount of feminine fragrance to get noticed!</li>
            <li>Especially the cute packaging.</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I used almost a whole bottle!</li>
            <li>but both of them smell funny after they sit for a while-they don&#x27;t smell like the bottles in the store.</li>
            <li>can&#x27;t possibly say how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Wore it to bed every night the first 2 weeks after I received it.  </li>
            <li>I have not been swarmed by people saying how much they like it, but I have had compliments from people who&#x27;ve never been complimentary about anything else, so...?  </li>
            <li>I most definitely recommend this product, and the others as well!  </li>
            <li>The scent is exactly like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, it smells very yum!</li>
            <li>Item exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>then just bought the Christmas time only gift pack at Nordstrom, which is even better in price for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li>I first sampled this fragrance walking through a department store.  </li>
            <li>and I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s definitely one of my faves.</li>
            <li>Also, shipping was really fast!</li>
            <li>first applied it smells smi-overpowering, and has a strawberry icecream tint to it.</li>
            <li>I love perfume and this is definitely a favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Again, it is not necessary to apply more that a couple (one or two) squirts.  </li>
            <li>and I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>since I like going through  perfume phases, where I&#x27;ll wear one scent for a while until it runs out pretty much!</li>
            <li>So glad I&#x27;ve finally found my signature scent.</li>
            <li>I first smelled it at a Sephora store some time ago</li>
            <li>When you first put it on it does smell like a mix of cotton candy and vanilla, but as the day goes on the smell deepens.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, too!  </li>
            <li>also know that Amazon.com would not jeopardize their legendary reputation by selling a knockoff or fake version of one of their best-selling perfumes.</li>
            <li>The observant shopper will notice the hot pepper on the cylender label, indicating the spicy \\&quot;adult\\&quot; nature of this EDT.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I want to get the body cream next. :)</li>
            <li>This is the first time that I have bought something from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li>I first came across it in an upscale cosmetic store.  </li>
            <li>and I feel so pretty and girly when I wear it.</li>
            <li>Smells cheap and too young for me.</li>
            <li>so obviously I jumped at the opportunity to get in on here for so cheap!</li>
            <li>I really like this smell!  </li>
            <li>What woman wouldn&#x27;t want to smell edibile yet sophisticated at the same time?  </li>
            <li>The bottles that don&#x27;t say Aquolina are the most current version of this product.</li>
            <li>I never review my Amazon purchases, but I had to praise the seller on this one since my experience overall was fantastic!</li>
            <li>My girlfriend loves this perfume and its much cheaper buying it on Amazon rather than from Sephora!</li>
            <li>This is the first time I have purchased this perfume</li>
            <li>The first spray smelt like a mixture of alcohol and candy overpowering.</li>
            <li>I get so many compliments when I wear it, from both men (especially) and women.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li>Used it the first morning.</li>
            <li>The spray top was different from the others i bought.</li>
            <li>I you like sweet sugary scents, than you are going to love Pink Sugar.  </li>
            <li>If you want this perfume, u should go sample it at a store first</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not heavy at all, just very fresh and feminine.  </li>
            <li>This is not one of those cheap teen perfumes that fades away quickly.</li>
            <li>Its an okay perfume very sweet but maybe a little too much for my liking .</li>
            <li>I still like it very much, as it&#x27;s sweet, but not juvenile.</li>
            <li>it, im pretty sure you&#x27;ll get the same responses too.. just dont spray TOO much.</li>
            <li>Although this does smell sweet, it&#x27;s a little too sweet and strong.  </li>
            <li>Once it dries down, it takes on a different scent, more like a warm vanilla.</li>
            <li>It arrived right on schedule, came in the standard packaging, and was in fine condition.  </li>
            <li>It arrived earlier than expected and was in great condition.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s such a sweet smell, sweet olfactoraly speaking, but also in a tender sort of way.</li>
            <li>and I love it so much I am now on my second bottle.</li>
            <li>Definitely a fragrance that says that you are old enough to know better, but still too young to care (in a good way).</li>
            <li>it shipped pretty fast too.</li>
            <li>The packaging is pretty and the presentation is really girly in a grown up girl kinda</li>
            <li>I love this scent and don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this</li>
            <li>The perfume lasts pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li>Men and women compliment me all the time, and tell me the scent is sweet but mature.  </li>
            <li>This fragance is unique like no other, be prepared for everybody asking what you have on, both men and women.  </li>
            <li>I mean HATES smells of any kind!</li>
            <li>If you are looking to surprise your special one with a new scent, it&#x27;s a safe bet she will really like Pink Sugar.  </li>
            <li>It smells very sweet but not overpowering, even though the scent will last you the whole day.</li>
            <li>Fresh, clean and for old or young.</li>
            <li>What first caught my attention was the cute bottle design, and also the name, \\&quot;Pink</li>
            <li>It is like pure concentrated SUGAR.</li>
            <li>As my years have progressed, naturally certain tastes of mine have changed.  </li>
            <li>wasn&#x27;t that smart.</li>
            <li>Itsnanclean pure smell.</li>
            <li>I heard it described as pure candy, cookies, and sugar.</li>
            <li>I had tried so many different perfumes, and had come to terms with the fact I was destined to live a life without a \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>It definitely does have a first, initial smell and a second smell, and the second smell, which lasts, is really good. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>it can be a little over whelming if you marinate yourself in it, i suggest spritzing some into the air and then walking into the scent, it is a nice fragrance to have on hand.</li>
            <li>The bottle is huge, especially for the price that Amazon offered, but I have a feeling</li>
            <li>not only does this perfume smell amazing, but it literally lasts throughout my entire work day.</li>
            <li>Smells like absolute heaven.</li>
            <li>Pink Sugar is my all-time favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>I have looked very closely at the packaging.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t get any sweeter than this, and yet, it is not overpowering, and it lasts for hours and hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pink Sugar is one of those scents that I would have worn as a much younger lady yet it still holds great appeal for me now that I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I really wish they would come out with an EDP version.</li>
            <li>and it smelled really funky, I don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really speak for why she likes it</li>
            <li>I love Pink Sugar-</li>
            <li>I really wanted this fragrance for years.  </li>
            <li>It really blended well</li>
            <li>It priced really reasonable, which is unusual for perfumes of this caliber.  </li>
            <li>The scent feels fresh and young.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Anazon took care of the problem very kindly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think that&#x27;s me, do I have too much on??\\&quot;</li>
            <li>Perfums are one of those item which result very convenient to buy through the Internet.  </li>
            <li>This scent is absolutely heavenly.</li>
            <li>tahnk you so much.</li>
            <li>Real cotton candy scent on</li>
            <li>I know the difference because I have bought the real perfume before</li>
            <li>Can smell it if you are close to me, (very close)</li>
            <li>absolutely adore this fragrance - but will you?</li>
            <li>The fragrance itself is fantastic, starting off with that slightly peppery bergamot note on top of the sweetness, then dries to a powdery cotton candy finish after the pepper disappears.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also extremely reasonably priced for perfume.</li>
            <li>I guess it for people who really like sweet&amp;sugary scents .</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really get to wear it.  </li>
            <li>and I really wanted to try it</li>
            <li>Real stuff.</li>
            <li>Bought for a friend&#x27;s birthday, she absolutely adored it.</li>
            <li>I always use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li>Summers, not so much....</li>
            <li>I love pink sugar Aqualina</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Who wants to smell like that?</li>
            <li>I cant believe how fast I received this</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>Very upset about this purchase.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe it got here so fast.</li>
            <li>absolutely my fav summer smell</li>
            <li>Lasted the whole day</li>
            <li>so I know it is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Ordered the 3.4 oz size for $25, no tax, fast</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some reviews that indicated this was not the real thing</li>
            <li>I really like this scent.</li>
            <li>You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li>I know this is the real deal.</li>
            <li>Feel very relaxed smelling like that.  </li>
            <li>I love Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the product was just as described.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I have bought this perfume from pricey department stores like SEPHORA, and this one from this seller is the real deal.</li>
            <li>and you smell the strength and real quality.</li>
            <li>Haha.</li>
            <li>Fast, efficient, and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>thanks again</li>
            <li>#34;no time&amp;#34;,regardless of how much you apply.</li>
            <li>I love it so much that decided to also purchase Pink Sugar Sensual, can not wait to receive it.</li>
            <li>so I naturally tend to lean more towards sweeter scents, so this perfume was an instant addiction.</li>
            <li>Will shop on line more frequently for big savings all the time!</li>
            <li>Such a pretty, girly scent!!</li>
            <li>It arrived the other day and was in the same good condition as the perfume.  </li>
            <li>Not overpowering, but if you don&#x27;t like wearing sweet smelling fragrances, stay far, far away from this product!</li>
            <li>Way to strong seems like it has been siting around for a long time</li>
            <li>Pink sugar is my absolute, hands down most favorite perfume in the world.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the product and didn&#x27;t know if it would last an hour or all day.  </li>
            <li>I love Pink Sugar!</li>
            <li>I purchased this fragrance from Sephora&#x27;s website because I needed something more playful and youthful than my other scents.</li>
            <li>I am aware that this is supposed to smell like the treat; however, I thought that Aquolina would personalize this scent a little more.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and found it to be Pink Sugar,we purchased same and are very pleased with this&lt;br /&gt;Eau de Toilette</li>
            <li>The cylender containing the perfume has textured, pink stripes on the top and sides-- stripes that are 3D &amp; you can feel the slight rubberiness touching them.</li>
            <li>Based on the the description and name of this perfume, I expected it to smell sweet, fruity and fun.</li>
            <li>It has a very subtle sweet scent that guys love!</li>
            <li>the actual bottle has a nice frosted pink cap with really cute darker pink ribbon wrapped around it in a crisscrossing</li>
            <li>This perfume is sooo fragrant, high quality, and real, just a dab</li>
            <li>I have a sensitive nose and can only were certain, light perfumes.  </li>
            <li>I only use on special occasions.</li>
            <li>I got to pay a lot less for my absolute favorite perfume.</li>
            <li>and she loves it,smells sweet and will last forever</li>
            <li>Such a sweet and sultry scent.</li>
            <li>If you like smelling sweet and possibly edible, this is the scent for you.</li>
            <li>It IS sweet, but not THAT sweet, sugary but not sickeningly sweet.  </li>
            <li>This is my favorite fragrance hands down.  </li>
            <li>Love pink sugar!!</li>
            <li>This is a super sweet scent that reminds me of something that girls under 20 would wear (which could be a good or bad thing).</li>
            <li>(Not overly heavy and strong!)</li>
            <li>It looked absolutely brand new.</li>
            <li>They were identical to the one I received and more than half the price.</li>
            <li>MAIN issue is that the smell is just...</li>
            <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find this particular fragrance anywhere, I once again turned to Amazon and of course they carried it.</li>
            <li>Being a young teen, I really enjoy perfumes that can compliment my style, as well as my personality.  </li>
            <li>I have received numerous compliments and will be back for more.</li>
            <li>I love to smell it on her, and the scent generally lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li>Any perfume can give people headaches or make them nauseous, particularly if the wearer works with chemotherapy patients, as I do.  </li>
            <li>The powder, red fruit, and cotton candy is such a lovely scent.</li>
            <li>if you want a decent perfume, don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li>i feel sorry for all those great reviews u may be getting something else rather than the real deal.</li>
            <li>And it doesn&#x27;t last that long, but when it does, it&#x27;s strong!</li>
            <li>I purchased it with the Pink Sugar moisturizer and together they have a great long lasting layering effect.</li>
            <li>Pink Sugar I will definitely repurchase, it has the sweetest smell, and it is not overwhelmingly sick or anything, it literally is sweet and gentle..</li>
            <li>After wearing for like six hours the scent has settle down enormously and not sickening sweet.</li>
            <li>After all, it is a great price and it really is not THAT far off from the more expensive version.</li>
            <li>I highly reccomend this to every teenager, like me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li>Been buying it for 4 years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>This is different from any other \\&quot;Oriental\\&quot; fragrance I have ever smelled, but gorgeous enough that I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves fragrances in that category, OR anyone who can&#x27;t decide between Earl Grey tea and a vanilla cappuccino in the morning.</li>
            <li>Its soft, sweet, rich, sometimes a little spicy.</li>
            <li>I ordered a Pink Sugar Tester spray thinking that for the fantastic price, it might just be a less than reputable product.  </li>
            <li>After reading many reviews I was a little hesitant to make this purchase.  </li>
            <li>I was more than pleased because it was less than half the price!  </li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not sure what some of these other people got, but mine is the real deal so the price with shipping is a great deal.</li>
            <li>It will last the whole day!!</li>
            <li>Everything seemed pretty legit, &amp; there were far more positive reviews than negative</li>
            <li>I have a small one for my purse and a large one for at home &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>Rarely, if ever, do I care much about packaging, but Pink Sugar certainly is an exception.</li>
            <li>The packaging looks very much the same but on the bottle it does not say \\&quot;aqualina\\&quot; like the real stuff</li>
            <li>I love Pink Sugar!!!</li>
            <li>My body chemistry reacts badly with 99% of perfumes and colognes but this one is a perfect match!</li>
            <li>I have yet to meet someone who doesn&#x27;t enjoy the scent of Pink Sugar--</li>
            <li>/&gt;OVERALL, I would say definitely go and purchase from this dealer if you are willing to sacrifice the long-wearing effect that this perfume has when purchased from a real beauty supplier like Sephora.</li>
            <li>Because we all have our own personal body chemistry, one fragrance can smell quite different on various people.</li>
            <li>I pretty much wear it daily.</li>
            <li>I love the way this smells, and its a long lasting fragrance that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
            <li>This scent is worth a second chance.</li>
            <li>It is not too sweet and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only fragrance I&#x27;m wearing right now</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s probably best avoided in humid summer weather as it can become a bit sickly.</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s not a strong perfume</li>
            <li>It is special as no other perfumes smell the same.  </li>
            <li>To put my review in context, I am not a fan of musks (ex. \\&quot;Carolina Herrera\\&quot;) or the classics that other women seem to enjoy (ex.</li>
            <li>The bottle was in a brand new package with a plastic seal and everything.</li>
            <li>I am always scared to try new perfumes.</li>
            <li>My new signature scent.</li>
            <li>new go to perfume.</li>
            <li>New product, not a tester.</li>
            <li>The packaging was brand new.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money - Only buy it if you have smelled it and liked the smell.</li>
            <li>Pink Sugar is a good everyday fragrance that is not overpowering or offensive.  </li>
            <li>Coworkers have commented on how nice and subtle it is.  </li>
            <li>Obviously lots of people love Pink Sugar and maybe you will as well.</li>
            <li>I ordered Pink Sugar on QVC few years ago and loved the smell.</li>
            <li>Nonetheless, I still enjoy wearing this to casual events, as it is appealing.</li>
            <li>It is very sweet smelling and not too heavy.</li>
            <li>It has a sweet smell, hard to describe, but its not a childish sweet...</li>
            <li>I first smelled this product when I was in Sephora testing out different fragrances</li>
            <li>When I first wore it my husband actually said, \\&quot;you smell so good\\&quot;!</li>
            <li>And the perfumes that I love (ex. \\&quot;Ciara\\&quot;, \\&quot;Norell\\&quot;, and Victoria&#x27;s Secret \\&quot;Rapture\\&quot;) smell great on other women, but turn into a sour stank on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I had read some other reviews saying that it is better suited for younger people.</li>
            <li>This was my first and only issue with buying something through Amazon.</li>
            <li>Smells like an adult version of toasted marshmallows!</li>
            <li>I have tried many designer brands in the past.</li>
            <li>First of all, everyone has a different body chemistry.</li>
            <li>It smells like cotton candy and first but once that initial scent wears off, it smells like caramel and vanilla and baby powdery.</li>
            <li>I saw this same product on another website and the cost was much higher plus you had to pay shipping.</li>
            <li>and so does my significant other.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cotton Candy is my favorite scent, and normally I would mind it being mixed with other things... not this time!</li>
            <li>So this is a huge step down.</li>
            <li>packaging is not super extraordinary, but I don&#x27;t really &#x27;buy the perfume for the bottle&#x27;.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very quickly- within a day and a half!</li>
            <li>The size was large also so it will last a while.</li>
            <li>I got the large 3.4 oz bottle for only $25.  </li>
            <li>I hate musk, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li>scent of Pink Sugar is like pure cotton candy straight from the County fairground.</li>
            <li>(I think perfumes smell a little different on everyone)My kiddos love it, as well...</li>
            <li>and I found this scent which I love and a little last all day!!!!</li>
            <li>I read a good but of the reviews on here about this particular sellers product and some (not many but some) said that this was absolutely not the same as the product sold in Sephora.</li>
            <li>It is for those ladies younger and more mature that want just a little hint of the feminine and the yummy (think cotten candy) to catch the senses of passersby.</li>
            <li>I get migraines very easily...and this is soft enough that it does not cause headaches.  </li>
            <li>the natural chemistry of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend buying it for someone old and stuffy.</li>
            <li>I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 16 year old sister.</li>
            <li>My 6 year old daughter loves it too...</li>
            <li>You smell young when you wear this.</li>
            <li>Its like Loves Baby Soft for grown ups.</li>
            <li>Purchased the genuine product before a few years ago</li>
            <li>so I gave it to my 10 year old daughter with the instructions to spritz in the air and do a walk through</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has some real sillage -- my coworker could smell it from outside my office, and came in to ask me what I was wearing.  </li>
            <li>my bottle mysteriously disappeared at my wedding while I was getting ready.</li>
            <li>Or maybe a young adult.</li>
            <li>This is a terrific perfume for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>In fact, my husband thought it smelled like \\&quot;old people and baby powder.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My 10 year old son, my husband and mother-in-law</li>
            <li>it doesnt have the name on the bottle and it wears off in an hour the real one last all day.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about 30 minutes, &amp; I have been running around my home cleaning working up a sweat &amp; thus far reacts just as I remembered.</li>
            <li>It lasts pretty long but does fade with time.</li>
            <li>I really like this and its definitely one of my favorites.</li>
            <li>Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I put on a sample secretly and then walked around the house when company was over, just to see what kind of reaction</li>
            <li>I like how unique the fragrance is, light, airy, nostalgic, not overpowering....</li>
            <li>I was so excited when i got back from our family trip and found Pink Sugar in the mail.</li>
            <li>Knock offs usually have a strong alcohol smell and this does.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it&#x27;s not as strong as usual</li>
            <li>It stays true, but softens down so it is more subtle sunny/oriental/floral.  </li>
            <li>I instantly liked the fragrance, one that smelled very similar to cotton candy, with subtle tones of vanilla.  </li>
            <li>The Sensual is nice, lighter, with a slight spice to it, reminds me of Colors by Benetton that I used in the early 90s, very different from this Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li>I expected the entire bouquet to be sweet.  </li>
            <li>Still wont purchase again though large bottle so it will be a long time before I finish it.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried this perfume would be too sweet smelling after reading some of the reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years, religiously but the price has always been so high</li>
            <li>This is a soft, sweet, lovely fragrance and not that sickening sweet, candy like smell.  </li>
            <li>Completely addicted, my new favorite scent.  </li>
            <li>It is a lightly scented long lasting perfume with a hint of a sweet sugary vanilla mixture and definitely captivated my attention when it was applied (as it lingered in the air)and also later when it also simmered down to its under-lying notes of vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although it is a very feminine fragrance Pink Sugar is not cloying or obnoxious but complex, sophisticated, and playful.</li>
            <li>Unbelievable service and always a smooth shopping experience ..</li>
            <li>its sweet, and heavenly..not heavy at all,,.</li>
            <li>so the only thing I worry about is that it&#x27;s a little too light</li>
            <li>Smells very sweet and is different than what I would usually buy myself.</li>
            <li>I was concerned after reading a few reviews stating that this perfume is not the authentic Aquolina Pink Sugar perfume.</li>
            <li>Smell is pretty long lasting.</li>
            <li>it really smells like sweet pink lemonade with a little bit of cotton candy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found that it wears very well on me, especially if I put a little moisturizing lotion on first.  </li>
            <li>When I received the Aquolina, it was very clear that it was no original-the box was similar but without aquolina sign.</li>
            <li>I got a major headache from it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Amazon always does it right and with the wide selection of product and low prices there&#x27;s no reason why amazon shouldn&#x27;t be the go to choice every time</li>
            <li>At first it smells like licorice, then after a few minutes, sinks right into cotton candy.</li>
            <li>I love the pink and white swirled cylinder that had slightly rubbery raised stripes and</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use much and it doesn&#x27;t sting my skin like other perfumes (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li>I can smell this on myself all day long, which is a huge plus since other perfumes barely last an hour on me.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It smells so sweet that the almost invisible little sugar ants I&#x27;m trying to get rid of were actually drawn to it.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like foody scents, generally, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine wanting to smell like caramel and cotton candy.  </li>
            <li>I went back to the old bottle and sprayed it</li>
            <li>Also, I would recommend the entire product line to complete the scent assembly.</li>
            <li>It really does smell like Pink Sugar with a touch of vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>After a bit of time, what was left was a soft cotton candy type smell.</li>
            <li>Is it possible its old?</li>
            <li>That is thanks to pink sugar.</li>
            <li>the perfume bottle itself is a glass bottle with hot pink stripes similar to the tube it comes in</li>
            <li>Okay smelling when it finally died down, but for obvious reasons, I won&#x27;t be purchasing pink sugar.</li>
            <li>stuff smells like a mix between cotton candy and subtle fresh baked cookies without that sickly sweet smell of other \\&quot;candy\\&quot; style perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>They no longer sell it in the Sephora in town, due to decrease in popularity...and that&#x27;s fine with me because that means less women will be wearing it.</li>
            <li>Very affordable compared to other perfumes out there.</li>
            <li>because as far as I can tell the packaging IS the original and it ISNT a knock off the perfume comes in a sturdy cardboard cylinder with textured pink stripes with the pink sugar logo and a pink spiral on the lid</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear the strong floral, heavy musky perfumes simply because they give me headaches, so Pink Sugar saved me from that.</li>
            <li>And what I got was the exact same as what I&#x27;ve been using from Sephora, from the smell down to the bottle and casing.</li>
            <li>I usually have an allergic reaction to most perfumes due to the floral scent, however this perfume smells like, well, candy!  </li>
            <li>Others have complained about it fading too quickly on them, but I think their noses are just not good enough, it lasts all day although very much more subtly later in the day, with just a touch of musk showing up.  </li>
            <li>It is the real stuff not watered down so all you need is 2 sprays and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li>The new \\&quot;Pink Sugar\\&quot; perfume bottles do not say Aquolina on the bottle anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So im not sure how to rate this right now.</li>
            <li>The scent lasts all day, but isn&#x27;t quite as delicate and sweet smelling as my last one.</li>
            <li>Sugar perfume smells just like sweet, fluffy, pink cotton candy and everyone LOVES it and asks me what perfume are you wearing?</li>
            <li>(The few instances it is have been positive experiences ;P )</li>
            <li>Others reported it was not the real thing or was not packaged in the proper packaging that was NOT TRUE for me.</li>
            <li>so a little goes a long way when you first spray it</li>
            <li>I tend to go for dark, musky, woodsy smells, but I was getting sick of those and wanted to branch out for something more unique.  </li>

            <li> It smells great, and it makes a great gift - although the lady I bought it for says she has smelled it on others, which somewhat takes away the \\&quot;surprise\\&quot; factor for me, as a gift-giver.  </li>

            <li> The lady on the phone was very nice though when I called about it.</li>
            <li> It is very nice producte</li>
            <li> It goes very nicely with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> It was very cheap and not a knock off and the stain power is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>

            <li> they think their mommy smells wonderful! :)</li>
            <li> Never met a person that hasn&#x27;t liked it yet !</li>
            <li> and I am thrilled!</li>
            <li> girlfriend love it and great speed when sent!</li>
            <li> it has good staying power and smells great....</li>
            <li> Love love this perfume!!!</li>
            <li> it smells of vanilla, berries, and cotton candy with a not so pleasant musk scent ( depending on your taste in scent)</li>
            <li> This perfume is very sweet and delicious!</li>
            <li> Wonderful, beautiful, sexy, romantic.. flawless.. best money</li>
            <li> But im happy to say, Its completely authentic !</li>
            <li> My bottle arrived in excellent condition, brand new and unused, well packaged and the fragrance is wonderful.</li>
            <li> but it has a place in my fragrance wardrobe, like a rhinestone clip or bright scarf.</li>
            <li> It also smells wonderful and is as light as air when you apply to your skin.</li>
            <li> Someone who smelled it has started calling me Candy (although he said it doesn&#x27;t taste as good as it smells) and someone else always tells me it smells like toast when I put it on.  </li>
            <li> good</li>
            <li> Everyone keeps telling me how good I smell.</li>
            <li> Good for grownups if your chemistry can handle vanilla scents.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly one day I found it at Amazon by accident.</li>
            <li> It smells so good, like cotton candy or cookies or something.\\&quot; \\&quot;uhhh...</li>
            <li> Smells like to me: a bit of burnt sugar--in a good way, like caramel, a hint of cotton candy and some raspberry scent tones in it.</li>
            <li> And to get this size for so cheap was awesome!</li>
            <li> I agree with the spray in air and walk thru, but what I find is a good idea</li>
            <li> , spray 2 spritz into my hand, add a good amount of  unscented, good quality lotion, rub of towel blotted skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so noisy at the Fair and all your friends are there.</li>
            <li> Good amount of product for money.[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This fit the bill perfectly!  </li>
            <li> I get compliments all the time about how good it smells</li>
            <li> In a good way.</li>
            <li> Girl Friend loved it</li>

            <li> (men love it too!)</li>
            <li> the seller was accredited, so it means much more!</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;you will (all) love it!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I have received so many compliments on this smell!</li>
            <li> It is the perfect mix of soft, pleasant scents without all the floral scents and though others may disagree, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s youthful at all.  </li>
            <li> I just received it in the mail today and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> Free shipping is great</li>
            <li> Everyone comments on how amazing i smell</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing as everyone else has said.</li>
            <li> The staying power is amazing.</li>
            <li> HAHA Best ( and strangest)</li>
            <li> so if this ever gets popular she&#x27;ll choose something else.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I will never wear another kind.</li>
            <li> I guess I should have known that, seeing that it&#x27;s the top seller in fragrances on Amazon, but she seems really, really happy, so that makes me glad.  </li>
            <li> Plus...(fill in this area with your own imagination.)</li>
            <li> and she says she receives many compliments that she smells good..</li>
            <li> So I got my own bottle.</li>
            <li> you Anazon, for good customer service!&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> Every time that I put it on I get complimented on how good I smell, and who doesn&#x27;t love that?</li>
            <li> But after a minute or so it settels into a warm vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> and I think will be particularly nice in the summer</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s own.  </li>
            <li> I found that I cannot even return the item as it is deemed \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com.</li>
            <li> So many people (including strangers) tell me how good I smell when I wear this perfume.</li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s best not to wear too much of this stuff, if any at all, to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scent is so nice</li>
            <li> Sooooooooooooo many beauty gurus on Youtube said how good this smelled.</li>
            <li> I got compliments at work for smelling like candy while walking around haha~ great stuff!</li>
            <li> but my perfume smells more of alchaol than anything, doesnt smell good.</li>
            <li> Thanks to those who suggested spraying it in freshly-washed hair, my hair smells great too!</li>
            <li> and I liked everything mentioned.</li>
            <li> Smells like warm vanilla sugar.</li>
            <li> The samples were a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Then go buy yoself a nice pair of shoes with money you saved.</li>
            <li> so i absolutely love it and love it more when i can find a good deal on it~!</li>
            <li> Wonderful smell that would be nice on any person of any age as long as you are a girl and not a guy! LOL</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light and sweet and absolutely wonderful.</li>
            <li> This scent is sweet and does put you in happy mood, cotton candy, marshmellows,yum.&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
            <li> I had heard LOTS of great things about this perfume, and its sweet sugary scent.</li>

            <li> Love this perfume - was a little bit hesitant to purchase through Amazon, as I wasn&#x27;t sure this would be the &amp;#34;real thing.&amp;#34;  I am happy to say it was, and the perfume smells absolutely wonderful!  </li>
            <li> After walking around for a while, the delicious aromas of warm vanilla, sweet cotton candy, and soft caramel grew on me!  </li>
            <li> Love the sweet candy-like smell and it stays on, smelling good all day long.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Awesome perfume, delivered quickly, seller highly recommended!</li>

            <li> This perfume smell delicious and fresh at the same time, it is warm and inviting.  </li>
            <li> It is really warm and sweet smelling without making you smell like a kid that has run amok in a cotton candy factory like sugary scents I have come across.</li>
            <li> The product itself is pretty good.</li>
            <li> If this is a knock off, well it&#x27;s a pretty damn good one.</li>

            <li> I LOVE this sweet smelling perfume!</li>
            <li> The scent is so wonderful I have received more compliments wearing this scent more than any other.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing, intriguing, and YUMMY perfume my wife has ever tried.</li>
            <li> so I couldn&#x27;t make a strong comparison, but I could tell the smell was much more alcohol-y.</li>
            <li> love the aroma of it not too strong smell</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift idea for a female friend who thoroughly liked the scent and this was an immediate approval of its rating, on amazon, as a great scent for women.</li>
            <li> This is a great fragrance that young women will love.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is perfect for teens, nice and sweet perfume.</li>
            <li> so many people are familiar with it, and so many others have done so.  </li>
            <li> For the amount and quality, this is a very good value compared to similar items on the market.</li>
            <li> It smells very sweet like cotton candy.</li>
            <li> The smell is very sweet.  </li>
            <li> but I love sweet perfumes and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on this scent many times.</li>
            <li> This smells like vanilla cookies and is a great scent for young girls.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is the perfect</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is a wonderful scent.</li>
            <li> you cannot find it cheaper anywhere else and free shipping on top of that.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is the best perfume I have ever used!</li>
            <li> The citrus fades away and the red fruit comes out to mix with the florals turning it into a wonderful and sweet scent.</li>
            <li> A long time favorite, it&#x27;s sweet and smells delicious.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard many good things about this fragrance &amp; (judging by the reviews) others seem to enjoy it as well; was really looking forward to this perfume until...</li>
            <li> I adored this perfume, but it was becoming too pricey.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Clinique Happy Heart or Happy in Bloom.</li>
            <li> The lemon mix in really makes this a good staple to use every day.</li>
            <li> I loved the smell so much</li>
            <li> It is a fun sweet scent that would be good for daytime, but can also feel like a sexier fragrance when worn in the evening.</li>
            <li> it does not smell nearly as good as the real stuff.  </li>
            <li> What really struck me was the plasticky smell that hung around for a good two hours.</li>
            <li> Smells so clean and pure and like cookies!!!!</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is a fresh smell of cotton candy, perfect for parties, and I am 14 and I highly reccomend to all teens and friends, This perfume will leave you a beautiful splash of cotton candy all day</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a sweet, warm scent rich in vanilla notes but it doesn&#x27;t end up smelling like body powder for an octogenarian.  </li>
            <li> Rich, sweet scent that smells like caramel and warm vanilla.</li>
            <li> The scent is so unique and lovely.</li>
            <li> and I love this fun perfume!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I had the original to compare it too.  </li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say that I have loved this perfume for years and couldn&#x27;t have been more excited to get it at such a great price.</li>
            <li> If you like sweet fragances!</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love the smell bit strong at first spray, but when it settle so yummy.</li>
            <li> It was a very good price, the shipping was reasonable, and I got it very fast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells great and last most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others.  </li>
            <li> As a rule, I like fragrances that are clean and sophisticated.</li>
            <li> excactly how discribed..Recieved very quickly... will order again when it comes time...</li>
            <li> It came very quick too.</li>
            <li> This perfume did not have QUITE that strong of an alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> It has a sugary smell with strong hints of vanilla and cotton candy, and it lasts for hours.  </li>
            <li> I am someone that doesn&#x27;t like a strong scent.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the scent was as strong as it used to be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that get headaches from strong scents.</li>
            <li> or I just can&#x27;t stand a strong floral smell.</li>
            <li> This perfume is sweet but not too sweet and kind of reminds me of cotton candy spray I used to wear in grammer school.</li>
            <li> This is a light, clean fragrance, yet fun rather than sophisticated and a nice change.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt have a strong smell</li>
            <li> After a bit, the strong smell fades into something that smells like sugar cookies.  </li>
            <li> Smells like strong alcohol/chemicals.</li>
            <li> Is okay.make me headache though.to strong for me</li>
            <li> The pepper part of the scent is too strong for me.</li>
            <li> It stays on well and the smell is strong.</li>
            <li> I BELIEVE SHE LIKED IT VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> I love when women wear perfumes that have a fruity or sweet scent as opposed to a musky or floral scent.  </li>
            <li> The smell is sweet and age appropriate, she never leaves the house without putting it on.</li>
            <li> Sweet, sexy and flirtatious.</li>
            <li> I love a sweet smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> this started being popular when sephora first started carrying this fragrance...</li>
            <li> Lovely girly smell, not too sweet.</li>
            <li> I love this smell, it is a sweet cotton candy vanilla scent.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not overly sweet and lasts most of the day.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more sweet and sugary than foody.  </li>
            <li> this is the first perfume i have bought that my sons father really liked...</li>
            <li> The bottle is beautiful and BIG!</li>
            <li> I smell sweet like cotton candy, but it is not too overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I recommend it for all of you who love vanilla and sweet scents.</li>
            <li> Most people say it smells sweet and sugary</li>
            <li> but i get more of a sweet spicey smell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The prices on Amazon are hands down the best prices.</li>
            <li> But, as it turned out, it was actually exactly what I was looking for with the same great scent!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t do any good to get a good deal if it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery, exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> When I hear Pink Sugar, I think sweet and delicious like cupcakes.</li>
            <li> It is not to strong, nor light.</li>
            <li> A super value too ordering through Amazon!</li>
            <li> This smells exactly like the real perfume, both me and my girlfriend love it!!  </li>
            <li> it doesnt smell all perfumy more of a sweet clean candy smell..</li>
            <li> Anyway, this perfume is great and it only takes a little to smell so wonderful all day.</li>
            <li> I am a huge vanilla and sugar scent fan.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is amazing, there is really nothing else out there quite like it.</li>
            <li> a fun, flirty scent :)</li>
            <li> The scent is addictive and always makes me feel energized and happy.</li>
            <li> so i can enjoy the fragrance all day.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> also they wrapped it in a bunch of bubble wrap to secure it</li>
            <li> This perfume is a fun, playful, and sexy fragrance.  </li>
            <li> It had free shipping and arrived in 2 days ....</li>
            <li> When first applied it has a nice sort of &#x60;spicy&#x27; undertone that gradually disappears to leave a light, sweet cotton candy scent that is noticeable without being in any way overpowering.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Real deal folks, price is amazing.</li>
            <li> I bought it, received the free shipping, and received it a couple of days later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Go light on it.  </li>
            <li> The perfume is amazing and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Light, sugary...</li>
            <li> great buy, for any female, as a gift idea.</li>
            <li> Well, that was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Again - the product if working properly is awesome.</li>
            <li> This perfume is fabulous.</li>
            <li> for a fraction of the cost of the legitimate one ($60) &amp; free shipping, why the hell not?</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for everyone, but if you&#x27;re into that candy shop smell, this will fit the bill.</li>
            <li> Amazon offered it at a lower price with free shipping.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> It smells so cheap.</li>
            <li> but the smell is not that fantastic</li>
            <li> I wish I liked it as much.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s has such a great smell.</li>
            <li> It smells cheap</li>
            <li> It is light and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> Service great and love Pink Sugar</li>
            <li> I would have to say that the top note is my favorite, however you smell absolutely irresistible with this on.</li>
            <li> If you like soft, warm scents, you will love this perfume.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect summer scent and, HANDS DOWN, Amazon has the best pricing out there (I&#x27;ve payed triple at Nordstrom in the past).</li>
            <li> While this fragrance certainly lasts a very long time (which is great!), the scent is just a tad too strong for me.  </li>
            <li> Too strong, too sweet, smells cheap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed that as the day goes on, Pink Sugar evolves into a rich, textured sweetness that is all the while fresh, delightful, and inviting.  </li>
            <li> Ok I was very hesitant about purchasing this perfume because I read many reviews saying the packaging isn&#x27;t the original and</li>
            <li> I think the price is right, and I plan to buy more when this bottle is finished.</li>
            <li> I would say test the fragrance before you buy, though...just to make sure that it is right for you.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes you feel quite sexy and men notice it right away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is sweet and strong but not too overpowering.</li>
            <li> Try it on first Ladies!!</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Though, not a scent I&#x27;d recommend for an older gal - really more appropriate for a pre-40 woman.  </li>
            <li> It is not two strong everyone always complements me that I smell good enough to eat!</li>
            <li> If you want a unique scent get this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since it first came out, people stop me and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing -mostly women</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on this, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> I should know better and just go to Amazon.com first.</li>
            <li> Very girly! : )</li>
            <li> This perfume is not overbearing and has a light sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I was excited to see this on here.</li>
            <li> I first tried this at Sephora and fell in love.  </li>
            <li> but it smells fantastic, sugary and sweet.  </li>
            <li> It is a light, sweet fragrance.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure of purchasing this.</li>
            <li> you get alot for the price so its def worth it!</li>
            <li> Not the original.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying out!</li>
            <li> I love you Mr. Ellis Thanks!</li>
            <li> very girly and sweet!!</li>
            <li> Vanilla is the most obvious note, however on me the perfume takes on a warm caramel citrus scent too.</li>
            <li> My sister was visiting for a couple of minutes, and when she left I walked into the room she had been in and smelled the most amazing perfume.</li>
            <li> fantastic embraceable sexy sent and everyone always wants to know what it is.</li>
            <li> Overall I am happy with my purchase, arrived super quick and I would recommend this</li>
            <li> Long wearing, great size, the service was quick.</li>
            <li> The smell is super sweet and very pleasant, it may be a little too sweet for some people</li>
            <li> The top comes off easily, revealing a fragrance bottle wrapped with a piece of white cardboard to keep it safe.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t worn it around anyone to see what anyone else thinks about it, so I&#x27;m hoping it will grow on me once I&#x27;ve worn it more and if it gets good reactions from other people, and</li>
            <li> I save it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> All of my shoes tend to be flats with the occassional 2\\&quot; heel that I need for a special event.  </li>
            <li> Vanilla, musk and bergamot give this perfume a special notes.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Compliment City\\&quot; is right around the corner!</li>
            <li> Pink sugar is a happy smell.</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase of Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> as for those who say its too sweet smelling: ur buying a perfume called \\&quot;pink sugar\\&quot; lol what do you expect?</li>
            <li> Nice sweet soft scent.</li>
            <li> This smells so sweet</li>
            <li> Many factors can affect a perfume, the main one being strong heat/light, causing it to lose its fun scent, leaving the remains of a rubbing-alcohol smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true what they say, a way to a man&#x27;s heart is through his stomach.</li>
            <li> Some women had reviewed it as being really really sweet, like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li> Light scent, yet so fun and yummy smelling.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand the popularity of this product nor how anyone finds that to smell sweet.</li>
            <li> I love this scent and the price is very affordable.  </li>
            <li> I bought a full size bottle, and have been using it ever since.</li>
            <li> It is sweet smelling, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> your body chemistry works well with sweet smells</li>
            <li> It smells so sweet and yummy.</li>
            <li> but it seems nearly embarrassing to wear on its own at my age.  </li>
            <li> It was labeled on the manufacturer label as a Tester, and it had full fragrance in a full bottle.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll go through it fast with how much I love it.  </li>
            <li> 2 hours after applying, it still retains that sweet note--</li>
            <li> very flirty, smells a bit like cotton candy :)</li>
            <li> It is however a sweet scent.</li>
            <li> Not kiddie candy smell but a sweet sweet smell</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sweet like vanilla and cotton candy nothing like it.</li>
            <li> This is sweet, overpowering sweet</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good one though, if you&#x27;re a teen like me.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that I sometimes put some on before I go to bed</li>
            <li> No burnt notes for me, it&#x27;s not so sweet</li>
            <li> Even guy friends will comment and say mmmm what is that sweet smell..</li>
            <li> Being sweet</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not the true Aquolina brand</li>
            <li> It is a vanilla like sweet smell.  </li>
            <li> It smells like cotton candy so don&#x27;t buy it unless you like a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> This is sweet, but not like the fruity gunk</li>
            <li> If you like smelling like candy and all sweet, this is a must have.</li>
            <li> It is extremely sweet smelling (just like cotton candy).</li>
            <li> It is definitely a sweet smelling perfume.</li>
            <li> I can even smell it on my clothes after a full day of wearing it.</li>
            <li> this perfume def isn&#x27;t for you if you don&#x27;t like really sweet smells.</li>
            <li> I bought it because I was looking for a sweet vanilla sugary smelling scent, this is not that.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> But this does NOT smell like sugar in any way.&lt;br /&gt;Not a sweet smell at all.</li>
            <li> Not to sweet at all.</li>
            <li> Sweet without smelling like cotton candy</li>
            <li> smell sweet, like vanilla!&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> It sweet.</li>
            <li> I wear it, people constantly tell me how good it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you like the smell of vanilla or freshly baked goods you will enjoy this sweet scent.</li>
            <li> I loved this at first for winter - the licorice and warm vanilla smells are great for the cold Boston winters.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It has a nice soft sweet (cotton candy) scent</li>
            <li> The cotton candy finally comes out on top of the scent, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less beautiful, it still smells like something a strong, powerful, sexy woman would wear.</li>
            <li> I bought the Pink Sugar EDT Spray because I just love it!!</li>
            <li> Smells great on other people...</li>
            <li> Great price compared to other places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so happy with Pink Sugar!</li>
            <li> I purchased the 1.7 ounce bottle from Sephora, and since I was using it every day I ran out quickly.</li>
            <li> I got here so quick</li>
            <li> I have gotten many compliments on it from women but actually seemed to receive more from men...</li>
            <li> Luckily, I found the product on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so perfect for springtime, and at such a low cost, you would be foolish to pass it up.</li>
            <li> It arrived so quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar has a sweety-spicy smell and it is perfect for an adult.</li>
            <li> and it smells way better than the high end perfumes.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is a really pleasant and sweet scent.  </li>
            <li> Pink sugar is amazing!</li>
            <li> It is is suitable for an adult as well.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great everyday fragrance, light, fun</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping also!</li>
            <li> but not so sweet that it doesn&#x27;t have an uplifting, fresh feel to it.</li>
            <li> I expect my man to pull me into his arms and take a good long sniff when he smells me wearing this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Right off the top what I smell is black pepper, which I found really appealing, since I love pepper.  </li>
            <li> To me the initial scent is sweet, almost citrusy but that quickly fades into a mix of warm sugary goodness.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get such a great price, but as the old saying goes, &amp;#34;you pay for what you get.&amp;#34</li>
            <li> Depending on how strong you perfer your perfumes: usually my wrists, the back of my neck (where people hug me), &amp; a light mist all over does the job perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink</li>
            <li> This perfume smells sweet, sexy, and young.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s sweet and light in the beginning, much like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li> It has a sweet and soft scent that you will LOVE.</li>
            <li> way.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on bright and clean, with a bit of sparkle to it, like sugar cookies with pink sugar!  </li>
            <li> This stuff Smells exactly just like cotton candy!</li>
            <li> Does not even smell close to the real thing!!</li>
            <li> Ordered and my perfume just arrived, could not be more pleased, this perfume is not only in a pretty bottle</li>
            <li> I can only say that I love this fragrance!</li>
            <li> the smell is exactly on point to the original.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future I love it so much!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not fake!</li>
            <li> Wow the product was exactly what I wanted and it was an excellent price and buy for the other prices I have seen.</li>
            <li> I first smelled this at Kohls, sprayed it onto one of those paper things and initially thought it smelled nice, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> It has an amazing smell and its the only perfume</li>
            <li> I think it smells far better than just toast.  </li>
            <li> This smells a bit like the old \\&quot;Love</li>
            <li> I lightly sprayed my wrist, thought it was okay, and soon after left the store.  </li>
            <li> I was very pleasantly surprised :)</li>
            <li> Big bottle, nothing more to say except it is fantastic</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s well worth the money and the 3.4 ounce</li>
            <li> I was surprised to see such a great price on Amazon, so I couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
            <li> Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations.</li>
            <li> Pink sugar will leave you smelling good for hours.</li>
            <li> The smell is better suited for a young girl</li>
            <li> I think it all depends on the kind of scents you like and what your personal style is.</li>
            <li> One of the guys said I was like a &amp;#34;walking jolly rancher&amp;#34; and it made me smile for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Men love when I wear this and can&#x27;t comment enough on how much they love it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a warm, sugary scent, reminiscent of cotton candy and vanilla.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure about young girls wearing it since it does have a sweet-sexy, alluring scent.</li>
            <li> I was told this is not the genuine product more than likely.</li>
            <li> It was well worth it</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this if you like sweet candy scents!</li>
            <li> After a few hours, it fades in a very warm and yummy scent, like a mixture of brown sugar and vanilla.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It was not too long before I ordered this perfume, and all I can say is that I&#x27;m in LOVE with this heavenly scent!  </li>
            <li> I also think that Pink Sugar isn&#x27;t just appealing for teenagers--but for anyone who is interested in a playful, yet sophisticated fragrance that smells</li>
            <li> I love pink sugar, it&#x27;s a light sweet scent.</li>
            <li> This is the real brand, full sized, packaged really well and smells fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I just love the light, slightly sweet scent of Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> or it wasn&#x27;t the right version.</li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s usually right after I spray it</li>
            <li> I waited patiently to order it online though, instead of right then and there.</li>
            <li> A 1 ounce bottle was $40.00, and I right away knew that it would be cheaper online.</li>
            <li> I got the right one</li>
            <li> I called her right away to ask what it was</li>
            <li> and I noticed something was off right away.</li>
            <li> I sprayed it and it smells right,</li>
            <li> Very soft, sweet brings out the playful side in you!</li>
            <li> At first, it smells really sweet, but there is this really chemically, musky undertone that just kills my  nose!  </li>
            <li> I recommend this product to any female that love a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> :) the licorice scent is very strong at first but after a little bit goes away.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not the most sophisticated fragrance in my collection, but on some days when the mood is right I love using Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you enjoy smelling like candy and vanilla~</li>
            <li> Less than a week later I had my order and was very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really like this sweet cotton candy smell...</li>
            <li> A spiced hot sugar freshly spun.  </li>
            <li> If you are smelling too sweet, you may be putting on too much.  </li>
            <li> It is not overpowering or sickly sweet, and people who are VERY picky about perfume said they like it.</li>
            <li> It is a nice blend of cotton candy and other sweet fragrences.</li>
            <li> It has a very strong initial scent at first.  </li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite scents and was priced more reasonably than other places where i have seen it on sale.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for everyday wear, as it is also very affordable.</li>
            <li> It was shipped to me super fast</li>
            <li> Also the bottle leaks from the top it drips all over the place soo much wasted product there is more on my vanity than myself.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this, I didn&#x27;t usually wear perfume, but now, I make sure to always spritz some on!!  </li>
            <li> I found Pink Sugar when I was in Paris shopping and fell in love with it!  </li>
            <li> Alright so I bought this a perfume a year and a half ago, I LOVED it at first.</li>
            <li> For it came super fast and smells heavenly ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very much a \\&quot;pink\\&quot; scent.  </li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say it was very appreciated</li>
            <li> Not to mention the shipping was very fast despite the fact it was not prime eligible.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very, very fast.  </li>
            <li> I originally sampled this fragrance in Sephora a few months ago and liked it, yet didn&#x27;t purchase it.</li>
            <li> I was scared it would not smell like the real deal, but it does and it in quite large, true to there word.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light enough to not overwhelm, but has just the right amount of feminine fragrance to get noticed!</li>
            <li> Especially the cute packaging.</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m pretty sure</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I used almost a whole bottle!</li>
            <li> but both of them smell funny after they sit for a while-they don&#x27;t smell like the bottles in the store.</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t possibly say how much I love this stuff.</li>
            <li> Wore it to bed every night the first 2 weeks after I received it.  </li>
            <li> I have not been swarmed by people saying how much they like it, but I have had compliments from people who&#x27;ve never been complimentary about anything else, so...?  </li>
            <li> I most definitely recommend this product, and the others as well!  </li>
            <li> The scent is exactly like cotton candy.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, it smells very yum!</li>
            <li> Item exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> then just bought the Christmas time only gift pack at Nordstrom, which is even better in price for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;Thank</li>
            <li> I first sampled this fragrance walking through a department store.  </li>
            <li> and I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s definitely one of my faves.</li>
            <li> Also, shipping was really fast!</li>
            <li> first applied it smells smi-overpowering, and has a strawberry icecream tint to it.</li>
            <li> I love perfume and this is definitely a favorite.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Again, it is not necessary to apply more that a couple (one or two) squirts.  </li>
            <li> and I instantly fell in love with it.</li>
            <li> since I like going through  perfume phases, where I&#x27;ll wear one scent for a while until it runs out pretty much!</li>
            <li> So glad I&#x27;ve finally found my signature scent.</li>
            <li> I first smelled it at a Sephora store some time ago</li>
            <li> When you first put it on it does smell like a mix of cotton candy and vanilla, but as the day goes on the smell deepens.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, too!  </li>
            <li> also know that Amazon.com would not jeopardize their legendary reputation by selling a knockoff or fake version of one of their best-selling perfumes.</li>
            <li> The observant shopper will notice the hot pepper on the cylender label, indicating the spicy \\&quot;adult\\&quot; nature of this EDT.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> I want to get the body cream next. :)</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have bought something from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s ok for the price</li>
            <li> I first came across it in an upscale cosmetic store.  </li>
            <li> and I feel so pretty and girly when I wear it.</li>
            <li> Smells cheap and too young for me.</li>
            <li> so obviously I jumped at the opportunity to get in on here for so cheap!</li>
            <li> I really like this smell!  </li>
            <li> What woman wouldn&#x27;t want to smell edibile yet sophisticated at the same time?  </li>
            <li> The bottles that don&#x27;t say Aquolina are the most current version of this product.</li>
            <li> I never review my Amazon purchases, but I had to praise the seller on this one since my experience overall was fantastic!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume and its much cheaper buying it on Amazon rather than from Sephora!</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased this perfume</li>
            <li> The first spray smelt like a mixture of alcohol and candy overpowering.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments when I wear it, from both men (especially) and women.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping too!</li>
            <li> Used it the first morning.</li>
            <li> The spray top was different from the others i bought.</li>
            <li> I you like sweet sugary scents, than you are going to love Pink Sugar.  </li>
            <li> If you want this perfume, u should go sample it at a store first</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not heavy at all, just very fresh and feminine.  </li>
            <li> This is not one of those cheap teen perfumes that fades away quickly.</li>
            <li> Its an okay perfume very sweet but maybe a little too much for my liking .</li>
            <li> I still like it very much, as it&#x27;s sweet, but not juvenile.</li>
            <li> it, im pretty sure you&#x27;ll get the same responses too.. just dont spray TOO much.</li>
            <li> Although this does smell sweet, it&#x27;s a little too sweet and strong.  </li>
            <li> Once it dries down, it takes on a different scent, more like a warm vanilla.</li>
            <li> It arrived right on schedule, came in the standard packaging, and was in fine condition.  </li>
            <li> It arrived earlier than expected and was in great condition.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a sweet smell, sweet olfactoraly speaking, but also in a tender sort of way.</li>
            <li> and I love it so much I am now on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Definitely a fragrance that says that you are old enough to know better, but still too young to care (in a good way).</li>
            <li> it shipped pretty fast too.</li>
            <li> The packaging is pretty and the presentation is really girly in a grown up girl kinda</li>
            <li> I love this scent and don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this</li>
            <li> The perfume lasts pretty much all day.  </li>
            <li> Men and women compliment me all the time, and tell me the scent is sweet but mature.  </li>
            <li> This fragance is unique like no other, be prepared for everybody asking what you have on, both men and women.  </li>
            <li> I mean HATES smells of any kind!</li>
            <li> If you are looking to surprise your special one with a new scent, it&#x27;s a safe bet she will really like Pink Sugar.  </li>
            <li> It smells very sweet but not overpowering, even though the scent will last you the whole day.</li>
            <li> Fresh, clean and for old or young.</li>
            <li> What first caught my attention was the cute bottle design, and also the name, \\&quot;Pink</li>
            <li> It is like pure concentrated SUGAR.</li>
            <li> As my years have progressed, naturally certain tastes of mine have changed.  </li>
            <li> wasn&#x27;t that smart.</li>
            <li> Itsnanclean pure smell.</li>
            <li> I heard it described as pure candy, cookies, and sugar.</li>
            <li> I had tried so many different perfumes, and had come to terms with the fact I was destined to live a life without a \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It definitely does have a first, initial smell and a second smell, and the second smell, which lasts, is really good. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> it can be a little over whelming if you marinate yourself in it, i suggest spritzing some into the air and then walking into the scent, it is a nice fragrance to have on hand.</li>
            <li> The bottle is huge, especially for the price that Amazon offered, but I have a feeling</li>
            <li> not only does this perfume smell amazing, but it literally lasts throughout my entire work day.</li>
            <li> Smells like absolute heaven.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is my all-time favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I have looked very closely at the packaging.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t get any sweeter than this, and yet, it is not overpowering, and it lasts for hours and hours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is one of those scents that I would have worn as a much younger lady yet it still holds great appeal for me now that I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> I really wish they would come out with an EDP version.</li>
            <li> and it smelled really funky, I don&#x27;t know why</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t really speak for why she likes it</li>
            <li> I love Pink Sugar-</li>
            <li> I really wanted this fragrance for years.  </li>
            <li> It really blended well</li>
            <li> It priced really reasonable, which is unusual for perfumes of this caliber.  </li>
            <li> The scent feels fresh and young.  </li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Anazon took care of the problem very kindly.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think that&#x27;s me, do I have too much on??\\&quot;</li>
            <li> Perfums are one of those item which result very convenient to buy through the Internet.  </li>
            <li> This scent is absolutely heavenly.</li>
            <li> tahnk you so much.</li>
            <li> Real cotton candy scent on</li>
            <li> I know the difference because I have bought the real perfume before</li>
            <li> Can smell it if you are close to me, (very close)</li>
            <li> absolutely adore this fragrance - but will you?</li>
            <li> The fragrance itself is fantastic, starting off with that slightly peppery bergamot note on top of the sweetness, then dries to a powdery cotton candy finish after the pepper disappears.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also extremely reasonably priced for perfume.</li>
            <li> I guess it for people who really like sweet&amp;sugary scents .</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really get to wear it.  </li>
            <li> and I really wanted to try it</li>
            <li> Real stuff.</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend&#x27;s birthday, she absolutely adored it.</li>
            <li> I always use the whole bottle.</li>
            <li> Summers, not so much....</li>
            <li> I love pink sugar Aqualina</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Who wants to smell like that?</li>
            <li> I cant believe how fast I received this</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> Very upset about this purchase.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe it got here so fast.</li>
            <li> absolutely my fav summer smell</li>
            <li> Lasted the whole day</li>
            <li> so I know it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Ordered the 3.4 oz size for $25, no tax, fast</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some reviews that indicated this was not the real thing</li>
            <li> I really like this scent.</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> I know this is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Feel very relaxed smelling like that.  </li>
            <li> I love Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and the product was just as described.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I have bought this perfume from pricey department stores like SEPHORA, and this one from this seller is the real deal.</li>
            <li> and you smell the strength and real quality.</li>
            <li> Haha.</li>
            <li> Fast, efficient, and reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> thanks again</li>
            <li> #34;no time&amp;#34;,regardless of how much you apply.</li>
            <li> I love it so much that decided to also purchase Pink Sugar Sensual, can not wait to receive it.</li>
            <li> so I naturally tend to lean more towards sweeter scents, so this perfume was an instant addiction.</li>
            <li> Will shop on line more frequently for big savings all the time!</li>
            <li> Such a pretty, girly scent!!</li>
            <li> It arrived the other day and was in the same good condition as the perfume.  </li>
            <li> Not overpowering, but if you don&#x27;t like wearing sweet smelling fragrances, stay far, far away from this product!</li>
            <li> Way to strong seems like it has been siting around for a long time</li>
            <li> Pink sugar is my absolute, hands down most favorite perfume in the world.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the product and didn&#x27;t know if it would last an hour or all day.  </li>
            <li> I love Pink Sugar!</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance from Sephora&#x27;s website because I needed something more playful and youthful than my other scents.</li>
            <li> I am aware that this is supposed to smell like the treat; however, I thought that Aquolina would personalize this scent a little more.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;and found it to be Pink Sugar,we purchased same and are very pleased with this&lt;br /&gt;Eau de Toilette</li>
            <li> The cylender containing the perfume has textured, pink stripes on the top and sides-- stripes that are 3D &amp; you can feel the slight rubberiness touching them.</li>
            <li> Based on the the description and name of this perfume, I expected it to smell sweet, fruity and fun.</li>
            <li> It has a very subtle sweet scent that guys love!</li>
            <li> the actual bottle has a nice frosted pink cap with really cute darker pink ribbon wrapped around it in a crisscrossing</li>
            <li> This perfume is sooo fragrant, high quality, and real, just a dab</li>
            <li> I have a sensitive nose and can only were certain, light perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I only use on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I got to pay a lot less for my absolute favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> and she loves it,smells sweet and will last forever</li>
            <li> Such a sweet and sultry scent.</li>
            <li> If you like smelling sweet and possibly edible, this is the scent for you.</li>
            <li> It IS sweet, but not THAT sweet, sugary but not sickeningly sweet.  </li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance hands down.  </li>
            <li> Love pink sugar!!</li>
            <li> This is a super sweet scent that reminds me of something that girls under 20 would wear (which could be a good or bad thing).</li>
            <li> (Not overly heavy and strong!)</li>
            <li> It looked absolutely brand new.</li>
            <li> They were identical to the one I received and more than half the price.</li>
            <li> MAIN issue is that the smell is just...</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find this particular fragrance anywhere, I once again turned to Amazon and of course they carried it.</li>
            <li> Being a young teen, I really enjoy perfumes that can compliment my style, as well as my personality.  </li>
            <li> I have received numerous compliments and will be back for more.</li>
            <li> I love to smell it on her, and the scent generally lasts all day long.  </li>
            <li> Any perfume can give people headaches or make them nauseous, particularly if the wearer works with chemotherapy patients, as I do.  </li>
            <li> The powder, red fruit, and cotton candy is such a lovely scent.</li>
            <li> if you want a decent perfume, don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> i feel sorry for all those great reviews u may be getting something else rather than the real deal.</li>
            <li> And it doesn&#x27;t last that long, but when it does, it&#x27;s strong!</li>
            <li> I purchased it with the Pink Sugar moisturizer and together they have a great long lasting layering effect.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar I will definitely repurchase, it has the sweetest smell, and it is not overwhelmingly sick or anything, it literally is sweet and gentle..</li>
            <li> After wearing for like six hours the scent has settle down enormously and not sickening sweet.</li>
            <li> After all, it is a great price and it really is not THAT far off from the more expensive version.</li>
            <li> I highly reccomend this to every teenager, like me.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> Been buying it for 4 years and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is different from any other \\&quot;Oriental\\&quot; fragrance I have ever smelled, but gorgeous enough that I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves fragrances in that category, OR anyone who can&#x27;t decide between Earl Grey tea and a vanilla cappuccino in the morning.</li>
            <li> Its soft, sweet, rich, sometimes a little spicy.</li>
            <li> I ordered a Pink Sugar Tester spray thinking that for the fantastic price, it might just be a less than reputable product.  </li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I was a little hesitant to make this purchase.  </li>
            <li> I was more than pleased because it was less than half the price!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure what some of these other people got, but mine is the real deal so the price with shipping is a great deal.</li>
            <li> It will last the whole day!!</li>
            <li> Everything seemed pretty legit, &amp; there were far more positive reviews than negative</li>
            <li> I have a small one for my purse and a large one for at home &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Rarely, if ever, do I care much about packaging, but Pink Sugar certainly is an exception.</li>
            <li> The packaging looks very much the same but on the bottle it does not say \\&quot;aqualina\\&quot; like the real stuff</li>
            <li> I love Pink Sugar!!!</li>
            <li> My body chemistry reacts badly with 99% of perfumes and colognes but this one is a perfect match!</li>
            <li> I have yet to meet someone who doesn&#x27;t enjoy the scent of Pink Sugar--</li>
            <li> /&gt;OVERALL, I would say definitely go and purchase from this dealer if you are willing to sacrifice the long-wearing effect that this perfume has when purchased from a real beauty supplier like Sephora.</li>
            <li> Because we all have our own personal body chemistry, one fragrance can smell quite different on various people.</li>
            <li> I pretty much wear it daily.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells, and its a long lasting fragrance that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
            <li> This scent is worth a second chance.</li>
            <li> It is not too sweet and lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only fragrance I&#x27;m wearing right now</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s probably best avoided in humid summer weather as it can become a bit sickly.</li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s not a strong perfume</li>
            <li> It is special as no other perfumes smell the same.  </li>
            <li> To put my review in context, I am not a fan of musks (ex. \\&quot;Carolina Herrera\\&quot;) or the classics that other women seem to enjoy (ex.</li>
            <li> The bottle was in a brand new package with a plastic seal and everything.</li>
            <li> I am always scared to try new perfumes.</li>
            <li> My new signature scent.</li>
            <li> new go to perfume.</li>
            <li> New product, not a tester.</li>
            <li> The packaging was brand new.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - Only buy it if you have smelled it and liked the smell.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is a good everyday fragrance that is not overpowering or offensive.  </li>
            <li> Coworkers have commented on how nice and subtle it is.  </li>
            <li> Obviously lots of people love Pink Sugar and maybe you will as well.</li>
            <li> I ordered Pink Sugar on QVC few years ago and loved the smell.</li>
            <li> Nonetheless, I still enjoy wearing this to casual events, as it is appealing.</li>
            <li> It is very sweet smelling and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> It has a sweet smell, hard to describe, but its not a childish sweet...</li>
            <li> I first smelled this product when I was in Sephora testing out different fragrances</li>
            <li> When I first wore it my husband actually said, \\&quot;you smell so good\\&quot;!</li>
            <li> And the perfumes that I love (ex. \\&quot;Ciara\\&quot;, \\&quot;Norell\\&quot;, and Victoria&#x27;s Secret \\&quot;Rapture\\&quot;) smell great on other women, but turn into a sour stank on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I had read some other reviews saying that it is better suited for younger people.</li>
            <li> This was my first and only issue with buying something through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Smells like an adult version of toasted marshmallows!</li>
            <li> I have tried many designer brands in the past.</li>
            <li> First of all, everyone has a different body chemistry.</li>
            <li> It smells like cotton candy and first but once that initial scent wears off, it smells like caramel and vanilla and baby powdery.</li>
            <li> I saw this same product on another website and the cost was much higher plus you had to pay shipping.</li>
            <li> and so does my significant other.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Cotton Candy is my favorite scent, and normally I would mind it being mixed with other things... not this time!</li>
            <li> So this is a huge step down.</li>
            <li> packaging is not super extraordinary, but I don&#x27;t really &#x27;buy the perfume for the bottle&#x27;.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very quickly- within a day and a half!</li>
            <li> The size was large also so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> I got the large 3.4 oz bottle for only $25.  </li>
            <li> I hate musk, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  </li>
            <li> scent of Pink Sugar is like pure cotton candy straight from the County fairground.</li>
            <li> (I think perfumes smell a little different on everyone)My kiddos love it, as well...</li>
            <li> and I found this scent which I love and a little last all day!!!!</li>
            <li> I read a good but of the reviews on here about this particular sellers product and some (not many but some) said that this was absolutely not the same as the product sold in Sephora.</li>
            <li> It is for those ladies younger and more mature that want just a little hint of the feminine and the yummy (think cotten candy) to catch the senses of passersby.</li>
            <li> I get migraines very easily...and this is soft enough that it does not cause headaches.  </li>
            <li> the natural chemistry of my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend buying it for someone old and stuffy.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 16 year old sister.</li>
            <li> My 6 year old daughter loves it too...</li>
            <li> You smell young when you wear this.</li>
            <li> Its like Loves Baby Soft for grown ups.</li>
            <li> Purchased the genuine product before a few years ago</li>
            <li> so I gave it to my 10 year old daughter with the instructions to spritz in the air and do a walk through</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has some real sillage -- my coworker could smell it from outside my office, and came in to ask me what I was wearing.  </li>
            <li> my bottle mysteriously disappeared at my wedding while I was getting ready.</li>
            <li> Or maybe a young adult.</li>
            <li> This is a terrific perfume for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> In fact, my husband thought it smelled like \\&quot;old people and baby powder.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My 10 year old son, my husband and mother-in-law</li>
            <li> it doesnt have the name on the bottle and it wears off in an hour the real one last all day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 30 minutes, &amp; I have been running around my home cleaning working up a sweat &amp; thus far reacts just as I remembered.</li>
            <li> It lasts pretty long but does fade with time.</li>
            <li> I really like this and its definitely one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I put on a sample secretly and then walked around the house when company was over, just to see what kind of reaction</li>
            <li> I like how unique the fragrance is, light, airy, nostalgic, not overpowering....</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i got back from our family trip and found Pink Sugar in the mail.</li>
            <li> Knock offs usually have a strong alcohol smell and this does.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s not as strong as usual</li>
            <li> It stays true, but softens down so it is more subtle sunny/oriental/floral.  </li>
            <li> I instantly liked the fragrance, one that smelled very similar to cotton candy, with subtle tones of vanilla.  </li>
            <li> The Sensual is nice, lighter, with a slight spice to it, reminds me of Colors by Benetton that I used in the early 90s, very different from this Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> I expected the entire bouquet to be sweet.  </li>
            <li> Still wont purchase again though large bottle so it will be a long time before I finish it.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried this perfume would be too sweet smelling after reading some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years, religiously but the price has always been so high</li>
            <li> This is a soft, sweet, lovely fragrance and not that sickening sweet, candy like smell.  </li>
            <li> Completely addicted, my new favorite scent.  </li>
            <li> It is a lightly scented long lasting perfume with a hint of a sweet sugary vanilla mixture and definitely captivated my attention when it was applied (as it lingered in the air)and also later when it also simmered down to its under-lying notes of vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although it is a very feminine fragrance Pink Sugar is not cloying or obnoxious but complex, sophisticated, and playful.</li>
            <li> Unbelievable service and always a smooth shopping experience ..</li>
            <li> its sweet, and heavenly..not heavy at all,,.</li>
            <li> so the only thing I worry about is that it&#x27;s a little too light</li>
            <li> Smells very sweet and is different than what I would usually buy myself.</li>
            <li> I was concerned after reading a few reviews stating that this perfume is not the authentic Aquolina Pink Sugar perfume.</li>
            <li> Smell is pretty long lasting.</li>
            <li> it really smells like sweet pink lemonade with a little bit of cotton candy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that it wears very well on me, especially if I put a little moisturizing lotion on first.  </li>
            <li> When I received the Aquolina, it was very clear that it was no original-the box was similar but without aquolina sign.</li>
            <li> I got a major headache from it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Amazon always does it right and with the wide selection of product and low prices there&#x27;s no reason why amazon shouldn&#x27;t be the go to choice every time</li>
            <li> At first it smells like licorice, then after a few minutes, sinks right into cotton candy.</li>
            <li> I love the pink and white swirled cylinder that had slightly rubbery raised stripes and</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use much and it doesn&#x27;t sting my skin like other perfumes (I have sensitive skin).</li>
            <li> I can smell this on myself all day long, which is a huge plus since other perfumes barely last an hour on me.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells so sweet that the almost invisible little sugar ants I&#x27;m trying to get rid of were actually drawn to it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like foody scents, generally, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine wanting to smell like caramel and cotton candy.  </li>
            <li> I went back to the old bottle and sprayed it</li>
            <li> Also, I would recommend the entire product line to complete the scent assembly.</li>
            <li> It really does smell like Pink Sugar with a touch of vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> After a bit of time, what was left was a soft cotton candy type smell.</li>
            <li> Is it possible its old?</li>
            <li> That is thanks to pink sugar.</li>
            <li> the perfume bottle itself is a glass bottle with hot pink stripes similar to the tube it comes in</li>
            <li> Okay smelling when it finally died down, but for obvious reasons, I won&#x27;t be purchasing pink sugar.</li>
            <li> stuff smells like a mix between cotton candy and subtle fresh baked cookies without that sickly sweet smell of other \\&quot;candy\\&quot; style perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> They no longer sell it in the Sephora in town, due to decrease in popularity...and that&#x27;s fine with me because that means less women will be wearing it.</li>
            <li> Very affordable compared to other perfumes out there.</li>
            <li> because as far as I can tell the packaging IS the original and it ISNT a knock off the perfume comes in a sturdy cardboard cylinder with textured pink stripes with the pink sugar logo and a pink spiral on the lid</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear the strong floral, heavy musky perfumes simply because they give me headaches, so Pink Sugar saved me from that.</li>
            <li> And what I got was the exact same as what I&#x27;ve been using from Sephora, from the smell down to the bottle and casing.</li>
            <li> I usually have an allergic reaction to most perfumes due to the floral scent, however this perfume smells like, well, candy!  </li>
            <li> Others have complained about it fading too quickly on them, but I think their noses are just not good enough, it lasts all day although very much more subtly later in the day, with just a touch of musk showing up.  </li>
            <li> It is the real stuff not watered down so all you need is 2 sprays and it lasts all day.  </li>
            <li> The new \\&quot;Pink Sugar\\&quot; perfume bottles do not say Aquolina on the bottle anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So im not sure how to rate this right now.</li>
            <li> The scent lasts all day, but isn&#x27;t quite as delicate and sweet smelling as my last one.</li>
            <li> Sugar perfume smells just like sweet, fluffy, pink cotton candy and everyone LOVES it and asks me what perfume are you wearing?</li>
            <li> (The few instances it is have been positive experiences ;P )</li>
            <li> Others reported it was not the real thing or was not packaged in the proper packaging that was NOT TRUE for me.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way when you first spray it</li>
            <li> I tend to go for dark, musky, woodsy smells, but I was getting sick of those and wanted to branch out for something more unique.  </li>
            <li> When I first heard about Pink Sugar a few years ago, I never expected that I would jump on the bandwagon.  </li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a lovely day time scent that is casual enough for me to wear every day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m slowly beginning my Aquolina collection, and so far I have the original Pink Sugar, Pink Sugar Sensual, &amp; Gold Sugar is on its way.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it is a fake, because it doesn&#x27;t say Aquolina anywhere, but it&#x27;s a darn good fake that I&#x27;d be willing to buy again, and again.</li>
            <li> I read some of the previous reviews and didn&#x27;t want to go worng by ordering a used bottle, therfore I just ordered new.</li>
            <li> I am very dissapointed, because I live in Serbia and it is complicated for me to return it, and also because I completely lost my trust to this way of purchasing things.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that the scent isn&#x27;t long lasting.</li>
            <li> Well I&#x27;m not sure what they got in the mail, and they may have gotten something faulty, but what I got was the real deal.</li>
            <li> delicious!!!&lt;br /&gt;The scent lingers once you spray, last long on the skin.</li>
            <li> also last a long time.</li>
            <li> Everyone loves it when I wear it and it does last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting.</li>
            <li> I layered Pink Sugar and Lush&#x27;s Karma perfume, which it heavy on bergomot and patchouli, it really brought the sweetness down.  </li>
            <li> It is very long lasting, so you don&#x27;t have to re-apply throughout the day.</li>
            <li> u get this lasting vanilla smell and it lasts for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I am on my second bottle of this scent and plan to purchase the entire Pink Sugar collection.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a much larger bottle than expected, even though I use it a lot I can see this easily lasting me two years.</li>
            <li> After several days of use I&#x27;d discovered I hadn&#x27;t had a single perfume induced headache.</li>
            <li> The smell was so strong and offensive that I was angry that I smelled it on my arm in the car on an hour long trip.</li>
            <li> I do not really care that it is suppose to be a &#x27;teen&#x27; scent</li>
            <li> As long as everyone on the planet is NOT using it she&#x27;ll keep it in her arsenal.</li>
            <li> lasts a long while</li>
            <li> It lasts a really long time and smells like cake and candy.</li>
            <li> It also lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> Pink Sugar was recommended to me from a friend of mine and is now the only thing that I wear.</li>
            <li> But I had to wait for a long time to get the package.</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Pink Sugar several years ago from a department store.  </li>
            <li> My wife still smells of pink sugar when she gets home after work, so it does last quite a while.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last very long, which is to be expected since it is EDT.</li>
            <li> This is a long lasting scent, unlike some of the other youthful perfumes you find yourself reapplying.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not exactly the same.</li>
            <li> I initial purchased Pink Sugar as a Christmas gift for my sister and she just loves it!</li>
            <li> With other perfumes, I spray some in the morning and will last me until the evening.</li>
            <li> A few weeks later, I returned to the store only to find that the fragrance had been sold out.  </li>
            <li> I like to smell something nice in the middle of the workday when I&#x27;m getting tired and bored with the hours...</li>
            <li> On myself, this perfume smells like cotton candy initially, and then dries down to a vanilla/amber scent after about 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> Was very disappointed I didn&#x27;t receive the authentic fragrence and have to go through all the trouble to return it then re-order the true product.....hopefully....</li>
            <li> I constantly find myself smelling hidden scents in the fragrance.</li>
            <li> The scent only lasted less than 30 minutes.  </li>
            <li> In short, it is the cotton-candy/caramel that everyone describes, and it has a slightly burnt-sugar scent to it.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I smell is over powering black licorice.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wish it did.</li>
            <li> Seriously, guys, girls, young, old, dogs, cats, I mean everyone loves the scent and I get compliments daily.</li>
            <li> GET MORE COMPLIMETS ON THIS THAN ALL MY OTHER PERFUMES, INCLUDING THE VERY EXPENSIVE ONES; WEAR IT ALL THE TIME</li>
            <li> Those are the people that are writing the bad reviews :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s but use this fragrance whenever I&#x27;m feeling playful and young.</li>
            <li> I then ordered the Pink Sugar Mouse.  </li>
            <li> I am disabled and can not get to a post office to send back!</li>
            <li> The bottles are now being branded solely as \\&quot;Pink</li>
            <li> and no longer as \\&quot;Aquolina Pink Sugar\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> This perfume was not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> And to remind you, the name of this perfume is Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> But be careful because it is the strongest scent in the universe</li>
            <li> Reminds me of pink cotton candy, and summer time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d read a description of Pink Sugar in a magazine and wanted to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I told all my friends about pink sugar, and now they all have it.</li>
            <li> For that reason, I am not going to urge you to buy Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> This is what I am told I smell like when I wear my Pink Sugar.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;Pink Sugar\\</li>
            <li> I keep a bottle of Pink Sugar in my purse at all times.</li>
            <li> I verified that the \\&quot;Pink</li>
            <li> B000C1Z1HE Pink Sugar by Aquolina for Women - 3.4 Ounce EDT Spray]]</li>
            <li> The cap of the perfume is frosted pink, with fuschia metallic ribbons on the cap and sides of the bottle.</li>
            <li> This product was not the Pink Sugar I am use to.</li>
            <li> and it is what I expected.</li>
            <li> This was really not a problem but was not really specified.  </li>
            <li> then Pink Sugar is diffentently for you.</li>
            <li> and she said it was Pink Sugar, so I ordered some for myself</li>
            <li> This product was to be Pink Sugar by Aquolina.  </li>
            <li> The product I received was called Pink Sugar</li>
            <li> Looks like the product but is missing the key company name and the fragrance</li>
            <li> There are plenty of pink sugar lovers out there.</li>
            <li> Been wearing pink sugar for years and this is not it.</li>
            <li> Just Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it forever, and a few of my coworkers from my last job used it too.</li>
            <li> Because of the cotton candy smell, people have been comparing &#x27;Pink Sugar&#x27; to Britney Spears&#x27; &#x27;Fantasy&#x27; perfume.  </li>
            <li> Sensual pink sugar sent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not very upset about that</li>
            <li> just recieved my bottle of Pink Sugar today</li>
            <li> I inadvertently placed this review info with the Pink Sugar Sensual, which I also have.</li>
            <li> Although I was doubtful about getting so much more for a much smaller price, I decided to go ahead and purchase this anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know people either love it or hate it, but I always get compliments when I wear it - especially from men.</li>
            <li> Your bottle will last for a while since you only need to spray a small amount and that&#x27;s it!</li>
            <li> so maybe its just my gfs taste that its not strong enough!!!</li>
            <li> A heavily sweet/musk smell, definitely has vanilla and sugar, kinda like perfumed cotton candy and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a little over sweet and nauseating, and the licorice smell is suffocating.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can say is that it&#x27;s a little weaker smelling than the one I previously bought from the store.</li>
            <li> This fragrance lasts and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> However, it was dumb of me to purchase this fragrance without actually knowing what it smells like first, because as it turns out, the scent is not at all sweet, but spicy, rude and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Be careful with it though!</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> but I ran out of my other bottle I bought from Sephora</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than on other sites.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is like aromatherapy!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear perfume for other people, I wear it for myself.  </li>
            <li> As other reviewers described it, it smells like vanilla, marshmallows, and cotton candy and those are</li>
            <li> However, there is a packaging requirement that I was not aware when I processed my order.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I recommend other customers to take these two factors into consideration when calculating the cost and planning the date for which the item is needed.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s never noticed with any other purfume so this one&#x27;s a keeper.</li>
            <li> Yay Pink Sugar!</li>
            <li> Other then this the product was satisfactory.</li>
            <li> The other issue is the lenghty shipping time was almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I guess I should never listen to other people when it comes to perfume without smelling it.</li>
            <li> This was just as I expected (packaging, smell, size) were all CORRECT!</li>
            <li> /&gt;&#x27;Pink Sugar&#x27; smells like you doused yourself in Cotton Candy!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been told I smell like candy, vanilla and other times like cotton candy.</li>
            <li> Everyone who smells it around me agree with my opinion, total waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Like other reviewers the closest thing I&#x27;d probably liken it to is cotton candy with hints of vanilla.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Givenchy but thought would try something cheaper,with the same scents I like,vanilla,etc.</li>
            <li> However, after some research I recently discovered that the recent production of the perfume is solely titled \\&quot;Pink Sugar.\\&quot; Here is the website of the manufacturer as proof: [...] .I requested a refund for this perfume, and ordered it somewhere else only to get the same product.</li>
            <li> So if you think you have a fake, you absolutely don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> My wife had been using Dark Vanilla for years,and it seems to be unavailable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really worth describing the scent-</li>
            <li> People should not be forced to, nor do they want to, smell you after you have left the room an hour ago.  </li>
            <li> It is not the real Pink Sugar.  </li>
            <li> I was worried that this may be fake due to the lack of Aquolina name, but like another reviewer said, this is just the new bottle/packaging!</li>
            <li> I do a couple spritz on my hair each morning when it&#x27;s down.</li>
            <li> It is a watered down rip off.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of pink sugar and my husband got me this gift for our wedding anniversary!!</li>
            <li> I hate to even tell people what it is because I like how unique it is on me!  </li>
            <li> And the perfume seriously lasts all day, especially if you spray it in your hair.</li>
            <li> I found it, the price was considerably less</li>
            <li> wife was not happy so went to rite aid spent the extra money</li>
            <li> Smells like black licorice, vanilla and cherry.</li>
            <li> ,it&#x27;s a wasted of money in the long run,bought my usual perfume anyway because this was unnacceptable</li>
            <li> I was shocked when i went to the store and found out that the full size was $60 .</li>
            <li> but I was a little disappointed when it came because the tube had a few dents and scratches on even with the huge amount of bubble wrap</li>
            <li> though a little too perfumey for me.</li>
            <li> , try just dabbing a little on.</li>
            <li> little girls spray on themselves.  </li>
            <li> so I did a little research.</li>
            <li> Less than half the price here!</li>
            <li> You dont need to put a lot on just a little and the compliments come flocking.</li>
            <li> I put on a shirt I had sprayed it on, that I haddn&#x27;t worn for a few days and was surprised to find it still smelled faintly of vanilla!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I first tried Pink Sugar I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months</li>
            <li> I can even smell it a few hours after school has ended</li>
            <li> A few times on the elevator at work, a few people have said \\&quot;do you smell that??</li>
            <li> she has two bottles and can wear it everyday.</li>
            <li> It was missing the cover but who cares.</li>
            <li> so I know that the scent lasts all day and this product was not a genuine product.</li>
            <li> walked into the conference room and a male co-worker 5 minutes behind me, followed the scent to where I was and complimented me on it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for a few years and it has a scent that almost everyone likes.</li>
            <li> Feel like I wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;BUT, after using it a few times I noticed caramel, lots of it.</li>
            <li> I would have been missing out.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It starts out citrusy, for a few minutes</li>
            <li> I receive lots of compliments everyday</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was twice the size of the one sold in department stores for half the price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula slightly or what-</li>
            <li> I noticed my hair was softer, and shiny, with less flyaways!</li>
            <li> Its not a strong scent nor is it perfumey.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this pruduct a try because all the positive feedback it has but dear lord, for the first time in my life I should have stay with the negative one, it smells soooooo aweful, like burn cotton  candy or something, some of the reviews says that is a fake one and maybe it is because I can&#x27;t believe that all of these people can like such a horrible perfume.</li>
            <li> I think I am also allergic because I got a pretty bad headache.</li>
            <li> , I was a little disappointed that the perfume smells EXACTLY like the Cotton Candy Fantasy spray that one could purchase at Rite Aid for $5.</li>
            <li> You Seriously smell like candy when you wear Pink Sugar!  </li>
            <li> I was afraid that maybe the product would arrive damaged or partially used and that would account for the very low price.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Second, this isn&#x27;t a little girl&#x27;s scent on me!</li>
            <li> decided to write this review because today I was walking downtown and this guy walks past me and yells \\&quot;Damn girl, you smell like candy.</li>
            <li> I was a bit skeptical about buying this because it was only $20 for a 3.4 oz</li>
            <li> cause all you need is a small spray and</li>
            <li> I usually apply it a couple times a day.</li>
            <li> My english is not perfect, but I have the urge to write this small review.</li>
            <li> The smell was also different and it&#x27;s clearly a fake.</li>
            <li> I usually wear anything by Escada.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;ll like it, try it at sephora or Ulta.</li>
            <li> Im not sure what happened</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance in the past, but bought at Sephora - not through this seller.</li>
            <li> The product came on time, and was at a cheaper price than usual.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume, but I do not love it... yet.</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments when I wear this perfume, which usually come in the form of &amp;#34;you</li>
            <li> I hastily concluded that the item I received was fake since it did not bare the brand name Aquolina on the box or the bottle.</li>
            <li> Really sweet perfume, almost sickening, spray in moderation.</li>
            <li> I usually wear it to work and will get compliments late into the day.</li>
            <li> I just hate that the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping if I apply less I won&#x27;t get such a bad headache.</li>
            <li> I seriously gagged after spritzing this on :/  </li>
            <li> I find it hard to categorize.</li>
            <li> I will have a hard time throwing it away, if I do that at all.</li>
            <li> Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> We got it on amazon from \\&quot;Beauty Storage\\&quot; and I was a little hesitant to order online, as a few of the reviews I read indicated that that this was a fake.  </li>
            <li> There was no place in town that carried it, and I was told I&#x27;d probably have to drive at least 2 hours to get it...</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear this, at least 2 people compliment me and ask me what I am wearing.  </li>
            <li> For the negative reviewers who think their products are knockoffs because the bottle doesn&#x27;t say Aquolina: I went to Sephora today.</li>
            <li> You will not go wrong with this Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> It seriously smells like Cotten Candy.</li>
            <li> It is actually a very complex scent and it is really hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> and I all thought it smelled pretty awful.</li>
            <li> This perfume sucks!</li>

            <li> I was thinking it would probably get people annoyed or me dizzy.</li>

            <li> It makes me feel sick.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> Because of this, this type of products have to be re-packaged having a couple of implications for customers: (a) an additional cost of $15.00 per bottle and (b) a two-week delayed to receive the product.</li>
            <li> :(</li>
            <li> I was disappointed</li>

            <li> I hate that smell.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This smells so sweet but it isn&#x27;t cloying or girly. The lemon mix in really makes this a good staple to use every day.</li>
            <li> I really like this sweet cotton candy smell...</li>
            <li> Purchased this cause my husband likes the smell, I think its okay though a little too perfumey for me.</li>
            <li> I love this! Especially the cute packaging. The perfume smells great, very cotton candy, tangy, warm scent with some sandalwood undertones too. Smells like absolute heaven. I loved the smell so much I bought the lotion and body wash as well. Get compliments on the scent daily. Try it!</li>
            <li> This stuff Smells exactly just like cotton candy! I get compliments every time I wear it, even from total strangers.</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews I was a little hesitant to make this purchase.  I was afraid that maybe the product would arrive damaged or partially used and that would account for the very low price.  Some of the reviews stated that said their bottle was damaged, used or the perfume was not up to par.  My bottle arrived in excellent condition, brand new and unused, well packaged and the fragrance is wonderful. Best of all is that the price is a fraction of what it sells for in the retail stores.  I was so pleased with the EDT I then ordered the Pink Sugar Mouse.  It arrived the other day and was in the same good condition as the perfume.  It also smells wonderful and is as light as air when you apply to your skin.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is my all-time favorite perfume. I purchased the 1.7 ounce bottle from Sephora, and since I was using it every day I ran out quickly. I definitely wanted to repurchase but did not want to pay $45 again, so, I turned to Amazon! and at $24 for twice the amount of product I was getting from Sephora, I couldn&#x27;t refuse. Although I was doubtful about getting so much more for a much smaller price, I decided to go ahead and purchase this anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people in these reviews have been skeptical about this perfume when purchased from this dealer. I have looked very closely at the packaging. A lot of reviews have been skeptical about the lack of some sort of \\&quot;Aquolina\\&quot; logo on the packaging, however, the one I purchased from Sephora didn&#x27;t have one either. So that&#x27;s not the issue here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MAIN issue is that the smell is just... well... different. My old bottle was empty so I couldn&#x27;t make a strong comparison, but I could tell the smell was much more alcohol-y. I&#x27;m thinking this was a result of poor maintenance of the perfume. Many factors can affect a perfume, the main one being strong heat/light, causing it to lose its fun scent, leaving the remains of a rubbing-alcohol smell. Yuck! This perfume did not have QUITE that strong of an alcohol smell. It definitely did smell like pink sugar, just a less-strong version of my old Sephora-purchased perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OVERALL, I would say definitely go and purchase from this dealer if you are willing to sacrifice the long-wearing effect that this perfume has when purchased from a real beauty supplier like Sephora. After all, it is a great price and it really is not THAT far off from the more expensive version.</li>
            <li> Which is a very good thing as far as I am concerned.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite perfumes! I ordered it after reading some online reviews, (and this time, I actually put some effort into trying to find it locally.) There was no place in town that carried it, and I was told I&#x27;d probably have to drive at least 2 hours to get it... so I ordered in on Amazon. It was a very good price, the shipping was reasonable, and I got it very fast.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is not super extraordinary, but I don&#x27;t really &#x27;buy the perfume for the bottle&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is amazing, there is really nothing else out there quite like it. It is like pure concentrated SUGAR. It really doesn&#x27;t get any sweeter than this, and yet, it is not overpowering, and it lasts for hours and hours.&lt;br /&gt;My husband does not like many perfumes, but this one he does. He says it makes me smell like cotton candy. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s such a sweet smell, sweet olfactoraly speaking, but also in a tender sort of way. Reminds me of childhood wonder and pure joy of candies and favorite warm baked treats fresh out of the oven.  Someone who smelled it has started calling me Candy (although he said it doesn&#x27;t taste as good as it smells) and someone else always tells me it smells like toast when I put it on.  I think it smells far better than just toast.  I really love it. I save it for special occasions.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this perfume. I think it is the best on the line. If you want a unique scent get this. People always ask me \\&quot;what are you wearing, what is that smell?\\&quot; It gets everyones attention.&lt;br /&gt;The product was at my house 3 days after placing the order.</li>
            <li> I always love this stuff.  My students tell me I smell like cupcakes.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It&#x27;s the only one I wear and I get so many comments on how good it smells, mostly from men.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a few months and I LOVE it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People always ask me if I&#x27;ve been baking cookies or drinking vanilla lol&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to write this review because today I was walking downtown and this guy walks past me and yells \\&quot;Damn girl, you smell like candy. I want to eat you.\\&quot; HAHA Best ( and strangest) compliment ever!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell lasts all day for me. I constantly find myself smelling hidden scents in the fragrance.</li>
            <li> You have got to be kidding me Amazon...I paid 28 dollars for a generic knockoff?! No where on the packaging does it say Aqualina the brand name...I am so very disappointed with Amazon and I think my shopping days with you guys are over! I am disabled and can not get to a post office to send back! Does not even smell close to the real thing!! Thanx alot Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> Such a pretty, girly scent!! I love this! I get tons of compliments when I wear it!  Be careful with it though! A little bit goes a long way!</li>
            <li> I usually hate wearing perfume because it makes me nauseous but his one does not! I absolutely love it!  It is  my favorite perfume of all time. I do not really care that it is suppose to be a &#x27;teen&#x27; scent, I still like it and will wear for the next 50 yrs! I love it so much that decided to also purchase Pink Sugar Sensual, can not wait to receive it. Pink Sugar I will definitely repurchase, it has the sweetest smell, and it is not overwhelmingly sick or anything, it literally is sweet and gentle..in love!</li>
            <li> As my years have progressed, naturally certain tastes of mine have changed.  My clothes, of course, are more conservative and chosen for comfort.  All of my shoes tend to be flats with the occassional 2\\&quot; heel that I need for a special event.  But when it comes to fragrance, I still embrace a wide array of scents from deep and spicy to lush tropical notes and everything in-between.  Pink Sugar is one of those scents that I would have worn as a much younger lady yet it still holds great appeal for me now that I&#x27;m in my early 50&#x27;s.  It&#x27;s a sweet, warm scent rich in vanilla notes but it doesn&#x27;t end up smelling like body powder for an octogenarian.  It may not be for every (scents)ibility, but I&#x27;m enjoying the heck out of.</li>
            <li> I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this scent.  It doesn&#x27;t last very long, which is to be expected since it is EDT. I really wish they would come out with an EDP version. I was recently told by one of my students that if he had a girlfriend, he would want her to wear this perfume. Needless to say, I DO NOT wear this perfume to work anymore! Otherwise, it&#x27;s my \\&quot;go-to\\&quot; scent. Not flowery, not musky--it has a sweet and warm scent.</li>
            <li> I love this scent!! I am a huge vanilla and sugar scent fan.  I use this with Victoria&#x27;s secret Vanilla Lace, and Cotton Candy body deodorant.  It has a sugary smell with strong hints of vanilla and cotton candy, and it lasts for hours.  I only gave it 4 stars because I&#x27;m pretty sure the bottle I bought here from Amazon was a fake.  It did not say Aquolina anywhere on the bottle, packaging, or case.  Also I have seen this for $20 in stores instead of the $26 here.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since it first came out, people stop me and ask me what I&#x27;m wearing -mostly women and they look so happy from the scent.. This scent is sweet and does put you in happy mood, cotton candy, marshmellows,yum.&lt;br /&gt;Its really great for the spring/summer, in the fall/winter i use oriental deeper scents. I just love this/</li>
            <li> This perfume is very sweet and delicious! It smells just like cotton candy! I get a lot of compliments on this, it&#x27;s worth a try!</li>
            <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find this particular fragrance anywhere, I once again turned to Amazon and of course they carried it. Not only did they have it, they had several selections to choose from. I should know better and just go to Amazon.com first. It would have saved me a lot of time. The fragrance is great also!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product from Amazon, and like many others thought it was fake because of the lack of branding on the packaging.  I did some research and found out that Aquolina has removed the company name from this product.  The bottles are now being branded solely as \\&quot;Pink Sugar\\&quot; and no longer as \\&quot;Aquolina Pink Sugar\\&quot;  So if you think you have a fake, you absolutely don&#x27;t.  Amazon is selling a legit product.</li>
            <li> This stuff just smells gross.  At first, it smells really sweet, but there is this really chemically, musky undertone that just kills my  nose!  I expected the entire bouquet to be sweet.  Try Calgon&#x27;s Marshmallow body spray.</li>
            <li> I received my bottle yesterday, used it last night and when I woke up the scent was still on me. It smells absolutely delicious!!!! A must buy...a fun, flirty scent :)</li>
            <li> Wow the product was exactly what I wanted and it was an excellent price and buy for the other prices I have seen. Thank you so much! God Bless you!</li>
            <li> This is my FAVORITE perfume!!! I have had this as a favorite for over 5 yrs now!! It&#x27;s just sweet and wonderful!! Very girly! : )</li>
            <li> Alright so I bought this a perfume a year and a half ago, I LOVED it at first. I used almost a whole bottle! Then I bought another one and switched up my pefume for a while. I went back to the old bottle and sprayed it and it smelled really funky, I don&#x27;t know why but both of them smell funny after they sit for a while-they don&#x27;t smell like the bottles in the store. It&#x27;s like it goes bad after a while? So wtf?</li>
            <li> This was the best purchase I&#x27;ve ever made! I was a bit skeptical about buying this because it was only $20 for a 3.4 oz but I ran out of my other bottle I bought from Sephora so I decided to go for it. I just received it in the mail today and it is amazing. The bottle was in a brand new package with a plastic seal and everything. It looked absolutely brand new. The smell is super sweet and very pleasant, it may be a little too sweet for some people but I love sweet perfumes and I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on this scent many times. Some people compare it to chocolate chip cookies which I don&#x27;t mind at all. :)</li>
            <li> I bought this for my girlfriend for christmas and she Loves it, and I have to admit so do I.  I can&#x27;t really speak for why she likes it so I will tell you why I like it. It&#x27;s true what they say, a way to a man&#x27;s heart is through his stomach. I love when women wear perfumes that have a fruity or sweet scent as opposed to a musky or floral scent.  This perfume is not overbearing and has a light sweet scent. It reminds me a bit of cotton candy.</li>
            <li> This fragance is unique like no other, be prepared for everybody asking what you have on, both men and women.  I adore it!!</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing, intriguing, and YUMMY perfume my wife has ever tried. As long as everyone on the planet is NOT using it she&#x27;ll keep it in her arsenal. She&#x27;s one of those that has to be different so if this ever gets popular she&#x27;ll choose something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells like a mix between cotton candy and subtle fresh baked cookies without that sickly sweet smell of other \\&quot;candy\\&quot; style perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t possibly say how much I love this stuff. It&#x27;s that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a bonus it&#x27;s cheaper on Amazon than on other sites.</li>
            <li> I receive so many compliments from both men and women on this perfume and have even had people following me around asking what delicious fragrance I was wearing.  I hope this perfume is never discontinued.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is like aromatherapy! The scent is addictive and always makes me feel energized and happy. Vanilla is the most obvious note, however on me the perfume takes on a warm caramel citrus scent too. The scent is so unique and lovely. Although it is a very feminine fragrance Pink Sugar is not cloying or obnoxious but complex, sophisticated, and playful. My co-workers love when I arrive to work in the morning because I smell so great. I love to spray it in my hair so i can enjoy the fragrance all day. Sometimes my friends and family will grab a handful of my hair just for a sniff!</li>
            <li> Love love love the perfume, however I have prime shipping and it took over a weeke to get delivered to me. Only complain...</li>
            <li> I was worried that this was going to end up being a scam where they dilute the perfume or it wasn&#x27;t the right version. But, as it turned out, it was actually exactly what I was looking for with the same great scent! I am very pleased with my purchase [...]! This is an amazing price for an amazing perfume! I look forward to doing business with this supplier in the future! Thank you!</li>
            <li> I love Pink Sugar-It smells just like cotton candy! Whenever I wear it someone inevitably asks me what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. It is the perfect summer scent and, HANDS DOWN, Amazon has the best pricing out there (I&#x27;ve payed triple at Nordstrom in the past). Great buy-</li>
            <li> I get so many...\\&quot;Smells good here!\\&quot;...LOL....Wore it to bed every night the first 2 weeks after I received it.  It&#x27;s that yummy!</li>
            <li> Whenever I wear this, at least 2 people compliment me and ask me what I am wearing.  LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> I am always scared to try new perfumes. This I love. when I run out I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> LOVE this perfume. I am someone that doesn&#x27;t like a strong scent. This smells a bit like the old \\&quot;Love Soft\\&quot; with a bit more of a floral/vanilla undertone. If you like bakery smells, this is for you. I&#x27;ve actually had it on and people have said, do you smell cupcakes? (men LOVE this!) Fresh, clean and for old or young. My mom, who&#x27;s in her 70&#x27;s loves the shower gel. Cheers you up!</li>
            <li> It smells like sugar water. Don&#x27;t waste your money - Only buy it if you have smelled it and liked the smell. Otherwise don&#x27;t risk wasting your money.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think the scent was as strong as it used to be. It doesn&#x27;t do any good to get a good deal if it&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
            <li> I hastily concluded that the item I received was fake since it did not bare the brand name Aquolina on the box or the bottle. However, after some research I recently discovered that the recent production of the perfume is solely titled \\&quot;Pink Sugar.\\&quot; Here is the website of the manufacturer as proof: [...] .I requested a refund for this perfume, and ordered it somewhere else only to get the same product. This IS authentic!</li>
            <li> I have worn this scent for 4 years now and everyone loves it. The banks tellers to the grocery check out people always ask what it is. Love it</li>
            <li> Had never heard of it, was looking for something different.  Received it, have worn it every day since getting it.  Some women had reviewed it as being really really sweet, like cotton candy.  Doesn&#x27;t smell that way to me.  Right off the top what I smell is black pepper, which I found really appealing, since I love pepper.  It IS sweet, but not THAT sweet, sugary but not sickeningly sweet.  I have not been swarmed by people saying how much they like it, but I have had compliments from people who&#x27;ve never been complimentary about anything else, so...?  I don&#x27;t wear perfume for other people, I wear it for myself.  I like to smell something nice in the middle of the workday when I&#x27;m getting tired and bored with the hours...I&#x27;ve found that it wears very well on me, especially if I put a little moisturizing lotion on first.  Others have complained about it fading too quickly on them, but I think their noses are just not good enough, it lasts all day although very much more subtly later in the day, with just a touch of musk showing up.  I hate musk, so I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t really bother me.  I think the price is right, and I plan to buy more when this bottle is finished.</li>
            <li> never dissapointed with this perfume. it smells amazing. like cotton candy and I always get compliments on it. it shipped pretty fast too. very happy.</li>
            <li> Very good value for the money.  Smells great and last most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to others.  For the amount and quality, this is a very good value compared to similar items on the market.</li>
            <li> I really wanted this fragrance for years.  I have a big parfume collection so I was always putting my purchase away.  But recently I decided to get it for myself for birthday.  This perfume smell delicious and fresh at the same time, it is warm and inviting.  When I wearing it, it makes me happy.  It is a compliment gather.  Men love this perfume.  Vanilla, musk and bergamot give this perfume a special notes.  It has great staying power for EDT.  It is special as no other perfumes smell the same.  Price is great for the amount and quality.</li>
            <li> The parfume was in perfect condition. I got here so quick and it smells absolutly delicious!! Everyone keeps telling me how good I smell. That makes me happy :)</li>
            <li> I first smelled this product when I was in Sephora testing out different fragrances w/ my friends.  What first caught my attention was the cute bottle design, and also the name, \\&quot;Pink Sugar\\&quot;.  I lightly sprayed my wrist, thought it was okay, and soon after left the store.  After walking around for a while, the delicious aromas of warm vanilla, sweet cotton candy, and soft caramel grew on me!  It really blended well w/ the natural chemistry of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was not too long before I ordered this perfume, and all I can say is that I&#x27;m in LOVE with this heavenly scent!  I&#x27;ve noticed that as the day goes on, Pink Sugar evolves into a rich, textured sweetness that is all the while fresh, delightful, and inviting.  Being a young teen, I really enjoy perfumes that can compliment my style, as well as my personality.  I also think that Pink Sugar isn&#x27;t just appealing for teenagers--but for anyone who is interested in a playful, yet sophisticated fragrance that smells SO delicious!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m slowly beginning my Aquolina collection, and so far I have the original Pink Sugar, Pink Sugar Sensual, &amp; Gold Sugar is on its way.  I most definitely recommend this product, and the others as well!  \\&quot;Compliment City\\&quot; is right around the corner! :)  I would say test the fragrance before you buy, though...just to make sure that it is right for you.  Depending on how strong you perfer your perfumes: usually my wrists, the back of my neck (where people hug me), &amp; a light mist all over does the job perfectly for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink Sugar has become my signature scent, and I absolutely LOVE it. &amp;lt;3</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this yummy scent. Smells like vanilla and cotton candy. Only perfume I will wear and do wear. Does not give me a headache like some perfumes do. Light scent, yet so fun and yummy smelling. Everyone compliments me on it when I&#x27;m wearing it, asks what I&#x27;m wearing. I will never wear another kind. My all time favorite.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells sweet, sexy, and young. I absolutley love it. I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend buying it for someone old and stuffy. Those are the people that are writing the bad reviews :)</li>
            <li> This perfume was not at all what I expected. As other reviewers described it, it smells like vanilla, marshmallows, and cotton candy and those are lovely smells. And to remind you, the name of this perfume is Pink Sugar. However, it was dumb of me to purchase this fragrance without actually knowing what it smells like first, because as it turns out, the scent is not at all sweet, but spicy, rude and unpleasant. I don&#x27;t understand the popularity of this product nor how anyone finds that to smell sweet.</li>
            <li> omg i just recieved it today i love it!! it kinda smells like a mix between vanilla and cotton candy.</li>
            <li> I think this is fake. There isn&#x27;t the brand name aquolina anywhere on the package. I&#x27;m very disappointed and upset. I can&#x27;t believe I got tricked. The lady on the phone was very nice though when I called about it.</li>
            <li> This is my all time favorite perfume and Amazon sells it for so cheap!!! At sephora its $50 and up. I was excited to see this on here. It smells so yummy. I have a small one for my purse and a large one for at home &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is a good everyday fragrance that is not overpowering or offensive.  I receive many complements whenever I wear it.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 16 year old sister. The smell is sweet and age appropriate, she never leaves the house without putting it on. I am so happy I purchased this for her it smells fabulous!</li>
            <li> Long wearing, great size, the service was quick. The scent is perfect, smells just like candy. I really enjoy it.</li>
            <li> After 5 years this is still my favorite perfume. I get SO MANY compliments on it I&#x27;ve tried to change but still can&#x27;t! Good for grownups if your chemistry can handle vanilla scents.</li>
            <li> The scent is exactly like cotton candy.  I don&#x27;t know how they captured the fragrance of spun sugar like that, but it&#x27;s just wonderful.</li>
            <li> Ok I was very hesitant about purchasing this perfume because I read many reviews saying the packaging isn&#x27;t the original and the perfume is a knock off I&#x27;m so glad I purchased it though because as far as I can tell the packaging IS the original and it ISNT a knock off the perfume comes in a sturdy cardboard cylinder with textured pink stripes with the pink sugar logo and a pink spiral on the lid the perfume bottle itself is a glass bottle with hot pink stripes similar to the tube it comes in also they wrapped it in a bunch of bubble wrap to secure it but I was a little disappointed when it came because the tube had a few dents and scratches on even with the huge amount of bubble wrap it came in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE SCENT&lt;br /&gt;The scent is to die for and it lasts all day! But be careful because it is the strongest scent in the universe so a little goes a long way when you first spray it it smells of vanilla, berries, and cotton candy with a not so pleasant musk scent ( depending on your taste in scent) but as the day goes on the scent fades into a lovely cotton candy scent I can even smell it a few hours after school has ended</li>
            <li> I love this scent and the price is very affordable.  It&#x27;s great for daytime when wearing shorts or a sundress.  My only complaint is that the scent doesn&#x27;t last as long as I wish it did.</li>
            <li> This is not aquolina!!!! I went thru all reviews and decided to take a chance. BIG mistake!!! I know aquolina. This is not it. As soon as I sprayed it I had a massive headache. So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume. Smells great, great buy from amazon saved some money. Shipping was fast purchased on 5/5/11.&lt;br /&gt;Packaging was great. Would buy from again. So happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because it was twice the size of the one sold in department stores for half the price! It arrived earlier than expected and was in great condition. The only thing I can say is that it&#x27;s a little weaker smelling than the one I previously bought from the store. It still smells great but it IS slightly different. I&#x27;m not sure if they changed the formula slightly or what-but it&#x27;s not exactly the same. I still love it and would order it again!</li>
            <li> A spiced hot sugar freshly spun.  Sweet, sexy and flirtatious. Makes me think of sun warmed skin and summer honeysuckle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care for the smell of this at all. I was hoping to find something comparable to Hypnotic Poison.  This isn&#x27;t it.</li>
            <li> It smells great, and it makes a great gift - although the lady I bought it for says she has smelled it on others, which somewhat takes away the \\&quot;surprise\\&quot; factor for me, as a gift-giver.  I guess I should have known that, seeing that it&#x27;s the top seller in fragrances on Amazon, but she seems really, really happy, so that makes me glad.  Plus...(fill in this area with your own imagination.)</li>
            <li> got this for my girlfriend and she loves it,smells sweet and will last forever cause all you need is a small spray and your covered and she says she receives many compliments that she smells good..</li>
            <li> I love it! I love it! I love it! I gave it to my granddaughter and she likes it. So I got my own bottle. I really love. And I&#x27;m 60 years, so its not just a teenager smell. Ymmm!!!</li>
            <li> I was worried that this may be fake due to the lack of Aquolina name, but like another reviewer said, this is just the new bottle/packaging! Here is the Italian website to compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, it smells very yum! :) the licorice scent is very strong at first but after a little bit goes away. Just give it some time! I can&#x27;t stop smelling myself. :)</li>
            <li> Pink sugar is a happy smell. Reminds me of pink cotton candy, and summer time. It&#x27;s not overpowering. I usually apply it a couple times a day.</li>
            <li> Can we say LEGIT! I am highly satisfied with my bottle! For it came super fast and smells heavenly ;)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  ok.  smells different from when I bought it years ago from sephora</li>
            <li> I first tried this at Sephora and fell in love.  Of course came to Amazon knowing I&#x27;d find it cheaper and did.  Ordered and my perfume just arrived, could not be more pleased, this perfume is not only in a pretty bottle but it smells fantastic, sugary and sweet.  I love it!</li>
            <li> I used to use a cotton candy type smelling one, but it got discontinued, so I thought I&#x27;d try this. The scent lasts all day, but isn&#x27;t quite as delicate and sweet smelling as my last one. Still good though!!</li>
            <li> This perfume is a fun, playful, and sexy fragrance.  It priced really reasonable, which is unusual for perfumes of this caliber.  The scent feels fresh and young.  The name is definitly fitting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will smell like cake and sugar!  It stays on for a while.  I love the bottle it comes in too. I have gotten several as gifts for girlfriends, and everyone loves it.  It is a fun sweet scent that would be good for daytime, but can also feel like a sexier fragrance when worn in the evening.</li>
            <li> I love a sweet smelling perfume. I read some of the previous reviews and didn&#x27;t want to go worng by ordering a used bottle, therfore I just ordered new. I haven&#x27;t had any problems and I love the way it smells. My 6 year old daughter loves it too...</li>
            <li> I had a sample of this Eau de Toilette and had fallen in love with it. I could not find it at any stores that I went to. Surprisingly one day I found it at Amazon by accident. It was a steal at $26.99 :D I love the Vanilla, lemon, citrusy sweet scent .... very delicious ;)It had free shipping and arrived in 2 days .... I was very pleasantly surprised :) Item exactly as shown.</li>
            <li> This is def one of my favorite scents! It smells like marshmallows and candy. One of my co-workers said it smells like chocolate, but everyone else says it smells like candy. I love it, and it lasts a while too. I am going to buy another bottle from Amazon when I run out!</li>
            <li> The bottle i received stunk of bad alchohol..&lt;br /&gt;Anazon took care of the problem very kindly.&lt;br /&gt;I then just bought the Christmas time only gift pack at Nordstrom, which is even better in price for what you get.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Anazon, for good customer service!&lt;br /&gt;:-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that get headaches from strong scents. I had tried so many different perfumes, and had come to terms with the fact I was destined to live a life without a \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot;. I&#x27;d read a description of Pink Sugar in a magazine and wanted to give it a try. I snagged a sample from the local Sephora. After several days of use I&#x27;d discovered I hadn&#x27;t had a single perfume induced headache. I bought a full size bottle, and have been using it ever since. I despise floral fragrances and am so happy to find something that doesn&#x27;t make me smell like a rosebush. It is sweet smelling, but not overpowering. Love it!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this purchase... this started being popular when sephora first started carrying this fragrance... i have so many fragrances but this one is an outstanding fragrance among my perfume collection &#x3D;) yey</li>
            <li> Everyone comments on how lovely it smells.  I love that everyone says how it smells x way or y way..lol but they all agree its a yummy smell. And that&#x27;s what I want! Love the price and this is the second time i bought from this seller so keep up the great job!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter for Christmas. She loves the smell. It is a light, sweet fragrance. It is is suitable for an adult as well.</li>
            <li> What a great price through this retailer...I have purchased a smaller bottle through another retailer and paid twice the amount. I love the fragrance this cologne emits.  Smells like cotton candy.  Lots of compliments come my way when I wear this delicious fragrance.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this sweet smelling perfume! A few times on the elevator at work, a few people have said \\&quot;do you smell that?? It smells so good, like cotton candy or cookies or something.\\&quot; \\&quot;uhhh...I think that&#x27;s me, do I have too much on??\\&quot; I don&#x27;t (or I hope) that people aren&#x27;t just being nice when they tell me no and that it smells awesome and ask what it is. But it&#x27;s usually right after I spray it so the only thing I worry about is that it&#x27;s a little too light and I find myself randomly spraying myself throughout the day. Then again sometimes I think we become immune to our perfume smell :-) I would suggest getting the lotion to put on before spraying yourself. Seems to make the fragrance last longer.</li>
            <li> Perfums are one of those item which result very convenient to buy through the Internet.  However, there is a packaging requirement that I was not aware when I processed my order. Some type of bottles currently used for parfums, leads US custom authorities to consider them as \\&quot;Danger Material\\&quot;. Because of this, this type of products have to be re-packaged having a couple of implications for customers: (a) an additional cost of $15.00 per bottle and (b) a two-week delayed to receive the product. Therefore, I recommend other customers to take these two factors into consideration when calculating the cost and planning the date for which the item is needed.</li>
            <li> I initial purchased Pink Sugar as a Christmas gift for my sister and she just loves it! And I have to say that I really love it too! It is really warm and sweet smelling without making you smell like a kid that has run amok in a cotton candy factory like sugary scents I have come across. When first applied it has a nice sort of &#x60;spicy&#x27; undertone that gradually disappears to leave a light, sweet cotton candy scent that is noticeable without being in any way overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The awesome packaging is a really nice bonus! I love the pink and white swirled cylinder that had slightly rubbery raised stripes and the actual bottle has a nice frosted pink cap with really cute darker pink ribbon wrapped around it in a crisscrossing pattern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a great gift idea or just an awesome way to treat yourself!</li>
            <li> Yeah, it&#x27;s kissable on your neck...compliments of my boyfriend....ha-ha-ha!!!&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s sold!!&lt;br /&gt;Me tooooo!!!&lt;br /&gt;I think this perfume smells delicious!!!&lt;br /&gt;The scent lingers once you spray, last long on the skin. Smells like to me: a bit of burnt sugar--in a good way, like caramel, a hint of cotton candy and some raspberry scent tones in it. This is the reason why I wanted to try it out so I bought it and I am happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> Great! Smells delicious. Big bottle, nothing more to say except it is fantastic and i was very happy!</li>
            <li> Real deal folks, price is amazing. Came way sooner then estimated. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Too strong, too sweet, smells cheap. Avoid this at all costs</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS STUFF!!  Completely addicted, my new favorite scent.  Get tons of compliments all the time about how great it smells.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me it really smells like sweet pink lemonade with a little bit of cotton candy.  I end up sniffing myself throughout the day because it smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your body chemistry works well with sweet smells you should definitely give this a try.  It&#x27;s well worth the money and the 3.4 ounce lasts a long while (believe me I practically bathe in the stuff and it stills last about 6 months).  BUY IT!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! I don&#x27;t wear perfume a lot because I tend to get headaches from them or I just can&#x27;t stand a strong floral smell. This perfume is sweet but not too sweet and kind of reminds me of cotton candy spray I used to wear in grammer school. I love that the smell lasts and doesn&#x27;t fade away after an hour of applying. I have gotten many compliments on it from women but actually seemed to receive more from men...this will definately be a keeper! :)</li>
            <li> I first sampled this fragrance walking through a department store.  I instantly liked the fragrance, one that smelled very similar to cotton candy, with subtle tones of vanilla.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of vanilla fragrances, but this one struck me as delicious.  A few weeks later, I returned to the store only to find that the fragrance had been sold out.  Luckily, I found the product on Amazon.com.  I bought it, received the free shipping, and received it a couple of days later!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband loves this fragrance on me.  Coworkers have commented on how nice and subtle it is.  I like how unique the fragrance is, light, airy, nostalgic, not overpowering....I will definitely buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Lovely girly smell, not too sweet. Smells like cotton candy with a hint of caramel and musk.  Fragrance lasts all day.  A great anytime perfume for day or evening.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It smells so sweet and yummy. Every time that I put it on I get complimented on how good I smell, and who doesn&#x27;t love that? Before I bought it online, I went to Sephora to smell it and try it on and I instantly fell in love with it. I waited patiently to order it online though, instead of right then and there. Because from Amazon it was about $20.00 dollars cheaper. Oh how I love Amazon. Anyway, this perfume is great and it only takes a little to smell so wonderful all day. I love it, my boyfriend loves it, and I have yet to be told that it is too strong or too overwhelming. I suggest getting it if you want to smell good and feel good!</li>
            <li> This hair perfume makes me feel better from the inside out (not to mention smell better too!) I do a couple spritz on my hair each morning when it&#x27;s down. The smell immediately comes out on me. At first it smells like licorice, then after a few minutes, sinks right into cotton candy. Then sugar cookies, and back to cotton candy again! All with a hint of vanilla &amp; caramel at the end. So basically, everything it&#x27;s selling itself for (:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s a hair perfume, it does wonders for your hair too. I noticed my hair was softer, and shiny, with less flyaways! Amazing! Did I mention how great it smells?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you buy this perfume DEFINITIVELY expect compliments. People ask, \\&quot;what smells so good?\\&quot; I&#x27;ve had people say, you smell like candy, or you smell like cookies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it is a fake, because it doesn&#x27;t say Aquolina anywhere, but it&#x27;s a darn good fake that I&#x27;d be willing to buy again, and again. And it doesn&#x27;t last that long, but when it does, it&#x27;s strong! So another spritz over a 6 hour period makes it a-ok. But I&#x27;m not picky (; It&#x27;s so perfect for springtime, and at such a low cost, you would be foolish to pass it up. GET IT!!</li>
            <li> This scent is absolutely heavenly. It is for those ladies younger and more mature that want just a little hint of the feminine and the yummy (think cotten candy) to catch the senses of passersby.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn this smell for over a year--it&#x27;s awesomely delicious. I couldn&#x27;t believe the 3.4 ounce bottle was only 30 bucks! At Sephora you&#x27;d pay 55 plus tax. Awesome.</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance its smells like Cotton Candy and Marshmallows &#x3D;]~ also the staying power is great for a EDT it outlasts most of my EDP perfumes..&lt;br /&gt;The price cannot be beat here on amazon.com $29.99 for a 3.4oz is a DEAL it retails for $55..&lt;br /&gt;the Free shipping is great i ordered 1/22/08 and recieved 1/24/08 just 2 DAYS LATER!! great service with AMAZON !!</li>
            <li> I love this fragrance, it&#x27;s definitely one of my faves. When I first wore it my husband actually said, \\&quot;you smell so good\\&quot;! He&#x27;s never noticed with any other purfume so this one&#x27;s a keeper. Also, shipping was really fast!</li>
            <li> Alright,&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this produst without smelling it beforehand. Which...wasn&#x27;t that smart. But I was VERY pleased with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When first applied it smells smi-overpowering, and has a strawberry icecream tint to it. But after a minute or so it settels into a warm vanilla scent. People have asked me if I&#x27;ve been eating cotton candy!&lt;br /&gt;It also last a long time. I put on a shirt I had sprayed it on, that I haddn&#x27;t worn for a few days and was surprised to find it still smelled faintly of vanilla!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it!</li>
            <li> Good value and great service</li>
            <li> I know people either love it or hate it, but I always get compliments when I wear it - especially from men. They no longer sell it in the Sephora in town, due to decrease in popularity...and that&#x27;s fine with me because that means less women will be wearing it. People may also say this perfume is immature, but I am in my 30s and I wear this without any thought.</li>
            <li> I originally sampled this fragrance in Sephora a few months ago and liked it, yet didn&#x27;t purchase it. I was surprised to see such a great price on Amazon, so I couldn&#x27;t resist. I still like it very much, as it&#x27;s sweet, but not juvenile. It&#x27;s a great everyday fragrance, light, fun and I think will be particularly nice in the summer (people have asked if it&#x27;s some sort of a vanilla fragrance). As a rule, I like fragrances that are clean and sophisticated. This is a light, clean fragrance, yet fun rather than sophisticated and a nice change. Thanks for the great offer and an opportunity to try it. I have received numerous compliments and will be back for more.</li>
            <li> My daughter inlaw loves this perfume and i got her two bottles for Christmas. She said that she was just about out of it and was only using it when she and my son would go out now she has two bottles and can wear it everyday. tahnk you so much.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best fragrances I have ever smelled, buying it for my wife.  I usually have an allergic reaction to most perfumes due to the floral scent, however this perfume smells like, well, candy!  I love to smell it on her, and the scent generally lasts all day long.  It is an awesome size for the price....Great value!!</li>
            <li> I had been searching for a fragrance I could wear everyday and feel confident that I smelled good to everyone, a scent that was not overpowering or shocking to the senses and this was it!  This fragrance is deliciously sweet, very light, and sure to please anyone who smells it on you!  Most importantly, my boyfriend loves it too!  The scent is a mix of vanilla, cupcakes, cotton candy, hint of citrus...and more!  I highly recommend this if you like sweet candy scents!</li>
            <li> I love perfume and this is definitely a favorite.&lt;br /&gt;It smells...delicious.  It doesn&#x27;t smell fake, it smells like something you want to EAT.  I suppose that is where the name comes from.  The packaging is pretty and the presentation is really girly in a grown up girl kinda way.&lt;br /&gt;It goes on bright and clean, with a bit of sparkle to it, like sugar cookies with pink sugar!  It&#x27;s well named!  It stays true, but softens down so it is more subtle sunny/oriental/floral.  I&#x27;ve got several compliments on it.</li>
            <li> Makes my girl smell sexy!</li>
            <li> Every time I wear this perfume I always get lots of compliments!  It is very sweet smelling and not too heavy.</li>
            <li> The scent is so wonderful I have received more compliments wearing this scent more than any other. I don&#x27;t have to use much and it doesn&#x27;t sting my skin like other perfumes (I have sensitive skin). I will definitely buy this one again.</li>
            <li> Service great and love Pink Sugar</li>
            <li> This smells wonderful.. I wish it lasted longer but it came fast and beautifully packaged.. I love this perfume... You smell young when you wear this.</li>
            <li> I ordered Pink Sugar on QVC few years ago and loved the smell. I have never seen it in a store. My sister got me this for xmas. It was missing the cover but who cares. I love this smell. Its like Loves Baby Soft for grown ups.</li>
            <li> This smells like vanilla cookies and is a great scent for young girls.</li>
            <li> I layered Pink Sugar and Lush&#x27;s Karma perfume, which it heavy on bergomot and patchouli, it really brought the sweetness down.  Real cotton candy scent on it&#x27;s own.  I love it but it seems nearly embarrassing to wear on its own at my age.  I think mixing may be the only way to go with this one but it has a place in my fragrance wardrobe, like a rhinestone clip or bright scarf.</li>
            <li> I am extremely unhappy about my purchase.  This perfume is a knock-off.  I know the difference because I have bought the real perfume before and I was hoping to get a better deal.  The packaging looks very much the same but on the bottle it does not say \\&quot;aqualina\\&quot; like the real stuff anf it does not smell nearly as good as the real stuff.  I found that I cannot even return the item as it is deemed \\&quot;For safety reasons, items that are classified as hazardous materials or use flammable liquids or gases cannot be returned to Amazon.com. Customers should dispose of hazardous materials according to Local, State and Federal regulations. Customers should contact their local government or local waste company for directions on how to dispose of Household Hazardous Waste\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So UNHAPPY!!!</li>
            <li> My english is not perfect, but I have the urge to write this small review. When I received the Aquolina, it was very clear that it was no original-the box was similar but without aquolina sign. The smell was also different and it&#x27;s clearly a fake. I am very dissapointed, because I live in Serbia and it is complicated for me to return it, and also because I completely lost my trust to this way of purchasing things.</li>
            <li> Pink sugar is amazing! It is a nice blend of cotton candy and other sweet fragrences. It is the perfect gift for teens. It is not to strong, nor light. Pink sugar will leave you smelling good for hours. I told all my friends about pink sugar, and now they all have it. I highly reccomend this to every teenager, like me.</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments with this perfume. It lasts a really long time and smells like cake and candy.</li>
            <li> i bought this for my gf and she seems pleased ith it but it doesnt have a strong smell but her friends use it so maybe its just my gfs taste that its not strong enough!!!</li>
            <li> Purchased the genuine product before a few years ago so I know that the scent lasts all day and this product was not a genuine product. The scent only lasted less than 30 minutes.  The scent evaporated faster than water!</li>
            <li> Although this does smell sweet, it&#x27;s a little too sweet and strong.  The smell is better suited for a young girl so I gave it to my 10 year old daughter with the instructions to spritz in the air and do a walk through so she wouldn&#x27;t smell too strong.&lt;br /&gt;It gave me a headache every time I used it.</li>
            <li> I love this spray! Doesn&#x27;t overpower everyone. Can smell it if you are close to me, (very close) I love this smell, it is a sweet cotton candy vanilla scent. So many people (including strangers) tell me how good I smell when I wear this perfume. I have been told I smell like cookies, a Krispy Kreme donut, you name it. Both men and women have complemented me on it. And the perfume seriously lasts all day, especially if you spray it in your hair. Not overpowering, but if you don&#x27;t like wearing sweet smelling fragrances, stay far, far away from this product!</li>
            <li> This was too expensive for the amount that you receive.  I was expecting more for my money so I will not reorder.</li>
            <li> i am always getting compliments on this perfume everywhere i go so i absolutely love it and love it more when i can find a good deal on it~!</li>
            <li> I love Pink Sugar!!! I get migraines very easily...and this is soft enough that it does not cause headaches.  Love it!  Awesome smell!!! :-)</li>
            <li> There is not aquolina anywhere on the package--I think it is fake.  Knock offs usually have a strong alcohol smell and this does.  I can&#x27;t believe I got taken by Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ordered this some time ago.  It has a very strong initial scent at first.  Go light on it.  After a bit, the strong smell fades into something that smells like sugar cookies.  Again, it is not necessary to apply more that a couple (one or two) squirts.  People should not be forced to, nor do they want to, smell you after you have left the room an hour ago.  This is a long lasting scent, unlike some of the other youthful perfumes you find yourself reapplying.</li>
            <li> I work at a local Sephora and this fragrance was constantly being raved about by my fellow employees. Finally, I tried a sample of it and I instantly fell in love with it. It smells very sweet but not overpowering, even though the scent will last you the whole day. I usually wear anything by Escada. That&#x27;s my favorite line of fragrances so I naturally tend to lean more towards sweeter scents, so this perfume was an instant addiction. I would have to say that the top note is my favorite, however you smell absolutely irresistible with this on. I haven&#x27;t stopped recieving compliments about it, from men and women. It&#x27;s the only fragrance I&#x27;m wearing right now since I like going through  perfume phases, where I&#x27;ll wear one scent for a while until it runs out pretty much! I bought the perfume, body spray, hair spray, and body lotion. This stuff is great!</li>
            <li> Rich, sweet scent that smells like caramel and warm vanilla. This is not one of those cheap teen perfumes that fades away quickly. This fragrance lasts and a little goes a long way. I can&#x27;t wear the strong floral, heavy musky perfumes simply because they give me headaches, so Pink Sugar saved me from that. So glad I&#x27;ve finally found my signature scent. Thank you Aquolina!</li>
            <li> Obviously fragrance is a very personal matter. Because we all have our own personal body chemistry, one fragrance can smell quite different on various people. For that reason, I am not going to urge you to buy Pink Sugar. I can only say that I love this fragrance! I first smelled it at a Sephora store some time ago and I could not get the scent out of my mind. I finally bought some and I love it so much I am now on my second bottle. I pretty much wear it daily. I find it hard to categorize. When you first put it on it does smell like a mix of cotton candy and vanilla, but as the day goes on the smell deepens. It is actually a very complex scent and it is really hard to describe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely adore this fragrance - but will you? The best thing to do is to go to a Sephora or Ulta store and try it. Obviously lots of people love Pink Sugar and maybe you will as well.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!!! It is a mixture of vanilla, cotton candy and marshmallows. Every time I walk by, someone comments on how yummy and delicious I smell. The perfume is amazing and reasonably priced. Pair with the body lotion and you are set. My new signature scent.</li>
            <li> I luv this perfume. It is my all time fave. I get many compliments on it. And to get this size for so cheap was awesome!</li>
            <li> It is very nice producte and I wish to deal with this seller again. Best of luck for all</li>
            <li> Love...Love....love!!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a Perfume Enthusiast, i collect perfumes. I read all the bad reviews about how its fake, or its generic. I was Skeptical as it was being shipped to my house hoping i didnt get ripped off. But im happy to say, Its completely authentic ! the smell is exactly on point to the original. To all of those that says it smells different. Very fast shipping also! Yay Pink Sugar!</li>
            <li> This is my signature fragance.  I wear it all the time.  I will continue to order this as I use it.</li>
            <li> This is the only perfume for me!  I have a sensitive nose and can only were certain, light perfumes.  Every time I wear this I get compliments in the office. I smell cotton candy, however, on occasion, I have been told by the male persuasion that it smells like chocolote...what?! Anyhow, have been using this perfume exclusively for 2 years now.  Product was received on time and in excellent condition!</li>
            <li> Itsnanclean pure smell. No alcohol smell for me like another buyer spoke about. I love this perfume. The size was large also so it will last a while.</li>
            <li> Great item, as described; prompt delivery; highly recommend this seller.</li>
            <li> I had heard LOTS of great things about this perfume, and its sweet sugary scent. I wanted it so badly but I decided to look for the fragrance in the stores around the mall. A 1 ounce bottle was $40.00, and I right away knew that it would be cheaper online. Here on amazon, it is bigger and for a CHEAPER price. Well anyways, the perfume is perfect! I use it mostly during the morning and afternoon, since it is a perky, and cupcake type of smell. It is probably the perfume that I throw in my bag the most on the way to school. If you spray generous amounts daily it will last you months.</li>
            <li> My wife had been using Dark Vanilla for years,and it seems to be unavailable&lt;br /&gt;in my dentists&#x27; office I smelled a similar perfume and questioned the woman&lt;br /&gt;and found it to be Pink Sugar,we purchased same and are very pleased with this&lt;br /&gt;Eau de Toilette</li>
            <li> To put my review in context, I am not a fan of musks (ex. \\&quot;Carolina Herrera\\&quot;) or the classics that other women seem to enjoy (ex. \\&quot;Chanel No. 5\\&quot;, \\&quot;Mitsouko\\&quot;).  And the perfumes that I love (ex. \\&quot;Ciara\\&quot;, \\&quot;Norell\\&quot;, and Victoria&#x27;s Secret \\&quot;Rapture\\&quot;) smell great on other women, but turn into a sour stank on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and sweat and acidity can change the dominant notes.  On myself, this perfume smells like cotton candy initially, and then dries down to a vanilla/amber scent after about 30 minutes.  Any perfume can give people headaches or make them nauseous, particularly if the wearer works with chemotherapy patients, as I do.  So it&#x27;s best not to wear too much of this stuff, if any at all, to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has some real sillage -- my coworker could smell it from outside my office, and came in to ask me what I was wearing.  It also lasts a long time.  At the end of the day, my husband could smell it too, and although he doesn&#x27;t like many perfumes either, he said I smelled tasty.  Needless to say, I bought some.</li>
            <li> I am a mommy of three and was a bit worried that this scent would be too immature for me. It&#x27;s not. I absolutely LOVE it. I had read some other reviews saying that it is better suited for younger people. I think it all depends on the kind of scents you like and what your personal style is.I think it&#x27;s a lovely day time scent that is casual enough for me to wear every day. It reminds me of cotton candy and caramel. I love this scent after it has been on my skin for a while and has worn off a bit. It goes very nicely with my body chemistry. (I think perfumes smell a little different on everyone)My kiddos love it, as well...they think their mommy smells wonderful! :)</li>
            <li> This is what I am told I smell like when I wear my Pink Sugar.  If you are smelling too sweet, you may be putting on too much.  I agree with the spray in air and walk thru, but what I find is a good idea is after my shower, spray 2 spritz into my hand, add a good amount of  unscented, good quality lotion, rub of towel blotted skin.  it last all day, and I smell wonderful.  It has good staying power, and if you are flirty, it is the perfect scent to wear if you are 12 or 52!</li>
            <li> I ordered a Pink Sugar Tester spray thinking that for the fantastic price, it might just be a less than reputable product.  I was wrong.  The only thing different was that the bottle had no lid/cap.  It was labeled on the manufacturer label as a Tester, and it had full fragrance in a full bottle.  I was more than pleased because it was less than half the price!  Shipping was fast, too!  This was an A+ experience for me!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It has a very subtle sweet scent that guys love! It is very long lasting, so you don&#x27;t have to re-apply throughout the day. I have yet to meet someone who doesn&#x27;t enjoy the scent of Pink Sugar-- it is GREAT!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re not sure you&#x27;ll like it, try it at sephora or Ulta. If you like it, buy it here. It&#x27;s cheaper!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so noisy at the Fair and all your friends are there. -Neil Young&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent of Pink Sugar is like pure cotton candy straight from the County fairground. \\&quot;Pink Sugar\\&quot; is my signature fragrance. I keep a bottle of Pink Sugar in my purse at all times. It smells like cotton candy and reminds me of my childhood glory days at the County Fair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pink Sugar perfume smells just like sweet, fluffy, pink cotton candy and everyone LOVES it and asks me what perfume are you wearing? Seriously, guys, girls, young, old, dogs, cats, I mean everyone loves the scent and I get compliments daily. So why the hell would I not wear it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note- FYI 08/18/2011- I was concerned after reading a few reviews stating that this perfume is not the authentic Aquolina Pink Sugar perfume. I verified that the \\&quot;Pink Sugar\\&quot; perfume you and I order from Amazon.com is NOT \\&quot;fake\\&quot; and is authentic after conducting research. The new \\&quot;Pink Sugar\\&quot; perfume bottles do not say Aquolina on the bottle anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The parent company is called Selectiva S.P.A. and is printed on the bottom of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also know that Amazon.com would not jeopardize their legendary reputation by selling a knockoff or fake version of one of their best-selling perfumes.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on the 8th of June! I was supposed to receive it today, but I did not get anything. :( I want a refund!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed! I was sent a tester with no top on the perfume!! I can not believe this!! Very very disappointed!</li>
            <li> This perfume was $15.00 cheaper online then in stores. It smells just like liquid candy. I love it. Good amount of product for money.[[ASIN:B000C1Z1HE Pink Sugar by Aquolina for Women - 3.4 Ounce EDT Spray]]</li>
            <li> the bottle i bought from amazon was 2x as big and almost 1/2 the price of sephora!i love this scent- it is my favorite and it lasts.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best perfumes I&#x27;ve ever owned, and I own a LOT.  I tend to go for dark, musky, woodsy smells, but I was getting sick of those and wanted to branch out for something more unique.  This fit the bill perfectly!  Pink Sugar is the perfect name- it&#x27;s sweet and light in the beginning, much like cotton candy.  After a few hours, it fades in a very warm and yummy scent, like a mixture of brown sugar and vanilla.  I can smell this on myself all day long, which is a huge plus since other perfumes barely last an hour on me.  However, it&#x27;s not heavy at all, just very fresh and feminine.  I even spray this on my pillow before I go to sleep.  The bottle is huge, especially for the price that Amazon offered, but I have a feeling I&#x27;ll go through it fast with how much I love it.  I literally can&#x27;t get enough of how yummy and comforting it smells!  Definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> Rarely, if ever, do I care much about packaging, but Pink Sugar certainly is an exception. The cylender containing the perfume has textured, pink stripes on the top and sides-- stripes that are 3D &amp; you can feel the slight rubberiness touching them. The observant shopper will notice the hot pepper on the cylender label, indicating the spicy \\&quot;adult\\&quot; nature of this EDT. The top comes off easily, revealing a fragrance bottle wrapped with a piece of white cardboard to keep it safe. The cap of the perfume is frosted pink, with fuschia metallic ribbons on the cap and sides of the bottle. The packaging alone will definitely appeal to the kid in you. I will have a hard time throwing it away, if I do that at all. The fragrance itself is fantastic, starting off with that slightly peppery bergamot note on top of the sweetness, then dries to a powdery cotton candy finish after the pepper disappears. 2 hours after applying, it still retains that sweet note-- but not so sweet that it doesn&#x27;t have an uplifting, fresh feel to it. This is different from any other \\&quot;Oriental\\&quot; fragrance I have ever smelled, but gorgeous enough that I strongly recommend it to anyone who loves fragrances in that category, OR anyone who can&#x27;t decide between Earl Grey tea and a vanilla cappuccino in the morning. Definitely a fragrance that says that you are old enough to know better, but still too young to care (in a good way).</li>
            <li> Awesome perfume, delivered quickly, seller highly recommended! Thanks!</li>
            <li> I love this scent. Smells so clean and pure and like cookies!!!! I use it for a room spray too. Before I go to bed - I love the smell. It reminds me of making cookies with Mom.</li>
            <li> Popular scent, men love women who wear this. Maybe because it smells like cotton candy. My ex bought this for me come to think of it.  Just this afternoon, I got off the elevator at work walked into the conference room and a male co-worker 5 minutes behind me, followed the scent to where I was and complimented me on it. He literally was sniffing the air he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it, im pretty sure you&#x27;ll get the same responses too.. just dont spray TOO much.</li>
            <li> I love the way this smells, and its a long lasting fragrance that doesn&#x27;t cost a lot. If you like the smell of vanilla or freshly baked goods you will enjoy this sweet scent. I get tons of compliments when I wear it!</li>
            <li> it can be a little over whelming if you marinate yourself in it, i suggest spritzing some into the air and then walking into the scent, it is a nice fragrance to have on hand. very flirty, smells a bit like cotton candy :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. I&#x27;ve used it for a few years and it has a scent that almost everyone likes. It&#x27;s not overly sweet and lasts most of the day. I get so many compliments when I wear it</li>
            <li> This product was not the Pink Sugar I am use to. I was excited to get such a great price, but as the old saying goes, &amp;#34;you pay for what you get.&amp;#34; Very poor product.</li>
            <li> Smells great on other people... For some reason I think it smells kinda like licorice on me. But I still kinda like it. All my friends wear it.</li>
            <li> I bought the Pink Sugar EDT Spray because I just love it!! This is the second time I order it through Amazon and couldn&#x27;t be happier. The scent is so nice...sweet, almost smells like cotton candy, vanilla-ish and not over bearing. I get compliments from people all the time and they ask what perfume I&#x27;m wearing. Ladies...guys love the scent! My boyfriend loooooves it! I want to get the body cream next. :)</li>
            <li> I love this perfume.  it is never over powering.  I get compliments all the time about how good it smells</li>
            <li> It is the real perfume, but its a tester without the cap or the box...just be warned of that, but it smells good and was shipped very quickly!</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is a wonderful scent. I have received many compliments on this fragrance. Its not a strong scent nor is it perfumey. It is however a sweet scent. Everyone i know that has this fragrance loves it. At this price $32.14 for 3.4 oz spray you cannot find it cheaper anywhere else and free shipping on top of that. I say buy it you cannot go wrong!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume - was a little bit hesitant to purchase through Amazon, as I wasn&#x27;t sure this would be the &amp;#34;real thing.&amp;#34;  I am happy to say it was, and the perfume smells absolutely wonderful!  Will buy again through Amazon.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is the best perfume I have ever used! It&#x27;s light enough to not overwhelm, but has just the right amount of feminine fragrance to get noticed! It has a sweet, yet clean scent that is AMAZING!!!</li>
            <li> This is the first time that I have bought something from Amazon. It came quickly and was in perfect condition. Pink Sugar was recommended to me from a friend of mine and is now the only thing that I wear. I love it because it&#x27;s not a strong perfume and it last&#x27;s all day.</li>
            <li> When I first heard about Pink Sugar a few years ago, I never expected that I would jump on the bandwagon.  I don&#x27;t like foody scents, generally, and I couldn&#x27;t imagine wanting to smell like caramel and cotton candy.  But here I am, having just invested in the perfume.  It&#x27;s not really worth describing the scent- so many people are familiar with it, and so many others have done so.  In short, it is the cotton-candy/caramel that everyone describes, and it has a slightly burnt-sugar scent to it.  Why do I like it?  It&#x27;s more sweet and sugary than foody.  There&#x27;s a difference between smelling like sugar and smelling like baked goods, and this is definitely a sugar scent.  It&#x27;s also a happy, calming, girly scent.  It&#x27;s very much a \\&quot;pink\\&quot; scent.  After a bit of wear I can almost smell strawberry in it.  It&#x27;s also extremely reasonably priced for perfume.</li>
            <li> It came before it&#x27;s ship date and it is what I expected. I love this perfume it smells like cotton candy</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume! I smelled it on someone and had to have it. If you like soft, warm scents, you will love this perfume. Exactly what I wanted, I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells just like cotton candy! It smells great and I use it every day. My boyfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> I love pink sugar, it&#x27;s a light sweet scent. It&#x27;s great for everyday wear, as it is also very affordable. The product was nicely packaged and I received in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Great price compared to other places. One of my fave perfumes</li>
            <li> I get a lot of compliments on this product... I LOVE THE WAY THIS SMELLS!!!&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST PERFUMES I OWN</li>
            <li> Its an okay perfume very sweet but maybe a little too much for my liking . I guess it for people who really like sweet&amp;sugary scents . Also the packaging was a bit disappointing, no cap/container was there and I wasn&#x27;t informed about the beforehand.Overall, it&#x27;s ok for the price I payed($23) but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying a second bottle .</li>
            <li> Smelled better on my friend that it did when I bought it and used it.  My hubby hates it so I don&#x27;t really get to wear it.  Feel like I wasted my money.  Bummer.</li>
            <li> I was scared it would not smell like the real deal, but it does and it in quite large, true to there word.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, beautiful, sexy, romantic.. flawless.. best money I ever spent.&lt;br /&gt;Makes you feel quite sexy and men notice it right away.</li>
            <li> Very soft, sweet brings out the playful side in you! In a good way. Not kiddie candy smell but a sweet sweet smell that you would have experience yourself to understand. Never met a person that hasn&#x27;t liked it yet !</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how much I love the scent of this perfume!  I first came across it in an upscale cosmetic store.  I wasn&#x27;t familiar with the product and didn&#x27;t know if it would last an hour or all day.  The price was not inexpensive so I didn&#x27;t purchase it that day.  I couldn&#x27;t get that scent out of my mind and I really wanted to try it so I looked it up on Amazon.  I found it, the price was considerably less so I gave it a try.  I have now purchased a second bottle as well as the cream mousse perfume.</li>
            <li> I had a problem with my purchase and thought that since it was done online like some places that was that. I sent an email back to them (from work)and I explained what happen to my order. By that morning (get off work at 7am) around 8:30am someone from the company called and promise to correct my order. Less than a week later I had my order and was very happy with my purchase.I would make another purchase from AAA Perfume Merchants again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let the name fool you.  This is a soft, sweet, lovely fragrance and not that sickening sweet, candy like smell.  Everyone loves it when I wear it and it does last a long time.  Once it dries down, it takes on a different scent, more like a warm vanilla. It&#x27;s just wonderful and I feel so pretty and girly when I wear it.</li>
            <li> A gift for my sister. She is absolutely in love with the Aquolina products, from the lip gloss to the perfumes...as am I!&lt;br /&gt;Light and summery</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what people always say when they walk by my desk at work. When I tell them it&#x27;s my perfume, they are in disbelief that perfume could smell deliciously like pastries.  Men and women compliment me all the time, and tell me the scent is sweet but mature.  I am on my second bottle of this scent and plan to purchase the entire Pink Sugar collection.  Next on my list is Chocolate Lovers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m Absolutely in LOVE with this scent! It is now my signature scent.. Everyone comments on how amazing i smell :) I always feel so confident in this scent and love the attention my boyfriend gives me when i wear it heheh Such a perfect smell AND the Price is Perfect!! &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> Real stuff. Girl Friend loved it</li>
            <li> I love this perfume. Smells great. Only problem was when I received it, the bottle was leaking</li>
            <li> Im an idiot for buying a perfume without smelling it. Smells cheap and too young for me. Probably good for a teenager. Has like a caramel/cotton candy smell.</li>
            <li> The product sent was a tester bottle.This was really not a problem but was not really specified.  Other then this the product was satisfactory. The other issue is the lenghty shipping time was almost 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I got the right one now so I&#x27;m satisfy</li>
            <li> When I first tried Pink Sugar I was disappointed. All I could smell was liquorice and alcohol mixed with cotton candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, after using it a few times I noticed caramel, lots of it. Which I love. And the liquorice became sweet and pleasant. I actually started to like it. And then love it.&lt;br /&gt;I was a hater, and now it&#x27;s one of my favorite gourmands. I am sooo happy I gave it a chance and didn&#x27;t just get rid of it. I would have been missing out.</li>
            <li> its a knock off.  what i received is not what is advertised...looks similar but definutely different. its awaste of money!!!!!</li>
            <li> This smells so delicious for quite awhile!</li>
            <li> Bought for a friend&#x27;s birthday, she absolutely adored it. Cute packaging. A heavily sweet/musk smell, definitely has vanilla and sugar, kinda like perfumed cotton candy and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I read a good but of the reviews on here about this particular sellers product and some (not many but some) said that this was absolutely not the same as the product sold in Sephora. Well I&#x27;m not sure what they got in the mail, and they may have gotten something faulty, but what I got was the real deal. I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for years, religiously but the price has always been so high so obviously I jumped at the opportunity to get in on here for so cheap! And what I got was the exact same as what I&#x27;ve been using from Sephora, from the smell down to the bottle and casing. It was absolutely perfect!</li>
            <li> I guess I should never listen to other people when it comes to perfume without smelling it. Sooooooooooooo many beauty gurus on Youtube said how good this smelled. They all said it smelled like a combo of cotton candy &amp; sugar. I wore it once &amp; it was so nauseating &amp; I hated it!!!! No returns on it either. Smell it in the store before you buy it. To me it smells just like Vanilla perfume and I hate the smell of Vanilla perfume, but if you like that smell than buy it because you will probably like it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so good my bottle mysteriously disappeared at my wedding while I was getting ready. It has an amazing smell and its the only perfume I always use the whole bottle. Light, sugary... my coworker thought I had been eating sugar cookies.</li>
            <li> Has a great candy sweet medium weight scent without being over powering, men always compliment me on this.  I purchased it with the Pink Sugar moisturizer and together they have a great long lasting layering effect.</li>
            <li> This will always be one of my favorite perfumes! It smells just as the name suggests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is sweet and strong but not too overpowering. Occasionally, it&#x27;ll get someone to pause in their tracks when I walk by! (The few instances it is have been positive experiences ;P )</li>
            <li> I have had this perfume before and love it.  This was a great purchase!  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find it on-line.</li>
            <li> If you love sweets smells with the hint of candy and fruit scents then Pink Sugar is diffentently for you.</li>
            <li> I always get compliments about this fragrance and it&#x27;s my favorite.  The vendor was prompt on delivery and there were no problems at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift idea for a female friend who thoroughly liked the scent and this was an immediate approval of its rating, on amazon, as a great scent for women. It is a lightly scented long lasting perfume with a hint of a sweet sugary vanilla mixture and definitely captivated my attention when it was applied (as it lingered in the air)and also later when it also simmered down to its under-lying notes of vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great buy, for any female, as a gift idea.</li>
            <li> Love love this perfume!!! Smells like cotton candy and my hubby loves it!!!&lt;br /&gt;Lots of complements from men too!!!</li>
            <li> Amazing, sweet, sexy, flirty. Its the perfect sweet feminine perfume. And you can&#x27;t beat the price. I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments!!&lt;br /&gt;My new go to perfume.</li>
            <li> I loved this at first for winter - the licorice and warm vanilla smells are great for the cold Boston winters.  Summers, not so much.... it&#x27;s a little over sweet and nauseating, and the licorice smell is suffocating.  My boyfriend even asked me if I left rotten cookies in the bedroom when i passed by...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent DEFINITELY Travels and everyone that comes into the office tells me it smells like vanilla.  Spritz lightly!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sixty and I love this fun perfume!  It&#x27;s sweet and flirty and just makes me feel good when I wear it and I get tons of compliments.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife for a Christmas gift, and she smells great when she wears it.  So yeah. Buy it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product.  It is not the real Pink Sugar.  It is a watered down rip off.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I love this perfume!  Every time I wear it I get tons of compliments.  It&#x27;s for women of all ages I&#x27;m 31. It is the real stuff not watered down so all you need is 2 sprays and it lasts all day.  It&#x27;s sweet like vanilla and cotton candy nothing like it.</li>
            <li> I love pink sugar Aqualina so I ordered it at a good price from Amazon. I noticed by the third day the spray pump was mal-functioning and it does not spray properly. Well, that was a waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;Again - the product if working properly is awesome. This was my first and only issue with buying something through Amazon.</li>
            <li> This has a cotton candy smell. It&#x27;s good to wear when you want to feel fun and flirty. I get a lot of compliments when I wear this.</li>
            <li> I found Pink Sugar when I was in Paris shopping and fell in love with it!  I didn&#x27;t want to spend the money then, but when I got home I found it through Amazon and I am thrilled!</li>
            <li> This smells exactly like the real perfume, both me and my girlfriend love it!!  I would recommend this to friends.</li>
            <li> If you like Cotton Candy, you&#x27;ll love this perfume.....I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years and still absolutely love it!  Wouldn&#x27;t wear anything else.</li>
            <li> I love it , it smells nice and sugary. The only thing is that the scent isn&#x27;t long lasting. That&#x27;s all</li>
            <li> UMMM.... i paid $20 for a tester someone STOLE. The bottle literally has a tester sticker on it.&lt;br /&gt;I am not happy!</li>
            <li> This was a great deal, shipping was fast and it came perfectly packaged. Wonderful smell that would be nice on any person of any age as long as you are a girl and not a guy! LOL</li>
            <li> I bought this Perfume back in January, the reason why I gave this a 4 star was because my perfume was actually a tester with no cap. I was disappointed but I got that over with. This is sweet, overpowering sweet so if you&#x27;re not a fan of Cotton Candy, then this isn&#x27;t for you. It&#x27;s a good one though, if you&#x27;re a teen like me. Or maybe a young adult. Though my grandma loves this (; xx</li>
            <li> My sister was visiting for a couple of minutes, and when she left I walked into the room she had been in and smelled the most amazing perfume. I called her right away to ask what it was and she said it was Pink Sugar, so I ordered some for myself and oh my does it smell amazing! It is not overpowering or sickly sweet, and people who are VERY picky about perfume said they like it. I love it so much that I sometimes put some on before I go to bed so I can smell it while I go to sleep! It comes in a much larger bottle than expected, even though I use it a lot I can see this easily lasting me two years. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is a really pleasant and sweet scent.  If you are looking to surprise your special one with a new scent, it&#x27;s a safe bet she will really like Pink Sugar.  Though, not a scent I&#x27;d recommend for an older gal - really more appropriate for a pre-40 woman.  Also, I would recommend the entire product line to complete the scent assembly.</li>
            <li> If you love the scent of COTTON CANDY, you will love this. It really does smell like Pink Sugar with a touch of vanilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I put on a sample secretly and then walked around the house when company was over, just to see what kind of reaction I would get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two people immediately said\\&quot; What smells like Cotton Candy?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People have told me it is a happy,sweet smell- not gaggy. They said it has a softness to it- not overpowering at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then again- watch how you apply this. Overkill of any scent can turn people off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would give it 5 stars if the staying power was a bit stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can smell this through out the day, it just gets more muted as the day wears on.  This is a terrific perfume for a reasonable price. Not everyone can pay 80.00 and up for an ounce.</li>
            <li> I really like this smell!  Before I bought this, I didn&#x27;t usually wear perfume, but now, I make sure to always spritz some on!!  Smells like an adult version of toasted marshmallows!</li>
            <li> The product itself is pretty good. But I had to wait for a long time to get the package. This is supposed to be an Amazon Prime qualified product and I am supposed to get it in 2-3 days, but I ended up waiting for an additional week. I received no explanation of the delay from the seller either.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this fragrance at all. Based on the the description and name of this perfume, I expected it to smell sweet, fruity and fun. It was none of those things. In fact, my husband thought it smelled like \\&quot;old people and baby powder.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who wants to smell like that?</li>
            <li> This product was to be Pink Sugar by Aquolina.  The product I received was called Pink Sugar but it definetely was not by Aquolina.  It is a fake/fraud product.  Not made by the actual company Aquolina.  Looks like the product but is missing the key company name and the fragrance smells nothing like the actual product.  I&#x27;m returning this product.  I&#x27;m glad I had the original to compare it too.  Was very disappointed I didn&#x27;t receive the authentic fragrence and have to go through all the trouble to return it then re-order the true product.....hopefully....</li>
            <li> I have tried many designer brands in the past. This is the ONLY one I have ever gotten continuous excellent comments on. From the youngest to the oldest. Love love love this perfume. It has become my signature scent. Will ALWAYS buy it!</li>
            <li> Smile lovely, great one to be gifted. I like it. You&#x27;ll feel elegant. I recommend it for any one .</li>
            <li> fantastic embraceable sexy sent and everyone always wants to know what it is. This product last for hours and I would recommend to everyone.</li>
            <li> I cant believe how fast I received this, My daughter put this on her Christmas list, I just happened to find on Amazon, I am so amazed by great deal as well as quick ship. Thanks</li>
            <li> Unbelievable service and always a smooth shopping experience ..&lt;br /&gt;Amazon always does it right and with the wide selection of product and low prices there&#x27;s no reason why amazon shouldn&#x27;t be the go to choice every time</li>
            <li> First of all, everyone has a different body chemistry. I don&#x27;t suggest you buy this product blind. Go into a store, and use a Tester. I tried it on at Sephora. I loved it! Try it on first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, this isn&#x27;t a little girl&#x27;s scent on me! It starts out citrusy, for a few minutes and then the floral notes come out to play. The citrus fades away and the red fruit comes out to mix with the florals turning it into a wonderful and sweet scent. Everything blends together so well that I can&#x27;t even describe what it smells like, but it&#x27;s delicious! The cotton candy finally comes out on top of the scent, but that doesn&#x27;t make it any less beautiful, it still smells like something a strong, powerful, sexy woman would wear. Eventually the floral scent becomes kinda powdery. The powder, red fruit, and cotton candy is such a lovely scent. It&#x27;s not overpowering to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cotton Candy is my favorite scent, and normally I would mind it being mixed with other things... not this time! This scent is now my signature scent. I&#x27;ve got severe allergies, and it doesn&#x27;t cause me any problems with them. I&#x27;m so happy with Pink Sugar! No burnt notes for me, it&#x27;s not so sweet it&#x27;s sickening, it&#x27;s just incredibly beautiful. I expect my man to pull me into his arms and take a good long sniff when he smells me wearing this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t do a test sniff, and don&#x27;t like it, try just dabbing a little on. Or try it at a different time. Your body chemistry changes at different times. This scent is worth a second chance. And if all else fails? You could give it to someone else. There are plenty of pink sugar lovers out there.</li>
            <li> I got compliments at work for smelling like candy while walking around haha~ great stuff! One of the guys said I was like a &amp;#34;walking jolly rancher&amp;#34; and it made me smile for the rest of the day. Highly recommended if you enjoy smelling like candy and vanilla~</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure of purchasing this. I was thinking it would probably get people annoyed or me dizzy. Not at all. Though it is a strong sugary smell, I love it! It lasts all day and I get lots of compliments on it! People always ask me what I do to always smell like cotton candy.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the wonderful reviews I decided to try this while at Ulta. What really struck me was the plasticky smell that hung around for a good two hours. I think I am also allergic because I got a pretty bad headache. My 10 year old son, my husband and mother-in-law and I all thought it smelled pretty awful. Maybe we just have different tastes. After a bit of time, what was left was a soft cotton candy type smell. Okay smelling when it finally died down, but for obvious reasons, I won&#x27;t be purchasing pink sugar.</li>
            <li> Smells like strong alcohol/chemicals.</li>
            <li> It worked.  When I wore it the guy who gave me a hug said I smelled really good.  It definitely does have a first, initial smell and a second smell, and the second smell, which lasts, is really good. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Others reported it was not the real thing or was not packaged in the proper packaging that was NOT TRUE for me. This was just as I expected (packaging, smell, size) were all CORRECT! I am VERY SATISFIED!</li>
            <li> girlfriend love it and great speed when sent!</li>
            <li> FAKE! Smells horrible. Very upset about this purchase. Been wearing pink sugar for years and this is not it.</li>
            <li> GAVE AS A GIFT TO A TEENAGE GIRL. I BELIEVE SHE LIKED IT VERY MUCH.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!!! I have been wearing it for years. It makes me so happy! I wish the scent would last longer though.</li>
            <li> MEN AND WOMEN love the smell of this perfume, there are compliments every time I wear it...The packaging container is adorable as well.....you cannot go wrong with this selection....</li>
            <li> I LOVE this EDT spray!  I found a bottle at a Florida flea market and have been ordering bottles from Amazon ever since!  I hope it never gets discontinued!</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s just say it was very appreciated and I was well awarded !Thank You!!</li>
            <li> I love Pink Sugar! I was so happy to see it on Amazon for this great price!! love love love it! It was shipped to me super fast that is always great.. I will order again once I run out.. Thank You Thank You :) My friends all love the smell on me. Even guy friends will comment and say mmmm what is that sweet smell.. One of our guy friends says it is the perfect smell not to strong and not fake sweet smell. My husband also like it and he hates I mean HATES smells of any kind!</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for y daughter. She uses this product all the time</li>
            <li> Is okay.make me headache though.to strong for me</li>
            <li> this perfume smells so good....this is the first perfume i have bought that my sons father really liked...n he NEVER likes my perfume selections....it has good staying power and smells great....</li>
            <li> Way to strong seems like it has been siting around for a long time wife was not happy so went to rite aid spent the extra money and now shes happy</li>
            <li> Thumbs up!!! I definitely will recommend this to everyone.....Not only on the speedy shipping but I really love this purfume. I will definitely ordering again soon.</li>
            <li> I like the fragrance on my wife. Being sweet it&#x27;s probably best avoided in humid summer weather as it can become a bit sickly.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments on this scent.  I hate to even tell people what it is because I like how unique it is on me!  I hope this product is never discontinued because I love it.  It is the perfect mix of soft, pleasant scents without all the floral scents and though others may disagree, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s youthful at all.  What woman wouldn&#x27;t want to smell edibile yet sophisticated at the same time?  Then again, what do I know. &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This is a super sweet scent that reminds me of something that girls under 20 would wear (which could be a good or bad thing). I&#x27;m in my late 20s but use this fragrance whenever I&#x27;m feeling playful and young. It&#x27;s definitely not the most sophisticated fragrance in my collection, but on some days when the mood is right I love using Pink Sugar. It smells like cotton candy and first but once that initial scent wears off, it smells like caramel and vanilla and baby powdery. It smells the best 3-4 hours after application on my body.</li>
            <li> For the negative reviewers who think their products are knockoffs because the bottle doesn&#x27;t say Aquolina: I went to Sephora today. The bottles of EDT &amp; hair perfume there did not say Aquolina. Just Pink Sugar. The pics on Sephora&#x27;s website are outdated. The bottles that don&#x27;t say Aquolina are the most current version of this product.</li>
            <li> this is the best scent EVER. its sweet, and heavenly..not heavy at all,,. it doesnt smell all perfumy more of a sweet clean candy smell..its delicious but mature not kiddie like some cheap walmart perfume. its great. and sexy.....YOUR MAN WILL LOVE IT</li>
            <li> This stuff smells amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it forever, and a few of my coworkers from my last job used it too. It&#x27;s light and sweet and absolutely wonderful. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Same on this product it&#x27;s not the true Aquolina brand it doesnt have the name on the bottle and it wears off in an hour the real one last all day.  Also the bottle leaks from the top it drips all over the place soo much wasted product there is more on my vanity than myself.</li>
            <li> Men love when I wear this and can&#x27;t comment enough on how much they love it.  I only use on special occasions.</li>
            <li> I have bought this product at a store and it was triple the price. I thought I would try and it from here and I am very satisfied with the product and the price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this fragrance from Sephora&#x27;s website because I needed something more playful and youthful than my other scents. When it arrived and I sprayed it, I was a little disappointed that the perfume smells EXACTLY like the Cotton Candy Fantasy spray that one could purchase at Rite Aid for $5. I am aware that this is supposed to smell like the treat; however, I thought that Aquolina would personalize this scent a little more. Perhaps a hint of cotton candy surrounded by notes of vanilla would have done the trick. Nonetheless, I still enjoy wearing this to casual events, as it is appealing.</li>
            <li> This perfume smells amazing as everyone else has said. I get lots of compliments and my husband loves this fragrance. The bottle is beautiful and BIG! you get alot for the price so its def worth it! :) try the butter that goes with it.</li>
            <li> First, I&#x27;d like to say that I have loved this perfume for years and couldn&#x27;t have been more excited to get it at such a great price. Second, I have to give big ups to the seller because I received this perfume in the mail very quickly- within a day and a half! Amazing! I never review my Amazon purchases, but I had to praise the seller on this one since my experience overall was fantastic!</li>
            <li> A long time favorite, it&#x27;s sweet and smells delicious. This was a great price for a large bottle and it came very quickly.</li>
            <li> Wonderful scent. Smells different on different people. Reached my house in 10 days. Very affordable compared to other perfumes out there. I love the sugar and candy notes.</li>
            <li> Pink Sugar is perfect for teens, nice and sweet perfume. Pink Sugar is a fresh smell of cotton candy, perfect for parties, and I am 14 and I highly reccomend to all teens and friends, This perfume will leave you a beautiful splash of cotton candy all day</li>
            <li> i love this scent, it smells amazing like cotton candy but more sophisticated, not like a bubblegum barbie perfume. i got so many compliments from this perfume. men love it, like they say men love perfume that smells like you can eat it. that&#x27;s this to the tee! recommended!</li>
            <li> was the most inexpensive plce to purchase this purfume. Will shop on line more frequently for big savings all the time!</li>
            <li> Love this sent. Good price.  Smells like cotton candy. One of my favorites of all time fragrance. Hard to find in stores</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my daughter in college. She loves it! It arrived so quickly. I couldn&#x27;t believe it got here so fast. This is a great fragrance that young women will love.</li>
            <li> Just what the wife wanted. She says people are always asking what she has on, and saying they love it.</li>
            <li> The only thing I smell is over powering black licorice. It makes me feel sick. I hate that smell. I thought it was going to smell like cotton candy, cookies and vanilla, like everybody keeps saying.</li>
            <li> absolutely my fav summer smell</li>
            <li> This perfume smells absolutely delightful! I get compliments everywhere I go!</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this perfume and its much cheaper buying it on Amazon rather than from Sephora! She re-buys this perfume all the time!</li>
            <li> Very good price for this perfume, It is alot more in store. It smells very sweet like cotton candy. It is not two strong everyone always complements me that I smell good enough to eat! Lasted the whole day so I know it is the real deal.</li>
            <li> Best price ever! I hope they never discontinue this perfume.</li>
            <li> Im not sure what happened but my perfume smells more of alchaol than anything, doesnt smell good. Is it possible its old? I dont know.....threw bottle away after giving it a week of daily use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard many good things about this fragrance &amp; (judging by the reviews) others seem to enjoy it as well; was really looking forward to this perfume until...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Pink Sugar&#x27; smells like you doused yourself in Cotton Candy!  I seriously gagged after spritzing this on :/  Because of the cotton candy smell, people have been comparing &#x27;Pink Sugar&#x27; to Britney Spears&#x27; &#x27;Fantasy&#x27; perfume.  I smell no resemblance between this &amp; &#x27;Fantasy&#x27;.  If you want to smell like you&#x27;ve just bathed in rancid, sickening sweetness, then by all means buy &#x27;Pink Sugar&#x27;.  But for me?  No thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Chloe</li>
            <li> LOVE this perfume! And love that amazon carries it!</li>
            <li> You Seriously smell like candy when you wear Pink Sugar!  I Love it, recommend it and will buy it again !!!!!!</li>
            <li> This has become my signature scent. I smell sweet like cotton candy, but it is not too overwhelming. The scent lasts all day, and my boyfriend loves the smell!</li>
            <li> I purchased a bottle of Pink Sugar several years ago from a department store.  It was nearly double the price of Amazon.  This fragrance reminds me of cotton candy.  It is a vanilla like sweet smell.  I got the large 3.4 oz bottle for only $25.  I would highly recommend this fragrance.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume,and great experiences with shipping etc</li>
            <li> I love this scent and don&#x27;t know why I waited so long to purchase this but once again AMAZON has great selection and I found this scent which I love and a little last all day!!!!</li>
            <li> It was not what was sent. Sensual pink sugar sent. Not the original. Doesn&#x27;t smell horrible but not what I wanted.</li>
            <li> I get so many compliments with this perfume and it&#x27;s not even expensive. It smells like cotton candy so don&#x27;t buy it unless you like a sweet smell. This is my 2nd bottle now.</li>
            <li> I spritz some on my dreadlocks and at the end of the day it still smells like I just put it on :) I&#x27;ve been told I smell like candy, vanilla and other times like cotton candy. It&#x27;s fun to wear, and my husband puts out every time I wear it! :D</li>
            <li> This is the first time I have purchased this perfume and I based it on others reviews. I am so glad I did. This perfume is fabulous. It is not too sweet and lasts a long time.  It is just delish!</li>
            <li> I have used this fragrance in the past, but bought at Sephora - not through this seller. I adored this perfume, but it was becoming too pricey. So I sought out to find a deal. &amp; I was led here. Everything seemed pretty legit, &amp; there were far more positive reviews than negative so I assumed I had finally found a solution. I opened the box &amp; packaging &amp; as others have said, AQUOLINA IS NOWHERE STATED ON THE CANISTER NOR BOTTLE. So immediately I became discouraged, thinking that I have been had. So the moment of truth ... I spritzed it on. Smelled identical to what I&#x27;m used to! It&#x27;s been about 30 minutes, &amp; I have been running around my home cleaning working up a sweat &amp; thus far reacts just as I remembered. If this is a knock off, well it&#x27;s a pretty damn good one. I am concerned about it&#x27;s shelf life, as I have read others complain how it&#x27;s crap after awhile. Would i suggest buying it overall? Sure  ... for a fraction of the cost of the legitimate one ($60) &amp; free shipping, why the hell not?</li>
            <li> GET MORE COMPLIMETS ON THIS THAN ALL MY OTHER PERFUMES, INCLUDING THE VERY EXPENSIVE ONES; WEAR IT ALL THE TIME</li>
            <li> Buying a perfume online, there is always a risk that you may no like it.  This is sweet, but not like the fruity gunk little girls spray on themselves.  It is more cookie than candy or bubble gum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have owned Pink Sugar before, you will not be disappointed.  We got it on amazon from \\&quot;Beauty Storage\\&quot; and I was a little hesitant to order online, as a few of the reviews I read indicated that that this was a fake.  The item we received sure seemed correct product and not a knock off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it smells the same as the last traces we had in another bottle.  The bottle has changed, but is the same as what is shown on the manufacturer&#x27;s website.  It arrived right on schedule, came in the standard packaging, and was in fine condition.  That plus it was cheaper than what we&#x27;d pay Retail, I could not be happier with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This perfum lasts ALLDAY! If you like smelling like candy and all sweet, this is a must have. I wear it in the afternoons and sometimes spray it on before bed, so that special someone cravesssssss me!!!! LOL</li>
            <li> Ordered the 3.4 oz size for $25, no tax, fast shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen some reviews that indicated this was not the real thing so I did a little research. I went to my local Ulta and checked out the bottle and scent. They were identical to the one I received and more than half the price. Retails for $60 for this size in stores. Not to mention the shipping was very fast despite the fact it was not prime eligible. Ordered it Wednesday and received it Saturday. I am satisfied with the product and seller.</li>
            <li> My body chemistry reacts badly with 99% of perfumes and colognes but this one is a perfect match! Love the sweet candy-like smell and it stays on, smelling good all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells so sweet that the almost invisible little sugar ants I&#x27;m trying to get rid of were actually drawn to it. Thanks to those who suggested spraying it in freshly-washed hair, my hair smells great too!</li>
            <li> The product came on time, and was at a cheaper price than usual. It smells great.  We are very happy with it.</li>
            <li> This was a gift for a family member. They loved it very much. Thank you. I just wish it came in a bigger bottle.</li>
            <li> I really like this scent. It is extremely sweet smelling (just like cotton candy). It lasts pretty long but does fade with time.</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter in law because she just loves the smell, she was very excited to get this and wears it all the time. Good price also.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love the smell bit strong at first spray, but when it settle so yummy.</li>
            <li> I gave this three stars bec ause I am torn. The bottle has 5inches of perfume. The first spray smelt like a mixture of alcohol and candy overpowering., it settled and the aroma of the alcohol smell had lessen quite abit. Really sweet perfume, almost sickening, spray in moderation. Not a grown woman scent, but I will use. Will not purchase again. Ok! After wearing for like six hours the scent has settle down enormously and not sickening sweet. It smells like sugar. Still wont purchase again though large bottle so it will be a long time before I finish it.</li>
            <li> This is the one and only perfume that I have ever re-purchased! It is definitely a sweet smelling perfume. The staying power is amazing. I usually wear it to work and will get compliments late into the day. It&#x27;s a combination of vanilla and caramel. You really can&#x27;t beat the price. Definitely worth trying out!</li>
            <li> I was a little worried this perfume would be too sweet smelling after reading some of the reviews. I decided to try it anyway. The scent is just wonderful! It is very clean smelling and not overpowering. I can even smell it on my clothes after a full day of wearing it. I will definitely buy this perfume again. It is my all time favorite. I purchased this through my husband&#x27;s account on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I ALWAYS get compliments on this when i wear it. It has a sweet smell, hard to describe, but its not a childish sweet... My husband has the coordinating fragrance for men and its just as delicious. Definately recommend!</li>
            <li> A bad gift for my wife, she don&#x27;t like it, she has used it as bathroom spray.</li>
            <li> love the aroma of it not too strong smell</li>
            <li> I read so many reviews before purchasing this product. I even watched youtube videos and decided that I had to have it. I heard it described as pure candy, cookies, and sugar. I sprayed it on and all I could smell was licorice. The smell was so strong and offensive that I was angry that I smelled it on my arm in the car on an hour long trip. I wished that I&#x27;d have taken a shower before leaving the house. It was so cloying and just nasty. I&#x27;ve never had that reaction to a scent before. I know everyone is different so let my mistake be a lesson! Try it on first Ladies!!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume! It&#x27;s a warm, sugary scent, reminiscent of cotton candy and vanilla. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s for everyone, but if you&#x27;re into that candy shop smell, this will fit the bill.</li>
            <li> I like this perfume, but I do not love it... yet. maybe with time? Smells very sweet and is different than what I would usually buy myself. I usually wear Clinique Happy Heart or Happy in Bloom. It smells good, but the first time I wore it I got a major headache from it. I know this is the real deal. It has all the same labels/names/packaging/appearance so I&#x27;m not sure what some of these other people got, but mine is the real deal so the price with shipping is a great deal. I haven&#x27;t worn it around anyone to see what anyone else thinks about it, so I&#x27;m hoping it will grow on me once I&#x27;ve worn it more and if it gets good reactions from other people, and I&#x27;m hoping if I apply less I won&#x27;t get such a bad headache. Overall I am happy with my purchase, arrived super quick and I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. It smells like cotton candy.</li>
            <li> This perfume is an A+. The smell is very sweet.  Feel very relaxed smelling like that.  The price is incredible.  The shipping was very, very fast.  I am totally satisfied with this product.  Totally buying it again in the future.</li>
            <li> I saw this same product on another website and the cost was much higher plus you had to pay shipping. Amazon offered it at a lower price with free shipping. Shipped quickly. Smells sooo good! Very satisfied</li>
            <li> I am so happy with my purchase of Pink Sugar. I read about how it smells and what notes it has and I liked everything mentioned. Well, it is everything I thought it might be!&lt;br /&gt;I do prefer vanilla-based oriental scents but with an edge and this is it! Pink Sugar has a sweety-spicy smell and it is perfect for an adult. I&#x27;m not too sure about young girls wearing it since it does have a sweet-sexy, alluring scent. A super value too ordering through Amazon!</li>
            <li> not only does this perfume smell amazing, but it literally lasts throughout my entire work day. at the end of the day people still ask me what perfume i&#x27;m wearing. this perfume def isn&#x27;t for you if you don&#x27;t like really sweet smells. it smells like cotton candy. everyone tells me i smells like sugar cookies. i have tons of perfume. marc jacobs,gucci,givenchey,ralph lauren,etc. this is my favorite and it&#x27;s and it&#x27;s cheap and it smells way better than the high end perfumes.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast delivery, exactly what we wanted.</li>
            <li> Smells delicious! If you like sweet fragances! This one will be perfect for you to wear! I receive lots of compliments everyday</li>
            <li> I just love the smell! Im on my second bottle. I will be buying more in the future I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Love this perfume! Smells like warm vanilla sugar. And good size bottle as well. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone who likes vanilla.</li>
            <li> I love Pink Sugar. It&#x27;s sweet and musky and just the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever worn. I get so many compliments when I wear it, from both men (especially) and women. I refuse to tell anyone WHAT perfume I&#x27;m wearing because it&#x27;s become my personal signature scent. Love, love, love!</li>
            <li> I got samples of this perfume when I was shopping at Sephora. This perfume sucks! It smells so cheap. I&#x27;m used to Chanel and Dior. That&#x27;s the only perfume that I wear. So this is a huge step down. I wore it once and the sample bottle stayed unused eversince. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it for my laundry. I dunno.&lt;br /&gt;But if you want a decent perfume, don&#x27;t buy this one.</li>
            <li> This is the real brand, full sized, packaged really well and smells fantastic.  Fast shipping too! Thanks.</li>
            <li> Smells like cotton candy and vanilla.  My daughters and I love it. We receive compliments all of the time.</li>
            <li> My favorite of all times, it is just like sugar and caramel; you want to eat it.</li>
            <li> When I hear Pink Sugar, I think sweet and delicious like cupcakes. I was expecting to smell like a bakery. Not a bathroom. This perfume smells like baby powder. I hate this scent. I bought it because I was looking for a sweet vanilla sugary smelling scent, this is not that.&lt;br /&gt;For people who do like the more powdery, clean, baby scent, this would be great. But this does NOT smell like sugar in any way.&lt;br /&gt;Not a sweet smell at all. I could not return either because it is a flammable product. I&#x27;m not very upset about that though, I&#x27;ll just give to someone as a Christmas gift what....&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, not what I wanted. That&#x27;s why I gave it 1 star.</li>
            <li> Smells like heaven. I love wearing this and so does my significant other. Such a sweet and sultry scent.</li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t wait to receive it. Used it the first morning. People around me said they couldn&#x27;t smell anything by the afternoon. I was told this is not the genuine product more than likely.</li>
            <li> When I wear this I always get compliments! I am a server/bartender so I wear this to have a light happy scent because this is most definitely a happy scent! (men love it too!)</li>
            <li> Okay. So im not sure how to rate this right now. Pink sugar is my absolute, hands down most favorite perfume in the world. I have ordered from this seller multiple times. Id say ive bought this perfume about 4 times from here. And every time Ive been pleased. The smell is out of this world. I get compliments everywhere I go. Its soft, sweet, rich, sometimes a little spicy. Perfect smell for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just recieved my bottle of Pink Sugar today and I noticed something was off right away. The spray top was different from the others i bought. And it doesnt unscrew like the others and its like glued to the bottle. I sprayed it and it smells right, but i just want to make sure i didnt recieve a bottle with something added to it. I guess you get what you paid for. But id rather not be lied to, ya know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, i attached a photo.</li>
            <li> I wear this perfume daily and get compliments all the time. Been buying it for 4 years and highly recommend it. It&#x27;s not overbearing and can be worn at work, at play or for going out. I can&#x27;t say enough about this product.</li>
            <li> i LOVE this perfume. It smells soo good! u get this lasting vanilla smell and it lasts for a very long time. as for those who say its too sweet smelling: ur buying a perfume called \\&quot;pink sugar\\&quot; lol what do you expect? will def. be repurchasing this if i run out!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome perfume.  Everybody compliments me on it.  This is the fourth bottle of this perfume that I have ordered.  You will not be disappointed with the purchase of this.</li>
            <li> Fabulous value on my signature cologne!!!  Just last night I was getting a pedicure and several of the ladies in the spa were&lt;br /&gt;saying...&amp;#34;what is that delicious frangrance?&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Loved it...EXACTLY what I wanted...service was fast and great!</li>
            <li> I love this perfume and have had many compliments.....After passing a family member or friend... &amp;#34;You smell so good!&amp;#34;  This is my very favorite perfume to put on in the morning.</li>
            <li> I get stopped all the time by men asking what fragrance I&#x27;m wearing. Shipping was fast and the product was just as described. The samples were a nice touch. I will purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is  a deliciously scented fragrance that leaves your senses as if lingering upon the pinkest sugary cotton candy cloud.......&amp;#60;3 it!!! You will not go wrong with this Pink Sugar.</li>
            <li> Smells like black licorice, vanilla and cherry. Long lasting. I inadvertently placed this review info with the Pink Sugar Sensual, which I also have. The Sensual is nice, lighter, with a slight spice to it, reminds me of Colors by Benetton that I used in the early 90s, very different from this Pink Sugar. Of the two I like this version most.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife after smelling it on a friends wife. It&#x27;s just a wonderful fragrance! My wife still smells of pink sugar when she gets home after work, so it does last quite a while. Buy it for your wife, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with this sellers price . For the same size bottle I would have payed double in the stores. I got to pay a lot less for my absolute favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> i though i would like it and i do but the smell is not that fantastic so make sure you know what it smells like before you buy it</li>
            <li> This is my one and only. Wherever I go, people always comment on how wonderful I smell. That is thanks to pink sugar. Who doesn&#x27;t like cotton candy smelling people?</li>
            <li> You really can&#x27;t go wrong with this scent. It was well worth it and the transaction was as smooth as can be! Amazon has done it again&lt;br /&gt;and the seller was accredited, so it means much more! The perfume lasts pretty much all day.  It gives a sweet/sexy smell and I&#x27;m sure&lt;br /&gt;you will (all) love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite fragrance hands down.  It has a sweet and soft scent that you will LOVE. Every time I wear it I receive so many compliments from both women and men.  This scent is great for all seasons so it&#x27;s definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the real deal. I have bought this perfume from pricey department stores like SEPHORA, and this one from this seller is the real deal. Same scent, same color liquid, same packaging, same everything. Only diff? Less than half the price here! Stock up ladies. This perfume is sooo fragrant, high quality, and real, just a dab and you smell the strength and real quality. You would be able to tell immediately if it was fake. I was skeptical for the price but it&#x27;s not fake! Just a great price! Woohoo! 😁 And if it was a fake (although I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s not) I wouldn&#x27;t care anyway cuz it&#x27;s the same...everything is the same! These ladies on here that are saying it&#x27;s fake and are spending 50 bucks more for the SAME perfume elsewhere are such fools. Haha. Buy this stuff, don&#x27;t be dumb. Then go buy yoself a nice pair of shoes with money you saved.</li>
            <li> This perfume is divine. My husband DOES NOT like perfume but he loves this. It seriously smells like Cotten Candy. Not to sweet at all. I get compliments whenever I wear it!</li>
            <li> One of my favorite perfume&#x27;s I love the cotton candy smell and it last for hours. I recommend this product to any female that love a sweet smell.</li>
            <li> I decided to give this pruduct a try because all the positive feedback it has but dear lord, for the first time in my life I should have stay with the negative one, it smells soooooo aweful, like burn cotton  candy or something, some of the reviews says that is a fake one and maybe it is because I can&#x27;t believe that all of these people can like such a horrible perfume. Everyone who smells it around me agree with my opinion, total waste of my money!</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price was right, Purchased 3 the price was so good.  Sweet without smelling like cotton candy</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this perfume. This has laster me years and I will continue to purchase when I run out. I always get compliments on the scent!</li>
            <li> this is one of my favorite scents and was priced more reasonably than other places where i have seen it on sale.</li>
            <li> I you like sweet sugary scents, than you are going to love Pink Sugar.  I get compliments every I go.  It reminds people of their childhood in the neighborhood candy store.  I use it after every workout at the gym.</li>
            <li> Fast, efficient, and reasonable price.  Good perfume at a good price.  New product, not a tester. 4 more words required</li>
            <li> Love pink sugar!! Cotton candy smell! Yummy!</li>
            <li> I wanted the package with the pepper on it like shown in the picture. When it came it was the one without the pepper. Its at The Rack for the same price.</li>
            <li> I get tons of compliments when I wear this perfume, which usually come in the form of &amp;#34;you smell sweet, like vanilla!&amp;#34; Great scent, not overpowering. Love it!</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have aquolina printed on the bottle. every bottle should have the name on it. so this one is a knock off forsure. they just good at imitating bestselling brands. i feel sorry for all those great reviews u may be getting something else rather than the real deal.</li>
            <li> My favorite perfume!! Nice sweet soft scent. Love it!!</li>
            <li> Love this sent. It sweet. kinda reminds me of cotton candy. Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> My sophomore daughter loves this and it made a perfect Christmas gift!  It smells great and appropriate for a high schooler!  (Not overly heavy and strong!)</li>
            <li> Ship great. Product problem, stuck to bottom of box. They replaced it, did not ask for rtn. of defective one.</li>
            <li> Smells good but this is a tester and nowhere in the description stated that this is a tester and i bought this as a gift! im so disappointed. took almost forever to reach also</li>
            <li> Great Price for this size bottle !!! excactly how discribed..Recieved very quickly... will order again when it comes time... thanks again</li>
            <li> The scent is Devine!&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately the scent is gone in &amp;#34;no time&amp;#34;,regardless of how much you apply.</li>
            <li> I just love the light, slightly sweet scent of Pink Sugar. I&#x27;ve had so many compliments on it from both men and women.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite perfume and I wear it all the time!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 39 and would recommend this to any girl at any age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice soft sweet (cotton candy) scent but I have heard that it doesn&#x27;t smell the same on everyone...&lt;br /&gt;When I wear it, people constantly tell me how good it smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prices on Amazon are hands down the best prices. Retail stores at the mall sell the 1.7oz for $60</li>
            <li> I have bought this perfume many times because it is my girlfriends favorite. but this is the best price I have ever found for this product.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes and I get sooooo many compliments on it! I purchased this for my friend at xmas since it was a great price and she loved it! I got the package when they stated it would be delived. Thank you for the great service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fan of pink sugar and my husband got me this gift for our wedding anniversary!! I love you Mr. Ellis Thanks!</li>
            <li> I wish I liked it as much. The pepper part of the scent is too strong for me. It kicks up my allergies. The scent itself would be better if this were not so prevalant.</li>
            <li> Ive been waiting to buy this perfume for the longest time. It stays on well and the smell is strong. Officially my favorite perfume.</li>
            <li> I feel like it&#x27;s not as strong as usual but I guess I could be imagining it.</li>
            <li> Best smelling stuff ever! I have received so many compliments on this smell! Ladies, if you want to smell edible, this is the stuff for you. Good quality. Smell is pretty long lasting. Great product for the price!</li>
            <li> Love this fragrance!!! very girly and sweet!! Your bottle will last for a while since you only need to spray a small amount and that&#x27;s it! It will last the whole day!! I recommend it for all of you who love vanilla and sweet scents.</li>
            <li> I love love love this perfum. It&#x27;s has such a great smell. I just hate that the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long. I have to keep on putting more perfume through out the day. With other perfumes, I spray some in the morning and will last me until the evening.</li>
            <li> Always get compliments</li>
            <li> This was a Christmas gift for my daughter, she loved it.</li>
            <li> I was so excited when i got back from our family trip and found Pink Sugar in the mail. Most people say it smells sweet and sugary but i get more of a sweet spicey smell. It was very cheap and not a knock off and the stain power is wonderful! If you want this perfume, u should go sample it at a store first but most people like the scent. I was shocked when i went to the store and found out that the full size was $60 . Thats insane. I got it from here for $25. It came very quick too.I really like this and its definitely one of my favorites.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a perfume to replace mine that had been discontinued. I first smelled this at Kohls, sprayed it onto one of those paper things and initially thought it smelled nice, but nothing special. After I left the store I noticed some of the spray had gotten on my hand, and I couldn&#x27;t stop sniffing it. To me the initial scent is sweet, almost citrusy but that quickly fades into a mix of warm sugary goodness. Like other reviewers the closest thing I&#x27;d probably liken it to is cotton candy with hints of vanilla. If you like smelling sweet and possibly edible, this is the scent for you. I always get compliments on it and people ask what scent I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
            <li> The packaging was brand new. Plus I got the bottle for a third of the price found in stores! Definitely where I&#x27;ll get my perfume in the future.</li>
            <li> While this fragrance certainly lasts a very long time (which is great!), the scent is just a tad too strong for me.  I think this scent is more for a teenager.</li>
            <li> I usually wear Givenchy but thought would try something cheaper,with the same scents I like,vanilla,etc. It smells cheap,it&#x27;s a wasted of money in the long run,bought my usual perfume anyway because this was unnacceptable</li>
            <li> Very good, my wife loves it.</li>
            <li> This smells so good! Everyone has compliments me when I wear this frangrance. It is light and stays on all day.</li>
            <li> You dont need to put a lot on just a little and the compliments come flocking. I love this stuff and always order it here, Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
