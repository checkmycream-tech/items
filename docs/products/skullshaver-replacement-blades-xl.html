            <li>I&#x27;m super happy with my Skull Shaver.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s pretty great.</li>
            <li>It was great for the first two shaves.</li>
            <li>Again worked great the first time.</li>
            <li>Much better than the one it comes with good clean shave</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just glad there are replacement parts for the Skullshaver.</li>
            <li>the rotary blades protector seems better.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>I am able to rinse them after each shave.</li>
            <li>I love this shaver</li>
            <li>works great and quick to clean.</li>
            <li>I got this as a Christmas gift and was glad that the replacement blades were purchased too.</li>
            <li>As a matter of fact I will need to get more.</li>
            <li>Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li>Just got the Skullshaver Replacement blades x1 and love it.</li>
            <li>when you order the replacement attachment - nake sure it&#x27;s the XI.</li>
            <li>Uses it 4 or more times a week to buzz his head.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>THEY ARE OK.</li>
            <li>THE TOP OF THE HEADS ARE PLASTIC, JUST MOVING THEM</li>
            <li>It will probably be a while before you need to replace the original blades on this amazing product....</li>
            <li>When you only have one skull shaver this is nice to have you can have your own attachment and its good for traveling</li>
            <li>The material is inferior and very easy breakable when trying to lift the cap to clean.  </li>
            <li>it is cheaply made but does the trick, it would be better made out of steel not plastic</li>
            <li>Love the close, comfortable shave.  </li>
            <li>The original product was ok.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Took the blade assembly off.&lt;br /&gt;Motor was running fine.</li>
            <li>great shave but one of the replacement blades doesn&#x27;t clip on securely &amp; the same noise</li>
            <li>Wish the free attachment for the review included the blades.</li>
            <li>these blades provide a comfortable shave,&lt;br /&gt;easy to change too.</li>
            <li>has started coming from the replacement blade just as it did with the oriblades in which one of the blades NO LONGER stayed SECURE &amp; EVENTUALLY BROKE</li>
            <li>quick and easy to change</li>
            <li>We used the original blade and this one as well and no difference.</li>
            <li>Used my original skull shaver with original blades for about 9 months, cleaning weekly.  </li>
            <li>Never happened on original blades.  </li>
            <li>It is much better than the blades that came with my first order</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never buy this type again&amp; will stick with the original design.</li>
            <li>When trying to remove the cap to clean, it broke off.  </li>
            <li>to clean.</li>
            <li>Clean again.</li>
            <li>Good for 1 1/2 shaves only, even when you clean it as directed.</li>
            <li>The fact that I am able to rinse it each time is very helpful.</li>
            <li>This really helps keeps my head clean and smooth.</li>
            <li>Really close and easy to move around the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Went</li>
            <li>I bought the Bald Eagle shaver and its the best money I have spent in a long time.</li>
            <li>I always soften my hair first with a hot towel to try to help, but it does not make a difference.</li>
            <li>This XI is the exact razor attachment that came with the Skullshaver I ordered, and the razor that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>first couple of times of use.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t get to run consistently afterwards.  </li>
            <li>I got these blades because I wanted and even better shave, smoother shave, than the standard ones that come with the Shull Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This was sent to me by the company as a freebie, and I really find the manufacturing far inferior to the original.  </li>
            <li>It is the same model as the original and is working fine so far.  </li>
            <li>of course tried the newly ordered XI right away and it worked perfectly.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like the way these blades do an extra fine job of shaving by head and face.</li>
            <li>The Skullshaver blades work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I spent 130 bucks on this shaver, these blade heads need to be built better.</li>
            <li>I have had the skull shaver for about 6 months, and I really like the product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great concept, but it&#x27;s poorly executed.</li>
            <li>No big deal, glad it wasn&#x27;t alive.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the deal is, but its not the same as the blades that came on the original unit.</li>
            <li>This actually feels more solid than the one that came with the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Even</li>
            <li>but this one really does the job, it shaves your skull with little effort and shaves your face in a very clean manor.</li>
            <li>up buying a high end Norelco.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend them</li>
            <li>Good concept but poor execution and quality.</li>
            <li>I ordered new head assembly and reread the cleaning instructions.</li>
            <li>Skull Shaver is like NEW after installing the replacement blade.  </li>
            <li>Still no go.&lt;br /&gt; Ordered this new replacement blade.</li>
            <li>Went to clean for first time and can&#x27;t get center head to go back on.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;These cut so close and clean when they are new and sharp.  </li>
            <li>The replacement blades also did not seem as sharp as the original nor shave as closely.</li>
            <li>Recently bought first replacement head.  </li>
            <li>old XI blade wore out and I needed a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blade assembly doesn&#x27;t lock to the motor unit so if I use the close shave hold (fingers directly atop the blade heads), the motor pops off.</li>
            <li>And now my shaver has lost all kinds of power and and will not cut through my day old hair since these have been installed.</li>
            <li>The Skullshaver breaks very easily, and these replacement blades are even worse.  </li>
            <li>This is a review of the Skullshaver in general that my wife purchased for me for Christmas.</li>
            <li>A bit loud as I think the gears inside the shaverhead and the actual shaver are not aligned correctly.</li>

            <li> A bit loud as I think the gears inside the shaverhead and the actual shaver are not aligned correctly.</li>
            <li> It simple does very poor job, not like the original one.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t need to clean the same every day, can be a little complicated the cleaning process, so I have couple of heads</li>
            <li> The other minor downside is the plastic cover does not stay covering the metal portion of the elements.  </li>
            <li> &amp; i had to use the Skullshaver with 3 blades instead of 4 blades,not the center blade</li>
            <li> Took center hub cap off.</li>
            <li> other than that i like my Skullshaver,just can&#x27;t figure out why this has happened to the origional blades &amp;</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through two shaver heads in less than five months.</li>
            <li> Blades are not great for coarse hair.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> There was a dead spider inside the plastic packaging when I got it.</li>
            <li> These plastic pieces broke on my shaver after a few months, so I reordered the piece you see here.  </li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I broke the razor attachment for my Skullshaver, so I ordered a replacement.</li>
            <li> Not sure how often they need to be changed.</li>
            <li> So, not sure on how well it will work but looking at it, seems alright.</li>
            <li> No more cuts and burns from razors electric or otherwise.</li>
            <li> Would have returned but was past the 30 day limit.&lt;br /&gt;Ended</li>
            <li> What sucks is that with only one of these, when it fails in the middle of a shave, you&#x27;re screwed, and you look like a moron for only shaving half your head!  </li>
            <li> The gears that run the cutting heads grind from the start, and eventually multiple heads don&#x27;t turn.  </li>
            <li> After using the shaver for a couple of months and cleaning it according to instructions the very small plastic retainer clips break off and the heads will not stay in place.</li>
            <li> Disappointed and considering just buying a regular 3 headed electric shaver.</li>
            <li> The shaver head is poorly built.</li>
            <li> Poorly made product.</li>
            <li> The heads are designed poorly.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, we have to buy the replacement blades as the gift can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> The blade heads break off randomly.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> It was very annoying.</li>

            <li> The shaver head is poorly built. After using the shaver for a couple of months and cleaning it according to instructions the very small plastic retainer clips break off and the heads will not stay in place. I ordered new head assembly and reread the cleaning instructions. Same results. A couple months and the clips broke again. I feel this a piece of junk I would not recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I bought the Bald Eagle shaver and its the best money I have spent in a long time. Great Job!</li>
            <li> Skull Shaver is like NEW after installing the replacement blade.  :)</li>
            <li> Blades are not great for coarse hair. They catch and the entire head freezes constantly. I always soften my hair first with a hot towel to try to help, but it does not make a difference. The replacement blades also did not seem as sharp as the original nor shave as closely. Disappointed and considering just buying a regular 3 headed electric shaver. Good concept but poor execution and quality. Also shaver does not hold a charge well nor have enough power.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband because he shaves his head daily. This does not work at all. Didn&#x27;t shave it one iota. We used the original blade and this one as well and no difference. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> It was what I wanted &amp; performed like I needed it to.</li>
            <li> Works fine. Not sure how often they need to be changed.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive but seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile. There was a dead spider inside the plastic packaging when I got it. No big deal, glad it wasn&#x27;t alive. Just shook it out and then gave it to my bf as a backup blade. Won&#x27;t be needing this blade for awhile though, hopefully. So, not sure on how well it will work but looking at it, seems alright. I&#x27;m just glad there are replacement parts for the Skullshaver.</li>
            <li> it is cheaply made but does the trick, it would be better made out of steel not plastic, i recommend buying extra&#x27;s</li>
            <li> quick and easy to change</li>
            <li> My Husband loves this shaver.</li>
            <li> My husband received a skull shaver as a gift.  When trying to remove the cap to clean, it broke off.  We have since, ordered three and returned three for the same reason.  The material is inferior and very easy breakable when trying to lift the cap to clean.  Unfortunately, we have to buy the replacement blades as the gift can&#x27;t be returned.</li>
            <li> This was sent to me by the company as a freebie, and I really find the manufacturing far inferior to the original.  What sucks is that with only one of these, when it fails in the middle of a shave, you&#x27;re screwed, and you look like a moron for only shaving half your head!  The original product was ok. but this is a downgrade.  Fix your manufacturing process!</li>
            <li> As described and great product.</li>
            <li> This actually feels more solid than the one that came with the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Even the rotary blades protector seems better.</li>
            <li> The Skullshaver blades work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My old XI blade wore out and I needed a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These cut so close and clean when they are new and sharp.  I love it</li>
            <li> These things suck! The blade assembly doesn&#x27;t lock to the motor unit so if I use the close shave hold (fingers directly atop the blade heads), the motor pops off. The gears in the heads grind and presumably some of the blades stop turning as the shave quality drops after two or three shaves. The blade heads break off randomly. I bought the two pack and just threw away one of the heads after only two shaves! I spent 130 bucks on this shaver, these blade heads need to be built better. If I could return the unit, I would.</li>
            <li> I have had the skull shaver for about 6 months, and I really like the product.  However, the clips that hold the shaving elements to the gears are just plastic.  These plastic pieces broke on my shaver after a few months, so I reordered the piece you see here.  It is the same model as the original and is working fine so far.  The other minor downside is the plastic cover does not stay covering the metal portion of the elements.  Any movement and the cover pops off, so this always happens when travelling.</li>
            <li> I truly like the five flexing blades. They feel real smooth on my skin. They do a great job. I am able to rinse them after each shave. I never have to open the shaver head assembly. There are a lot of hair after doing head and face. The fact that I am able to rinse it each time is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Not the best cut or build quality...</li>
            <li> When you only have one skull shaver this is nice to have you can have your own attachment and its good for traveling</li>
            <li> Good for 1 1/2 shaves only, even when you clean it as directed.</li>
            <li> So good .. I bought extra set so I don&#x27;t need to clean the same every day, can be a little complicated the cleaning process, so I have couple of heads and I use through the week ..  ( I use the shaver every day ).</li>
            <li> Very easy to change out!</li>
            <li> Close comfortable shave, awesome. I would recommend this product to anyone. I am a satisfied customer without a doubt !</li>
            <li> SHAVER DOES NOT SHAVE. SO I RETURNED THE REPLACEMENT BLADES.WITH THE &amp;#34;SKULL SHAVER&amp;#34; NO NEED FOR A REPLACEMENT BLADE KIT.</li>
            <li> Used my original skull shaver with original blades for about 9 months, cleaning weekly.  Works great.  Love the close, comfortable shave.  Recently bought first replacement head.  Went to clean for first time and can&#x27;t get center head to go back on.  Never happened on original blades.  Tried contacting seller through their website and through twitter - no response days after trying to make contact.  Disappointing.</li>
            <li> Much better than the one it comes with good clean shave I love this shaver works great and quick to clean.</li>
            <li> arrived DESTROYED, returned ASAP</li>
            <li> wonderful that there is repplacement blades and they are not too costly either.  They work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I got this as a Christmas gift and was glad that the replacement blades were purchased too. As a matter of fact I will need to get more. Wish the free attachment for the review included the blades. Thanks for a great product.</li>
            <li> The Skullshaver breaks very easily, and these replacement blades are even worse.  I think that next time I decide to get a head-shaving system, I&#x27;ll just get a caveman to make me a flint razor.</li>
            <li> these blades provide a comfortable shave,&lt;br /&gt;easy to change too.</li>
            <li> Poorly made product.I&#x27;ve gone through two shaver heads in less than five months. The prongs that hold in the individual outer heads are fragile.</li>
            <li> The heads are designed poorly.  The gears that run the cutting heads grind from the start, and eventually multiple heads don&#x27;t turn.  I&#x27;ve had 2 heads, and both of them stopped working within a couple of uses.  It&#x27;s a great concept, but it&#x27;s poorly executed.</li>
            <li> the product works.. i have  used electric shavers for years. but this one really does the job, it shaves your skull with little effort and shaves your face in a very clean manor.</li>
            <li> great shave but one of the replacement blades doesn&#x27;t clip on securely &amp; the same noise has started coming from the replacement blade just as it did with the oriblades in which one of the blades NO LONGER stayed SECURE &amp; EVENTUALLY BROKE &amp; i had to use the Skullshaver with 3 blades instead of 4 blades,not the center blade but one of the larger blades. other than that i like my Skullshaver,just can&#x27;t figure out why this has happened to the origional blades &amp; now its beginning to happen to the replacement blades</li>
            <li> Just got the Skullshaver Replacement blades x1 and love it. It is much better than the blades that came with my first order&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ron Carpenter</li>
            <li> It will probably be a while before you need to replace the original blades on this amazing product.... But, when it&#x27;s time to do so, this replacement set totally works!</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I broke the razor attachment for my Skullshaver, so I ordered a replacement. At the time I didn&#x27;t realize that there were 2 options and I didn&#x27;t order the XI, I believe it was the SL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First use and it was obviously not the same shave. The razor missed spots. It was very annoying. After using it for 2 weeks, I turned back to Amazon to find the XI. This XI is the exact razor attachment that came with the Skullshaver I ordered, and the razor that worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I of course tried the newly ordered XI right away and it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when you order the replacement attachment - nake sure it&#x27;s the XI.</li>
            <li> Razor blades work well first couple of times of use. But went downhill from there. I would not recommend this anyone!</li>
            <li> This is great!. I bought the skull shaver last year as a Christmas present for my husband. He loves it. Uses it 4 or more times a week to buzz his head. I just now had to get replacement blades. That&#x27;s pretty great. The price was great.</li>
            <li> It simple does very poor job, not like the original one. I&#x27;ll never buy this type again&amp; will stick with the original design.</li>
            <li> This really helps keeps my head clean and smooth. No more cuts and burns from razors electric or otherwise. Love it.</li>
            <li> The Skull Shaver System, is an excellent product. I will continue to use it as before.</li>
            <li> This is a review of the Skullshaver in general that my wife purchased for me for Christmas. I reallly wanted to like this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Great design. Inspirered me to shave my head. It was great for the first two shaves. Really close and easy to move around the scalp.&lt;br /&gt;Went to clean. Followed the directions to the tee. Couldn&#x27;t get to run consistently afterwards.  Would stop and start. Took the blade assembly off.&lt;br /&gt;Motor was running fine. Took center hub cap off. Cleaned. Still no go.&lt;br /&gt; Ordered this new replacement blade. Again worked great the first time. Clean again. Recharged. Again - Not running. I&#x27;ve had rotary Norelcos that&lt;br /&gt; didn&#x27;t have these issues. This shaver is too finicky. Build quality needs to be improved. Would have returned but was past the 30 day limit.&lt;br /&gt;Ended up buying a high end Norelco. Works excellent!</li>
            <li> Good replacement. A bit loud as I think the gears inside the shaverhead and the actual shaver are not aligned correctly.</li>
            <li> THEY ARE OK. THE TOP OF THE HEADS ARE PLASTIC, JUST MOVING THEM A BIT ONE OF THE HEADS FELL OFF. THEY POPED BACK ON BUT IF YOU ARE EXPECTING A SOLID PIECE THE ENTIRE SET UP FEEL LITE AND PLASTICY.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super happy with my Skull Shaver. I got these blades because I wanted and even better shave, smoother shave, than the standard ones that come with the Shull Shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way these blades do an extra fine job of shaving by head and face. HIGHLY recommend them</li>
            <li> Excellent price for a great shaver...</li>
            <li> So I ordered this as a replacement.....I don&#x27;t know what the deal is, but its not the same as the blades that came on the original unit. It looks cheaper and does not articulate as well as the orginal. And now my shaver has lost all kinds of power and and will not cut through my day old hair since these have been installed. I&#x27;ve since relegated this shaver to just a body trimmer and gone back to shaving my head.</li>
