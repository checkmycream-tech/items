            <li>I bought a pack of these to put in bridesmaids &amp;#34;oh sh!# kits&amp;#34; and everyone loved them-as did I!</li>

            <li>Love this product, beautiful color, and light..</li>
            <li>The best blotting paper I found so far!</li>
            <li>, it’s nice just being able to keep one in my desk at work, one in my car, and one in my bag.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best powder.</li>
            <li>I like the rose variety better because the powder on this tends to shake off easily.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone and if there were 10 stars on top</li>
            <li>I would definitely give this product a perfect 10!!!</li>
            <li>i still havent&#x27; found anything better than these.</li>
            <li>My wife says this is her favorite blotting paper.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I really love this product.</li>
            <li>They easily fit into your purse, and the powder side was so nice to blot up excess oil.</li>
            <li>Great, fast service.  </li>
            <li>Love tem.  </li>
            <li>Leave a lovely matte finish.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, I love these papers.</li>
            <li>I like the powder on the blotting paper since most sheets don&#x27;t have a translucent powder and also like the book they come in.  </li>
            <li>u will like this better.</li>
            <li>I was hoping for a more blotting effect.  </li>
            <li>So perfect for touchups through the day for someone with oily skin, especially in the warmer months.  </li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many powders on the market, including the famous brands available at the department store.</li>
            <li>Great for refreshing your face during any social setting.</li>
            <li>Fabulous for meetings.  </li>
            <li>decent product, but would be worlds better if they were twice the size and made with a more tear resistant paper.</li>
            <li>Same excellent product, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I have used the original one before.</li>
            <li>These were great to use beneath my bangs during dancing, and I also found them useful while traveling on long flights.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and was hoping these worked better than the clean&amp;clear/neutrogena sheets but</li>
            <li>None of them ever really made me happy because my shine comes back full force, my hands get greasy, and the sheets literally just blotted, but didn’t add anything to my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It mentions \\&quot;Rachel\\&quot; which means the color of the paper is beige, and not the powder, which is a mild translucent color.    </li>
            <li>Somebody is trying to make a quick buck from you by seling this product.</li>
            <li>If u are a super oily person like me</li>
            <li>Because these blotting papers are thicker, they instantly absorb and lift oil off the face and the powder on the paper leaves a nice matte finish.  </li>
            <li>The delivery from this company is also very fast</li>
            <li>These lasted a whole year!</li>
            <li>i first used these about twenty years ago when my grandmere sent them to me.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad I only bought one book rather than going for 12 as I was going to do.</li>
            <li>Also the best oil blotting paper, too...I was so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t purchase this anymore when my favorite &amp;#34;bath/soap/lotion/makeup&amp;#34; store went out of business.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>I will be looking for a better product next time.</li>
            <li>I love the toned powder feature, it isn&#x27;t as obvious and blaring, just gentle.</li>
            <li>Lastly, they tear easily when you press them against your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blotting power of the Paper combined with a soft wipe of powder, removes the shine completely and leaves you with a smooth, non-greasy finish.  </li>
            <li>These are cheap but they actually work really well.  </li>
            <li>I was very hesitant on buying in bulk, but I am a greasy beast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These sheets are powdered (which I didn’t even consider about until after I ordered this) and it helps so much.</li>
            <li>My face looks cleaner and it really does keep me from being shinier sooner.</li>
            <li>I will continue ordering this product for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Papier Poudre Oil Blotting Paper in the past and they were effective in getting the oil and dirt off my face.</li>
            <li>The cover of each booklet of the authentic product is yellow and not white.  </li>
            <li>Decent delivery time received.</li>
            <li>I love that such a simple product has remained so high-quality and has never been over-engineered or plasticized over the years.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re actually scented, but they have a really pleasant aroma to them.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but when I use this, it really absorbs all the oils and give me that fresh powder just applied make up look for a really long time.</li>
            <li>pretty fast shipping for standard shipping, so</li>
            <li>They are much better than plain oil blotting paper.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this product.  </li>
            <li>and you can leave home with just a lipstick and this blotting paper in your purse and your makeup stays absolutely fresh looking all day long.</li>
            <li>The paper really soaks in oil and the layer of powder conveniently adds a touch of power to the oily areas and removes the shine instantly.</li>
            <li>I’ve tried the clean and clear blue sheets, the Target brand of those sheets, and all other kinds of oil blotting papers that become see-through after they touch my face.</li>
            <li>No obvious powdery look, effective for very oily faces - other blotting papers don&#x27;t seem to get rid of my excessive shine.</li>
            <li>I like that they are small and fit into my wallet.</li>
            <li>I have a \\&quot;very\\&quot; oily facial skin, so I must blot my face throughout each day, usually 3 times or more daily.</li>
            <li>The papers are very small and tear easily.  </li>
            <li>the early 90&#x27;s and Papier Poudre is the only brand I will use.  </li>
            <li>I typically use Shiseido sheets and I am pretty picky.  </li>

            <li> I typically use Shiseido sheets and I am pretty picky.  </li>
            <li>  I expect the whole entire thing to last me for a year, if not more.</li>
            <li> And after trying other blotting papers, I must say Papier Poudre Oil Blotting Papers is bar far</li>
            <li> They are also a bit hard to cleanly rip out of the little book.  </li>
            <li> It is a facial oil blotting paper that has loose powder on it, so you don&#x27;t need to touch up your make-up after blotting.  </li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t have to wait too long to get it.</li>
            <li> I have been using these papers for as long as I can remember (25 years?).  </li>
            <li> , so for a 12, it’s going to be roughly the same price.</li>
            <li> The sheets are not double sided though: it is powdered on one side and not the other.</li>
            <li> I find my self reaching for two or three, when with other products I would only use one sheet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various name brand and non name blotting papers for years and am used to them being big enough to at least hold against my face with fingers from both hands.  </li>
            <li> If someone were to ask me which one beauty product I could not live without, it would be these blotting papers!  </li>
            <li> I ordered 2 boxes of 12 booklets from this vendor, and I got it after only a few days..</li>
            <li> I will NEVER use any other blotting paper.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin</li>
            <li> because the packet is so small but does a big time job of removing the oily shine on my face.</li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;ve yet to determine if these were the cause and not some other reason.  </li>
            <li> Additionally, the other oil blotting sheets are about $3</li>
            <li> I have tried other brands but they do not work as well.  </li>
            <li> I have 3 other family members using them also!</li>
            <li> These are so small they are hard to fully press against your face- which is needed to actually absorb oil, not just apply the powder.  </li>
            <li> The only gripe I have is poor packaging a few sheets in the book is bent but other than that I like the powder papers over wax like tissue paper blotting papers any day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these little blotting sheets for years.</li>
            <li> But, in the past, the powder in the paper had a creaminess to it that is lacking in this batch I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
            <li> not so (at least not for me).</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 10 years.  </li>
            <li> And with the papers already being very small, its a little frustrating to work with.  </li>
            <li> Simple tissue paper merely moves the oil around on your face, while Papier Poudres REMOVE it!   </li>
            <li> Some of the other blotting papers are made out of very thin paper and do not absorb oil off the face.  </li>
            <li> The Secret?  </li>
            <li> I will seriously go into a depression if they ever discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not at all saying these are fake.</li>
            <li> Blot oil without disturbing make up.  </li>
            <li> this product is fake.</li>
            <li> There is grainy materia all over each sheet which leaves nasty granules on your face.</li>
            <li> Totally disgusted with my purchase.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Ever since I bought the Poudre&#x27;s in England, 25+ years ago, I&#x27;ve been their biggest fan.  The Secret?  It&#x27;s Paper.....Not Tissue paper.... paper.  The blotting power of the Paper combined with a soft wipe of powder, removes the shine completely and leaves you with a smooth, non-greasy finish.  Simple tissue paper merely moves the oil around on your face, while Papier Poudres REMOVE it!   Both men and women can use them.  Fabulous for meetings.  Slip them into your pocket, and freshen up without leaving your chair.  I will NEVER use any other blotting paper. Try it!  You&#x27;ll absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> If someone were to ask me which one beauty product I could not live without, it would be these blotting papers!  I have been using them religiously since the early 90&#x27;s and Papier Poudre is the only brand I will use.  Some of the other blotting papers are made out of very thin paper and do not absorb oil off the face.  Because these blotting papers are thicker, they instantly absorb and lift oil off the face and the powder on the paper leaves a nice matte finish.  I will seriously go into a depression if they ever discontinue this product!</li>
            <li> These lasted a whole year!</li>
            <li> I will use these until I die. No obvious powdery look, effective for very oily faces - other blotting papers don&#x27;t seem to get rid of my excessive shine.</li>
            <li> This product is just great! It is a one time fix. You apply your makeup and you can leave home with just a lipstick and this blotting paper in your purse and your makeup stays absolutely fresh looking all day long. I have extremely oily skin but when I use this, it really absorbs all the oils and give me that fresh powder just applied make up look for a really long time. I love this product...it is one of the best on the market. The delivery from this company is also very fast so you don&#x27;t have to wait too long to get it. I would recommend this to anyone and if there were 10 stars on top I would definitely give this product a perfect 10!!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not what I wanted, I though it&#x27;s anti-shine, but actually it has powder... that&#x27;s why they have for every skin color.</li>
            <li> the price here is the best one on the internet.  i first used these about twenty years ago when my grandmere sent them to me.  my skin is so oily that i need to use something within 30 minutes of application of make up.  i still havent&#x27; found anything better than these.</li>
            <li> My wife says this is her favorite blotting paper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad I only bought one book rather than going for 12 as I was going to do. I don&#x27;t know how these work for others. The\\&quot;powder\\&quot; on them was scratchy and didn&#x27;t transfer to my skin. Using them was basically like I might as well have been pressing a piece of regular paper to my skin. It did nothing except smudge my makeup. I have very oily skin and was hoping these worked better than the clean&amp;clear/neutrogena sheets but not so (at least not for me).</li>
            <li> I have used these blotting papers for my oily face since the mid-nineties . They work well to get rid of the shine on my nose, forehead and chin. I highly recommend this product. I will continue ordering this product for as long as it&#x27;s available.</li>
            <li> Same excellent product, super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using these little blotting sheets for years. They&#x27;re great to carry around in a coat pocket, have in a desk drawer, in an evening purse, etc. because the packet is so small but does a big time job of removing the oily shine on my face. Great for refreshing your face during any social setting. These blotting sheets also help with acne!</li>
            <li> I have been using these papers for as long as I can remember (25 years?).  They absorb oil and leave just a touch of powder for a matte finish.  They are perfect for a touch-up without having to wash my face and reapply makeup any time of the day.  They are much better than plain oil blotting paper.</li>
            <li> I really love this product. The competitions&#x27; blotting paper (Walgreens brand, Neutrogena) are made would literally stick to my skin and slide. The paper really soaks in oil and the layer of powder conveniently adds a touch of power to the oily areas and removes the shine instantly.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product.  I&#x27;ve been using this since 1986 and it&#x27;s a lifesaver!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Papier Poudre Oil Blotting Paper in the past and they were effective in getting the oil and dirt off my face. But, in the past, the powder in the paper had a creaminess to it that is lacking in this batch I&#x27;ve bought. Though it gets the oil out, the powder seems drier and goes on my face like chalk. It made me break out after I used it. However, I&#x27;ve yet to determine if these were the cause and not some other reason.  I&#x27;m not at all saying these are fake. I hope they aren&#x27;t.  Maybe the company changed formulas. If so, I wish they never did because it was a very good product.</li>
            <li> I was very hesitant on buying in bulk, but I am a greasy beast. My face needs blotting and reblotting. I’ve tried the clean and clear blue sheets, the Target brand of those sheets, and all other kinds of oil blotting papers that become see-through after they touch my face. None of them ever really made me happy because my shine comes back full force, my hands get greasy, and the sheets literally just blotted, but didn’t add anything to my face.&lt;br /&gt;These sheets are powdered (which I didn’t even consider about until after I ordered this) and it helps so much. My face looks cleaner and it really does keep me from being shinier sooner. The sheets are not double sided though: it is powdered on one side and not the other. However, I really only need one sheet when I blot, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;Now that I bought 12 books, it’s nice just being able to keep one in my desk at work, one in my car, and one in my bag. Additionally, the other oil blotting sheets are about $3+ anyways, so for a 12, it’s going to be roughly the same price. You just won’t have to worry about purchasing any of them individually for a while  I expect the whole entire thing to last me for a year, if not more.</li>
            <li> I bought a pack of these to put in bridesmaids &amp;#34;oh sh!# kits&amp;#34; and everyone loved them-as did I! They easily fit into your purse, and the powder side was so nice to blot up excess oil. I&#x27;m not sure if they&#x27;re actually scented, but they have a really pleasant aroma to them. These were great to use beneath my bangs during dancing, and I also found them useful while traveling on long flights.</li>
            <li> Love this product, beautiful color, and light..I&#x27;ve tried many powders on the market, including the famous brands available at the department store. This is by far the best powder. Also the best oil blotting paper, too...I was so disappointed when I couldn&#x27;t purchase this anymore when my favorite &amp;#34;bath/soap/lotion/makeup&amp;#34; store went out of business. So happy I can get this at Amazon!</li>
            <li> I have a \\&quot;very\\&quot; oily facial skin, so I must blot my face throughout each day, usually 3 times or more daily. And after trying other blotting papers, I must say Papier Poudre Oil Blotting Papers is bar far the best blotting paper I&#x27;ve ever used.  It is a facial oil blotting paper that has loose powder on it, so you don&#x27;t need to touch up your make-up after blotting.  It mentions \\&quot;Rachel\\&quot; which means the color of the paper is beige, and not the powder, which is a mild translucent color.    I ordered 2 boxes of 12 booklets from this vendor, and I got it after only a few days.. pretty fast shipping for standard shipping, so I&#x27;m very pleased with their service.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Papier Poudre Oil Blotting Papers for years - it&#x27;s the best there is.  Great, fast service.  Thanks!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve used these for years.  Love tem.  Blot oil without disturbing make up.  Leave a lovely matte finish.</li>
            <li> Run Away!!!! this product is fake. I have used the original one before. Somebody is trying to make a quick buck from you by seling this product. There is grainy materia all over each sheet which leaves nasty granules on your face. The cover of each booklet of the authentic product is yellow and not white.  Totally disgusted with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I typically use Shiseido sheets and I am pretty picky.  These are cheap but they actually work really well.  I like that they are small and fit into my wallet.</li>
            <li> The best blotting paper I found so far! Just enough poudre to absorb the oil from the skin but not enough to clog pores !</li>
            <li> I like the rose variety better because the powder on this tends to shake off easily. Otherwise, I love these papers.</li>
            <li> Works wonderfully, beautiful design, great price.  I love the toned powder feature, it isn&#x27;t as obvious and blaring, just gentle.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did buying a pack of 12 booklets before trying on booklet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pluses- I like the powder on the blotting paper since most sheets don&#x27;t have a translucent powder and also like the book they come in.  Its nice since the papers dont fall out all over your purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;minuses- The papers are very small and tear easily.  I&#x27;ve used various name brand and non name blotting papers for years and am used to them being big enough to at least hold against my face with fingers from both hands.  These are so small they are hard to fully press against your face- which is needed to actually absorb oil, not just apply the powder.  They are also a bit hard to cleanly rip out of the little book.  The pages are not perforated so they can rip any which way.  And with the papers already being very small, its a little frustrating to work with.  I find my self reaching for two or three, when with other products I would only use one sheet.  Lastly, they tear easily when you press them against your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decent product, but would be worlds better if they were twice the size and made with a more tear resistant paper.</li>
            <li> These are the best blotting papers. They are especially goood for those with oily skin because the last thing you should be doing is applying alot of pressed powder on your skin. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for at least 10 years.  I have tried other brands but they do not work as well.  These remove the oil and it does not look like you have power on your face.  I have 3 other family members using them also!</li>
            <li> Decent delivery time received. The only gripe I have is poor packaging a few sheets in the book is bent but other than that I like the powder papers over wax like tissue paper blotting papers any day. If u are a super oily person like me u will like this better. I only need 2 for touchup over 8 -10 sheets tissue paper.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for a more blotting effect.  The papers appear to cover rather than blot.  I will be looking for a better product next time.</li>
            <li> So perfect for touchups through the day for someone with oily skin, especially in the warmer months.  I love them.</li>
            <li> Awesome. I buy them again and again.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for 26 years and have never been without them - I go through one booklet every 3 weeks or so. I love that such a simple product has remained so high-quality and has never been over-engineered or plasticized over the years. They&#x27;re always the same paper booklets, and they always arrive in the same cardboard box.</li>
