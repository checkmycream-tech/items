            <li>I have used this product for over a year now and still love it!</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li>I purchased this with the anticipation of it being an amazing product, based on all the favorable reviews.</li>
            <li>so I researched and found this amazing deodorant</li>
            <li>It took a couple days to get used to the feel of it (kind of feels tacky or like you forgot to put deodorant on)</li>
            <li>Now making my own for pennies.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s safe, all natural, smells great and works awesome!  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work effectively with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li>Smells good , but made me itch and didn&#x27;t  keep body order for more than 6 hours</li>
            <li>Original 2 Star Review: Smells great in the container.</li>
            <li>It will make you smell beautiful throughout the day and feeling fresh</li>
            <li>No aluminum and all natural, smells great too!  </li>
            <li>i got this stuff, its the best you can get with being a natural non aluminum antiperspirant  </li>
            <li>If you are looking for an all natural deodorant this is a great product and works!!</li>
            <li>Ok, thought great at first...</li>
            <li>but since then I&#x27;m a fan :)</li>
            <li>It is ok to prevent Odor</li>
            <li>I love anything</li>
            <li>tried Tom&#x27;s deodorant, and it&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li>Great stuff, highly recommend everyone try it!</li>
            <li>Okay.</li>
            <li>I plan on buying more products.</li>
            <li>and I will be buying more for my family.</li>
            <li>but I think there are better options out there.</li>
            <li>I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li>was happening to many others who were using Toms.</li>
            <li>but I already love it.</li>
            <li>This is among my favorite scents and it lasts longer than the others I tried.</li>
            <li>Great and natural !!</li>
            <li>The new one was scented with a vanilla-woodsy scent that smells great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and like this one the best!</li>
            <li>It worked great, but is a bit soft.</li>
            <li>I am so happy it has all natural ingredients and no aluminum.</li>
            <li>My girls used the Fresh Lemon Berry without any difficulty and the product was effective for them.</li>
            <li>I strongly suggest people to get this because I use to have problems where I use to sweat a lot</li>
            <li>It goes on just fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m super pleased and plan to order again.</li>
            <li>A HUGE MISTAKE!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have been using this deodorant for a few months now, and it works great!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few days now and it works great!</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;m not wearing perfume or body spray, it&#x27;s really important that my deodorant works.</li>
            <li>If you have experienced the same problems as me, I recommend you try this.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different ones and this is the absolute BEST one yet!</li>
            <li>Seems to be a good product so far.</li>
            <li>you just need to reapply it halfway into your day, kinda has a bit of a mint smell to it also was hoping it would smell more like coconut but overall good product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still searching for a good all natural deodorant ....</li>
            <li>wasting your time looking for other natural deodorants and stop wasting your time reading these reviews, get this deodorant and be happy forever, you&#x27;re welcome</li>
            <li>The smell is very fresh.  </li>
            <li>However, it washes off easily and you get used to it quick.  </li>
            <li>After reading the reviews I was really excited to try this product.</li>
            <li>Sent me a new one and it smells amazing and seems to work.  </li>
            <li>I love that it&#x27;s all natural and the scent coconut and lime is so refreshing .</li>
            <li>It kept me from stinking for a full 10 hour work shift.</li>
            <li>I have created my own natural deodorant from coconut oil, shea butter, baking soda, lemongrass oil and arrowroot.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li>I dont understand how this product got such good reviews.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed was the herbal minty smell was SO strong</li>
            <li>, it works super well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m currently pregnant and I stopped using deodorant since I knew</li>
            <li>I was pregnant cause of the aluminum .</li>
            <li>I was really eager to find a good all natural deodorant,.  </li>
            <li>This deodorant is the only aluminum free kind that has ever worked for me.  </li>
            <li>I love this stick and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I dont really know why would this product have any bad reviews at all: this is the most PERFECT deodorant ever made.</li>
            <li>Customer service is second to none, very much out to make sure the customer is satisfied.</li>
            <li>It does cause some irritation at first, but just let your skin get used to it!</li>
            <li>It seems to work and has a nice smell but is way more waxy that any natural deodorant ive come across yet feels gross.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant for the longest time and am so glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li>I am surprised I found something so natural and that works so good.</li>
            <li>After going through so many natural deodorants (Tom&#x27;s maine, etc.)</li>
            <li>This one feels nice on my pits and definitely controls odor.</li>
            <li>The fresh coconut and lime is a wave of freshness when I lift my arms</li>
            <li>I go to the gym daily and get real sweaty, this product has kept me smelling good</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still smelling fresh after a day.</li>
            <li>So far, after 3 days, I love it and it smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Definitely applies smoother and has better odor control than original.</li>
            <li>I spent a 20 hour day in Coconut &amp; Lime during my wife&#x27;s C-Section, in an OR bunny suit (hot), and I was smelling great the whole time.  </li>
            <li>The person or company that makes this states in the welcome letter to you to go directly to them first to replace or try another scent if the one you order does not work instead of putting a low review online.</li>
            <li>I cannot use it right after I shave.  </li>
            <li>However, I am a guy and have some hair in my armpits and this product is kind of harsh to put on as it is very sticky, other than that it works great all day long and smells good as well.</li>
            <li>This is the first aluminum-free deodorant I have purchased.</li>
            <li>First one was lavender vanilla which didn&#x27;t work well for me, but after speaking with customer service discovered that I may have gotten a defective one.  </li>
            <li>Because breast cancer has been in my family, I wanted to avoid toxins in most of the products I use, especially with the underarms.</li>
            <li>Also make sure the entire area is covered.</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic natural deodorant</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time today</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure this skewed the actual feedback about this</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product and will continue using it after I have these baby girls next month.</li>
            <li>It works well all day even on hot days with lots of activity.  </li>
            <li>Overall,  I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li>I tried a lot of natural deodorants trying to find the right one while pregnant.</li>
            <li>I had read the reviews which were mostly positive however after getting the product in the mail I know why.</li>
            <li>So happy to have finally found a natural deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li>In fact, I&#x27;m usually told I smell really good when I&#x27;m not wearing anything but the deodorant (lime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I think the more dry consistency perhaps helps it &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to underarms and may be the reason it lasts a tad longer.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to make my 3rd or 4th purchase of this (lost track) and really enjoy the results.</li>
            <li>It is very tacky when applied.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic product that definitely gets the job done!</li>
            <li>, I really really like this deodorant</li>
            <li>I expected more I guess because of the price and product ingredients.</li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t perspire much unless I&#x27;m exercising.</li>
            <li>This stuff just really keeps any bo in check.</li>
            <li>Out of all the Cruelty Free / Aluminum Free options out there, this one is the only one that works for me (after trying about 5-6 different brands).</li>
            <li>I really like the fact that Organic Virgin Coconut Oil is the #1 ingredient in it</li>
            <li>I tried it for a few days to see how I liked it.</li>
            <li>Like most I have been endlessly searching and trying many different types of natural deodorants to still not have found the one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d send it back for a full refund, but I&#x27;m fairly certain they wouldn&#x27;t since it&#x27;s a healthcare product.</li>
            <li>This works better than I expected for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li>I love the smell of coconut, love lime and figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li>Both the male and female engineer love this product.  </li>
            <li>When I found out I was pregnant with twins in April, I decided that I definitely wanted to go \\&quot;natural\\&quot; on all health and beauty products.</li>
            <li>: Company was kind enough to send a free replacement with a new formula that is less gritty.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I have gone through so many other natural deodorants</li>
            <li>ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS, nothing like the industrial chemicals in most other junk, AND IT WORKS.  </li>
            <li>Drinking more water and eating a little healthier also did wonders for me.</li>
            <li>so I find I have to apply a little more pressure when applying.  </li>
            <li>Simple, clean, CLEAR and NO TACKY residue that makes your pits stick together.</li>
            <li>It went on very sticky, which is what a lot of all natural deodorants do.  </li>
            <li>But I rarely ever wear white...</li>
            <li>Otherwise, no staining during normal wear for any of our clothes.</li>
            <li>It is pretty big.</li>
            <li>The only thing is, it may leave residue on your clothes, but I am willing to keep using this after hearing that parabens have been found on the cells of women with breast cancer.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised when after my workout I did not stink!</li>
            <li>I apply the deodorant once in the morning, and it keeps me fresh all day long.</li>
            <li>The first time I wore it was over night, then I wore it all the next day.</li>
            <li>I was searching for a new all natural deodorant after Tom&#x27;s was bought out and changed their recipe, leaving my armpits irritated.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over a year, give or take, and now it lasts me all day, although I do live in a hot and dry climate.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very thick, but softens after sitting in your warm armpits for awhile.</li>
            <li>but it does have a little more lasting power than others.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for creating a natural deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li>there is no harsh odor</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s organic and naturally scented,</li>
            <li>this is NOT an antiperspirant: perspiration is a natural process of the body, you CANNOT stop it unless you use chemicals,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop</li>
            <li>I used to use LUSH deodorant until I discovered this brand.  </li>
            <li>I bought this deodorant a year ago for my eight year old daughter who started having body odour.</li>
            <li>I wanted a natural deodorant without any cancer causing chemicals</li>
            <li>my soft (lotion-like) one I use at home.</li>
            <li>This does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li>but it is all natural.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t give me any irritation and last for a whole day long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>There was a time or two when I noticed I needed to re-apply it, it was after working outside in the heat during summer, but no big deal, it took care of it right away.</li>
            <li>Hope to have positive results in the long run.</li>
            <li>I order items from amazon all the time, but this is the very first time I&#x27;ve ever sat down to write a review.</li>
            <li>We live on an island with a tropical climate and my daughter play several sports for her school.</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have that gross, synthetic aroma of natural deodorants or the herby smell of LUSH&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>do find that it helps to apply a few layers rather than a quick swipe.</li>
            <li>I have also tried a lot of different natural deodorants, and this is the only one that really, really works just as well as the standard type, but without all the junk.  </li>
            <li>It is sticky which is to be expected but that can be remedied with just using it sparingly, don&#x27;t apply a large amount</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m used to sweating with years of deodorant use vs. anti-perspirant, this product does little to keep me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>I like that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue on my clothes, but I may try another brand.</li>
            <li>I FINALLY found the one natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s already kind of expensive with the shipping.</li>
            <li>It is a stick-type deodorant that has the more dry/powdery consistency of something like Secret, etc.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, you just have to try until you find the right one for you, but this one is worth trying.</li>
            <li>Finding a natural deodorant that actually worked turned out to be one of the most difficult feats of going \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>/&gt;Anywho, I used Old Spice high endurance, which was fine and worked well, but about every 3 months I would get contact dermatitis, red welting painful marks under my arms from the Old Spice (or any deo).  </li>

            <li> and I love it!</li>
            <li> Once I start moving I smell like coconuts and lime, my favorite scents!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for over a year now and still love it!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s amazing</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the anticipation of it being an amazing product, based on all the favorable reviews.</li>
            <li> so I researched and found this amazing deodorant</li>
            <li> It took a couple days to get used to the feel of it (kind of feels tacky or like you forgot to put deodorant on)</li>
            <li> Now making my own for pennies.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s safe, all natural, smells great and works awesome!  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work effectively with my body chemistry.</li>
            <li> Smells good , but made me itch and didn&#x27;t  keep body order for more than 6 hours</li>
            <li> Original 2 Star Review: Smells great in the container.</li>
            <li> It will make you smell beautiful throughout the day and feeling fresh</li>
            <li> No aluminum and all natural, smells great too!  </li>
            <li> i got this stuff, its the best you can get with being a natural non aluminum antiperspirant  </li>
            <li> If you are looking for an all natural deodorant this is a great product and works!!</li>
            <li> Ok, thought great at first...</li>
            <li> but since then I&#x27;m a fan :)</li>
            <li> It is ok to prevent Odor</li>
            <li> I love anything</li>
            <li> tried Tom&#x27;s deodorant, and it&#x27;s ok...</li>
            <li> Great stuff, highly recommend everyone try it!</li>
            <li> Okay.</li>
            <li> I plan on buying more products.</li>
            <li> and I will be buying more for my family.</li>
            <li> but I think there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant.</li>
            <li> was happening to many others who were using Toms.</li>
            <li> but I already love it.</li>
            <li> This is among my favorite scents and it lasts longer than the others I tried.</li>
            <li> Great and natural !!</li>
            <li> The new one was scented with a vanilla-woodsy scent that smells great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and like this one the best!</li>
            <li> It worked great, but is a bit soft.</li>
            <li> I am so happy it has all natural ingredients and no aluminum.</li>
            <li> My girls used the Fresh Lemon Berry without any difficulty and the product was effective for them.</li>
            <li> I strongly suggest people to get this because I use to have problems where I use to sweat a lot</li>
            <li> It goes on just fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m super pleased and plan to order again.</li>
            <li> A HUGE MISTAKE!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for a few months now, and it works great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few days now and it works great!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;m not wearing perfume or body spray, it&#x27;s really important that my deodorant works.</li>
            <li> If you have experienced the same problems as me, I recommend you try this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different ones and this is the absolute BEST one yet!</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product so far.</li>
            <li> you just need to reapply it halfway into your day, kinda has a bit of a mint smell to it also was hoping it would smell more like coconut but overall good product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still searching for a good all natural deodorant ....</li>
            <li> wasting your time looking for other natural deodorants and stop wasting your time reading these reviews, get this deodorant and be happy forever, you&#x27;re welcome</li>
            <li> The smell is very fresh.  </li>
            <li> However, it washes off easily and you get used to it quick.  </li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was really excited to try this product.</li>
            <li> Sent me a new one and it smells amazing and seems to work.  </li>
            <li> I love that it&#x27;s all natural and the scent coconut and lime is so refreshing .</li>
            <li> It kept me from stinking for a full 10 hour work shift.</li>
            <li> I have created my own natural deodorant from coconut oil, shea butter, baking soda, lemongrass oil and arrowroot.</li>
            <li> Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> I dont understand how this product got such good reviews.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed was the herbal minty smell was SO strong</li>
            <li> , it works super well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently pregnant and I stopped using deodorant since I knew</li>
            <li> I was pregnant cause of the aluminum .</li>
            <li> I was really eager to find a good all natural deodorant,.  </li>
            <li> This deodorant is the only aluminum free kind that has ever worked for me.  </li>
            <li> I love this stick and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Honestly, I dont really know why would this product have any bad reviews at all: this is the most PERFECT deodorant ever made.</li>
            <li> Customer service is second to none, very much out to make sure the customer is satisfied.</li>
            <li> It does cause some irritation at first, but just let your skin get used to it!</li>
            <li> It seems to work and has a nice smell but is way more waxy that any natural deodorant ive come across yet feels gross.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant for the longest time and am so glad I tried this one.</li>
            <li> I am surprised I found something so natural and that works so good.</li>
            <li> After going through so many natural deodorants (Tom&#x27;s maine, etc.)</li>
            <li> This one feels nice on my pits and definitely controls odor.</li>
            <li> The fresh coconut and lime is a wave of freshness when I lift my arms</li>
            <li> I go to the gym daily and get real sweaty, this product has kept me smelling good</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still smelling fresh after a day.</li>
            <li> So far, after 3 days, I love it and it smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely applies smoother and has better odor control than original.</li>
            <li> I spent a 20 hour day in Coconut &amp; Lime during my wife&#x27;s C-Section, in an OR bunny suit (hot), and I was smelling great the whole time.  </li>
            <li> The person or company that makes this states in the welcome letter to you to go directly to them first to replace or try another scent if the one you order does not work instead of putting a low review online.</li>
            <li> I cannot use it right after I shave.  </li>
            <li> However, I am a guy and have some hair in my armpits and this product is kind of harsh to put on as it is very sticky, other than that it works great all day long and smells good as well.</li>
            <li> This is the first aluminum-free deodorant I have purchased.</li>
            <li> First one was lavender vanilla which didn&#x27;t work well for me, but after speaking with customer service discovered that I may have gotten a defective one.  </li>
            <li> Because breast cancer has been in my family, I wanted to avoid toxins in most of the products I use, especially with the underarms.</li>
            <li> Also make sure the entire area is covered.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic natural deodorant</li>
            <li> I used it for the first time today</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure this skewed the actual feedback about this</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product and will continue using it after I have these baby girls next month.</li>
            <li> It works well all day even on hot days with lots of activity.  </li>
            <li> Overall,  I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of natural deodorants trying to find the right one while pregnant.</li>
            <li> I had read the reviews which were mostly positive however after getting the product in the mail I know why.</li>
            <li> So happy to have finally found a natural deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li> In fact, I&#x27;m usually told I smell really good when I&#x27;m not wearing anything but the deodorant (lime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I think the more dry consistency perhaps helps it &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to underarms and may be the reason it lasts a tad longer.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting ready to make my 3rd or 4th purchase of this (lost track) and really enjoy the results.</li>
            <li> It is very tacky when applied.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic product that definitely gets the job done!</li>
            <li> , I really really like this deodorant</li>
            <li> I expected more I guess because of the price and product ingredients.</li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t perspire much unless I&#x27;m exercising.</li>
            <li> This stuff just really keeps any bo in check.</li>
            <li> Out of all the Cruelty Free / Aluminum Free options out there, this one is the only one that works for me (after trying about 5-6 different brands).</li>
            <li> I really like the fact that Organic Virgin Coconut Oil is the #1 ingredient in it</li>
            <li> I tried it for a few days to see how I liked it.</li>
            <li> Like most I have been endlessly searching and trying many different types of natural deodorants to still not have found the one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d send it back for a full refund, but I&#x27;m fairly certain they wouldn&#x27;t since it&#x27;s a healthcare product.</li>
            <li> This works better than I expected for a natural deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love the smell of coconut, love lime and figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  </li>
            <li> Both the male and female engineer love this product.  </li>
            <li> When I found out I was pregnant with twins in April, I decided that I definitely wanted to go \\&quot;natural\\&quot; on all health and beauty products.</li>
            <li> : Company was kind enough to send a free replacement with a new formula that is less gritty.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have gone through so many other natural deodorants</li>
            <li> ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS, nothing like the industrial chemicals in most other junk, AND IT WORKS.  </li>
            <li> Drinking more water and eating a little healthier also did wonders for me.</li>
            <li> so I find I have to apply a little more pressure when applying.  </li>
            <li> Simple, clean, CLEAR and NO TACKY residue that makes your pits stick together.</li>
            <li> It went on very sticky, which is what a lot of all natural deodorants do.  </li>
            <li> But I rarely ever wear white...</li>
            <li> Otherwise, no staining during normal wear for any of our clothes.</li>
            <li> It is pretty big.</li>
            <li> The only thing is, it may leave residue on your clothes, but I am willing to keep using this after hearing that parabens have been found on the cells of women with breast cancer.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised when after my workout I did not stink!</li>
            <li> I apply the deodorant once in the morning, and it keeps me fresh all day long.</li>
            <li> The first time I wore it was over night, then I wore it all the next day.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a new all natural deodorant after Tom&#x27;s was bought out and changed their recipe, leaving my armpits irritated.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over a year, give or take, and now it lasts me all day, although I do live in a hot and dry climate.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very thick, but softens after sitting in your warm armpits for awhile.</li>
            <li> but it does have a little more lasting power than others.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for creating a natural deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li> there is no harsh odor</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic and naturally scented,</li>
            <li> this is NOT an antiperspirant: perspiration is a natural process of the body, you CANNOT stop it unless you use chemicals,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop</li>
            <li> I used to use LUSH deodorant until I discovered this brand.  </li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant a year ago for my eight year old daughter who started having body odour.</li>
            <li> I wanted a natural deodorant without any cancer causing chemicals</li>
            <li> my soft (lotion-like) one I use at home.</li>
            <li> This does not irritate my sensitive skin</li>
            <li> but it is all natural.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t give me any irritation and last for a whole day long.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> There was a time or two when I noticed I needed to re-apply it, it was after working outside in the heat during summer, but no big deal, it took care of it right away.</li>
            <li> Hope to have positive results in the long run.</li>
            <li> I order items from amazon all the time, but this is the very first time I&#x27;ve ever sat down to write a review.</li>
            <li> We live on an island with a tropical climate and my daughter play several sports for her school.</li>
            <li> and it doesn&#x27;t have that gross, synthetic aroma of natural deodorants or the herby smell of LUSH&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> do find that it helps to apply a few layers rather than a quick swipe.</li>
            <li> I have also tried a lot of different natural deodorants, and this is the only one that really, really works just as well as the standard type, but without all the junk.  </li>
            <li> It is sticky which is to be expected but that can be remedied with just using it sparingly, don&#x27;t apply a large amount</li>
            <li> While I&#x27;m used to sweating with years of deodorant use vs. anti-perspirant, this product does little to keep me smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> I like that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue on my clothes, but I may try another brand.</li>
            <li> I FINALLY found the one natural deodorant that works.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s already kind of expensive with the shipping.</li>
            <li> It is a stick-type deodorant that has the more dry/powdery consistency of something like Secret, etc.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, you just have to try until you find the right one for you, but this one is worth trying.</li>
            <li> Finding a natural deodorant that actually worked turned out to be one of the most difficult feats of going \\&quot;natural.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> /&gt;Anywho, I used Old Spice high endurance, which was fine and worked well, but about every 3 months I would get contact dermatitis, red welting painful marks under my arms from the Old Spice (or any deo).  </li>
            <li> i found that this, like all other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, doesn&#x27;t last the entire day</li>
            <li> ;) Whether it&#x27;ll work for everyone, that&#x27;s hard to say and depends on the individual, but I&#x27;ll definitely continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I am an active adult who is health focused.  </li>
            <li> I have tried a large number of natural deodorants with poor results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a little more expensive that other so-called natural deodorants out there, WITH ACTUAL WHOLESOME INGREDIENTS that even non-scientists can understand, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Because of that, you might have to wait a little longer than usual to get it (because it&#x27;s not sitting on a store shelf waiting to be purchased), but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> seriously canNOT understand all the positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> It neutralizes odors and my pits don&#x27;t turn red like with other sticks.  </li>
            <li> I was previously using Tom&#x27;s of Maine Long lasting lemongrass deodorant until I noticed that my pits were peeling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently made a partial transition to deodorant due to my concern of antiperspirant.</li>
            <li> It is all natural just as mine, but is very firm, like a stick.</li>
            <li> Or maybe initially -then about half way through it</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to not getting welts from my previous deo, not smelling like a teenage boy from Tom&#x27;s not working, and smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really works at all temperatures and lasts at least 24 hours!  </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s all natural therefore no chemicals, duh</li>
            <li> Will be a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> Still some gritty feel on application, but no gritty residue left behind.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Be careful with your clothes as the coconut oil can stain so</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t drag your clothes across your underarms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days</li>
            <li> this stuff is rough on your pits.</li>
            <li> only after few uses.</li>
            <li> Please be careful if you are going to try it.</li>
            <li> It works extremely well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m done shopping around for other deodorants, I&#x27;m sticking with this one</li>
            <li> So, I searched other options and stumbled across Skin2Spirit.</li>
            <li> think we&#x27;ve figured out that the ingredient Zinc ricinoleate is what&#x27;s causing the peeling as it&#x27;s not in any other deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> When I first used this, I did have to reapply a second time as my body readjusted from using years of store brand, aluminum based products; however, I also used to get really bad</li>
            <li> i sweat over average and this stuff works</li>
            <li> only drawback is if you&#x27;re not used to it, it goes on like a thick paste.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m moving my 5 star down to a 4 (3.5) star.  </li>
            <li> It does feel a little sticky like other commenters have said but who cares?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d previously tried Toms, Crystal and another salt type product, but didn&#x27;t care for them.</li>
            <li> Typically the odor protection lasts 3-6 hours.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw this product after trying and failing with other natural deodorants.</li>
            <li> It is a little messy in the container</li>
            <li> I think there&#x27;s no perfect natural deodorant for every person.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and threw it out.  </li>
            <li> It may also remove dead skin and/or bacteria, even if you don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> This brand also has a spray on if you&#x27;re not into the stick, though I have not yet tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, tip, they have an etsy storefront where they sell this for half about the price that amazon does!</li>
            <li> The way this product goes on is very sticky and unpleasant.</li>
            <li> I SCRUBBED my skin almost raw to get it off</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past year already</li>
            <li> like that the seller makes the deodorant in small batches.</li>
            <li> that means no more cancer, skin rashes, and aftershave bumps&lt;</li>
            <li> gross, weird smell.</li>
            <li> At this point,  I need a bit of antiperspirant coverage while at work, so I use a small amount of Kiehls scentless as well.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a product that I can wear.  </li>
            <li> Smell wasn&#x27;t bad, and as natural d.o.&#x27;s go, you must reapply or you&#x27;ll stink.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention it was sticky and thick on the underarms.  </li>
            <li> Apply slowly if you have pit hair or it will tug some out.</li>
            <li> Maybe I just put it on too thick</li>
            <li> You will see what I mean when you use it.</li>
            <li> By the middle of the day even if I reapplied I smelled so bad I had to wash it off.</li>
            <li> , it is STICKY and leaves a &#x27;tar-tacky&#x27; residue on your armpit that is near impossible to get off!  </li>
            <li> keeps getting worse and worse.  </li>
            <li> They are responsive, care about their customers, and stand behind their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Just too expensive.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it! It took a couple days to get used to the feel of it (kind of feels tacky or like you forgot to put deodorant on) but since then I&#x27;m a fan :)&lt;br /&gt;Works great, even when it&#x27;s failing there is no harsh odor (I hate the smell of deodorant &amp; bo)  over all I&#x27;m super pleased and plan to order again.</li>
            <li> This product gave me a painful rash and I had to stop using it.  My girls used the Fresh Lemon Berry without any difficulty and the product was effective for them.</li>
            <li> I loved it. Just too expensive. Now making my own for pennies.</li>
            <li> It is ok to prevent Odor but it does not prevent you from sweating.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for a natural deodorant for the longest time and am so glad I tried this one. I absolutely love this product!! It works and smells great and best of all, it&#x27;s natural. Definitely recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past year already and it&#x27;s amazing I strongly suggest people to get this because I use to have problems where I use to sweat a lot but once I started to using this, everything stopped.</li>
            <li> This works better than I expected for a natural deodorant. It is very tacky when applied. It also leaves grease (?) on fabric that touches it- which I learned needs stain lifter to come out in the wash. I like that it is all natural and doesn&#x27;t leave white residue on my clothes, but I may try another brand. Also this one smells like pina coladas..</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a product that I can wear.  This deodorant not only controlled odor but did not cause a rash.  The smell is very fresh.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I am surprised I found something so natural and that works so good. I am a mom and needed a good bio blocker. This smells so good. I love anything coconut and this is incredible! Will need to buy it again. It is pretty big. The only thing is, it may leave residue on your clothes, but I am willing to keep using this after hearing that parabens have been found on the cells of women with breast cancer. Please don&#x27;t raise the price, it&#x27;s already kind of expensive with the shipping.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for a few months now, and it works great! I must say, the ones that works the best is the fresh coconut lime, lumber jack and vanilla lavender. With that being said I recently got my husband to use this deodorant as well, and he always wears a white tee under his shirts, and the vanilla lavender definitely stained the white tee. But I rarely ever wear white...so it doesn&#x27;t bother me! But I got him the lumber jack scent and it works perfect for him. I have gone through so many other natural deodorants and I felt like they made me smell. This deodorant keeps all smells at bay. It does cause some irritation at first, but just let your skin get used to it!</li>
            <li> I just recently learned about the dangers of aluminum in deodorants. I threw away all of my deodorants and anti-perspirants that I had at home and at work. This is the first aluminum-free deodorant I have purchased. I bought this deodorant for my hubby so he could stop using aluminum based deodorants. I tried it for a few days to see how I liked it. It smells REALLY GOOD!!! It goes on just fine. It kept me from stinking for a full 10 hour work shift. My hubby uses it and he likes it too. He likes the smell. He does not stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the seller makes the deodorant in small batches. Because of that, you might have to wait a little longer than usual to get it (because it&#x27;s not sitting on a store shelf waiting to be purchased), but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller sent me an email after purchase with additional information. That was nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found out that anti-perspirants are bad for you because they clog up the pores in your arm pits; this is how they keep you from sweating. However, for anyone like myself, who is concerned about toxins, this also prevents toxins from sweating out of your system, via your arm pits. Because of this, I will no longer use anti-perspirants.</li>
            <li> This is fantastic product that definitely gets the job done! Customer service is second to none, very much out to make sure the customer is satisfied. Buy with confidence!!!</li>
            <li> Honestly, I dont really know why would this product have any bad reviews at all: this is the most PERFECT deodorant ever made. After going through so many natural deodorants (Tom&#x27;s maine, etc.) I FINALLY found the one natural deodorant that works. A couple of things for you to consider:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It&#x27;s organic and naturally scented, that means no more cancer, skin rashes, and aftershave bumps&lt;br /&gt;2. It will make you smell beautiful throughout the day and feeling fresh, naturally&lt;br /&gt;2. apply TWICE a day, it&#x27;s not going to work unless you apply multiples times in a day, it&#x27;s all natural therefore no chemicals, duh&lt;br /&gt;3. this is NOT an antiperspirant: perspiration is a natural process of the body, you CANNOT stop it unless you use chemicals,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stop wasting your time looking for other natural deodorants and stop wasting your time reading these reviews, get this deodorant and be happy forever, you&#x27;re welcome</li>
            <li> This is awesome deodorant! No aluminum and all natural, smells great too!  I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different ones and this is the absolute BEST one yet!</li>
            <li> I tried a lot of natural deodorants trying to find the right one while pregnant. This one feels nice on my pits and definitely controls odor. It seems to curtail sweating. It is a little messy in the container and I had to get used to the smell. It smells like candy. I think there&#x27;s no perfect natural deodorant for every person. Unfortunately, you just have to try until you find the right one for you, but this one is worth trying.</li>
            <li> Ok, thought great at first...then it stained my clothes as I was wearing them, could see it through shirts, didn&#x27;t come off in washing, and then towards the end started to become a sticky blob--the d.o. left in the container.  Not to mention it was sticky and thick on the underarms.  Doesn&#x27;t hold up well to heat - body heat even.  I wouldn&#x27;t reccommend.  Or maybe initially -then about half way through it keeps getting worse and worse.  Smell wasn&#x27;t bad, and as natural d.o.&#x27;s go, you must reapply or you&#x27;ll stink.  I&#x27;d say 2.5 stars</li>
            <li> First one was lavender vanilla which didn&#x27;t work well for me, but after speaking with customer service discovered that I may have gotten a defective one.  Sent me a new one and it smells amazing and seems to work.  Great customer service :)</li>
            <li> I moved to deodorant a while back as there are several studies linking aluminum to Alzheimer&#x27;s, and deodorants are reported to be the second highest source of aluminum to Americans (processed cheese is #1).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywho, I used Old Spice high endurance, which was fine and worked well, but about every 3 months I would get contact dermatitis, red welting painful marks under my arms from the Old Spice (or any deo).  I had to take a 3-5 day break and use powder until it went away.  All those nasty industrial chemicals have a known side effect of contact dermatitis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried Tom&#x27;s deodorant, and it&#x27;s ok... for bout 30 minutes, then you smell bad and have to re-apply.  What&#x27;s the point?  I had to take it with me to work and apply 1-2 times an hour.  BOO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, this passed the all-day test, I DON&#x27;T STINK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is if you&#x27;re not used to it, it goes on like a thick paste.  However, it washes off easily and you get used to it quick.  ALL NATURAL INGREDIENTS, nothing like the industrial chemicals in most other junk, AND IT WORKS.  (Believe me, I stink if something doesn&#x27;t work)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a little more expensive that other so-called natural deodorants out there, WITH ACTUAL WHOLESOME INGREDIENTS that even non-scientists can understand, and it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to not getting welts from my previous deo, not smelling like a teenage boy from Tom&#x27;s not working, and smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Get your smell (good) on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****************************************&lt;br /&gt;Updated review 8/6/14&lt;br /&gt;***************************************&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone through all the scents.  All are good.  However, &amp;#34;Fresh Lemon Berry&amp;#34;, to me, smells like Lemon Pledge... it still works, mind you, but you smell like wood cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, they ALL still ROCK IT.  I spent a 20 hour day in Coconut &amp; Lime during my wife&#x27;s C-Section, in an OR bunny suit (hot), and I was smelling great the whole time.  This is still the DEO TO GET!!!!&lt;br /&gt;**************************************&lt;br /&gt;Update 3 7/18/15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I really really like this deodorant, it works super well.  However, I&#x27;m moving my 5 star down to a 4 (3.5) star.  While this works GREAT it stains clothes.  Not with a color, but with the thick oil base.  All my T-shirts have oil/waxy pit stains from this.  I&#x27;m going to try to couple this with  the pit guards to see if that will spare my clothes.  If not, I&#x27;ll have to re-review this, give it up, and save my clothes!</li>
            <li> I used to use LUSH deodorant until I discovered this brand.  I run around a lot and often through situations where I&#x27;d like a shower before continuing my day.  The fresh coconut and lime is a wave of freshness when I lift my arms and it doesn&#x27;t have that gross, synthetic aroma of natural deodorants or the herby smell of LUSH&#x27;s.  It neutralizes odors and my pits don&#x27;t turn red like with other sticks.  This is truly my go-to deodorant that I will be faithful to the rest of my life.</li>
            <li> Love this deodorant!  It&#x27;s safe, all natural, smells great and works awesome!  I&#x27;ve tried many other brands and like this one the best!</li>
            <li> So happy to have finally found a natural deodorant that actually works! Smells great too. It does feel a little sticky like other commenters have said but who cares? Will be a lifelong customer.</li>
            <li> I have also tried a lot of different natural deodorants, and this is the only one that really, really works just as well as the standard type, but without all the junk.  Great stuff, highly recommend everyone try it!</li>
            <li> I bought this deodorant a year ago for my eight year old daughter who started having body odour. I wanted a natural deodorant without any cancer causing chemicals so I decided to try this one. We live on an island with a tropical climate and my daughter play several sports for her school. The deodorant works like a dream...there is no body odour and I have since ordered a couple for myself and have replaced my regular deodorant. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Seems to be a good product so far. Hope to have positive results in the long run. So here is wishing it all the best for my life:)</li>
            <li> I have created my own natural deodorant from coconut oil, shea butter, baking soda, lemongrass oil and arrowroot. It worked great, but is a bit soft. Then I found this item and bought it to see the difference in the consistency. It is all natural just as mine, but is very firm, like a stick. So I use this one when I need to take it with me somewhere and my soft (lotion-like) one I use at home. I love this stick and recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Original 2 Star Review: Smells great in the container. Doesn&#x27;t work effectively with my body chemistry. For the cost, I was expecting a knock out product. I don&#x27;t like the gritty feel when it&#x27;s applied. While I&#x27;m used to sweating with years of deodorant use vs. anti-perspirant, this product does little to keep me smelling fresh. Not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update-4 Star Review: Company was kind enough to send a free replacement with a new formula that is less gritty. The new one was scented with a vanilla-woodsy scent that smells great. Definitely applies smoother and has better odor control than original. Still some gritty feel on application, but no gritty residue left behind. Overall, a good product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the anticipation of it being an amazing product, based on all the favorable reviews. I love the smell of coconut, love lime and figured I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  OH WHAT A HUGE MISTAKE!&lt;br /&gt;This stuff not only smells nasty and musty, it is STICKY and leaves a &#x27;tar-tacky&#x27; residue on your armpit that is near impossible to get off!  I SCRUBBED my skin almost raw to get it off and it was still there!  HORRIBLE PRODUCT!  I&#x27;d send it back for a full refund, but I&#x27;m fairly certain they wouldn&#x27;t since it&#x27;s a healthcare product. I ordered two, one for myself and one for my mom whose got breast cancer and stays away from aluminum products.  We are going to stick with CRYSTAL deodorants. Simple, clean, CLEAR and NO TACKY residue that makes your pits stick together. My mom and dad said the same thing I did. Stay away from this product, go for the Crystal...works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I seriously canNOT understand all the positive reviews.  UGH!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product for a few days now and it works great! I go to the gym daily and get real sweaty, this product has kept me smelling good which is great. However, I am a guy and have some hair in my armpits and this product is kind of harsh to put on as it is very sticky, other than that it works great all day long and smells good as well.</li>
            <li> oily. gross, weird smell. Wasnt my forte and I do no recommend</li>
            <li> Okay. I expected more I guess because of the price and product ingredients. Would not order again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently pregnant and I stopped using deodorant since I knew I was pregnant cause of the aluminum . However it&#x27;s summer and I cannot go without using deodorant so I researched and found this amazing deodorant I love that it&#x27;s all natural and the scent coconut and lime is so refreshing .</li>
            <li> Im really happy i got this stuff, its the best you can get with being a natural non aluminum antiperspirant  i sweat over average and this stuff works great you just need to reapply it halfway into your day, kinda has a bit of a mint smell to it also was hoping it would smell more like coconut but overall good product.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed when I used this product bkz I was really eager to find a good all natural deodorant,.  The first thing I noticed was the herbal minty smell was SO strong it gave me a headache and stunk up the entire room.  It went on very sticky, which is what a lot of all natural deodorants do.  I used it a few times and threw it out.  I&#x27;m still searching for a good all natural deodorant ....</li>
            <li> This deodorant is the only aluminum free kind that has ever worked for me.  The scent (I purchased coconut lime) is light and pleasant, and I find that it lasts all day!  Even when I run 4+ miles, this stuff has me covered, so I&#x27;m probably never going to use anything else.</li>
            <li> I was searching for a new all natural deodorant after Tom&#x27;s was bought out and changed their recipe, leaving my armpits irritated. I read through a lot of reviews on amazon and finally found this brand. Took a chance and I was floored! I smell like a key lime pie all day, I can&#x27;t stop smelling my armpits! XD It works extremely well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very thick, but softens after sitting in your warm armpits for awhile. Apply slowly if you have pit hair or it will tug some out. This brand also has a spray on if you&#x27;re not into the stick, though I have not yet tried it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, tip, they have an etsy storefront where they sell this for half about the price that amazon does! (Although you obviously have to pay for shipping/can&#x27;t use amazon prime)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting ready to make my 3rd or 4th purchase of this (lost track) and really enjoy the results. Because breast cancer has been in my family, I wanted to avoid toxins in most of the products I use, especially with the underarms. I&#x27;d previously tried Toms, Crystal and another salt type product, but didn&#x27;t care for them. When I first used this, I did have to reapply a second time as my body readjusted from using years of store brand, aluminum based products; however, I also used to get really bad b.o. anyway. It&#x27;s been over a year, give or take, and now it lasts me all day, although I do live in a hot and dry climate. I also don&#x27;t perspire much unless I&#x27;m exercising. In fact, I&#x27;m usually told I smell really good when I&#x27;m not wearing anything but the deodorant (lime).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that it helps to apply a few layers rather than a quick swipe. Also make sure the entire area is covered. Some people also report darkness, which I also noticed but determined it was buildup that my way cloth wasn&#x27;t getting. Using a Korean Italy towel (gently) or similar helped me avoid that, and it will also somewhat help with any remaining odor issues (from my experience). It may also remove dead skin and/or bacteria, even if you don&#x27;t use this product. It doesn&#x27;t sting after shaving, waxing, or using an epilator, which is great. Drinking more water and eating a little healthier also did wonders for me. ;) Whether it&#x27;ll work for everyone, that&#x27;s hard to say and depends on the individual, but I&#x27;ll definitely continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Both the male and female engineer love this product.  It really works at all temperatures and lasts at least 24 hours!  The odor is fairly benign without any perfumes.  Great for those of us with allergies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be careful with your clothes as the coconut oil can stain so don&#x27;t drag your clothes across your underarms. Otherwise, no staining during normal wear for any of our clothes.</li>
            <li> Great product.Great value for the cots.  Great customer service. I plan on buying more products.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for an all natural deodorant this is a great product and works!!</li>
            <li> Smells good , but made me itch and didn&#x27;t  keep body order for more than 6 hours</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic natural deodorant and I believe it is cruelty-free.  The scent is awesome, if you like a lime and coconut and and it sort of smells like a mojito.  i found that this, like all other natural deodorants I&#x27;ve tried, doesn&#x27;t last the entire day but it does have a little more lasting power than others.  It is a stick-type deodorant that has the more dry/powdery consistency of something like Secret, etc. so I find I have to apply a little more pressure when applying.  I think the more dry consistency perhaps helps it &amp;#34;stick&amp;#34; to underarms and may be the reason it lasts a tad longer.  This does not irritate my sensitive skin *but*  I cannot use it right after I shave.  Excellent product, but a bit pricey.</li>
            <li> Smells really good and works well. It does not last all day and needs to be reapplied.... but it is all natural.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this deodorant. I am so happy it has all natural ingredients and no aluminum. It doesn&#x27;t give me any irritation and last for a whole day long.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to keep ordering.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for making it!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I saw this product after trying and failing with other natural deodorants. I used it for the first time today and I love it! I was pleasantly surprised when after my workout I did not stink! I&#x27;m done shopping around for other deodorants, I&#x27;m sticking with this one and I will be buying more for my family.</li>
            <li> It seems to work and has a nice smell but is way more waxy that any natural deodorant ive come across yet feels gross. Also doesn&#x27;t wash off shirts.  Maybe I just put it on too thick but I think there are better options out there.</li>
            <li> I used it and I&#x27;m still smelling fresh after a day. I like its solid consistency. Great and natural !!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews I was really excited to try this product. I had read the reviews which were mostly positive however after getting the product in the mail I know why. The person or company that makes this states in the welcome letter to you to go directly to them first to replace or try another scent if the one you order does not work instead of putting a low review online. I&#x27;m sure this skewed the actual feedback about this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Like most I have been endlessly searching and trying many different types of natural deodorants to still not have found the one. By the middle of the day even if I reapplied I smelled so bad I had to wash it off. Also keeping in mind a person&#x27;s body chemistry, diet, etc contribute as well. The hunt continues!</li>
            <li> I order items from amazon all the time, but this is the very first time I&#x27;ve ever sat down to write a review. Before trying this product, I had purchased four \\&quot;natural\\&quot; deodorants, and none of them worked for longer than a couple of hours. When I found out I was pregnant with twins in April, I decided that I definitely wanted to go \\&quot;natural\\&quot; on all health and beauty products. Finding a natural deodorant that actually worked turned out to be one of the most difficult feats of going \\&quot;natural.\\&quot; As soon as I read the reviews for this product, I decided to buy it to see if it worked, and I was so happy with the results. I apply the deodorant once in the morning, and it keeps me fresh all day long. Now that I&#x27;m not wearing perfume or body spray, it&#x27;s really important that my deodorant works. I absolutely love this product and will continue using it after I have these baby girls next month. Thanks for creating a natural deodorant that actually works!</li>
            <li> I am an active adult who is health focused.  I walk or bike daily and lift weights several days per week.  I have tried a large number of natural deodorants with poor results.  Typically the odor protection lasts 3-6 hours.  This product provides all day odor control for me.  I think the beeswax helps it stay in place improving the effectiveness.  I placed a couple of orders now and plan to continue using this product. If you have experienced the same problems as me, I recommend you try this. Also, Skin2Spirit customer service is exceptional. They are responsive, care about their customers, and stand behind their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had no issues with stains using the Coconut &amp; Lime, or Lumberjack products.</li>
            <li> I love this deodorant. Once I start moving I smell like coconuts and lime, my favorite scents! It is sticky which is to be expected but that can be remedied with just using it sparingly, don&#x27;t apply a large amount it&#x27;s not necessary.</li>
            <li> I was previously using Tom&#x27;s of Maine Long lasting lemongrass deodorant until I noticed that my pits were peeling. Like they got sunburned but that was impossible. The skin that peeled off was brown in color and it left the skin underneath a darker color as well. I got online and read this was happening to many others who were using Toms. So, I searched other options and stumbled across Skin2Spirit. I ordered the Coconut Lime. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days but I already love it. The first time I wore it was over night, then I wore it all the next day. Took a walk with the kids and sweat a lot, and it held up it&#x27;s scent and protection all day!  So far, after 3 days, I love it and it smells amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we&#x27;ve figured out that the ingredient Zinc ricinoleate is what&#x27;s causing the peeling as it&#x27;s not in any other deodorant I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> It works well all day even on hot days with lots of activity.  Update:  I have used this product for over a year now and still love it!</li>
            <li> this stuff is rough on your pits. Use your brain. Only use it once every 4 days mixed in conjunction with Lavanila coconut deodorant. This stuff just really keeps any bo in check. You will see what I mean when you use it.</li>
            <li> I dont understand how this product got such good reviews. I had the WORST allergic reaction to this product. My lymph nodes swelled up and got&lt;br /&gt;infected only after few uses. I took antibiotics for 10 days and had  to suffer from pain and discomfort. It took me almost a month to recover. Maybe its just me but i am the last guy to get any allergic reactions to anything i use. The way this product goes on is very sticky and unpleasant. Please be careful if you are going to try it.</li>
            <li> Out of all the Cruelty Free / Aluminum Free options out there, this one is the only one that works for me (after trying about 5-6 different brands). I have been using it for almost a year now. I really like the fact that Organic Virgin Coconut Oil is the #1 ingredient in it, we all know how good coconut oil is for the skin. There was a time or two when I noticed I needed to re-apply it, it was after working outside in the heat during summer, but no big deal, it took care of it right away. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recently made a partial transition to deodorant due to my concern of antiperspirant. Besides the concern of aluminum base substance, and I&#x27;ve also become disgusted by scents among all the conventional brands (Secret, Degree, etc). I realized how awful those brands smell after my husband had to borrow my stick. He reeked of some awful perfume worn by an elderly woman after applying the mainstream AP. So during my transition I bought 4 different brands of handmade deodorant from Etsy, and this one from Amazon. This is among my favorite scents and it lasts longer than the others I tried. Also, the consistency of Skin2Spirit is easier to deal with. One doesn&#x27;t have to dip their finger into a jar and mix prior to application, for example. At this point,  I need a bit of antiperspirant coverage while at work, so I use a small amount of Kiehls scentless as well. Overall,  I&#x27;m satisfied with the product.</li>
