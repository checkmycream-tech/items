            <li>and I don&#x27;t put it on my scalp to be sure it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  </li>
            <li>My hair growth like magic</li>

            <li>I have seen some results and I look forward to seeing better results with continued use.</li>
            <li>and I get more hair loss.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this oil</li>

            <li>I had to buy more of this stuff.</li>

            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>Mostly at night.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this hair oil.  </li>
            <li>Love it....</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a year was very excited to receive this product</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this hair oil after hearing and reading about everyone else&#x27;s amazing results.</li>
            <li>However I love love love love how soft my roots feel.</li>
            <li>Just like I thought they sold rather quickly!</li>
            <li>The smell is a very strong pine smell when you first put it on</li>
            <li>thank you for the good product, I will order more in next view weeks.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased this product from Sally Beauty Supply just to test it out on my hair and when I saw that Amazon had it available, I found it to be cheaper in price by stocking up on it.</li>
            <li>My hair is showing significant improvement in the length and texture.  </li>
            <li>I gave her my left overs and she has had great success.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for African Americans growing natural hair.</li>
            <li>I also eat healthy and I take Pure Biotin vitamins to help with the hair growth process which by during all three I am seeing the results I would like to see.</li>
            <li>a full 30 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this product apart from the smell I believe that it is good product.  </li>
            <li>Some people use a sweet smelling hair spray to cover the odor.</li>
            <li>High 5 to the seller, the product came on time as promise!!!</li>
            <li>To get the full effect, just apply it to the scalp and massage your scalp very gently and then leave your hair alone for a couple of days.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell it doesn&#x27;t stink</li>
            <li>My husband is 84 years old and good hair growth results occurred covering his bald spot enough to make a real difference!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I cannot believe I got three of them for such a fantastic price!  </li>
            <li>I tried it when I first got it.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s vey strong and don&#x27;t wear white, it might stain the close.</li>
            <li>I am trying to grow my hair a certain style like the mo-hawk style.</li>
            <li>thanks again&lt;br</li>
            <li>So, I will be using this again to see how much growth I can get long-term.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say if it makes my hair grow fast because I am not checking for that</li>
            <li>My wife really likes the way it smells.</li>
            <li>Also, when I put too much it makes my hair feel so oily</li>
            <li>But after a day or two, your hair has a very foul odor.  </li>
            <li>I like hair but not that much hair.</li>
            <li>It really works real well on my hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is fuller, much healthier and even in the areas that I had some concerns I am seeing new growth.</li>
            <li>4a/4b hair grows at a decent rate when using this oil.</li>
            <li>This product is thick and it really doesn&#x27;t take a lot for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>If you have short hair like I do, then you will be able to see a big difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a black female and it made my hair grow in the bald spot at the top of my head even with alopecia!</li>
            <li>I normally just squeeze it in between my braids.</li>
            <li>The remaining 2/3 of my hair grew at it&#x27;s normal rate.</li>
            <li>At 52 I was loosing my hair in the normal widows peak</li>
            <li>and I would recommend this product to any one who would like to see their hair restored, long, healthy, thick and strong.</li>
            <li>but then I started to loose it in the very front and was going to end up with a bald spot right on the front of my head as my father had done before me.</li>
            <li>It does however has a little strong scent but after a while it wears out.</li>
            <li>Wild Growth Hair Oil</li>
            <li>:  I can say only that it really works.  </li>
            <li>Wild Growth Hair Oil</li>
            <li>When my hair dries it is so soft.  </li>
            <li>I have natural hair and keep my hair in braids.</li>
            <li>my complete review, go to: hairdiary.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/wild-growth-hair-oil/</li>
            <li>It did make my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t get this stuff out my hair fast enough.  </li>
            <li>My hair does not grow fast so taking these vitamins will only enhance the growth.</li>
            <li>It has made my hair soft, but I am still waiting for growth and thickness of my hair, as your treatment said it would do.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use this for a few more weeks and will provide and update later.  </li>
            <li>it made my damage hair , healthy and thick</li>
            <li>it makes my hair soft, easy to manage, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see hair growth results but overall it makes my hair supple and that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars</li>
            <li>I would not recommend this product for caucasions or people with softer hair, this product is more for ethnic hair as the oil will weigh other hair typed down.</li>
            <li>This prevents breakage but doesn&#x27;t actually cause or initiate new growth.  </li>
            <li>AGAIN.MY HAIR IS NOT AS DRY AS BEFORE, AND IS MUCH EASIER TO COMB.</li>
            <li>As far as your wild growth oil is concerned,  I have been following directions and using your treatment.</li>
            <li>This oil does wonders on my hair, it completely grew back all my edges.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This prevents breakage but doesn&#x27;t actually cause or initiate new growth.  </li>
            <li> AGAIN.MY HAIR IS NOT AS DRY AS BEFORE, AND IS MUCH EASIER TO COMB.</li>
            <li> As far as your wild growth oil is concerned,  I have been following directions and using your treatment.</li>
            <li> This oil does wonders on my hair, it completely grew back all my edges.</li>
            <li> Shoot, if you have long hair like my daughter&#x27;s which is thick and course, then maybe you want to monitor your hair growth because my daughter&#x27;s hair grow fast anyways so this stuff is something she barely uses.</li>
            <li> but I do know that it is not as dry or brittle as it was prior to my purchasing this product.  </li>
            <li> Using this to protect my ends has helped my African American Hair to reach the middle of my back close to my waste.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months so far.</li>
            <li> It grows it long but doesnt thicken it.</li>
            <li> I noticed hair growth in an area I had lost hair due to rough handling during french braiding years ago...</li>
            <li> When I took my braids out my hair was actually really gritty feeling which was odd</li>
            <li> Use only a little the</li>
            <li> I also bought it to enhance my other products.</li>
            <li> If you want a lot of hair then using this stuff along with other stuff will help like hair vitamins and other hair growing products, just know how each product does your hair</li>
            <li> I have to wash my stuff every other day..</li>
            <li> I use it every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> My pillow cases and bed sheets are oiled down with this stuff.</li>
            <li> I would recommend using a small amount every other day or 3x per week...</li>
            <li> I am actually surprised because I was quite skeptical.</li>
            <li> After the first two days the bad odor came, so I washed and clarified my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you are having a hair issue try this stuff first before giving up or feeling bad about yourself.</li>
            <li> Other than the smell; you&#x27;ll see growth result!!!</li>
            <li> (when I remembered to do it) and I stopped loosing that hair and after about another month, my wife noticed I was growing some small gray hairs where there were none before.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but I have a small amount of hair there and my tuft at the front is thicker and fuller.</li>
            <li> I have a wig and my hair is flat twisted with the oil in my scalp.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to tell if I&#x27;m growing.</li>
            <li> Note to curve the scent I also use coconut oil moisturizer and try to wash my hair at least once a week.</li>
            <li> I mean the smell and everything.</li>
            <li> At first I hated it.</li>
            <li> The steroid shot caused my temples and edges to thin</li>
            <li> Sadly...</li>
            <li> so it anything goes wrong, you will know what product is doing is it.</li>
            <li> Works well but your hair stinks for days</li>
            <li> My braids don&#x27;t itch and its not leaving a dirty oil feeling</li>
            <li> It made my scalp itch like crazy!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not for me, I will not walk around stinking. :(</li>
            <li> The smell is very bad!!!  </li>

            <li> Best hair growth product ever!</li>
            <li> Wild Growth Hair Oil:  I can say only that it really works.  You must follow the directions and be faithful with your application and care of your hair.  You will see good results.  You need to eat healthy for the best results.  My husband is 84 years old and good hair growth results occurred covering his bald spot enough to make a real difference!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Wild Growth Hair Oil 3pcs x 4oz ...</li>
            <li> I use this after I wash my hair.  When my hair dries it is so soft.  This oil is thicker than regular olive oil and I don&#x27;t put it on my scalp to be sure it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores.  I only put it on the hair.  It works great as a hot oil treatment as well.  Using this to protect my ends has helped my African American Hair to reach the middle of my back close to my waste.  I also take vitamins that help hair growth as well.  This prevents breakage but doesn&#x27;t actually cause or initiate new growth.  It helps you maintain your length.</li>
            <li> thank you for the good product, I will order more in next view weeks. thanks again&lt;br /&gt;Abdulaziz s alenzy&lt;br /&gt;ksa</li>
            <li> My hair growth like magic</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t finished the product but i like it!</li>
            <li> Staple product. Great deal</li>
            <li> This oil is great. I have natural hair and keep my hair in braids. I normally just squeeze it in between my braids.</li>
            <li> Works well but your hair stinks for days</li>
            <li> Good stuff and the price not bad</li>
            <li> This oil does wonders on my hair, it completely grew back all my edges. This order came in very quickly and its a good price for three bottles! I&#x27;m never getting this from the store again.</li>
            <li> be using this for a couple months not reguarly like they say 3x a week but it was more so to help with my edges. It did grow back but i noticed a white film when washing my hair after starting this product</li>
            <li> My edges are growing back</li>
            <li> Have work for my hair...</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this hair oil after hearing and reading about everyone else&#x27;s amazing results. Sadly...NO. This oil itched and left blisters on my head. Never again will I touch this stuff! Even after I washed it out my scalp itched something fierce. ...smh...</li>
            <li> Have used product for years. I will keep using it.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months so far. I have seen some results and I look forward to seeing better results with continued use.</li>
            <li> The oil comes in a 4 oz. bottle with an applicator tip. I applied the product three times each week,  massaged my scalp for 2 minutes, and then prepped my hair for bed/the next day. After 2 weeks, I did an unofficial hair check to see how the product was working, and it didn’t appear that my hair had grown at all! But, to be fair, I decided to continue to use the product until the end of the month so I could see how well the oil worked within a month’s time (a full 30 days).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month, 1/3 of my hair grew 1.5&amp;#34;! No, that IS NOT a typo. The remaining 2/3 of my hair grew at it&#x27;s normal rate. So, I will be using this again to see how much growth I can get long-term. For only $8, this growth oil is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my complete review, go to: hairdiary.wordpress.com/2014/05/06/wild-growth-hair-oil/</li>
            <li> I noticed hair growth in an area I had lost hair due to rough handling during french braiding years ago...This was a great purchase!</li>
            <li> I tried this after taking a steroid shot for back pain. The steroid shot caused my temples and edges to thin so I got worried and bought this. At first I hated it. It made my scalp itch like crazy! It literally had me up in the night scratching my scalp. I decided to keep using it as directed and eventually the itch went away and my edges and temples are back. I am actually surprised because I was quite skeptical. I can&#x27;t say if it makes my hair grow fast because I am not checking for that but I can definitely say it works for my edges and temples. I have nonrelaxed hair btw.</li>
            <li> This stuff works but it is not a miracle oil. At 52 I was loosing my hair in the normal widows peak but then I started to loose it in the very front and was going to end up with a bald spot right on the front of my head as my father had done before me. I started using this about a year ago, once at night before I went to bed (when I remembered to do it) and I stopped loosing that hair and after about another month, my wife noticed I was growing some small gray hairs where there were none before.&lt;br /&gt;I have contined to use it and I seem to be holding my own nicely. My widows peak is not gone by any means but I have a small amount of hair there and my tuft at the front is thicker and fuller. I am convinced that without the oil, I would be close to being bald at the front.&lt;br /&gt;The stuff also smells nice and you can rub it into your finger tips after you rub it into your scalp. My wife really likes the way it smells.</li>
            <li> I bought this item because I saw an opportunity to sell. Just like I thought they sold rather quickly! I also bought it to enhance my other products. Very pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> Product came as described. 4a/4b hair grows at a decent rate when using this oil. Not the best smell but highly effective.</li>
            <li> I been using it for a month and haven&#x27;t seen any difference. Also, when I put too much it makes my hair feel so oily and I get more hair loss.</li>
            <li> I bought this product coz of the customer reviews about it, i hope it works...will update my review after i get some results..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three starts because it arrived earlier than scheduled!!!</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this product apart from the smell I believe that it is good product.  I cannot say that my hair has grown but I do know that it is not as dry or brittle as it was prior to my purchasing this product.  I will continue to use this for a few more weeks and will provide and update later.  Note to curve the scent I also use coconut oil moisturizer and try to wash my hair at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Speedy Service and a fantastic product!! I absolutely love this oil and I cannot believe I got three of them for such a fantastic price!  I will definately order again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year was very excited to receive this product the price is perfecct!!.it seems however my package was stolen as I have not received it even though it says delivered -__-.  Amazon was great very apologetic and refunded my money no hassle.I am looking to order this again and have my package held at the warehouse so I might actually receive it this time.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for over a month now and I am seeing results like never before. My hair is fuller, much healthier and even in the areas that I had some concerns I am seeing new growth. I originally purchased this product from Sally Beauty Supply just to test it out on my hair and when I saw that Amazon had it available, I found it to be cheaper in price by stocking up on it. It does however has a little strong scent but after a while it wears out. This product is thick and it really doesn&#x27;t take a lot for it to be effective. I also eat healthy and I take Pure Biotin vitamins to help with the hair growth process which by during all three I am seeing the results I would like to see. This product is really awesome and I would recommend this product to any one who would like to see their hair restored, long, healthy, thick and strong.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months my hair is growing a lot stronger and moist. Use only a little the it&#x27;s vey strong and don&#x27;t wear white, it might stain the close.</li>
            <li> Wild Growth is a very good hair oil which grows your hair. I&#x27;ve been using this for several years and I&#x27;ve seen growth results. I would not recommend this product for caucasions or people with softer hair, this product is more for ethnic hair as the oil will weigh other hair typed down. My daughter used this on her hair when she had braids and it grew her hair. I would advise you not to use this product every day...I would recommend using a small amount every other day or 3x per week...it has a smell to it which you might get use to. Some people use a sweet smelling hair spray to cover the odor. Other than the smell; you&#x27;ll see growth result!!! High 5 to the seller, the product came on time as promise!!!</li>
            <li> The smell is a very strong pine smell when you first put it on (I could have dealt with that).  But after a day or two, your hair has a very foul odor.  Like you have not washed it in about 3 or 4 months (maybe longer).  The smell is very bad!!!  I can&#x27;t walk around like that! It did make my hair soft and manageable.  but that still was not enough to keep me using it.  I tried it when I first got it.  After the first two days the bad odor came, so I washed and clarified my hair.  Waited a week and try it again.  SAME THING HAPPEN!!! I couldn&#x27;t get this stuff out my hair fast enough.  It&#x27;s not for me, I will not walk around stinking. :(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a black female and it made my hair grow in the bald spot at the top of my head even with alopecia! Must use daily for best results though.</li>
            <li> great  for  my  hair  love  it</li>
            <li> GREAT LIKE THE PRODUCT</li>
            <li> it makes my hair soft, easy to manage, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see hair growth results but overall it makes my hair supple and that&#x27;s why I gave it three stars</li>
            <li> my hair is actually in box braids and have been for a while so it&#x27;s hard to tell if I&#x27;m growing. However I love love love love how soft my roots feel. My braids don&#x27;t itch and its not leaving a dirty oil feeling so I&#x27;m satisfied but I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell it doesn&#x27;t stink it&#x27;s just too earthy. I think i&#x27;ll put it in a spray bottle with some rosewater when i&#x27;m finished rocking my braids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;m unsure if it worked being that my hair grows in protective styles anyway. When I took my braids out my hair was actually really gritty feeling which was odd but my sister wanted to try it. I gave her my left overs and she has had great success.</li>
            <li> my hair is thicker and so shiny!</li>
            <li> I dont know about anyone else but this stuff works wonders on my hair. It grows it long but doesnt thicken it. The smell is not a problem for me either. I recomment it.</li>
            <li> I had to buy more of this stuff. I has grown my hair and still is growing my hair. I love this stuff. I am trying to grow my hair a certain style like the mo-hawk style. I swear my hair has grown about 2-4 inches last month and still is growing. If you have short hair like I do, then you will be able to see a big difference. Shoot, if you have long hair like my daughter&#x27;s which is thick and course, then maybe you want to monitor your hair growth because my daughter&#x27;s hair grow fast anyways so this stuff is something she barely uses. That chick has a lot of hair anyways, so using this stuff may be just out of her league. Now that&#x27;s my opinion. I like hair but not that much hair. I am also taking hair vitamins to help with my hair growing. My hair does not grow fast so taking these vitamins will only enhance the growth. If you want a lot of hair then using this stuff along with other stuff will help like hair vitamins and other hair growing products, just know how each product does your hair so it anything goes wrong, you will know what product is doing is it. This stuff is oily, oily and oily. My pillow cases and bed sheets are oiled down with this stuff. I mean the smell and everything. I have to wash my stuff every other day..lol. I am enjoying my hair journey too. You can also heat this oil up, yall. This stuff is amazing and it works on all hair type. If you are having a hair issue try this stuff first before giving up or feeling bad about yourself. It really works real well on my hair. I love this stuff. I like the smell and I like the oiliness of this stuff. I mix this stuff in hair grease too. To get the full effect, just apply it to the scalp and massage your scalp very gently and then leave your hair alone for a couple of days. Wear a wig if you are like me trying to grow your hair out. I have a wig and my hair is flat twisted with the oil in my scalp. I use it every day or every other day. Mostly at night. I have to change my pillow cases on the regular. I&#x27;m loving it because my hair is growing. Also it your scalp will itch meaning it is GROWING. I also keep my hair wrap up at night or during the day when I am not working. Ladies and men, this stuff works and you will see a difference.</li>
            <li> I HAD BEEN USING THIS OFF AND ON THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, AND RECENTLY STARTED USING IT AGAIN.MY HAIR IS NOT AS DRY AS BEFORE, AND IS MUCH EASIER TO COMB. AND  EASIER TO MANAGE WHEN STYLING.</li>
