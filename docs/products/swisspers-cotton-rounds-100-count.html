    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Perfect for removing finger nail polish.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>These are the softest, best made make-up rounds that I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Swisspers are the best.</li>
            <li>i had always heard that these were the greatest, softest cotton rounds one could get.</li>
            <li>Very good price on amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>and they work great for cleaning my dogs&#x27; ears (I have 2 dogs).</li>
            <li>Great for toner or for removing make-up</li>
            <li>Great quality cotton rounds.</li>
            <li>These are great cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li>These are great cotton rounds...not sure what else to say!</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good, anyway.</li>
            <li>Swisspers has good quality products.</li>
            <li>good deal, convenient</li>
            <li>and the price is good.</li>
            <li>If you spend good money on skin care products buy the Swisspers.</li>
            <li>Good for washing your face but the cotton rubs apart very easily when applying toner or lotion</li>
            <li>I love these cottons pads!</li>
            <li>Love them!</li>
            <li>I use these for removing nail polish and they hold together nicely without falling apart.</li>
            <li>These are nice for removing makeup, stay in one piece and feel nice on the face.</li>
            <li>Nice cotton rounds for removing eye makeup.  </li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t very strong</li>
            <li>good value very useful</li>
            <li>Satisfied with product</li>
            <li>I love cotton rounds, so I bought these.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find swisspers at the store</li>
            <li>This will leave a lot of fuzzy debris on the skin and is more flimsy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some days they hold together better than others, but always come apart in some degree or another.  </li>
            <li>Even cotton balls are better than these...</li>
            <li>and that&#x27;s sayin&#x27; something :)</li>
            <li>I love their products -- better to me than cotton balls for most things.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many cotton rounds for toner, wiping cuts with antiseptic and more.</li>
            <li>I usually love swissper cotton products.</li>
            <li>That being said they are better than cotton balls.</li>
            <li>These had a great price when I got them, and honestly I got them as a filler to reach a threshold prescribed by Amazon to be able to meet a total needed for an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When visiting my mother in another state, I become re-acquainted with these and realized all over again why I loved them so much.</li>
            <li>it makes me very Testy...not good for others around me.  </li>
            <li>They are fine but cotton balls are easier to take nail polish off with.</li>
            <li>These cotton rounds were a nice price and work really well.</li>
            <li>I use them primarily for removing eye make up at night--using another product I reviewed.</li>
            <li>The purple bag product does not have the smooth fabric finish of the Swisspers I had before.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to dip these in wax and make cheap fire starters.</li>
            <li>to keep my face clean, it works well and a 100 is a lot</li>
            <li>Great product, delivery when expected!</li>
            <li>pad gives more surface area, it holds together so much better than its traditional forebear.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve always been a loyal customer.  </li>
            <li>I liked the other Swisspers better.  </li>
            <li>so one pack lasts me a good long time.</li>
            <li>I use these pretty much exclusively for taking off my eye make-up, and these are my favorite cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li>You can clean your face and ears pretty well with them</li>
            <li>They are textured, but still feel smooth on the gentle skin of my eyes.  </li>
            <li>I tossed them in an old canning jar in my bathroom for a cheap holder too!</li>
            <li>The cotton stays together really nicely and doesn&#x27;t peel, and the texture is smooth against my delicate skin :)</li>
            <li>they weren&#x27;t any better than the drugstore brand and in fact are NOT as soft as some.</li>
            <li>They fit nicely in the round plastic container for cotton rounds and are just the right thickness for removing makeup.</li>
            <li>Does not lose shape as quickly as the Gentle Care version.</li>
            <li>Just different packaging. :)</li>
            <li>I use them for my facial astringent every morning-- much cheaper than in Target or CVS but same great quality.</li>
            <li>I will always buy this brand first when I can find it.</li>
            <li>These are perfect - soft, fluffy enough without getting in the way, and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure what use out there is perfect for this product, but removing make up is certainly not one of them.</li>
            <li>reducing one star for matter of size only otherwise they work just fine.</li>
            <li>Did I really just pay $10 for a $2 item?</li>
            <li>cotton rounds that absorb well and are very durable.  </li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fall apart as readily, they hold up really well.</li>
            <li>You might think that all cotton pads are the same and buy the cheap store brand</li>
            <li>They are textured and don&#x27;t come apart when used like many other brands.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how much a difference it makes when  you buy the higher quality--it&#x27;s actually worth the extra dollar per pack.</li>
            <li>They are highly absorbent and don&#x27;t shed much (even on my stubble.)</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s grossly overpriced and nothing special.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re soft but strong enough to get even the toughest mascara off!</li>
            <li>I also use them for removing nail polish and the same is true for that.</li>
            <li>These are just like the cotton rounds I&#x27;ve purchased at different big box stores but at a better price.</li>
            <li>These are exactly what I expected but for a better price than I can find locally.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to remove polish from all 10 fingernails with just one cotton round</li>
            <li>They are nice and thick and hold up well.  </li>
            <li>I use one of these about four times when removing makeup (new corner/side each time).</li>
            <li>Needed these pad veery convenient and use it for everything from make-up to cleaning off the eyes at night, very soft and nail polish remover pads too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Lurisol</li>
            <li>You may notice me, with my clear skin, jaunty stride, and lack of wispy cotton threads on my face.  </li>
            <li>They are substantial, but soft, yet they do not shed, even when I scrub my face with one.  </li>
            <li>I guess it doesn&#x27;t fall apart completely.</li>
            <li>Could it fall apart completely?</li>
            <li>I was hoping for the professional grade rounds but these are not so.</li>
            <li>a man, and even after having shaved that morning, cotton balls routinely got snagged on my masculine intra-day beard growth.  </li>
            <li>They completely fall apart when I swipe toner on my face.  </li>
            <li>Little bigger size would have been better to hold it with proper grip in hand.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it leaves cotton residuals/lint, kinda annoy, but for the price, i can live with.</li>
            <li>I only have to order new ones maybe two or three times a year.</li>
            <li>I gave this product full ratings because there is nothing about it that makes it any less quality than your standard cotton rounds.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cotton rounds, plain and simple, if you need to remove make up, clean a wound.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, came with other items.  </li>
            <li>amount of 100 is good deal for the money, firm exterior with thick interior, so doesn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re going to fall apart as you&#x27;re using them, one goes a long way</li>
            <li>I have to spend a little more on them, but I feel they are the least damaging the soft tissue surrounding the eyes.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t leave behind particles, but tears easy.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave behind particles, but tears easy.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t like how it leaves little cotton pieces when I am using it if it isn&#x27;t completely soaked (I don&#x27;t know if it doesn&#x27;t do it when completely soaked, but I thought I should explain that I use it partially dry, which I am guessing can contribute to the issue).  </li>
            <li> In that way, they really last me a long time.</li>
            <li> The rounds are thick enough that even a large quantity of toner or makeup remover doesn&#x27;t break apart the cotton.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to waste them, since it is only toner, but when you are in a hurry (which we usually are, right ladies?)</li>
            <li> They are not completely soft, just how they are supposed to be to remove the stickiest makeup (of course with makeup remover).</li>
            <li> These are the right size for my needs, and I have not experienced any lint on them.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten about these little gems and was really dissatisfied with the usual cotton balls found in big box stores.</li>
            <li> they are a little rough and don&#x27;t hold up to a rigorous face wiping--they don&#x27;t completely disintegrate, but they start to come apart.</li>
            <li> I have used it with make up remover cream, to apply alcohol to my newborn&#x27;s belly button, and to pat dry areas on my newborn.</li>
            <li> but if the price is low, grab a few and you will thank me later!</li>
            <li> Other brands are too loosely woven and don&#x27;t hold up for even the brief amount of time needed to remove my make-up.  </li>
            <li> but when I used these cotton rounds, I had a bunch of loose pieces of cotton all over my face.</li>
            <li> I would perfere them to be a little larger</li>
            <li> Your only trouble will be getting them before they sell out.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;You want the pink packs.</li>
            <li> I have problems using and storing larger cotton rounds and seem to waste the thicker ones.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s not much of a difference between 1.10 and 3.10</li>
            <li> They arrived when promised along with other items.</li>
            <li> Other brands make my skin hurt.</li>
            <li> I have been using these for a couple of years or so now, and the pads don&#x27;t fall apart in use like other cotton rounds</li>
            <li> Well, I would not buy this brand of cotton rounds, or any other product of theirs again.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than trying to apply toner to one&#x27;s face, only to find itsy bitsy bits of white fluff sticking to one&#x27;s skin!  </li>
            <li> I even tried wetting these down to see if that&#x27;d help</li>
            <li> and I wanted to try cotton rounds instead of my typical routine of cotton balls to remove make up.</li>
            <li> It sucks up the toner enough so the pad doesn&#x27;t get watery and when using it, it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh feel or anything.</li>
            <li> It slips some times due to small size.</li>
            <li> A little pricier than the store brand and work just as well.</li>
            <li> I stopped buying the generics because they kept leaving little wisps of cotton on my face.</li>
            <li> These Cotton Rounds are not cheap and hold up.  </li>
            <li> It is too fluffy.</li>
            <li> These do the trick, but my wife mentioned that they are no better than the store brand which typically sells for 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> I guess, if you are too lazy to walk out of your house and prefer things to be shipped to your door, this may be a solution.</li>
            <li> Lazy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why these are that way.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are too thick....</li>
            <li> not a good product.</li>
            <li> It made me look like Santa after an exceptionally sloppy Norelco job.  </li>
            <li> This particular one is TERRIBLE!!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry cotton ball.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed!</li>
            <li> It was horrible especially on my eyelids, where the cotton would get stuck on my eyelashes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I would not recommend these for purchase.</li>
            <li> but you would be wrong.</li>
            <li> Annoying.  </li>
            <li> It is one of the worst cotton pads I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> good value very useful</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t very strong</li>
            <li> Satisfied with product</li>
            <li> falls apart. not a good product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave behind particles, but tears easy. Evenly distributes liquid on the pad. I use it with witch hazel on my face daily.</li>
            <li> It does what it supposed to do and meet my expectation. The only drawback is that it leaves cotton residuals/lint, kinda annoy, but for the price, i can live with.</li>
            <li> Perfect for removing finger nail polish.</li>
            <li> These are just like the cotton rounds I&#x27;ve purchased at different big box stores but at a better price. I use these for removing nail polish and they hold together nicely without falling apart. I&#x27;m able to remove polish from all 10 fingernails with just one cotton round so one pack lasts me a good long time. These are exactly what I expected but for a better price than I can find locally. Great product!</li>
            <li> Wisps of cotton do not cling on to my face after usage. Does not lose shape as quickly as the Gentle Care version.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s nothing worse than trying to apply toner to one&#x27;s face, only to find itsy bitsy bits of white fluff sticking to one&#x27;s skin!  That does not happen with this brand of cotton rounds, unlike some I have used.  These are made well.  They are substantial, but soft, yet they do not shed, even when I scrub my face with one.  I&#x27;ll order these again.</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds were a nice price and work really well. They are highly absorbent and don&#x27;t shed much (even on my stubble.) I tossed them in an old canning jar in my bathroom for a cheap holder too!</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s basic cotton rounds. I love cotton rounds, so I bought these.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know, it&#x27;s good. I guess it doesn&#x27;t fall apart completely. Could it fall apart completely? I don&#x27;t know. It&#x27;s good, anyway.</li>
            <li> They arrived when promised along with other items. I would perfere them to be a little larger but they get the job done.</li>
            <li> Did I really just pay $10 for a $2 item? You can get 5 times the amount of these for the same price. Shame on me being for not reading the details and shame on this seller for the markup.</li>
            <li> They fray a bit. Good for washing your face but the cotton rubs apart very easily when applying toner or lotion</li>
            <li> Does what it suppose to do. Little bigger size would have been better to hold it with proper grip in hand. It slips some times due to small size. reducing one star for matter of size only otherwise they work just fine.</li>
            <li> I had forgotten about these little gems and was really dissatisfied with the usual cotton balls found in big box stores. When visiting my mother in another state, I become re-acquainted with these and realized all over again why I loved them so much. I use them primarily for removing eye make up at night--using another product I reviewed. They&#x27;re soft but strong enough to get even the toughest mascara off!</li>
            <li> These are nice for removing makeup, stay in one piece and feel nice on the face. They are not completely soft, just how they are supposed to be to remove the stickiest makeup (of course with makeup remover).</li>
            <li> I use this with the thayers witch hazel [[ASIN:B000S823S6 B000S823S6]] to keep my face clean, it works well and a 100 is a lot</li>
            <li> These are what you would expect....cotton rounds that absorb well and are very durable.  Very good price on amazon.com.  Your only trouble will be getting them before they sell out.  That&#x27;s been my only issue.</li>
            <li> These had a great price when I got them, and honestly I got them as a filler to reach a threshold prescribed by Amazon to be able to meet a total needed for an order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like how it leaves little cotton pieces when I am using it if it isn&#x27;t completely soaked (I don&#x27;t know if it doesn&#x27;t do it when completely soaked, but I thought I should explain that I use it partially dry, which I am guessing can contribute to the issue).  I have used it with make up remover cream, to apply alcohol to my newborn&#x27;s belly button, and to pat dry areas on my newborn.</li>
            <li> I gave this product full ratings because there is nothing about it that makes it any less quality than your standard cotton rounds.  I use them often for application/removal of facial products.</li>
            <li> These just the regular cotton balls that you can buy in any store for a dollar. For ONE DOLLAR. I guess, if you are too lazy to walk out of your house and prefer things to be shipped to your door, this may be a solution. Otherwise, it&#x27;s grossly overpriced and nothing special.</li>
            <li> I was hoping for the professional grade rounds but these are not so. When moistened - they left cotton lint on my skin.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, came with other items.  I like the shape, and the absorbency. Will use them daily, instead of tp, to take off makeup.</li>
            <li> These are the softest, best made make-up rounds that I&#x27;ve tried. I have to spend a little more on them, but I feel they are the least damaging the soft tissue surrounding the eyes. Other brands make my skin hurt.</li>
            <li> I use these to take off my mascara at night... They are nice and thick and hold up well.  A little pricier than the store brand and work just as well.</li>
            <li> The rounds are thick enough that even a large quantity of toner or makeup remover doesn&#x27;t break apart the cotton.  I&#x27;ll continue buying these for daily use.</li>
            <li> Needed these pad veery convenient and use it for everything from make-up to cleaning off the eyes at night, very soft and nail polish remover pads too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Lurisol</li>
            <li> Swisspers has good quality products. I have been using these for a couple of years or so now, and the pads don&#x27;t fall apart in use like other cotton rounds do. I use one of these about four times when removing makeup (new corner/side each time). In that way, they really last me a long time. I only have to order new ones maybe two or three times a year. I also use them for removing nail polish and the same is true for that. They don&#x27;t fall apart as readily, they hold up really well.</li>
            <li> I use these in tandem with Olay toner at the end of my day in lieu of washing my face.  Yes.  Lazy.  But it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a man, and even after having shaved that morning, cotton balls routinely got snagged on my masculine intra-day beard growth.  It made me look like Santa after an exceptionally sloppy Norelco job.  Yes.  Annoying.  But no more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I&#x27;m a Swisspers Man.  You may notice me, with my clear skin, jaunty stride, and lack of wispy cotton threads on my face.  You will notice me.  Now that I&#x27;m a Swisspers Man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pad gives more surface area, it holds together so much better than its traditional forebear.  I&#x27;m never going back.  I&#x27;m sorry cotton ball.  It&#x27;s not me.  It&#x27;s you.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find swisspers at the store and I&#x27;ve always been a loyal customer.  I&#x27;m thankful that Amazon has it as an add-on purchase. The product is as advertised.</li>
            <li> I buy these every time that I order from Amazon. They are textured and don&#x27;t come apart when used like many other brands.</li>
            <li> The purple bag product does not have the smooth fabric finish of the Swisspers I had before. This will leave a lot of fuzzy debris on the skin and is more flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want the pink packs.</li>
            <li> Runs circles around the Target brand. These cotton circles do not fall apart when I am removing my nail polish.</li>
            <li> I purchased three different types of Swisspers. This particular one is TERRIBLE!!!  Will never buy again.  They completely fall apart when I swipe toner on my face.  Some days they hold together better than others, but always come apart in some degree or another.  I can&#x27;t wait to finish these and start a different bag.  I don&#x27;t want to waste them, since it is only toner, but when you are in a hurry (which we usually are, right ladies?) and I have to pick lint off my face before applying moisturizer, makeup, etc... it makes me very Testy...not good for others around me.  Save your money, and try a different type.  Even cotton balls are better than these...and that&#x27;s sayin&#x27; something :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to dip these in wax and make cheap fire starters.</li>
            <li> I am going to switch to cotton balls instead of these. They are fine but cotton balls are easier to take nail polish off with. Just different packaging. :)</li>
            <li> Nice cotton rounds for removing eye makeup.  They fit nicely in the round plastic container for cotton rounds and are just the right thickness for removing makeup. I have problems using and storing larger cotton rounds and seem to waste the thicker ones.  These are the right size for my needs, and I have not experienced any lint on them.</li>
            <li> These Cotton Rounds are not cheap and hold up.  I use them for my face and cleaning my nails.  I will order them again when I rung out.</li>
            <li> I love their products -- better to me than cotton balls for most things.  You can clean your face and ears pretty well with them and they work great for cleaning my dogs&#x27; ears (I have 2 dogs).</li>
            <li> It is one of the worst cotton pads I&#x27;ve ever used! It is too fluffy. When I use my Clinique toner with it, I can almost see the fibre stuck on my face!</li>
            <li> These are great cotton rounds...not sure what else to say!</li>
            <li> Product as stated...arrived on time.</li>
            <li> These do the trick, but my wife mentioned that they are no better than the store brand which typically sells for 1/3 the price.</li>
            <li> good deal, convenient</li>
            <li> I liked the other Swisspers better.  These were cheaper, so we gave them a shot.  Not impressed! Won&#x27;t buy these again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many cotton rounds for toner, wiping cuts with antiseptic and more. Swisspers are the best. They don&#x27;t come apart and you can use both sides before tossing them.</li>
            <li> I use this product to apply facial toner. It does the job well and the price is good. What a bargain!</li>
            <li> Great for toner or for removing make-up</li>
            <li> I love these cottons pads! I didn&#x27;t realize how much a difference it makes when  you buy the higher quality--it&#x27;s actually worth the extra dollar per pack. The cotton stays together really nicely and doesn&#x27;t peel, and the texture is smooth against my delicate skin :)</li>
            <li> Great product, delivery when expected!</li>
            <li> amount of 100 is good deal for the money, firm exterior with thick interior, so doesn&#x27;t feel like they&#x27;re going to fall apart as you&#x27;re using them, one goes a long way</li>
            <li> I stopped buying the generics because they kept leaving little wisps of cotton on my face. These are perfect - soft, fluffy enough without getting in the way, and don&#x27;t shed.</li>
            <li> I go through a lot of make up and I wanted to try cotton rounds instead of my typical routine of cotton balls to remove make up. Well, I would not buy this brand of cotton rounds, or any other product of theirs again. I use a lotion make up remover but when I used these cotton rounds, I had a bunch of loose pieces of cotton all over my face. It was horrible especially on my eyelids, where the cotton would get stuck on my eyelashes. I even tried wetting these down to see if that&#x27;d help but it didn&#x27;t. I&#x27;m not sure what use out there is perfect for this product, but removing make up is certainly not one of them.</li>
            <li> Great quality cotton rounds. I use them for my facial astringent every morning-- much cheaper than in Target or CVS but same great quality. Love them!</li>
            <li> These seem to come apart and flake when they are being used. I&#x27;m not sure why these are that way. I usually love swissper cotton products. Unfortunately, I would not recommend these for purchase.</li>
            <li> These are great cotton rounds.  One note is the price seems to fluctuate a lot on amazon.  I know it&#x27;s not much of a difference between 1.10 and 3.10 but if the price is low, grab a few and you will thank me later!</li>
            <li> These cotton rounds are too thick.... I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s made for the face but for the nails... I don&#x27;t recommend it for cleaning your face with this..</li>
            <li> Product as described...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cotton rounds, plain and simple, if you need to remove make up, clean a wound. All purpose simple pads</li>
            <li> i had always heard that these were the greatest, softest cotton rounds one could get. so i splurged and ordered these when i ran out last time. they weren&#x27;t any better than the drugstore brand and in fact are NOT as soft as some. they are a little rough and don&#x27;t hold up to a rigorous face wiping--they don&#x27;t completely disintegrate, but they start to come apart. i don&#x27;t think i&#x27;ll be ordering them again.</li>
            <li> I bought this to apply toner after shaving with a DE razor and these instantly fall apart upon encountering any stubble I may have missed. That being said they are better than cotton balls. I&#x27;m still looking for an alternative.</li>
            <li> It sucks up the toner enough so the pad doesn&#x27;t get watery and when using it, it doesn&#x27;t have a harsh feel or anything.</li>
            <li> I use these pretty much exclusively for taking off my eye make-up, and these are my favorite cotton rounds.  Other brands are too loosely woven and don&#x27;t hold up for even the brief amount of time needed to remove my make-up.  They are textured, but still feel smooth on the gentle skin of my eyes.  I will always buy this brand first when I can find it.</li>
            <li> You might think that all cotton pads are the same and buy the cheap store brand but you would be wrong. If you spend good money on skin care products buy the Swisspers. They hold their shape so you can use both sides which I need to, to remove all my waterproof mascara. No bits of cotton all over your face and toner bottles.</li>
