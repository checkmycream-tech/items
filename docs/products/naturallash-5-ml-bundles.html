            <li>Rapidlash works better.</li>
            <li>NaturalLASH :)</li>
            <li>it may irritate your eye, it&#x27;s better when not using makeup after this use, better to use at night or in the morning but no makeup.</li>
            <li>Okay so I received this on April 21, 2015.</li>
            <li>I have not finished the lash serum yet, but so far hair growth has been significant and the color is perfect.</li>
            <li>it is easy to apply, just wear like eyeliner</li>
            <li>This is easy to use and apply just follow the directions</li>
            <li>product is a natural eyelash serum , Natural LASH is the best lash and brow enhancer serum to grow thicker longer eyelashes and bolder eyebrows in about a month.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to apply just like wearing liquid eyeliner.</li>
            <li>Been 2 months and my bottle is still full my eyebrows and lashes are longer</li>
            <li>I have been using this for at least 9 months and I am very happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>but it subsidies quickly</li>
            <li>Currently I&#x27;ve re-ordered2 more! üòç</li>
            <li>But using this product is restoring my lashes back to their original fullness plus more .</li>
            <li>I started using it right away.</li>
            <li>but overall I am satisfied</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>feeling&amp;#34; the first 2 day</li>
            <li>I DID SEE VOLUME THE FIRST WEEK, BUT</li>
            <li>cause I see it becoming part of my daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li>As long as you apply it the right way, you should be fine.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li>It too early to notice much</li>
            <li>I will be doing updates of how it affects my eyelashes after a few weeks, and a more in depth review on my blog.</li>
            <li>my lashes are long and full.</li>
            <li>I have tried other lash products that have caused my lashes to grow really quickly and then fall out (eek!).</li>
            <li>Peptide has been clinically proven to trigger new hair growth.</li>
            <li>I see new hair follicles coming out on bald spots on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I recently lost most of my lashes due to eyelash extensions, so i needed something to help my lashes grow faster.</li>
            <li>where they are now short and look funny (to me).</li>
            <li>The Natural Last Growth Product does exactly what it says.</li>
            <li>When I bought this product I was expecting it to be clear, but it is a tan color.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;- as far as results go</li>
            <li>I have been using Natural Lash for 3 weeks but haven&#x27;t seen any change in my lashes yet.</li>
            <li>This product is made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>It is a complete waist of money.</li>
            <li>and I have been pleasantly surprised.</li>
            <li>I am ready  to place my next order.</li>
            <li>I WAS WONDERING IF MY SERUM WAS JUST OLD.  </li>
            <li>You apply like you would liquid eyeliner (An in most cases, a lot of Women generally are not experienced with liquid formation).</li>
            <li>I initially  purchased this because of the ingredients -(natural)  </li>
            <li>My thryoid is a little jacked and caused my once realllly long &amp; full eyebrows to kinda go away....</li>
            <li>I apply like eye liner with the very thin liner type brush and it&#x27;s very easy.</li>

            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference over the course of the next few months.</li>

            <li> I use it in the late afternoon and before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> It also nourishes skin around hair follicles, which helps to reverse damage done by false eyelashes and over plucking.</li>

            <li> this is a good product for anybody looking to repair damaged eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;- it is easy to apply, just wear like eyeliner&lt;br /&gt;- I wear contacts but I didn&#x27;t suffer from irritation&lt;br /&gt;- good quality serum, no parabens, made in the USA and best of all no animal testing&lt;br /&gt;- competitive pricing&lt;br /&gt;- as far as results go I have been using for about a month and a half and have noticed fuller eyelashes, nothing drastic but enough that I notice and appreciate&lt;br /&gt;- will continue to use in hopes of even more results&lt;br /&gt;- I assume this would benefit somebody with damaged eyelashes, it would help repair them&lt;br /&gt;received a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion</li>
            <li> I have not finished the lash serum yet, but so far hair growth has been significant and the color is perfect.</li>
            <li> I started noticing growth within 2 weeks. My lashes look great. There is slight irritation when the product is drying but overall I am satisfied</li>
            <li> I have been using Natural Lash for 3 weeks but haven&#x27;t seen any change in my lashes yet. I will give it another 2 weeks before I make a judgement. It says you will see visible results  in 5-8 weeks but I would think some growth would be visible sooner than 5 weeks!</li>
            <li> EXCELLENT AND PRICE WORTHY. GIVE IT A TRY BUT USE NIGHTLY</li>
            <li> The Natural Last Growth Product does exactly what it says. I recently lost most of my lashes due to eyelash extensions, so i needed something to help my lashes grow faster. I see that some people explain in their review that they experienced a burning sensation. However, i did not experience that feeling. As long as you apply it the right way, you should be fine. You apply like you would liquid eyeliner (An in most cases, a lot of Women generally are not experienced with liquid formation). This product gave my eyes a bolder look. And as you can see in my photo, my lashes are getting somewhere. I couldn&#x27;t be more happier. All in all... I am loving it! I received this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect product to have fuller longer eyelashes , this product came just as described .It arrived quickly and the packaging was perfect .It arrived in perfect condition .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is a natural eyelash serum , Natural LASH is the best lash and brow enhancer serum to grow thicker longer eyelashes and bolder eyebrows in about a month. Peptide has been clinically proven to trigger new hair growth. It also nourishes skin around hair follicles, which helps to reverse damage done by false eyelashes and over plucking. This product is made with natural ingredients. And if you stop using it, your lashes will not fall out, unlike other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for awhile and I have seen great results .My eyelashes are thicker and longer , I did get false eyelashes a lot over the past year and they have done a lot of damage to my own lashes . But using this product is restoring my lashes back to their original fullness plus more . This is easy to use and apply just follow the directions and you will have beautiful fuller and longer lashes .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product .</li>
            <li> Its was working good! After 2weeks its like nothing! U can&#x27;t filling anything when you apply in your eye slash!</li>
            <li> Would not recommend, Lost 5 eyelashes in a couple of days. if you use to the corner of eyelashes it causes irritation. Didn&#x27;t notice ANY difference . Rapidlash works better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I bought this product about one month ago and my eye lashes are definitely longer. I have noticed a difference in volume as well. I can&#x27;t wait to see the difference over the course of the next few months.</li>
            <li> I will order second for my friend ,</li>
            <li> I think this grow serum is great. I am actually seeing result after 4 weeks  of using. Will continue to use.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know whether the product worked or not.  It made my eyelids itch, so I only used it for about a week.  I had used Revitalash before without a problem.</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfully for 2 months.  I have seen no result at all.  This is a scam.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  It is a complete waist of money.</li>
            <li> It really works! Currently I&#x27;ve re-ordered2 more! üòç</li>
            <li> I just received this product so I haven&#x27;t used it yet, but everything seems to be intact, the box, the tube, and safety seal. When I bought this product I was expecting it to be clear, but it is a tan color. After looking at the images of other tubes I realized I had been mistaken. Also this product is less expensive than other brands so I wanted to give it a try. I will be doing updates of how it affects my eyelashes after a few weeks, and a more in depth review on my blog. - I used this three times now and what I&#x27;ve noticed that it does get a little crusty after it dries so I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you are going out somewhere. I use it in the late afternoon and before I go to bed.</li>
            <li> Inwas very disappointed with the size. It used to be larger under a different name. I would not recommend this.</li>
            <li> Works amazing!! Been 2 months and my bottle is still full my eyebrows and lashes are longer</li>
            <li> this is the best lash enhance/growth serum  I have used- my lashes are long and full. ( I also used it on my brows and it grew in an area that had stopped growing)  I have tried other lash products that have caused my lashes to grow really quickly and then fall out (eek!). I initially  purchased this because of the ingredients -(natural)  I have been using this for at least 9 months and I am very happy with the results.  keep up the good work NaturalLASH :)</li>
            <li> 4 stars because I find it hard to put on. Great product but would like an easier application. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s too close of the eye area it may irritate your eye, it&#x27;s better when not using makeup after this use, better to use at night or in the morning but no makeup. It leaves a yellowish color when dried.</li>
            <li> I started using this product over a month ago and the hair on both my brows and lashes are growing so long my girlfriends have noticed without me saying anything. Best thing on the market for the price.</li>
            <li> A friend who had battled cancer told me about this product. She told me that she had tried several and this worked the best and was a good price point, too. About a year prior, I had tried a fancy name brand and I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference. Then I tried this and I have been pleasantly surprised. My thryoid is a little jacked and caused my once realllly long &amp; full eyebrows to kinda go away....where they are now short and look funny (to me). I usually just put this on at night and after 2 weeks, they look like they are growing back!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for a great product!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product faithfully 2x a day for over a month and see NO DIFFERENCE in my lashes. It does not work as claimed.</li>
            <li> I ordered it for my eyebrows and observed the improvement 1 week after using it. I applied it 2x a day, before make up and at bedtime. I see new hair follicles coming out on bald spots on my eyebrows. I also applied it on my lower eyelashes and have seen some improvement also. I am ready  to place my next order.</li>
            <li> Okay so I received this on April 21, 2015. I started using it right away. As of today, may 11, 2015 I definitely see a ton of improvement. I definitely have longer lashes and I am using way less mascara. I didn&#x27;t find that the serum irritates my eyes and it&#x27;s super easy to apply just like wearing liquid eyeliner. I am happy I bought two bottles cause I see it becoming part of my daily beauty regimen.</li>
            <li> Only been 2 weeks, can&#x27;t tell it is working yet.  I believe I will be returning because my eyes feel uncomfortable at night when wearing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for several days now, twice daily. I must admit that I too had that &amp;#34;heavy feeling&amp;#34; the first 2 day but it subsidies quickly and now I don&#x27;t feel it at all. I apply like eye liner with the very thin liner type brush and it&#x27;s very easy. It too early to notice much but I did notice something after the second day of 4 applications-- one of my lashes grows downward and I have to use a curler to keep it up even with mascara but with this serum I don&#x27;t have to do that anymore!! My lash grows upward now!! Love that!  I would recommend trying this for yourself and can&#x27;t wait to see what else happens for me. Great item Received for my honest review</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THE PRODUCT FOR ALMOST 1 MONTH. I DID SEE VOLUME THE FIRST WEEK, BUT NOT LONGER LASHES. IM ALSO HAVING TROUBLE WITH IT BECAUSE THE BROWN LIQUID DRIES ON MY LIDS LIKE I HAVE EYE BUGGERS. I WAS WONDERING IF MY SERUM WAS JUST OLD.  I originally bought &amp;#34;Eyelash Growth Serum - NaturalLASH - Best Lash and Brow Enhancer Serum - Grow Thicker Longer Eyelashes and Bolder Eyebrows in About a Month + Natural&amp;#34;.  ALSO, I NOTICED amazon SAID OTHER PPL BOUGHT THE OTHER PRODUCT AS WELL, but IVE BEEN LOOKING AT IT ONLINE AND IT DOESNT LOOK ANY DIFFERENT THAT WHAT I BOUGHT ALREADY? ANY THOUGHTS ON THIS ANYONE? and about the eye buggers problem?</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 weeks,  just waiting on my results.  It takes about 5 weeks to see results.</li>
