            <li>They loved the cream and so did I.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how good this stuff was until I didn&#x27;t have it around anymore.  </li>
            <li>Works good as a moisturizer though.</li>

            <li>I love to shop on Amazon!</li>
            <li>Both my husband and I love it!  </li>
            <li>so it is very easy to see the difference.</li>
            <li>Absorbs very easily.  </li>
            <li>Great cream that makes your skin feel good, and look good, but not right away.  </li>
            <li>It made my skin feel really nice and minimize the fine lines and puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.....  </li>
            <li>who could ask for anything more.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>I should know better than to think that a cream called stem cell therapy is a scam.</li>
            <li>and, hopefully, people will start telling me again what lovely skin I have.</li>
            <li>She has many wrinkles.  </li>
            <li>We have not been able to contact customer service for answers to questions at this time, we will continue to try.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten any more since I started using it 3 or 4 years ago.</li>
            <li>Add more stem cell to it and perhaps it will generate the firming you are claiming in your advertisement.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it works, but I love the way it feels.  </li>
            <li>I love love love stem cell therapy..</li>
            <li>I Really love Stem Cell and would order it again..</li>
            <li>I love this product and the way it feels on my skin this is one product I will continue to use.</li>
            <li>My crows feet look 85% better.</li>
            <li>My wife has been using this for awhile and love the results.</li>
            <li>so thank you for making such a wonderful product and making a 94 year old grandmother happy</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it about a month, so I am hopeful that soon I will see great results.</li>
            <li>I had bought the cream for wrinkles, which it helped smooth out, but was excited to notice the redness on my cheeks, chin, and forehead were no longer visible.  </li>
            <li>Once it liquifies, it will not return to its original consistency.</li>
            <li>No unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li>Works great but will turn to liquid if left in high temp areas.</li>
            <li>Only 4 stars because like most, I&#x27;m still looking for that miracle cream!</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY SILKY AND GOES ON SMOOTHLY</li>
            <li>And my 28 and my 18 year old daughters also love it</li>
            <li>I can tell right now that over time this is going to work out</li>
            <li>I am 91 years old and my face is relatively free of wrinkles, considering my age.  </li>
            <li>I am sure it would be of benefit for a younger generation.</li>
            <li>I have many creams but decided to use only this product so I would know if it worked alone.  </li>
            <li>My face has change soooooooooooooooo much!  </li>
            <li>When I first started using this new formula, I had bags and wrinkles, but now my face is sprouting new growth!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nicely smooth, but is it supposed to be green?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>not sure i see any differance gave it a fair shot used as directed untill it was gone</li>
            <li>so i don t know if its good yet lets give it a 3 star because im not sure</li>
            <li>I believe the deep wrinkles around my mouth and nose are softening, and the fine lines around my eyes appear to be softening.</li>
            <li>Most for the least - the genuine product.</li>
            <li>and I really feel this product is the reason.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t say if the stem cell is THE ONE.  </li>
            <li>very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>; But the bottle looks the same.&lt;br /&gt;the missus says she uses it very sparingly...</li>
            <li>like it real well</li>
            <li>Thank you for your fast delivery</li>
            <li>and it costs too much.</li>
            <li>I really believe in this product.  </li>
            <li>Honestly I do not think it really helps the skin cell re-activated as it claims, but as a moisturizer it is a good product.</li>
            <li>Not even dead sea soap and rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found the product to be very drying for my particular &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; skin.</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth and has less lines.</li>
            <li>I do like how it feels when I put it on (very silky, not greasy) &amp; unlike the other reviews I do not notice a strong smell at all, but I did not see any change in the appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>and I have been taking care of my skin with various products starting with Vaseline in the 70&#x27; to Oil of Olay in the 80&#x27; to exotic oils and hyalauronic acid products to date.</li>
            <li>My makeup goes on more smoothly with this cream applied at least 15 minutes prior.</li>
            <li>I really llke this stem cell cream for my face, it keeps my face feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li>I bought it for her birthday a few years ago and when she needs more i replace it.</li>
            <li>cells\\&quot; is the new marketing buzz-phrase used by shysters to con people into paying for everything from eternal youth to curing chronic diseases.</li>
            <li>It is not greasy, and it is very soft.</li>
            <li>First product i have tried that actually does what it promised to do - minimize wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I was disturbed when someone mentioned to me recently that they were using \\&quot;stem cell\\&quot; products, and now I&#x27;m on a mission to make sure that consumers understand that there is NO SUCH THING as a topical \\&quot;stem cell\\&quot; cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Please note that with this particular product, at least one of the main ingredients is entirely fictitious, the \\&quot;doctor\\&quot; endorsing this product is paid to do so, and the claims made by this company are not verified by any reputable agency.  </li>
            <li>That was a complete surprise.  </li>
            <li>I did not use it fast enough for auto ship so cancelled.</li>
            <li>People seem to be quite amazed when I tell them how old I am.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for more than two years and continually (at least once a month) have people comment on my skin.</li>
            <li>But after not using it for a couple of months (when I run out of it), my skin starts to look old again.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into my skin and makes it feel soft.  </li>
            <li>basically they try to get as much point of purchase sales as possible before you find out</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 65 years old</li>
            <li>have to use sandpaper to keep the bark down, but I guess it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>No other products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 59 years old and have definitely seen improvement.  </li>
            <li>MY 91 year old mother in law purchased this cream and after 2 days of use she had an allergic reaction and needed to have medical treatment.  </li>
            <li>My family have commented that it has reduced very deep wrinkles between my eyes and my skin feels soft and moist all day.</li>
            <li>Additionally, this particular company has been accused of failing to process refunds, over-billing, selling empty jars and general fraud.&lt;br</li>

            <li> I received this as a gift from my Mom, but I would definitely buy it (again, for its moisturizing, long lasting at that, effect)!</li>
            <li> However, I would continue using it along with the other creams and serums since I&#x27;m definitely seeing results.  </li>
            <li> &quot; \\&quot;do not buy extra product, do not buy the other products...</li>
            <li> A couple dabs goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> During winter, I&#x27;ll reapply if my skin feels dry during the day.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not ever have I used a product that made my skin feel so soft persistently using very little.  </li>
            <li> and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the appearance of my skin, only that the under eye area felt tighter, but I still noticed bags and dark circles that did not change in appearance.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product ONE time on my entire face (a few previous times just under the eye area).  </li>

            <li> Other then a descent moisturizer</li>
            <li> this product is a sham, i have not noitced one single ounce of difference since using it a  month ago, not to mention it took the company deals2u 2 and a half months to even ship it to me (due to no stock)</li>
            <li> I also see an ever so slight texture change.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years and after about 6 weeks or less you will see your wrinkles vanish.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This product clears face and attempers wrinkles.</li>
            <li> This product is one of my staples.  I use it daily and it works for me.  I will keep ordering.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over a year now. Honestly I do not think it really helps the skin cell re-activated as it claims, but as a moisturizer it is a good product.</li>
            <li> Think it is terrific!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.....  yes it makes a difference.  I am 70 and look 50.  who could ask for anything more.  I have been suing it for about 3 years now.</li>
            <li> After 30 days, I noticed that my roscea had disappeared.  I had bought the cream for wrinkles, which it helped smooth out, but was excited to notice the redness on my cheeks, chin, and forehead were no longer visible.  That was a complete surprise.  Will continue to order this product because of the clearing of the roscea.</li>
            <li> Most for the least - the genuine product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 8 years. I have seen a great reduction in wrinkles. I am 78 but look much younger and I really feel this product is the reason.  I like the texture and also that I can leave it on under makeup.  My makeup goes on more smoothly with this cream applied at least 15 minutes prior.</li>
            <li> Great. Love it.  Can I still get it for 19.00</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for about 6 months now.  I have received compliments on my skin, but I also use other creams and serums with copper peptides and retinol.  I really couldn&#x27;t say if the stem cell is THE ONE.  However, I would continue using it along with the other creams and serums since I&#x27;m definitely seeing results.  I use the copper peptides and stem cell cream in the morning and the retinol at night.  I&#x27;m 59 years old and have definitely seen improvement.  I am, however, a little disgusted at the miracle claims this company makes about it&#x27;s cream.  It&#x27;s good, but it ain&#x27;t no miracle. I&#x27;m also concerned that some reviwers found the smell gross.  I wonder if they didn&#x27;t receive some bad batches.  I&#x27;ve never noticed a foul odor coming from this cream.</li>
            <li> Be careful. Works great but will turn to liquid if left in high temp areas. Once it liquifies, it will not return to its original consistency.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Mom likes it!!</li>
            <li> I just received this product last night and I was nervous after reading some of the reviews on the Internet. All I can say is these people are simply haters. I am 50+ and I have been taking care of my skin with various products starting with Vaseline in the 70&#x27; to Oil of Olay in the 80&#x27; to exotic oils and hyalauronic acid products to date. I tried rice phytoceramides, but nothing makes my skin feel like this cream. Not even dead sea soap and rose water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not ever have I used a product that made my skin feel so soft persistently using very little.  A couple dabs goes a very long way. I did this last night and this morning at six a.m.  It is now three - twenty in the afternoon, and my skin is the softest it has ever been in my life. I would buy it for this alone. I mean my skin is baby soft. I also see an ever so slight texture change.  I can tell right now that over time this is going to work out very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing to think about. Buy it and see if it works for you. Highest Possible Recommendation.</li>
            <li> She got this from a mail order co and likes it and after some time told me she would like another.&lt;br /&gt;she is very cute 16 y... after 47 yrs putin up with me  LoL&lt;br /&gt;don&#x27;t know about the formula or the &amp;#34;Derm SRC&amp;#34; But the bottle looks the same.&lt;br /&gt;the missus says she uses it very sparingly...</li>
            <li> I bought this several years ago and was assigned auto ship. I did not use it fast enough for auto ship so cancelled. Recently I used it again and it has firmed skin on my cheeks, is silky and not greasy and absorbs well. Am buying again.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.  Does not do anything!  I should know better than to think that a cream called stem cell therapy is a scam.</li>
            <li> I got hooked into one of those auto-ship things years ago and had enough jars to share with my office staff.  They loved the cream and so did I.  When Obamacare drove me to close my practice, I stopped the shipments and started using other products.  I didn&#x27;t realize how good this stuff was until I didn&#x27;t have it around anymore.  Also, the compliments on my beautiful skin seemed to stop coming.  I found it on Amazon now and, hopefully, people will start telling me again what lovely skin I have.</li>
            <li> Great cream that makes your skin feel good, and look good, but not right away.  It&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  I like it a lot.  Thank you!!!</li>
            <li> nothing is happening to my face.  Too soon to tell.</li>
            <li> I did not notice any change after using this product. I do like how it feels when I put it on (very silky, not greasy) &amp; unlike the other reviews I do not notice a strong smell at all, but I did not see any change in the appearance of my skin. Works good as a moisturizer though. Would probably not buy again.</li>
            <li> I have been using stem cell therapy for quite some time now.  I am 91 years old and my face is relatively free of wrinkles, considering my age.  People seem to be quite amazed when I tell them how old I am.  They have guessed I am seventy-five.  Using it has become part of my routine morning at night.  I know someone in her sixties who does not use it.  She has many wrinkles.  I intend to tell her about cell therapy but it is a delicate subject to broach.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT ONCE PER DAY AND VOILA!  i LOOK YOUNGER.  IT IS VERY SILKY AND GOES ON SMOOTHLY</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hopeful that I will see excellent restoration results soon. I believe the deep wrinkles around my mouth and nose are softening, and the fine lines around my eyes appear to be softening. I&#x27;ve only used it about a month, so I am hopeful that soon I will see great results.</li>
            <li> I have used this before.  I can&#x27;t find another product nearly as good.  More expensive products don&#x27;t work as well.  I use it on my hands too - so it is very easy to see the difference.</li>
            <li> I really llke this stem cell cream for my face, it keeps my face feeling baby soft.</li>
            <li> MY 91 year old mother in law purchased this cream and after 2 days of use she had an allergic reaction and needed to have medical treatment.  We have not been able to contact customer service for answers to questions at this time, we will continue to try.  No expiration date or description of cream on label.  I would stay away from this cream!</li>
            <li> product arrived ahead of schedule and I use this product a lot  like it real well</li>
            <li> Not as I expected the results. I am using the 3rd one and that will be it</li>
            <li> Love this product!  I need to buy some more!  It made my skin feel really nice and minimize the fine lines and puffiness around my eyes.</li>
            <li> This cr&amp;egrave;me is especially gentle and makes a great, great foundation for your make-up as well as feeding your skin.</li>
            <li> I like the product.  I use this every other day from my other moisturizers. I use hydrochloric Acid with Vitamin C, and this over.  Its a good smoothing moisturizer. I see the benefits from using it.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t dislike the cream, but I haven&#x27;t seen any difference since using it.  Probably won&#x27;t reorder.</li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to every friend and family member. At the age of 69, you name it and I&#x27;ve probably tried it. This product is head and shoulders above anything I have used before. My family have commented that it has reduced very deep wrinkles between my eyes and my skin feels soft and moist all day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only giving 4 stars as 5 would be unfair at this point.  I have only used this product ONE time on my entire face (a few previous times just under the eye area).  So, for my review.... I would give this an A+ as a moisturizer!!!  I had used a prescription formula on my skin for 2 days that caused irritation (redness, burning and peeling).  I GENEROUSLY applied this product on my entire face.  IMMEDIATELY, it felt like SILK!  The next day, the SAME SILKY feeling remained (without a second application).  It is NOT greasy... just soothingly silky.  If ONLY for a MOISTERIZER ---- I say, BUY IT!  My face has ALREADY recovered from the harsher prescription due to ONE use of this.  Relief...and surprise that something can moisturize THIS WELL with ONE application.  I received this as a gift from my Mom, but I would definitely buy it (again, for its moisturizing, long lasting at that, effect)!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than two years and continually (at least once a month) have people comment on my skin. I&#x27;m now over 60 and didn&#x27;t get comments like that even in my twenties. I doubt it&#x27;s truly stem cells, but it works! I use it in the morning as a moisturizer year round. During winter, I&#x27;ll reapply if my skin feels dry during the day. That&#x27;s all I do. No other products. I&#x27;m sold.</li>
            <li> its not made from babies</li>
            <li> this is a very good cream, I really liked it. Thank you for your fast delivery</li>
            <li> I do like this stuff......hasn&#x27;t removed wrinkles, but I haven&#x27;t gotten any more since I started using it 3 or 4 years ago. Only 4 stars because like most, I&#x27;m still looking for that miracle cream!</li>
            <li> I have used this cream for 1 1/2 years now I am very satisfied and have re-orderd twice I am 75 yrs and get a lot of comments on my skin</li>
            <li> not sure i see any differance gave it a fair shot used as directed untill it was gone</li>
            <li> use every morning and am very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Like being able to order one at a time...instead of being locked in by the manufacturer to every month delivery!</li>
            <li> Add more stem cell to it and perhaps it will generate the firming you are claiming in your advertisement.  Otherwise it at least doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt the skin.</li>
            <li> bought for my grandmother..she loves he product..so thank you for making such a wonderful product and making a 94 year old grandmother happy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it works, but I love the way it feels.  It is not greasy, and it is very soft. Absorbs very easily.  I like to use it on my neck</li>
            <li> I keep thinking that this can&#x27;t possibly work. But after not using it for a couple of months (when I run out of it), my skin starts to look old again. So I reorder and after a couple of weeks, I like what I see in the mirror again.  It&#x27;s happened 3 times now!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this product worked any differently than any other moisturizer I have used in the past. I don&#x27;t like the ingredient list and it costs too much.</li>
            <li> I only used this product for about 3 weeks and I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in the appearance of my skin, only that the under eye area felt tighter, but I still noticed bags and dark circles that did not change in appearance.</li>
            <li> My mother in law loves this product. I bought it for her birthday a few years ago and when she needs more i replace it.</li>
            <li> this product is a sham, i have not noitced one single ounce of difference since using it a  month ago, not to mention it took the company deals2u 2 and a half months to even ship it to me (due to no stock) i had to hound and hound them to get an answer as to why it hadent arrived after 2 weeks. i think il stick with olay.</li>
            <li> I  purchased this item not for myself.  My sister use it  and she very happy with results.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer.  It is never sticky, or greasy.  It absorbs into my skin and makes it feel soft.  No unpleasant odor.</li>
            <li> I love love love stem cell therapy.. I will never use anything else on my face.. And my 28 and my 18 year old daughters also love it</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t fall for this gimmick. Other then a descent moisturizer you&#x27;ll not see the difference they claim after using this product. Save your money folks.</li>
            <li> I am a happy customer! My order arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Product is great. First product i have tried that actually does what it promised to do - minimize wrinkles. No side effects either.</li>
            <li> I was disturbed when someone mentioned to me recently that they were using \\&quot;stem cell\\&quot; products, and now I&#x27;m on a mission to make sure that consumers understand that there is NO SUCH THING as a topical \\&quot;stem cell\\&quot; cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that with this particular product, at least one of the main ingredients is entirely fictitious, the \\&quot;doctor\\&quot; endorsing this product is paid to do so, and the claims made by this company are not verified by any reputable agency.  Additionally, this particular company has been accused of failing to process refunds, over-billing, selling empty jars and general fraud.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Stem cells\\&quot; is the new marketing buzz-phrase used by shysters to con people into paying for everything from eternal youth to curing chronic diseases. This \\&quot;therapy\\&quot; is snake oil!</li>
            <li> I Really love Stem Cell and would order it again.. I would never order any thing else...Its the only cream that I have tried that works !</li>
            <li> Saw absolutely no changes at all.</li>
            <li> I actually like this alright and ould use it again, it became a daily product when I last used it.</li>
            <li> Did not do a thing after 3mons.</li>
            <li> When I first started using this new formula, I had bags and wrinkles, but now my face is sprouting new growth!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nicely smooth, but is it supposed to be green?&lt;br /&gt;I have to use sandpaper to keep the bark down, but I guess it&#x27;s worth it. I just wish the termites and birds would keep away from my face!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product and the way it feels on my skin this is one product I will continue to use. I love to shop on Amazon!</li>
            <li> The cream was not even as thick as a ponds cold cream. I took photos before and after, no change. applied twice daily liberally.&lt;br /&gt;But what ires me, is while the shipment is on the way, I received at least 3 calls for upgrades and add on sales. basically they try to get as much point of purchase sales as possible before you find out it is not anything special.&lt;br /&gt;my recommendation\\&quot; \\&quot;do not buy extra product, do not buy the other products...\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;finally, they then tried to auto deduct money from my account ( actually they did), even though they were notified not to. had to spend at least two hours of my life fixing their mistake... I do not trust the integrity of this company. I believe they took the money intentionally...</li>
            <li> Great for night cream or under makeUp.  Absorbs and isn&#x27;t  greasy.</li>
            <li> I am using Stem Cell Therapy for a couple of years now and am very happy with it. My skin is very smooth and has less lines.</li>
            <li> I have used this for a few years and after about 6 weeks or less you will see your wrinkles vanish.  My crows feet look 85% better.</li>
            <li> love this product will order again!!! thank you stem cell</li>
            <li> Both my husband and I love it!  We will recommend it to others for their personal use and enjoyment.  Dah!</li>
            <li> i just stared using i  about 2 weeks so i don t know if its good yet lets give it a 3 star because im not sure</li>
            <li> My wife has been using this for awhile and love the results.</li>
            <li> this cream does not work!!!!!!!!! It&#x27;s a waste of money!!!!! :(</li>
            <li> While I thought it helped my skin somewhat, I felt that it was too expensive for the short time that it lasted. It seemed to just evaporate in the jar!! Believe there are cheaper products that work as well.</li>
            <li> I am told I have great skin and have been using this product for years from purchasing over an infomercial.  After I wash my face,&lt;br /&gt;this is my second skin.</li>
            <li> I had a spot about the size of a half dollar from a bad sunburn and when I used this it took it away. I only have a little spot like a freckle now.</li>
            <li> I found the product to be very drying for my particular &amp;#34;aging&amp;#34; skin. I am sure it would be of benefit for a younger generation.</li>
            <li> I have many creams but decided to use only this product so I would know if it worked alone.  My face has change soooooooooooooooo much!  It didn&#x27;t dawn on me until someone told me I had beautiful skin!  I started looking in the mirror and also realized there was a big change.  I&#x27;m 65 years old and I was just told by a waiter that he thought I was 55!  I really believe in this product.  Try it and you will see!</li>
            <li> I ordered this without seeing the ingredients.  I would like to return it.  It is loaded with Parabans which are cancer causing.  I would rather have wrinkles than cancer.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
