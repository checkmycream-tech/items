            <li>It does a wonderful job for shorter hair and the barrel is shorter which I really like.  </li>

            <li>The size of the iron is perfect for some kind of short hair.</li>
            <li>This one works great, though it does get really hot.  </li>
            <li>But very cheap price.</li>
            <li>Heats quickly and works great but feels cheap.</li>
            <li>I am glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li>Most of mine were purchased at a beauty supply house.</li>
            <li>I love that it has a holder for the hair, rather than having to use gloves as in the wands.</li>
            <li>I love the curling iron</li>
            <li>This was the smallest size we could find reasonable priced and it worked out great.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>I am glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I spend the money on this product.</li>
            <li>Without the fringe, it made a cute up-do for the holidays.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure if one had the patience and wanted an all over tight-curl style, it would do the job.  </li>
            <li>i love itt</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>perfect size for short hair</li>
            <li>The low setting is just perfect for accurate styling without overheating.</li>
            <li>great product, true to description, small, good quality, good temps&lt;</li>
            <li>and I was glad to find it available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>I received this iron very fast,in good condition but returned it because it was not what</li>
            <li>Good iron works well, very well.</li>
            <li>but this iron is perfect for touching up the dead spots.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how well the curls stay in the hair and how easy it was to curl it.</li>
            <li>and it is still which is still going strong and works quite well.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t get hot, it gets warm.</li>
            <li>The curls are beautiful if you use properly, by that</li>
            <li>I have very straight, short hair, and this curling curls it perfectly.</li>
            <li>and I would feel fine about ordering from this company again.</li>
            <li>This one works perfectly and was delivered in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li>The item is fine</li>
            <li>Shorter barrel, but my hair is is about 3 inches below my shoulders and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li>It works fine for my intent.</li>
            <li>This takes some time to heat up, but if you want tight, spiral curls, this barrel size is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This iron is a great size for people with short hair.  </li>
            <li>Infinite heat control makes it nice for however much time you have.</li>
            <li>I got this curling iron because I have short hair, and this works great for curls, and to flip my hair up.</li>
            <li>It is great  for short hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for short hair like mine.</li>
            <li>great for the short hair</li>
            <li>The curling iron doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly it pulls on the hair .The</li>
            <li>Great tool for giving you the curly updo&#x27;s coming back in.</li>
            <li>great product - would definitely order again</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t need to use it often, but when, for some reason, I get a small patch of hair that flattens in the area of my face, this provides the perfect fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>And just as important, it cools off quick so it can be but away before I leave.</li>
            <li>and this will probably be great for when my hair grows out, so I&#x27;m not really worried about it.</li>
            <li>Good luck future consumers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great, little, light weight curling iron, but packs a powerful styling punch!  </li>
            <li>It  heats very fast and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li>The iron heats quickly and heats well.  </li>
            <li>It heats quickly and curls hair well.  </li>
            <li>It heats up fairly quick and has the plastic safety tip on the end</li>
            <li>It is very hot, so</li>
            <li>Its really nice haing a barrel that small, and its does good heating up and keeping hot.</li>
            <li>I received this item even earlier than promised, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>It heats up quickly so I can use it right away.</li>
            <li>So far I am satisfied with the product and the item was shipped promptly.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair that has gotten more curly &amp; in some areas frizzy</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 curling irons and was able to get them with free shipping which was cheaper for me than buying one that was several dollars cheaper but wanted a fortune to ship it.</li>
            <li>It heated up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>IT BURNED MY HAIR RIGHT OFF.</li>
            <li>Great for small curls..</li>
            <li>They work well and especially for such a great price.</li>
            <li>A curling iron with 3/8 inch barrel is hard to find and I was happy to locate this one.  </li>
            <li>I tried using the hi setting and found that it was too hot.  </li>
            <li>I took it on vacation and the first time I used it, it came apart.  </li>
            <li>These curlers get extremely hot...</li>
            <li>I have short hair and the small barrel on this iron works perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li>Putting this electric curling iron works great for me since my hair is thick.  </li>
            <li>I get my hair cut short in summer and find this size barrel works better that the 5/8th.</li>
            <li>I love this curling iron for tiny curls.</li>
            <li>The hot setting is so hot you can burn your scalp, so  </li>
            <li>and I am able to have multiple style using this.</li>
            <li>This size is impossible to find in stores; I am pleased with how it functions; heats up,quickly, easy to use and fairly priced.</li>
            <li>The temperature of this curling iron is suitable, not too high, not too low.</li>
            <li>Curls well, gets hot pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast and stays hot.</li>
            <li>On the high setting, it worked very well and very fast.  </li>
            <li>This did the job beautifully and left me with a full head of little tiny curls!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it works very well</li>
            <li>May. The curling iron worked very well.</li>
            <li>Heats and curls fast.</li>
            <li>No matter how much hair I curled at a time or</li>
            <li>This is a fabulous curling iron with 2 different size rods that are inter-changeable.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>It heats up fast and curls very well.</li>
            <li>Works really well.</li>
            <li>I took it away and it took the whole pice of hair with it...</li>
            <li>Very unimpressive.  </li>
            <li>It arrived much quicker anticipated.</li>
            <li>It heats up really fast</li>
            <li>it heats up fast </li>
            <li>Heat&#x27;s up fast and gives me the curl and lift I like when I do my hair.</li>
            <li>Thanks for making this iron.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice for my curly hair to put in these tiny curls along with my regular ones.</li>
            <li>I usually just want to curl some tendrils that hang down when I have my hair up, and this does the trick perfectly.  </li>
            <li>I go from burning my fine hair to not curling it at all between the high and low</li>
            <li>Tiny but powerful!  </li>
            <li>but since I just started using it, it must be noted that it is easy to handle and heats really quickly--be careful not to burn yourself on the barrel--and it performs its function well.</li>
            <li>my hair is very thick but fine &amp; the the weight of it can flatten on top of my head.</li>
            <li>This is a nice curling iron if you want really small curls.</li>
            <li>the older I get.</li>
            <li>I got this because I have super short hair and was looking for something to help out.</li>
            <li>This very small radius curling iron barrow captures little whisks of hair perfectly.</li>
            <li>The only regret is that there is no indication when it has come up to temperature; there is a red light when it is plugged in, but I didn&#x27;t find any indication change for when it is hot.  </li>
            <li>It, is very hard to find good mini curling irons, I purchased this one for my Mother, and when I do her hair we use it, She loves it.</li>
            <li>I bought the tiny 3/8&amp;#34; size, having gotten really comfortable with my hair curling routine using a large tapered barrel, and wanting another option for a different look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;d probably be a great one to use on a child because it is so small and doesn&#x27;t get excruciatingly</li>
            <li>It is a bit unwieldy to use--but it is the only 3/8 inch curling iron I have found that is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I had purchased a new one and thrown  it away ...</li>
            <li>So imagine my surprise that by the 15 th of July this new Helen of Troy curling iron is already boom.</li>
            <li>i have used Helen of Troy products in the past and have been satisfied.  </li>
            <li>Cons: It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li>Since I just got this curling iron, I can&#x27;t evaluate it further than my first test--it worked.  </li>
            <li>This helen of Troy 1538 Spring Curling Iron, White, 3/8 inch Barrel curling iron is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>Item just as described, I have been using helen of Troy for years, I love this curling iron, small enough for short hair and also great for tight curls that last all day.</li>
            <li>I really like the long barrel which makes curling my hair go much faster.</li>
            <li>I used this rubish to try and do tight curls, I used it proporly and the minute I put my hair on the wand I heard a hissing sound and smelled burning smell....</li>
            <li>Bought this primarily for making tight curls for a period hairstyle for a show.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really hard to find a mini size curling iron any more.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend this product because of the heating and it has held up so far.  </li>
            <li>I needed the size but iron offers no settings.</li>
            <li>I have very short straight hair (in a pixie cut) and I needed to curl it for a play I was in.</li>
            <li>i have naturally curly hair but its a bit damaged from dying it</li>
            <li>my curls look natural and no one will ever know.</li>
            <li>and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if it works the same on every kind of hair (I&#x27;m white with long, fine, somewhat dry hair), or if I got a defective one, but I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I have thick coarse hair that can take the higher heat setting.  </li>
            <li>I mean ensuring you complete the full rotation of the iron so that all the hair is curled to the very ends.</li>
            <li>The lower setting is fine when you want a small but looser curl.</li>
            <li>So definitely try this if you wish, especially if you have super short hair.</li>
            <li>this product does not get hot enough for afro American hair</li>
            <li>The light indicates when it is on , so you are not likely to burn your house down by forgetting to turn it off.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a high and low setting.</li>
            <li>Has both High and Low settings.</li>
            <li>Heats up fast, has limited settings but holds heat well.</li>
            <li>Shipping came super fast, it actually worked, and it is small enough for really short hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: still not good for short short hair (but that&#x27;s mostly my fault, and I kinda knew that was gonna happen.)</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I wanted a curling iron small enough to leave cute little curls in my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Gets hot enough to curl thick, straight, short hair with ease.</li>
            <li>For me, it takes a few hours to do my hair with this, (my hair is over a foot and a half long, and its thick) and it keeps it&#x27;s shape for the most part with a little help from hairspray. :)</li>
            <li>what they say about a not long enough tip to keep from burning your fingers is spot on.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t take a long time to heat up, the curls will be super small.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The size of the iron is perfect for some kind of short hair.</li>
            <li> This one works great, though it does get really hot.  </li>
            <li> But very cheap price.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and works great but feels cheap.</li>
            <li> I am glad I purchased this item.</li>
            <li> Most of mine were purchased at a beauty supply house.</li>
            <li> I love that it has a holder for the hair, rather than having to use gloves as in the wands.</li>
            <li> I love the curling iron</li>
            <li> This was the smallest size we could find reasonable priced and it worked out great.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Perfect for short hair</li>
            <li> I would like to have been able to give more stars, but.....</li>

            <li> I am glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I spend the money on this product.</li>
            <li> Without the fringe, it made a cute up-do for the holidays.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure if one had the patience and wanted an all over tight-curl style, it would do the job.  </li>
            <li> i love itt</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> perfect size for short hair</li>
            <li> The low setting is just perfect for accurate styling without overheating.</li>
            <li> great product, true to description, small, good quality, good temps&lt;</li>
            <li> and I was glad to find it available from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> I received this iron very fast,in good condition but returned it because it was not what</li>
            <li> Good iron works well, very well.</li>
            <li> but this iron is perfect for touching up the dead spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how well the curls stay in the hair and how easy it was to curl it.</li>
            <li> and it is still which is still going strong and works quite well.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot, it gets warm.</li>
            <li> The curls are beautiful if you use properly, by that</li>
            <li> I have very straight, short hair, and this curling curls it perfectly.</li>
            <li> and I would feel fine about ordering from this company again.</li>
            <li> This one works perfectly and was delivered in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> The item is fine</li>
            <li> Shorter barrel, but my hair is is about 3 inches below my shoulders and it worked fine.  </li>
            <li> It works fine for my intent.</li>
            <li> This takes some time to heat up, but if you want tight, spiral curls, this barrel size is perfect.  </li>
            <li> This iron is a great size for people with short hair.  </li>
            <li> Infinite heat control makes it nice for however much time you have.</li>
            <li> I got this curling iron because I have short hair, and this works great for curls, and to flip my hair up.</li>
            <li> It is great  for short hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for short hair like mine.</li>
            <li> great for the short hair</li>
            <li> The curling iron doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly it pulls on the hair .The</li>
            <li> Great tool for giving you the curly updo&#x27;s coming back in.</li>
            <li> great product - would definitely order again</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t need to use it often, but when, for some reason, I get a small patch of hair that flattens in the area of my face, this provides the perfect fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> And just as important, it cools off quick so it can be but away before I leave.</li>
            <li> and this will probably be great for when my hair grows out, so I&#x27;m not really worried about it.</li>
            <li> Good luck future consumers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great, little, light weight curling iron, but packs a powerful styling punch!  </li>
            <li> It  heats very fast and is easy to handle.  </li>
            <li> The iron heats quickly and heats well.  </li>

            <li> It is very hot, so</li>
            <li> Its really nice haing a barrel that small, and its does good heating up and keeping hot.</li>
            <li> I received this item even earlier than promised, and I absolutely love it!</li>
            <li> It heats up quickly so I can use it right away.</li>
            <li> So far I am satisfied with the product and the item was shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that has gotten more curly &amp; in some areas frizzy</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 curling irons and was able to get them with free shipping which was cheaper for me than buying one that was several dollars cheaper but wanted a fortune to ship it.</li>
            <li> It heated up pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> IT BURNED MY HAIR RIGHT OFF.</li>
            <li> Great for small curls..</li>
            <li> They work well and especially for such a great price.</li>
            <li> A curling iron with 3/8 inch barrel is hard to find and I was happy to locate this one.  </li>
            <li> I tried using the hi setting and found that it was too hot.  </li>
            <li> I took it on vacation and the first time I used it, it came apart.  </li>
            <li> These curlers get extremely hot...</li>
            <li> I have short hair and the small barrel on this iron works perfectly for me.  </li>
            <li> Putting this electric curling iron works great for me since my hair is thick.  </li>
            <li> I get my hair cut short in summer and find this size barrel works better that the 5/8th.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron for tiny curls.</li>
            <li> The hot setting is so hot you can burn your scalp, so  </li>
            <li> and I am able to have multiple style using this.</li>
            <li> This size is impossible to find in stores; I am pleased with how it functions; heats up,quickly, easy to use and fairly priced.</li>
            <li> The temperature of this curling iron is suitable, not too high, not too low.</li>
            <li> Curls well, gets hot pretty fast.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast and stays hot.</li>
            <li> On the high setting, it worked very well and very fast.  </li>
            <li> This did the job beautifully and left me with a full head of little tiny curls!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it works very well</li>
            <li> May. The curling iron worked very well.</li>
            <li> Heats and curls fast.</li>
            <li> No matter how much hair I curled at a time or</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous curling iron with 2 different size rods that are inter-changeable.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> It heats up fast and curls very well.</li>
            <li> Works really well.</li>
            <li> I took it away and it took the whole pice of hair with it...</li>
            <li> Very unimpressive.  </li>
            <li> It arrived much quicker anticipated.</li>
            <li> It heats up really fast</li>
            <li> it heats up fast </li>
            <li> Heat&#x27;s up fast and gives me the curl and lift I like when I do my hair.</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this iron.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nice for my curly hair to put in these tiny curls along with my regular ones.</li>
            <li> I usually just want to curl some tendrils that hang down when I have my hair up, and this does the trick perfectly.  </li>
            <li> I go from burning my fine hair to not curling it at all between the high and low</li>
            <li> Tiny but powerful!  </li>
            <li> but since I just started using it, it must be noted that it is easy to handle and heats really quickly--be careful not to burn yourself on the barrel--and it performs its function well.</li>
            <li> my hair is very thick but fine &amp; the the weight of it can flatten on top of my head.</li>
            <li> This is a nice curling iron if you want really small curls.</li>
            <li> the older I get.</li>
            <li> I got this because I have super short hair and was looking for something to help out.</li>
            <li> This very small radius curling iron barrow captures little whisks of hair perfectly.</li>
            <li> The only regret is that there is no indication when it has come up to temperature; there is a red light when it is plugged in, but I didn&#x27;t find any indication change for when it is hot.  </li>
            <li> It, is very hard to find good mini curling irons, I purchased this one for my Mother, and when I do her hair we use it, She loves it.</li>
            <li> I bought the tiny 3/8&amp;#34; size, having gotten really comfortable with my hair curling routine using a large tapered barrel, and wanting another option for a different look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;d probably be a great one to use on a child because it is so small and doesn&#x27;t get excruciatingly</li>
            <li> It is a bit unwieldy to use--but it is the only 3/8 inch curling iron I have found that is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I had purchased a new one and thrown  it away ...</li>
            <li> So imagine my surprise that by the 15 th of July this new Helen of Troy curling iron is already boom.</li>
            <li> i have used Helen of Troy products in the past and have been satisfied.  </li>
            <li> Cons: It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Since I just got this curling iron, I can&#x27;t evaluate it further than my first test--it worked.  </li>
            <li> This helen of Troy 1538 Spring Curling Iron, White, 3/8 inch Barrel curling iron is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Item just as described, I have been using helen of Troy for years, I love this curling iron, small enough for short hair and also great for tight curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> I really like the long barrel which makes curling my hair go much faster.</li>
            <li> I used this rubish to try and do tight curls, I used it proporly and the minute I put my hair on the wand I heard a hissing sound and smelled burning smell....</li>
            <li> Bought this primarily for making tight curls for a period hairstyle for a show.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find a mini size curling iron any more.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend this product because of the heating and it has held up so far.  </li>
            <li> I needed the size but iron offers no settings.</li>
            <li> I have very short straight hair (in a pixie cut) and I needed to curl it for a play I was in.</li>
            <li> i have naturally curly hair but its a bit damaged from dying it</li>
            <li> my curls look natural and no one will ever know.</li>
            <li> and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works the same on every kind of hair (I&#x27;m white with long, fine, somewhat dry hair), or if I got a defective one, but I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I have thick coarse hair that can take the higher heat setting.  </li>
            <li> I mean ensuring you complete the full rotation of the iron so that all the hair is curled to the very ends.</li>
            <li> The lower setting is fine when you want a small but looser curl.</li>
            <li> So definitely try this if you wish, especially if you have super short hair.</li>
            <li> this product does not get hot enough for afro American hair</li>
            <li> The light indicates when it is on , so you are not likely to burn your house down by forgetting to turn it off.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a high and low setting.</li>
            <li> Has both High and Low settings.</li>
            <li> Heats up fast, has limited settings but holds heat well.</li>
            <li> Shipping came super fast, it actually worked, and it is small enough for really short hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: still not good for short short hair (but that&#x27;s mostly my fault, and I kinda knew that was gonna happen.)</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted a curling iron small enough to leave cute little curls in my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Gets hot enough to curl thick, straight, short hair with ease.</li>
            <li> For me, it takes a few hours to do my hair with this, (my hair is over a foot and a half long, and its thick) and it keeps it&#x27;s shape for the most part with a little help from hairspray. :)</li>
            <li> what they say about a not long enough tip to keep from burning your fingers is spot on.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t take a long time to heat up, the curls will be super small.</li>
            <li> I have loved the Helen of Troy brand for awhile, and unfortunately this product has not fit my fancy.</li>
            <li> For her being such an active child, I was surprised that the curls lasted all day without any hairspray.</li>
            <li> I hate have to test it with my finger, but otherwise, it is easy to use, comfortable in my hand, and so far I haven&#x27;t had trouble with the cord tangling.</li>
            <li> The small barrels are hard to find so am glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> Plus, the metal &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; is small, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere too much while you hold and use the iron.  </li>
            <li> It has adjustable temperature and turns off if it is left unattended for too long.  </li>
            <li> It had a long tip and the cord actually did not tangle (it does on this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> She could not get the same tight looking curls as when she had her hair done professionally.</li>
            <li> Feel that this was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> so it was too long for me.</li>
            <li> However, the product description says that it is 8.5&amp;#34; long, and it turned out to be 11.75&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Even after only a few seconds in her hair on low, her hair came out looking beautifly curled.</li>
            <li> but I have to be careful not to burn myself on the end.</li>
            <li> so that&#x27;s expected...</li>
            <li> Two days after the iron arrived two of my other irons broke.</li>
            <li> The barrel is small enough to go around my hair.  </li>
            <li> with any curling iron, it works on heat, so be careful when handling it!</li>
            <li> Bought for mom that has short hair and wanted small curl.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from these but after to reading other reviews, I decided to try them</li>
            <li> I always thought the difference between metal and ceramic was just marketing nonsense, but holy cow.</li>
            <li> It is thin enough even for smaller mustache.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a curling iron with a 3/8&amp;#34; barrel in local stores.</li>
            <li> I should have checked just how small a 3/8 inch barrel was before ordering because I think I meant to get a little bigger.</li>
            <li> A really hard to find size curling iron, which I needed for my short hair.  </li>
            <li> Worth every penny, and it wasn&#x27;t expensive at all!</li>
            <li> I received my order in less than a week.</li>
            <li> This brand is known to me and has been reliable in the past; when I saw they offered the small barrel that I needed, it was an obvious choice.  </li>
            <li> I also used it to make a number of curls in my very long hair, which I then twisted around each other into a bun with the springy curls at the ends in a little cascading bundle in the back.  </li>
            <li> They are compact and get those tight curls you need.</li>
            <li> This little iron does the trick.  </li>
            <li> I like this curling iron for my little girl.  </li>
            <li> I have used it practically everyday since it arrived.</li>
            <li> If you have thin, silky hair, you might want to keep the setting on the low end.  </li>
            <li> This curling iron helps tame the frizzy hair &amp; blend into the rest of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and after a few years the spring breaks</li>
            <li> /&gt;It was very long and hard to work with, the measurements given online were very confusing</li>
            <li> My mom was looking for a small curling iron.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m being a slow learner after going from an expensive curling iron that I finally had to retire.</li>
            <li> It is hard to find an iron this size</li>
            <li> Hard to find 3/8 inch barrel size.</li>
            <li> Hard to find size at this price.</li>
            <li> HARD TO FIND 3/8 CURLING IRON</li>
            <li> After a bad haircut, I couldn&#x27;t even get my old curling iron to catch a strand of hair.  </li>
            <li> VERY small curls.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  </li>
            <li> I also like to curl random areas to give some lift...</li>
            <li> Was quite disappointing.  </li>
            <li> But that was my bad, not the product&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> I am seriously disappointed.</li>
            <li> what products I put in my hair, it came out frizzy and horrible looking.</li>

            <li> I am glad I purchased this item. I has lived up to its discription. It works well.</li>
            <li> It makes great ringlets in my wigs! The low setting is just perfect for accurate styling without overheating. I&#x27;m learning that on synthetic hair, you need a smaller barrel than you think, and lower heat. Perfect!</li>
            <li> i have used Helen of Troy products in the past and have been satisfied.  I am a woman of color and needed a mini curling iron for the bottom portion of my hair now that I am wearing it short.  This little iron does the trick.  Although my hair is course, I use the lo setting and it provides sufficient heat.  I tried using the hi setting and found that it was too hot.  I would recommend this product because of the heating and it has held up so far.  I have used it practically everyday since it arrived.</li>
            <li> Item just as described, I have been using helen of Troy for years, I love this curling iron, small enough for short hair and also great for tight curls that last all day.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with this product!  It is hard to find an iron this size and I was glad to find it available from Amazon.  It works well and I would feel fine about ordering from this company again.</li>
            <li> Works well  So far I am satisfied with the product and the item was shipped promptly.</li>
            <li> My only &amp;#34;concern&amp;#34; is that the barrel is longer than I am used to so I&#x27;ve had to be extra cautious so as not to burn myself.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many curling irons over the years and the best is Helen of Troy.Most of mine were purchased at a beauty supply house.The mini iron has been the most difficult to find.I need several different sizes to style my hair.Two days after the iron arrived two of my other irons broke.I wished for Helen of Troy irons and would have gotten them instead of what I had to buy at the shopping mall.Time is what I didn&#x27;t have to wait for the order..In comparing another brand to Helen of Troy there is no comparison...Helen of Troy is the very best!!!!</li>
            <li> I took it on vacation and the first time I used it, it came apart.  by the time I returned home I had purchased a new one and thrown  it away ...&lt;br /&gt;waste of good money!</li>
            <li> This iron is a great size for people with short hair.  The barrel is small enough to go around my hair.  It works great but I have to be careful not to burn myself on the end.</li>
            <li> I like it was the best, becuse of the size of the barrel, for my short hair.</li>
            <li> These curlers get extremely hot...and that&#x27;s a great thing. They are compact and get those tight curls you need. Excellent product.</li>
            <li> This is a nice curling iron if you want really small curls. It&#x27;s nice for my curly hair to put in these tiny curls along with my regular ones. It gives it a bouncy look. I love that it has a holder for the hair, rather than having to use gloves as in the wands. I would never use those, so it&#x27;s nice to have this option. Also, stands on my marble counter, rather than rolling around. Infinite heat control makes it nice for however much time you have.</li>
            <li> If you are used to ceramic irons don&#x27;t buy this.  I needed the size but iron offers no settings. The type of heat is drying.</li>
            <li> I love the curling iron it is great size and came in on time for a two day shipping. I cant wait to use it and I notice that I don&#x27;t have to twist my hand curling on this one. The heat opitions for me are great and will be easy to do my hair tomorrow</li>
            <li> My mom was looking for a small curling iron.  This one works perfectly and was delivered in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> It, is very hard to find good mini curling irons, I purchased this one for my Mother, and when I do her hair we use it, She loves it. Great buy!!</li>
            <li> I have very short straight hair (in a pixie cut) and I needed to curl it for a play I was in. This did the job beautifully and left me with a full head of little tiny curls!</li>
            <li> Excellent product! Gets hot enough to curl thick, straight, short hair with ease. Very pleased with my purchase. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This takes some time to heat up, but if you want tight, spiral curls, this barrel size is perfect.  I usually just want to curl some tendrils that hang down when I have my hair up, and this does the trick perfectly.  Great price too.</li>
            <li> The item is fine it works very well i have short hair so it is good</li>
            <li> I got this curling iron because I have short hair, and this works great for curls, and to flip my hair up. Worth every penny, and it wasn&#x27;t expensive at all!</li>
            <li> The temperature of this curling iron is suitable, not too high, not too low. The size of the iron is perfect for some kind of short hair. A very good product for the price.</li>
            <li> It  heats very fast and is easy to handle.  It is great  for short hair.  I would recommend  it  especially for the person with short hair</li>
            <li> I purchased this product on the 10 th of May and it was delivered on the 18th of May. The curling iron worked very well. It heated up pretty quickly. I purchased this product because I own another Helen Of Troy curling iron with a bigger barrel since 1994 and it is still which is still going strong and works quite well. So imagine my surprise that by the 15 th of July this new Helen of Troy curling iron is already boom. It no longer heats up. I am seriously disappointed. Feel that this was a complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t get hot, it gets warm. But very cheap price.</li>
            <li> I have loved the Helen of Troy brand for awhile, and unfortunately this product has not fit my fancy. I will list the pros and cons. Pros: Shipping came super fast, it actually worked, and it is small enough for really short hair. Cons: It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough. There is only an on and off button, and there is no temperature control. So honestly this was a great price. You definitely get what you pay for. So definitely try this if you wish, especially if you have super short hair. Good luck future consumers.</li>
            <li> This very small radius curling iron barrow captures little whisks of hair perfectly. I don&#x27;t need to use it often, but when, for some reason, I get a small patch of hair that flattens in the area of my face, this provides the perfect fix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any curling iron, it works on heat, so be careful when handling it!</li>
            <li> Bought for mom that has short hair and wanted small curl. This was the smallest size we could find reasonable priced and it worked out great. She&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy!!</li>
            <li> I have short hair and the small barrel on this iron works perfectly for me.  I don&#x27;t have a perm, but my hair keeps it wave for a day or two with just a touch up.  The small barrels are hard to find so am glad I found this one.</li>
            <li> Great curling iron. Hard to find 3/8 inch barrel size. Excellent quality. Very good price. Nice features- 2 heating levels.</li>
            <li> Tiny but powerful!  I have to curl my hair when I get to work because of my hat.  Putting this electric curling iron works great for me since my hair is thick.  The curls are beautiful if you use properly, by that I mean ensuring you complete the full rotation of the iron so that all the hair is curled to the very ends.</li>
            <li> If you have short hair this is for you. Heats and curls fast. I&#x27;ve used this product in the past and after a few years the spring breaks but I use it every day so that&#x27;s expected...I just ordered my second to keep in my RV. No complaints from me.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does a wonderful job for shorter hair and the barrel is shorter which I really like.  These were received on time and with no damage.  I woud definitely use this seller again.</li>
            <li> This is a good curling iron and works well.  Be warned - a 3/8 inch barrel is very tiny.  I probably should have ordered 1/2 inch.  But that was my bad, not the product&#x27;s fault.</li>
            <li> I bought the tiny 3/8&amp;#34; size, having gotten really comfortable with my hair curling routine using a large tapered barrel, and wanting another option for a different look. I always thought the difference between metal and ceramic was just marketing nonsense, but holy cow. No matter how much hair I curled at a time or what products I put in my hair, it came out frizzy and horrible looking. My regular wand actually makes my hair look smoother. I&#x27;m not sure if it works the same on every kind of hair (I&#x27;m white with long, fine, somewhat dry hair), or if I got a defective one, but I can&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have had several of these and use them every day.  For the price it is well worth it!!!</li>
            <li> prompt shipping. Recommend!!</li>
            <li> i have naturally curly hair but its a bit damaged from dying it but this iron is perfect for touching up the dead spots. my curls look natural and no one will ever know. excellent quality for a cheap price.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a 1/4 inch curling iron but this was the smallest I could find.  It works well to curl short hair.</li>
            <li> This is a fabulous curling iron with 2 different size rods that are inter-changeable.  It has adjustable temperature and turns off if it is left unattended for too long.  It&#x27;s a great, little, light weight curling iron, but packs a powerful styling punch!  I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair that has gotten more curly &amp; in some areas frizzy the older I get. This curling iron helps tame the frizzy hair &amp; blend into the rest of my hair. I also like to curl random areas to give some lift...my hair is very thick but fine &amp; the the weight of it can flatten on top of my head. This curling iron gives my hair a boost in height.</li>
            <li> Works well with my short hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really hard to find a mini size curling iron any more.  This one works great, though it does get really hot.  Fortunately, I have thick coarse hair that can take the higher heat setting.  If you have thin, silky hair, you might want to keep the setting on the low end.  The iron heats quickly and heats well.  Plus, the metal &amp;#34;stand&amp;#34; is small, so it doesn&#x27;t interfere too much while you hold and use the iron.  I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just the size that I wanted. It&#x27;s great for short hair like mine. It heats up quickly so I can use it right away.</li>
            <li> barrel looks bigger in person</li>
            <li> Perfect for short hair</li>
            <li> I would like to have been able to give more stars, but.....what they say about a not long enough tip to keep from burning your fingers is spot on. OUCH! I&#x27;m being a slow learner after going from an expensive curling iron that I finally had to retire. It had a long tip and the cord actually did not tangle (it does on this one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this had a Med. heat setting, that would make me happy. I go from burning my fine hair to not curling it at all between the high and low setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Couldn&#x27;t beat the price, but it sure could use some improvements.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to my friends.  It heats up fast and curls very well. I am glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> Hard to find size at this price. I get my hair cut short in summer and find this size barrel works better that the 5/8th. Heats up fast and stays hot. And just as important, it cools off quick so it can be but away before I leave.</li>
            <li> I received this iron very fast,in good condition but returned it because it was not what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;It was very long and hard to work with, the measurements given online were very confusing so it was too long for me.</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron for my little girl.  It is the perfect size for her and makes her hair look so cute!</li>
            <li> Works really well. Curls well, gets hot pretty fast.</li>
            <li> great for the short hair and it is a good quality for the price</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I wanted a curling iron small enough to leave cute little curls in my 3 year old daughter&#x27;s hair. This worked out perfect. I&#x27;m amazed at how well the curls stay in the hair and how easy it was to curl it. There&#x27;s a high and low setting. I use the low setting for her because I don&#x27;t want to burn her hair. Even after only a few seconds in her hair on low, her hair came out looking beautifly curled. For her being such an active child, I was surprised that the curls lasted all day without any hairspray. I&#x27;m glad I spend the money on this product.</li>
            <li> Have bought three of these curling ironsat Sallys beauty supply and taken two back. The curling iron doesn&#x27;t glide smoothly it pulls on the hair .The one I kept is great.</li>
            <li> I used this rubish to try and do tight curls, I used it proporly and the minute I put my hair on the wand I heard a hissing sound and smelled burning smell.... I took it away and it took the whole pice of hair with it...IT BURNED MY HAIR RIGHT OFF. PLEASE DON&#x27;t be fooled by the good reviews And save your hair, I regret using this piece of **** I would give it (-100) stars if i could</li>
            <li> Bought this primarily for making tight curls for a period hairstyle for a show.  On the high setting, it worked very well and very fast.  I used it on my short bangs to curl them into a 17th century fringe of curls, to curl all the wispy hair around my face and on my neck.  I also used it to make a number of curls in my very long hair, which I then twisted around each other into a bun with the springy curls at the ends in a little cascading bundle in the back.  After the show, I used it to UNcurl the fringe and on the lower setting, to shape it back into half-bangs, like a wave.  Without the fringe, it made a cute up-do for the holidays.  I&#x27;m continuing to use it for the curly wisps around my face when I wear my hair up or back and to shape my bangs.  I&#x27;m sure if one had the patience and wanted an all over tight-curl style, it would do the job.  The lower setting is fine when you want a small but looser curl.</li>
            <li> Poor quality.  Very unimpressive.  Was quite disappointing.  I bought it for myself but will be giving it to charity. Never again.</li>
            <li> It heats quickly and curls hair well.  The light indicates when it is on , so you are not likely to burn your house down by forgetting to turn it off.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for the price. It heats very quickly and the curling barrel is just ideal for my bangs.</li>
            <li> Item arrived quickly and I am happy with the product.  A curling iron with 3/8 inch barrel is hard to find and I was happy to locate this one.  I really like the long barrel which makes curling my hair go much faster.</li>
            <li> Heats quickly and works great but feels cheap.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t get hot enough.</li>
            <li> Great tool, for people looking for 1/4&amp;#34; curler, ummmm here is your answer.  Heats up fast, has limited settings but holds heat well. Cord does not tangle, spins well.  Shorter barrel, but my hair is is about 3 inches below my shoulders and it worked fine.  Great tool for giving you the curly updo&#x27;s coming back in.</li>
            <li> great product - would definitely order again</li>
            <li> I just needed a hair curler for mustache handle-bars. I couldn&#x27;t find a 1/4&amp;#34; curler so I went w/ the 3/8&amp;#34;. It heats up fairly quick and has the plastic safety tip on the end so I don&#x27;t burn my face when using it. I ordered it on Friday and received it on Monday. Scheduled delivery time was the following Thursday. It arrived much quicker anticipated. It works fine for my intent. Has both High and Low settings.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron for tiny curls. It heats up really fast and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it so far.</li>
            <li> I like this curling iron.  It is very hot, so I don&#x27;t have to spend a lot of time setting my hair.  The hot setting is so hot you can burn your scalp, so  keep practicing.  Marlene</li>
            <li> Its really nice haing a barrel that small, and its does good heating up and keeping hot. For me, it takes a few hours to do my hair with this, (my hair is over a foot and a half long, and its thick) and it keeps it&#x27;s shape for the most part with a little help from hairspray. :)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good curling iron, works great.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a curling iron with a 3/8&amp;#34; barrel in local stores. So, I decided to check online and found what I was looking for through Amazon.  I ordered 2 curling irons and was able to get them with free shipping which was cheaper for me than buying one that was several dollars cheaper but wanted a fortune to ship it. I have ALWAYS had wonderful luck and the delivery timeliness is AWESOME! So, I will continue to order when I find what I am looking for. Thanks for the awesome delivery time. I received my order in less than a week. As a matter of fact it was several days and it was sent priority mail.  Thank you!</li>
            <li> I got this because I have super short hair and was looking for something to help out. It&#x27;s meh. I have curly hair anyways and this will probably be great for when my hair grows out, so I&#x27;m not really worried about it. It didn&#x27;t take a long time to heat up, the curls will be super small. It&#x27;d probably be a great one to use on a child because it is so small and doesn&#x27;t get excruciatingly hot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;pros: great product, true to description, small, good quality, good temps&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons: still not good for short short hair (but that&#x27;s mostly my fault, and I kinda knew that was gonna happen.)</li>
            <li> I like both of these curling irons as it fits my type of hair texture, will probably order them again .</li>
            <li> great. just what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been awhile since I purchased this item but since I just started using it, it must be noted that it is easy to handle and heats really quickly--be careful not to burn yourself on the barrel--and it performs its function well.</li>
            <li> Good iron works well, very well.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect from these but after to reading other reviews, I decided to try them and I am not disappointed. They work well and especially for such a great price.</li>
            <li> VERY small curls. I should have checked just how small a 3/8 inch barrel was before ordering because I think I meant to get a little bigger.</li>
            <li> its amazing i love itt  even tho i burn my self with it alot. it heats up fast </li>
            <li> Since I just got this curling iron, I can&#x27;t evaluate it further than my first test--it worked.  However, the product description says that it is 8.5&amp;#34; long, and it turned out to be 11.75&amp;#34;.  This isn&#x27;t a problem to me, but might be to some people.</li>
            <li> After a bad haircut, I couldn&#x27;t even get my old curling iron to catch a strand of hair.  This brand is known to me and has been reliable in the past; when I saw they offered the small barrel that I needed, it was an obvious choice.  The only regret is that there is no indication when it has come up to temperature; there is a red light when it is plugged in, but I didn&#x27;t find any indication change for when it is hot.  I hate have to test it with my finger, but otherwise, it is easy to use, comfortable in my hand, and so far I haven&#x27;t had trouble with the cord tangling.</li>
            <li> this product does not get hot enough for afro American hair</li>
            <li> I got it for my husband to curl his mustache. He enjoys it. It is thin enough even for smaller mustache.</li>
            <li> A really hard to find size curling iron, which I needed for my short hair.  I love it.  Heat&#x27;s up fast and gives me the curl and lift I like when I do my hair.</li>
            <li> This size is impossible to find in stores; I am pleased with how it functions; heats up,quickly, easy to use and fairly priced.</li>
            <li> perfect size for short hair</li>
            <li> This works well for my needs.  I recently cut my hair really short and I am able to have multiple style using this.</li>
            <li> I received this item even earlier than promised, and I absolutely love it! I have very straight, short hair, and this curling curls it perfectly. The curls last for days, too!</li>
            <li> Like the product / was delivered on time</li>
            <li> It is a bit unwieldy to use--but it is the only 3/8 inch curling iron I have found that is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for..</li>
            <li> Thanks for making this iron. I had been looking for this size for app one year and finally came upon this one. The size is what I was looking for. It also makes ur hair shine when using it.</li>
            <li> JUST PERFECT FOR WHAT I NEEDED CUZ MY HAIR IS REALLY SHORT,ITS PERFECT FOR ME,JUST LOVE IT. HARD TO FIND 3/8 CURLING IRON</li>
            <li> This helen of Troy 1538 Spring Curling Iron, White, 3/8 inch Barrel curling iron is exactly what I was looking for. This was a gift for a friend who had been using a 5/8&amp;#34; barrel curling iron. She could not get the same tight looking curls as when she had her hair done professionally. They told her it was because of the size of the barrel of the curling iron. I found this for her at a great price and free shipping. It was an instant hit with her. I&#x27;m thinking of ordeing another one, just in case this one quits some time in the future.</li>
            <li> Great for small curls..i use it on doll hair and it works great</li>
    </ol>
