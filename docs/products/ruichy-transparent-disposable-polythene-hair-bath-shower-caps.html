            <li>These are a very good value.</li>
            <li>I have a small-normal sized head and it fits great</li>
            <li>Great price and did not have to drive to the hair supply store for conditioner caps.  </li>
            <li>Works great over an 11&amp;#34; pizza pan -</li>

            <li>Great deal.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>This time the quality was greatly reduced.  </li>
            <li>Love these!!</li>
            <li>Good product at a great price.</li>
            <li>So 100ct for the price was good for me.</li>
            <li>Good thing I bought two of the packs, so</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good to buy them in bulk</li>
            <li>but if one needs a good cap at an affordable price I would recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &amp; God bless,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
            <li>Excellent product, exactly as described and pictured!</li>
            <li>First of all the size is perfect.</li>
            <li>I will never be able to use these within my lifetime!</li>
            <li>Love these!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase in every way...size, quality, shipping, and price!</li>
            <li>They are of good quality, and I love it that I have so many of them and do not have to worry about running out anytime soon!</li>
            <li>these are great to use for bowl covers - with a 100 of them you have no need to wash and re-use them - great for taking large bowls of food to a holiday or a summer cookout.</li>
            <li>DO NOT HESITATE these caps are amazing .&lt;br</li>
            <li>They are resuable and go on very easy.</li>
            <li>I use these to deep condition my hair and they work great, not to mention they are a great value.</li>
            <li>Great stock of caps that is exactly what I need since I use these ALL THE TIME.</li>
            <li>The elastic band, while not terribly snug, is sturdy.</li>
            <li>Now that I have so many</li>
            <li>The caps are okay.</li>
            <li>I use them in the shower while my temporary hair color dye is working its magic.</li>
            <li>Also to cover the top of a watermelon after it has been cut.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad to have this product.</li>
            <li>For the most part these caps work, but some of the got stuck together</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t able to utilize all 100 caps.</li>
            <li>It is just okay.</li>
            <li>Great when I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair and need to style fast.</li>
            <li>They are not only processing caps, but also excellent shower caps, in addition, I use them to cover my shoes when traveling, and thus protect my travel clothes in my suitcase.  </li>
            <li>Just right for showering, conditioning hair,covering a bowl, good quality.</li>
            <li>I use them for deep conditioning and they fit my head perfectly !</li>
            <li>I have tried many types of processing caps from the cheap 99 cent types to the no labeled ones at some beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>There are surely better options available.</li>
            <li>Rips really easily.</li>
            <li>work fine.  </li>
            <li>i tried it on my cousin who has a normal-big head and it fit her perfectly fine .</li>
            <li>I have a huge head and tons of hair</li>
            <li>and I can fit all my hair in it without struggling.</li>
            <li>I rock a decent-sized afro and this cap still fit over it.</li>
            <li>Should fit a 12&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them, good quality as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li>I love to deep condition my hair and these stay on and are a good price</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very useful for me when I do my hair treatments</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s super easy to put these on.</li>
            <li>While the fullness in the bonnet is welcome, the elastic band does not provide a secure fit and felt a bit loose as I was conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li>I use these to cover the top of a large bowl I&#x27;m putting in the fridge.</li>
            <li>First, you get a nice large number of them for the money.</li>
            <li>Good for one time use only.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are a good enough quality</li>
            <li>These are one-time use quality, but good enough to sleep in.</li>
            <li>Good product staple to have and provides multiple uses.  </li>
            <li>They fit my head great and would fit many other sizes great, and the material is thin but not too thin, perfect!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still on my first one!  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>What a nice big stash of them; should last me many years!</li>
            <li>The whole package should last a couple of years or more at this rate, so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>The elastic is far from durable, the cap is HUGH - but that would be ok is the elastic</li>
            <li>Also nice for keeping hair dry during a long-soak tub bath.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m ready to go!</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I love that these caps are extra large</li>
            <li>These plastic caps stretch out pretty fast.  </li>
            <li>(I mention this because I had another brand that was too large for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They do tend to run large though.</li>
            <li>have thin hair and an average size head, and the fit of this cap is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about how many I have left if I decide to use a new cap.</li>
            <li>Shipped in a reasonable amount of time.  </li>
            <li>Very roomy.</li>
            <li>my hair in the morning, doing it 2 times a week really see the improvement on my hair,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m transitioning from permed to natural hair, and on some days, I just don&#x27;t want to worry about my hair right after washing, or I need to run out.</li>
            <li>They are plenty roomy enough to accommodate most big styles, afros, curlers, etc.</li>
            <li>I used these all the time for deep conditioning or just a quick way to add moisture to my hair.</li>
            <li>They provide enough coverage for conditioning and showering, but I think the heat from deep conditioning warps the plastic and the elastic pretty quick.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m average in size/height with shoulder length hair medium thickness and these caps are very large -- didn&#x27;t even fit tightly enough to keep water off my face when washing in the sink -- let alone a shower.  </li>
            <li>I get more for my money with this batch than the small 10-15 bundles in the stores.</li>
            <li>Not only where they not extra large and were standard size, but the material was quite cheap.</li>
            <li>But if I could change one thing it would be make the elastic a bit more snug so they don&#x27;t slip down or gap open.</li>
            <li>these are fantastic for keeping my hair dry during a shower and also keeping my hair deep conditioned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll re-use one of these several times before it starts to rip too much around the edges.</li>
            <li>I finally broke down and purchased the Betty Dain Caps after only being able to find smaller sized caps (they claimed to be large) which just barely cover the hair</li>
            <li>Slips on many different size containers, no more searching for lids.  </li>
            <li>I think that this would fit anyone who wasn&#x27;t a small child.  </li>
            <li>The Betty Dain&#x27;s live up to their promise, the caps are larger.  </li>
            <li>Not only is the cap area large, but the elastic is also much looser than average size caps.</li>
            <li>The thicker, more expensive shower caps loose the elastic really quick.</li>
            <li>I have long bleached out hair plus I am getting older-</li>
            <li>I expected these to arrive as extra large conditioning caps.</li>

            <li> I have long bleached out hair plus I am getting older-</li>
            <li> I expected these to arrive as extra large conditioning caps.</li>
            <li> Not super high quality</li>
            <li> mainly the caps were too small.  </li>
            <li> Plain old plastic caps, and a bunch of them!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have long hair</li>
            <li> The cost is low, so you don&#x27;t have to feel guilty about going through them quickly.  </li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t stretched out yet at all!  </li>
            <li> I still use them, but they are a bit loose around my hair.</li>
            <li> They fell down around my ears and gapped in several places.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like the elastic to be a little tighter, but it protects my hair well enough.</li>
            <li> , they came on time as expected .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use these during my mayonnaise conditioning days, and just for days where I just need to have wet hair for a while for the help with the dryness.</li>
            <li> and I can even use it during my shower if I do not want my hair to be wet.</li>
            <li> not much else</li>
            <li> I dont know why people say it too big or too small .</li>
            <li> The quality of the plastic is thicker than the caps I&#x27;ve purchased locally in the past</li>
            <li> There is no way the other caps I purchased would be of use.  </li>
            <li> I use these to cover bowls and other containers in my refrigerator not for my head.  </li>
            <li> I often use oil on my hair, and while I love the conditioning benefits, I hate that the oil gets all over.</li>
            <li> and I still have to clip the caps in front to keep them from drooping down onto my face.</li>
            <li> I put one of these on, a black bonnet, and a hat</li>

            <li> I 100% recommend these caps ! THEY ARE GREAT ! I use them for deep conditioning and they fit my head perfectly ! I have a small-normal sized head and it fits great i tried it on my cousin who has a normal-big head and it fit her perfectly fine . I dont know why people say it too big or too small . DO NOT HESITATE these caps are amazing .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also , they came on time as expected .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line , GET THESE , you wont be sorry &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> They work for hair coloring and just regular showers.  The thicker, more expensive shower caps loose the elastic really quick. So 100ct for the price was good for me.</li>
            <li> These plastic caps stretch out pretty fast.  They provide enough coverage for conditioning and showering, but I think the heat from deep conditioning warps the plastic and the elastic pretty quick.  Good thing I bought two of the packs, so I have plenty to go through.  Wont be buying them again though.</li>
            <li> I expected these to arrive as extra large conditioning caps. Not only where they not extra large and were standard size, but the material was quite cheap. Please do not order these! I requested a refund but was not granted one.</li>
            <li> Not sturdy. Rips really easily. Good for one time use only.</li>
            <li> I use these to deep condition my hair and they work great, not to mention they are a great value.</li>
            <li> Great price and did not have to drive to the hair supply store for conditioner caps.  After my order I noticed the smaller packs would have come out cheeper for the same price.</li>
            <li> When I viewed the photograph of this product on line, it appeared to have a rubberband banding as opposed to a sewn on  elastic banding.  That was the disappointment, otherwise, the caps are identical to conditioning caps sold everywhere.</li>
            <li> Good product at a great price. Shipped in a reasonable amount of time.  I plan on purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I purchased these caps in order to use them when leaving my usual hair mask in for a coupole of hours. The quality of the plastic is thicker than the caps I&#x27;ve purchased locally in the past and I can fit all my hair in it without struggling. I have bra length curly hair and it&#x27;s super easy to put these on. When I&#x27;m done I just take it off and throw it out. Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> I purchased these to protect my clothing and furniture for the days that I use things like henna, indigo or deep conditioning treatments in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair and an average size head, and the fit of this cap is perfect.  I think that this would fit anyone who wasn&#x27;t a small child.  (I mention this because I had another brand that was too large for me.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a good enough quality and I haven&#x27;t found any defects in the caps.  They aren&#x27;t itchy or uncomfortable and can be worn for a long time.  The cost is low, so you don&#x27;t have to feel guilty about going through them quickly.  I&#x27;m not really sure what else can be said about these.  I&#x27;m very happy with them and would buy them again.</li>
            <li> I was worried when ordering these.. a lot of people complain about size and thin material.. they are perfect! They fit my head great and would fit many other sizes great, and the material is thin but not too thin, perfect!</li>
            <li> these are great to use for bowl covers - with a 100 of them you have no need to wash and re-use them - great for taking large bowls of food to a holiday or a summer cookout.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a plastic shower cap.</li>
            <li> First, you get a nice large number of them for the money. They do tend to run large though. I used a clip to gather up the excess plastic and it worked quite well.</li>
            <li> I have tried many types of processing caps from the cheap 99 cent types to the no labeled ones at some beauty supply stores. These have worked the best for me. First of all the size is perfect. I don&#x27;t have long hair but I do have thick hair and all of it fits in the cap. The elastic band, while not terribly snug, is sturdy. I am currently doing the GHE method, where I wear a plastic cap each time I do it during the week. So, I can reuse one cap for the week and then toss out when I done. Now that I have so many I don&#x27;t have to worry about how many I have left if I decide to use a new cap. Yay!</li>
            <li> I love that these caps are extra large so I don&#x27;t have to worry about using 2 in order to cover all of my hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m transitioning from permed to natural hair, and on some days, I just don&#x27;t want to worry about my hair right after washing, or I need to run out. I put one of these on, a black bonnet, and a hat and I&#x27;m ready to go! I use these during my mayonnaise conditioning days, and just for days where I just need to have wet hair for a while for the help with the dryness. Great stock of caps that is exactly what I need since I use these ALL THE TIME. I get more for my money with this batch than the small 10-15 bundles in the stores.</li>
            <li> I rock a decent-sized afro and this cap still fit over it. I&#x27;ll re-use one of these several times before it starts to rip too much around the edges. The whole package should last a couple of years or more at this rate, so I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Works great over an 11&amp;#34; pizza pan - I use it both as the dough&#x27;s rising in the pan, and then to cover it for leftovers.  Sturdy enough for multiple uses if you wish.  Should fit a 12&amp;#34; pan too.</li>
            <li> So convenient! These are one-time use quality, but good enough to sleep in. They don&#x27;t break when I leave conditioner in overnight. Also nice for keeping hair dry during a long-soak tub bath.</li>
            <li> The caps are okay. The elastic on them is a little lose but they serve the purpose when treating my hair.</li>
            <li> I finally broke down and purchased the Betty Dain Caps after only being able to find smaller sized caps (they claimed to be large) which just barely cover the hair (I have a very short Afro) in local stores.  The Betty Dain&#x27;s live up to their promise, the caps are larger.  Based on this, they will still be of use when my hair grows out (hopefully).  There is no way the other caps I purchased would be of use.  I have also used the caps multiple times without breakage, always a plus.  I know there are some negatives reviews on this, but I am happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Good product staple to have and provides multiple uses.  It took a while to be delivered as I thought it would be coming sooner so that took me back a bit.  But it finally arrived and is being out to use.</li>
            <li> Great for hair treatments and hair oil treatments...I will never be able to use these within my lifetime! Lol</li>
            <li> THese caps run larage.  While the fullness in the bonnet is welcome, the elastic band does not provide a secure fit and felt a bit loose as I was conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> Love these!  I use them for conditioning mine and my daughters hair.  They are of good quality, and I love it that I have so many of them and do not have to worry about running out anytime soon!</li>
            <li> Just right for showering, conditioning hair,covering a bowl, good quality.</li>
            <li> Got these for a pie throwing contest at work. Great pirce and well no ones hair was messed up!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m average in size/height with shoulder length hair medium thickness and these caps are very large -- didn&#x27;t even fit tightly enough to keep water off my face when washing in the sink -- let alone a shower.  They fell down around my ears and gapped in several places.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, exactly as described and pictured! What a nice big stash of them; should last me many years! I use them in the shower while my temporary hair color dye is working its magic. They can be used for deep conditioning too. I&#x27;d buy again!</li>
            <li> The elastic is far from durable, the cap is HUGH - but that would be ok is the elastic did it&#x27;s job.  If you don&#x27;t mind &amp;#34;rolling &amp; tucking&amp;#34; to make it work then....eh.... I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again though.  There are surely better options available.</li>
            <li> I still use them, but they are a bit loose around my hair. I&#x27;d like the elastic to be a little tighter, but it protects my hair well enough.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use these for what they were intended..I use these to cover the top of a large bowl I&#x27;m putting in the fridge. Also to cover the top of a watermelon after it has been cut.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so glad to have this product. It&#x27;s very useful for me when I do my hair treatments and I can even use it during my shower if I do not want my hair to be wet.</li>
            <li> These are a very good value. Previous reviews stating these \\&quot;run large\\&quot; are not exaggerating. Not only is the cap area large, but the elastic is also much looser than average size caps. I have a huge head and tons of hair and I still have to clip the caps in front to keep them from drooping down onto my face. They are plenty roomy enough to accommodate most big styles, afros, curlers, etc. But if I could change one thing it would be make the elastic a bit more snug so they don&#x27;t slip down or gap open.</li>
            <li> Until finding this product I have had a number of disappointments...mainly the caps were too small.  I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase in every way...size, quality, shipping, and price!</li>
            <li> I have long bleached out hair plus I am getting older- these are fantastic for keeping my hair dry during a shower and also keeping my hair deep conditioned. Very roomy.</li>
            <li> I often use oil on my hair, and while I love the conditioning benefits, I hate that the oil gets all over. These caps solve that problem. I have enough of these caps now to last for 2 years of treatments! Very happy!</li>
            <li> I used these all the time for deep conditioning or just a quick way to add moisture to my hair. It&#x27;s good to buy them in bulk so I can use and toss.</li>
            <li> I use these caps after applying conditioners to my hair to seal in the product and heat from my body. I also apply this cap after applying a pre poo treatment to my hair. These are quality caps and quite a bargain for the price. I will definitely repurchase again.</li>
            <li> It said 100ct but I ONLY got 30 ct!</li>
            <li> Great deal.  I&#x27;m using them under my thermal spa so I can just throw them away when I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> ... and I&#x27;m still on my first one!  It hasn&#x27;t stretched out yet at all!  At this rate, I may be using this package of 100 for the rest of my life. lol</li>
            <li> For the most part these caps work, but some of the got stuck together and when I pulled them apart it made holes in them so I wasn&#x27;t able to utilize all 100 caps.</li>
            <li> I had ordered this before and was very happy.  This time the quality was greatly reduced.  The plastic seems thinner and the elastic seems looser.  It is just okay.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think I will ever need a refill pack. They are resuable and go on very easy. Great when I don&#x27;t want to wash my hair and need to style fast. Great price too!</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair at nigt time, apply either olive oil or coconut oil on my hair and put the cap on to sleep,&lt;br /&gt;wash my hair in the morning, doing it 2 times a week really see the improvement on my hair,</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  They are not only processing caps, but also excellent shower caps, in addition, I use them to cover my shoes when traveling, and thus protect my travel clothes in my suitcase.  Love these!!</li>
            <li> Works well to keep my meds of mu pillow and sheets.  Not super high quality but if one needs a good cap at an affordable price I would recommend this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks &amp; God bless,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave</li>
            <li> I use these to cover bowls and other containers in my refrigerator not for my head.  Slips on many different size containers, no more searching for lids.  Toss out when dirty.</li>
            <li> Plain old plastic caps, and a bunch of them!  100 for 7 bucks, works for me.  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with them, good quality as far as I can tell.</li>
            <li> work fine.  not much else you can say</li>
            <li> I love to deep condition my hair and these stay on and are a good price</li>
