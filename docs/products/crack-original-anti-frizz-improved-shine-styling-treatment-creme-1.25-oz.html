            <li>but so.far.so good</li>

            <li>split ends look amazing.</li>
            <li>but yesterday I got my hair done and my hairdresser used this on my hair and its literally AMAZING.</li>
            <li>but honestly it can be out on damp hair too.</li>
            <li>this was the best stuff on the market as far as a leave in conditioner.</li>
            <li>I wanted it for the UV/ thermal protection, but I&#x27;ve found that liquid sprays are more effective for coating all of my hair.</li>
            <li>maybe even better then before</li>
            <li>I truly love this product that can handle the humidity of Florida with ease.  </li>
            <li>Love love love</li>
            <li>I love the way this makes my curly hair feel.</li>
            <li>For when I style my hair curly this might be my favorite hair product of all time</li>
            <li>I promise I don&#x27;t work for this company. :)</li>
            <li>My cousin is a hair stylist and she recommended I use this in my hair for static.</li>
            <li>Love this leave in.  </li>
            <li>Also, I prefer my BC repair sealed ends for the ends of my hair (prevents and hides split ends better).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m buying more on Amazon because I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li>I should have had more faith in him, because I love this product.  </li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>LOVE.</li>
            <li>However, maybe the name fits, as I am now hooked :)</li>
            <li>Makes hair texture fantastic.!</li>
            <li>Crack leave in protection makes my hair super soft, and smells WONDERFUL!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really work that good.</li>
            <li>So far I love this new leave-in treatment, and it smells awesome!</li>
            <li>It is truly an amazing product that really delivers.  </li>
            <li>keeps my hair looking sleek and really put a nice shine.  </li>
            <li>I had heard such great things about this hair creme, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m already familiar with.</li>
            <li>This is super pricey.</li>
            <li>This is a great product that leaves hair soft and smooth, and coats the hair just enough to add a bit of body.  </li>
            <li>Only takes a small amount so this size is perfect and worth every penny!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found an AMAZING frizz fighting product.</li>
            <li>Amazing if you flat iron or curl - if you just leave this in like a conditioner it does nothing</li>
            <li>I should stock up right?</li>
            <li>Yes, it makes your hair pretty soft, but not any more so than some cheaper store brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>A tiny amount is all you need to get super soft, smooth &amp; shiny silky hair!!</li>
            <li>Let me add that this came VERY fast.</li>
            <li>for some hair it works better, i may have to try different amount c if it will make any deference</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>first order</li>
            <li>I get really healthy, natural looking curls that are soft yet still defined.</li>
            <li>/&gt;There is a slight scent to this product, not bad or anything, more fruity that lingers.</li>
            <li>Very convenient, thanks amazon!</li>
            <li>This product worked great on my fine coarse natural african american hair.</li>
            <li>It cuts out the static from humid or dry weather conditions.</li>
            <li>but I can&#x27;t be certain.</li>
            <li>It is amazing how little of this product you use to get results.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair shiny and smooth for several days.</li>
            <li>I have very course curly hair, This product gave me control and shine.</li>
            <li>The price is fairly reasonable for the product.</li>
            <li>It was neatly packaged and looked very legit.</li>
            <li>Product came fast.</li>
            <li>you use too much it will become greasy in your hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had my tube for a month now and really do like this stuff.</li>
            <li>fast delivery.</li>
            <li>It really helps your hair, just don&#x27;t use a lot.</li>
            <li>I was really bummed.</li>
            <li>I ordered this from InVanity (the seller) on Amazon and received this nicely packaged and on time, within a few days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;2nd time I tried it, I made sure my hair was damp enough and again, gummy clear crystal nuggets.</li>
            <li>I have tried other products that I like better.</li>
            <li>I have a lot of hair and it is fine, dry, curly, and very prone to frizz.</li>
            <li>I love that I could order a smaller size before buying a big size.</li>
            <li>stuff works great in my naturally curly, medium to thin in places hair.</li>
            <li>yet it does condition hair and feels as if its mending hair I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>I use the tiniest sliver of product, maybe a skinny inch worth mixed with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Skinny Serum (the size a quarter).  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth trying if you like to try different products.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for a few months now and it is just okay.</li>
            <li>I have bleached my hair so many times so my hair is completely dead.</li>
            <li>Plus, once I flat ironed my hair, it looked like I just received a fresh relaxer.</li>
            <li>It is very masculine smelling.</li>
            <li>Magic - no more frizz</li>
            <li>It makes your hair really soft, and it has just a hint of sparkle in the cream to make your hair shiny but not greasy!</li>
            <li>I used about a nickel sized amount and rubbed throughout my hair, then once I blow dried my hair, my hair was super straight.</li>
            <li>The little tube will last quite awhile though and I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>And buy it here -- its much cheaper than at the local brick-and-mortar store.</li>
            <li>I just put it on the ends and it feels soft.</li>
            <li>However, it does make your hair soft.</li>
            <li>works well on my kinky curly natural 4a/4b hair.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
            <li>Remained sleek and soft.</li>
            <li>been in high humidity the last week AND worked out and my hair didn&#x27;t transform into a Don King afro.</li>
            <li>Love this product defiantly true to its name because I am now Addicted!!</li>
            <li>It truly works to help the frizz and calm the hair down.</li>
            <li>i was expecting more conditioning , it&#x60;s a bit too thick , not creamy enough , my hair is waive and thin,&lt;br</li>
            <li>It helps to leave my hair soft &amp; somewhat protects against heat damage &amp; split ends (with regular trims &amp; care)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Be careful not to use to much, or you will have white flakes</li>
            <li>Anson Mount, of Hell on Wheels, recommended this product on social media.  </li>
            <li>What I do know for sure is that the fragrance is very strong &amp; horrible.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve gotten more complements on my curls in the past few weeks than ever before.</li>

            <li> and I&#x27;ve gotten more complements on my curls in the past few weeks than ever before.</li>
            <li> Also, when I use this I can go for about three days without a flat iron.  </li>
            <li> and I use the flat iron on my hair a lot and this product protects my hair from heat damage</li>
            <li> I slide my palms on the inside and outside of my hair starting at my ear length and work it down to the ends which is a couple of inches below my shoulders.</li>
            <li> I blow dry my hair every night before I go to bed, which dries out my hair from the shaft to the ends and leaves it frizzy.</li>
            <li> It says to put on dry hair</li>
            <li> I use about the size of a pea and work it into my hair while it is still damp then blow dry</li>
            <li> /&gt;First day I tried it, I thought maybe my hair was too dry to apply the creme, as I had crystal-like gummy nuggets all throughout my hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s long, too, yet a small dab of this stuff leaves it soft and frizz-free.</li>
            <li> You get little product and small clear balls are left in your hair.;It</li>
            <li> but I was a little skeptical and bought the smallest tube available.  </li>

            <li> I had gone through a different seller (cant&#x27; recall the name) and the cap was taped shut, poorly packaged and took 2 weeks before it was delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottle is small &amp; it costs around $10.&lt;br /&gt;It may protect your hair a little from getting dried out from chlorine</li>

            <li> I had to write something  have been going to the pool at least twice a week since it open and alot of get togethers with friend so ive been.styling alot and yesterday my natural curly hair was dull limp and.wavey instead of bouncy spiral curls mind you i&#x27;m mixed. Mexican black and native american very thick curly hair. Anywho i used a.small size.like.everyone else.suggested and worked in.more if i needed to im serious when.i say my hair.just came.back to life maybe even better then before but ive only used it once but so.far.so good but its pricey for the amount. But i will buy again</li>
            <li> Great to control frizz</li>
            <li> Has a weird glittery residue all over your palms. Hair does become flaky in moist weather</li>
            <li> product doesnt weigh hair down...yet it does condition hair and feels as if its mending hair I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> I cannot believe I haven&#x27;t heard of Crack before.  I truly love this product that can handle the humidity of Florida with ease.  I use the tiniest sliver of product, maybe a skinny inch worth mixed with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Skinny Serum (the size a quarter).  It is truly an amazing product that really delivers.  No frizz even in the rain. Slight smell to product m but nothing harsh.  Also, when I use this I can go for about three days without a flat iron.  Would definitely buy again, and again, and again.  I should stock up right?</li>
            <li> Crack leave in protection makes my hair super soft, and smells WONDERFUL! I can see how this product could become habit forming!</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff came on time</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my curly hair feel. I get really healthy, natural looking curls that are soft yet still defined. A little goes a long way in wet hair. For when I style my hair curly this might be my favorite hair product of all time and I&#x27;ve gotten more complements on my curls in the past few weeks than ever before. I promise I don&#x27;t work for this company. :)</li>
            <li> Love this product defiantly true to its name because I am now Addicted!! keeps my hair looking sleek and really put a nice shine.  Only takes a small amount so this size is perfect and worth every penny!!</li>
            <li> This is super pricey. The bottle is small &amp; it costs around $10.&lt;br /&gt;It may protect your hair a little from getting dried out from chlorine but I can&#x27;t be certain. What I do know for sure is that the fragrance is very strong &amp; horrible.</li>
            <li> i was expecting more conditioning , it&#x60;s a bit too thick , not creamy enough , my hair is waive and thin,&lt;br /&gt;maybe for some hair it works better, i may have to try different amount c if it will make any deference</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hair and it is fine, dry, curly, and very prone to frizz. It&#x27;s long, too, yet a small dab of this stuff leaves it soft and frizz-free. I was accustomed to concocting a hair product cocktail incorporating 4 or 5 different hair tonics, moisturizers, leave-in conditioners, curl encouragers, texturizers and/or styling creams. Now I usually get away with Crack plus a texturizer and/or styling or curling cream.</li>
            <li> Great product! Thanks!</li>
            <li> Perfect for travel, purse, car, work desk, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonderful. I have been buying it through Amazon for about 6 months and tried it solely based on it&#x27;s good reviews. I blow dry my hair every night before I go to bed, which dries out my hair from the shaft to the ends and leaves it frizzy. I have fine (thin) hair and put about a half dollar sized amount in my palm and rub it around to crate a thin film on my palms. I slide my palms on the inside and outside of my hair starting at my ear length and work it down to the ends which is a couple of inches below my shoulders. Magic - no more frizz and my hair feels like their is no product in it and is brushable. Also a little bit like a detangler too.</li>
            <li> The name says it all.  After you use it on your hair once, you will be addicted.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair shiny and smooth for several days. I get lots of compliments on how beautifully hair looks. Really wonderful product for curly hair,</li>
            <li> Great product.  Helps with the &amp;#34;frizzies&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I have tried other products that I like better. It does what it says and I can&#x27;t say anything bad, but I&#x27;d opt for trying something new or using something I&#x27;m already familiar with.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that leaves hair soft and smooth, and coats the hair just enough to add a bit of body.  And buy it here -- its much cheaper than at the local brick-and-mortar store.</li>
            <li> I have very course curly hair, This product gave me control and shine. A little does go a long way. The price is fairly reasonable for the product. It helps in the summer humidity.</li>
            <li> Great product using it for years.  It truly works to help the frizz and calm the hair down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found an AMAZING frizz fighting product. Let me add that this came VERY fast. I ordered it Friday and I got it Wednesday... One day early than expected. It was neatly packaged and looked very legit. It says to put on dry hair but honestly it can be out on damp hair too. Smells amazing!! This stuff is addicting, CRACK!!! I love that I could order a smaller size before buying a big size. Very convenient, thanks amazon! My hair is so silky and no frizz.&lt;br /&gt;My split ends look amazing. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> Use very little product or it will feel greasy!!!  I just put it on the ends and it feels soft.</li>
            <li> Works great. Smells great. It doesn&#x27;t burn off when straightening like a lot of products do.&lt;br /&gt;will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It was recommended by my stylist and it really tames my crazy hair (without using a flat iron!). Just use a tiny amount (pea-size for medium length), so it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> So far I love this new leave-in treatment, and it smells awesome!</li>
            <li> You get little product and small clear balls are left in your hair.;It doesn&#x27;t blend well. However, it does make your hair soft. It&#x27;s worth trying if you like to try different products.</li>
            <li> Best product EVER! I don&#x27;t think there could ever be anything that&#x27;ll replace this! If ur hair is damaged, try this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is Awesome</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really work that good. Will not buy again.</li>
            <li> Product came fast. I was told by my hair dresser this was the best stuff on the market as far as a leave in conditioner. I dont like it. Makes my hair feel greasy. smells like a mens product.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair really soft, and it has just a hint of sparkle in the cream to make your hair shiny but not greasy!</li>
            <li> I ordered this from InVanity (the seller) on Amazon and received this nicely packaged and on time, within a few days.&lt;br /&gt;The first order I had gone through a different seller (cant&#x27; recall the name) and the cap was taped shut, poorly packaged and took 2 weeks before it was delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works great in my naturally curly, medium to thin in places hair. I use about the size of a pea and work it into my hair while it is still damp then blow dry out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use too much it will become greasy in your hair. So a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a slight scent to this product, not bad or anything, more fruity that lingers. I have noticed that bad smells like cooking, or even smoke don&#x27;t stick to my hair when i am using this product. It cuts out the static from humid or dry weather conditions. My cousin is a hair stylist and she recommended I use this in my hair for static. It helps to leave my hair soft &amp; somewhat protects against heat damage &amp; split ends (with regular trims &amp; care)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my tube for a month now and really do like this stuff.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair and I use the flat iron on my hair a lot and this product protects my hair from heat damage, it&#x27;s amazing and the smell is delicious. It&#x27;s salon quality!</li>
            <li> Love this leave in.  Be careful not to use to much, or you will have white flakes</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few months now and it is just okay. I wanted it for the UV/ thermal protection, but I&#x27;ve found that liquid sprays are more effective for coating all of my hair. Also, I prefer my BC repair sealed ends for the ends of my hair (prevents and hides split ends better). I found this cream difficult to work through my hair evenly. So, not my favorite hair cream. :P</li>
            <li> Ladies, this is an ok product IF you don&#x27;t like smelling like a MAN!! It is very masculine smelling. Yes, it makes your hair pretty soft, but not any more so than some cheaper store brands I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;m going to try &amp; return this. Not worth it.</li>
            <li> love it makes my hair feel so great!</li>
            <li> WOAH! Amazing if you flat iron or curl - if you just leave this in like a conditioner it does nothing but once heat is applied its very effective not greasy but shiny!</li>
            <li> fast delivery. works well on my kinky curly natural 4a/4b hair.&lt;br /&gt;Have been in high humidity the last week AND worked out and my hair didn&#x27;t transform into a Don King afro. Remained sleek and soft. I&#x27;m buying more on Amazon because I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
            <li> It is amazing how little of this product you use to get results.  A tiny, tiny amount keeps my straw-like winter hair from being brittle and fly-away.  Anson Mount, of Hell on Wheels, recommended this product on social media.  Anson is a hunk but I was a little skeptical and bought the smallest tube available.  I should have had more faith in him, because I love this product.  The little tube will last quite awhile though and I will buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Great product!  I use it every day!</li>
            <li> Wonderful on my hair. I wish that it came in a bigger size though.</li>
            <li> This product is beyond amazing!!!!!!!!! A tiny amount is all you need to get super soft, smooth &amp; shiny silky hair!! It gets rid of the fuzz instantly. LOVE. LOVE. LOVE.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff !  It really helps your hair, just don&#x27;t use a lot. start with a dime size, and go from there !</li>
            <li> I have not personally bought this product from amazon but yesterday I got my hair done and my hairdresser used this on my hair and its literally AMAZING. I have bleached my hair so many times so my hair is completely dead. but a little dab of this makes it seem like ive never even touched my hair! best thing ever.</li>
            <li> Good stuff! And this is a GREAT price to give it a try! (Btw, I could be wrong but I think you get only ONE tube at this price. I&#x27;m not sure why the pic indicates you get 3.)</li>
            <li> This product worked great on my fine coarse natural african american hair. I used about a nickel sized amount and rubbed throughout my hair, then once I blow dried my hair, my hair was super straight. Plus, once I flat ironed my hair, it looked like I just received a fresh relaxer. I will never go back to relaxing my hair, especially now that I have this product.  Other than the name, there is nothing I dislike about the product. However, maybe the name fits, as I am now hooked :)</li>
            <li> I had heard such great things about this hair creme, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it.&lt;br /&gt;First day I tried it, I thought maybe my hair was too dry to apply the creme, as I had crystal-like gummy nuggets all throughout my hair. I had to rinse it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd time I tried it, I made sure my hair was damp enough and again, gummy clear crystal nuggets. I was really bummed. :( I don&#x27;t like it...I don&#x27;t like it at all. It doesn&#x27;t even have a good smell to it.</li>
            <li> Makes hair texture fantastic.!</li>
