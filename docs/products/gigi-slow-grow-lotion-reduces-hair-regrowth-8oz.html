            <li>I had to let other people know how great it is.</li>
            <li>Shipped quickly.</li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what part of my grooming ritual helped my hair grow in slowly and more fine, but either way I am not going to question the results.</li>
            <li>This product really does smooth skin and reduce the rate of hair regrowth.  </li>
            <li>, I love the results, it will take at least a month to see good results of the product,&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>first time trying.  </li>
            <li>I made the test with one leg first and a good part of the hair did not grow back after the second week.  </li>
            <li>It has a light clean scent, be sure to apply a very small amount to DAMP skin; as directed on the package.  </li>
            <li>This lotion however is very cheap and lasts for a long time.</li>
            <li>Birth control prevented the first portion of the equation from becoming a reality while laser hair treatment combined with the Gigi lotion is taking care of the latter.</li>
            <li>Works great for fine hair and has slowed growth of thicker coarse hair but still have daily stubble and have to tweeze every other day.</li>
            <li>Not only did she have too many offspring, but the old gal certainly had some chin hairs that needed removing.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>This product really works.</li>
            <li>Then you have to really rub it in and it makes the product a pain to use.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t see much change..</li>
            <li>I was really hopeful that this would work.</li>
            <li>This really works.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works with reducing the growth.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I just have really motivated hair follicles and they just grow no matter what?&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it goes away fast though.</li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>In my case this lotion works very well.  </li>
            <li>This product works very well</li>
            <li>and this product really works for me .</li>
            <li>Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
            <li>Not too much to fully rate it.  </li>
            <li>Very unsatisfied with this productvand its promise.</li>
            <li>I have purchased other brands that work MUCH better.</li>
            <li>A nice light scent and a small amount goes a long way.</li>
            <li>I have only used it two times, so can&#x27;t give a true review yet.</li>
            <li>They should find a way to make the formula more absorbent so that the consumer actually uses it on a regular basis!  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this product ladies who suffer with hair removal or PCOS.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend buying this product ladies who suffer with hair removal or PCOS.</li>
            <li>what I suggest is apply a little and rub it fully and do it again. :]</li>
            <li>I normally have my hair growing out in the evening</li>
            <li>Makes skin very soft also.</li>
            <li>I read reviews, and it worked for some people, I&#x27;m surprised how?!</li>
            <li>Just put it on after shaving or waxing and you will notice the hair doesn&#x27;t come back as fast!</li>
            <li>its fine for skin lotion but as far as slowing down hair growth doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li>The only positive is the Smell.</li>
            <li>I was pretty skeptical when I bought this, but, surprisingly, I think it actually works!</li>
            <li>I use this and another cream off and on they both keep my skin smooth and soft and I have less hair on my legs.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s almost like the hair on my face is completely gone.</li>
            <li>My skin is extremely soft now in that area.</li>
            <li>Now that I have been using this lotion I see a totally complete 100% difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see any difference, so far it hasn&#x27;t worked</li>
            <li>Some may tend to disagree it all depends on what you&#x27;re sensitive to.</li>
            <li>And my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>I have pcos, and I love gig slow grow products, my only issue is I received the original bottle of lotion, i was hoping to try the new brand and smell of the purple bottle, was slightly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li>The hair grows back like normal.</li>
            <li>I used the product on my right leg - not the left, and found that both legs grew back hair at the same speed.</li>
            <li>I would pluck or wax daily, but the next day they would be right back again!!</li>
            <li>Before using this lotion, I would pluck the hairs on my face first thing in the morning only for the same hair to grow back halfway throughout the day.</li>
            <li>I almost always wear my hair down in public to try and hide the five o clock shadow that I used to have and would try to avoid everyone and anyone including my boyfriend from touching that area on my face because it felt like a rough stubble.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much, so the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li>Wow, a beauty product that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li>I m only 21 years old</li>
            <li>It may look like only a small amount in your hand but it spreads very well and covers large area.</li>
            <li>It really slows down hair growth.</li>
            <li>I m an asian male with very thick upper lip hairs and chin hairs , due to the shaving everyday I even got thicker hairs , and after I shave you could see those very light blue things (hair root) around my lips and its very obivous like I havent shaved yet.</li>

            <li> its fine for skin lotion but as far as slowing down hair growth doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The only positive is the Smell.</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical when I bought this, but, surprisingly, I think it actually works!</li>
            <li> I use this and another cream off and on they both keep my skin smooth and soft and I have less hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s almost like the hair on my face is completely gone.</li>
            <li> My skin is extremely soft now in that area.</li>
            <li> Now that I have been using this lotion I see a totally complete 100% difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference, so far it hasn&#x27;t worked</li>
            <li> Some may tend to disagree it all depends on what you&#x27;re sensitive to.</li>
            <li> And my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I have pcos, and I love gig slow grow products, my only issue is I received the original bottle of lotion, i was hoping to try the new brand and smell of the purple bottle, was slightly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;but</li>
            <li> The hair grows back like normal.</li>
            <li> I used the product on my right leg - not the left, and found that both legs grew back hair at the same speed.</li>
            <li> I would pluck or wax daily, but the next day they would be right back again!!</li>
            <li> Before using this lotion, I would pluck the hairs on my face first thing in the morning only for the same hair to grow back halfway throughout the day.</li>
            <li> I almost always wear my hair down in public to try and hide the five o clock shadow that I used to have and would try to avoid everyone and anyone including my boyfriend from touching that area on my face because it felt like a rough stubble.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much, so the bottle will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Wow, a beauty product that actually does what it says.</li>
            <li> I m only 21 years old</li>
            <li> It may look like only a small amount in your hand but it spreads very well and covers large area.</li>
            <li> It really slows down hair growth.</li>
            <li> I m an asian male with very thick upper lip hairs and chin hairs , due to the shaving everyday I even got thicker hairs , and after I shave you could see those very light blue things (hair root) around my lips and its very obivous like I havent shaved yet.</li>
            <li> A little thicker than expected and the smell is not desirable, but it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> After about two weeks of using this, that number has decreased significantly.</li>
            <li> From reading the reviews there was more positive feedback to base my decision to try this product.</li>
            <li> Smells very unpleasant right out of the bottle and takes a significant amount of work to rub in-- its streaks similar to sunscreen, but more frustrating due to lack of fluidity.</li>
            <li> However this product is kinda hard to rub in and turns to white color if you apply too much  .</li>
            <li> I had to let other people know how great it is.y with a dark ugly beard all around my face and 5 o&#x27;clock shadows all day every day.</li>
            <li> I hardly have any more hairs and the hairs that do grow back (which is very VERY minimal), are very thin and not thick at all.</li>
            <li> After using this lotion, it didn&#x27;t take long to see results.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a month and have noticed a considerable slow hair growth on my upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li> have over half a bottle left and am throwing it away...</li>
            <li> The product does seem to help with regrowth and also seems to make the regrowth less coarse.</li>
            <li> Slightly slower hair growth on the next two days.</li>
            <li> The texture is a little &amp;#34;greasier&amp;#34; than I thought - shows a white film on the skin if not thoroughly rubbed in.  </li>
            <li> I have seen minimal  reduction in hair growth.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it slow the hair growth, but after i use my epilady to remove the hair, it soothes my skin and makes it easier to epilady the next time.  </li>
            <li> other than that</li>
            <li> This product did slow hair growth but one negative aspect is that it leaves whiteness behind if you use too much (more than ½ teaspoon in any given area).  </li>
            <li> It is a non greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause infected hair like other lotions can after shaving.</li>
            <li> I usually get stubbly same day as shaving, and have dark/coarse hair.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a very long way!</li>
            <li> A small drop of this lotion goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Dark course hair-</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this, but it really works.</li>
            <li> 2 stars because it finally made it here late</li>
            <li> I used to stand in front of the mirror for 15 minutes each morning plucking the coarse and thick patches of hairs on my neck..</li>
            <li> It does slow down the hair growth if used daily.</li>
            <li> This allows me to shave half as often as I used to.</li>
            <li> and the hair that grows is softer and less amount.</li>
            <li> The smell disappears after a half hour or so.</li>
            <li> And helped a little with shaving.</li>
            <li> Will try a little longer.</li>
            <li> Im Dominican guy with really thick facial hair and this product really slow down the growth</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, caused lots of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
            <li> I also tried it on my legs a few times and it doesn&#x27;t work there either.</li>
            <li> Since using this lotion for a few weeks, I can go 2-3 days before they start to get prickly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I use it 1x a day everyday.</li>
            <li> Thick dark hairs and plenty of them would grow on my chin.</li>
            <li> If you are in a rush, it can slow you down.  </li>
            <li> I always had a fear that I would grow to be an old lady with a dark ugly beard all around my face and 5 o&#x27;clock shadows all day every day.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be aware that several hours after application is when you can notice the WORST smell, regardless of the shower taken beforehand.  </li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> They are hardly even noticeable.</li>
            <li> and even then they still seem like they are hardly there.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do nothing to slow hair growrh</li>
            <li> This does slow the growth of hair (if you remember to use it).</li>
            <li> Along with this I use Lierac Homme after shave balm which works too to slow your hairs growing speed ^^</li>
            <li> Does not work that well to slow hair growth</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone with annoying facial hair.</li>
            <li> Would like to assess after having used for approximately one month.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant and I&#x27;m the woman in the mall coughing/gagging as I walk past Bath and Body Works...  </li>
            <li> Not perfect</li>
            <li> For a lady with PCOS, you could not go wrong.</li>
            <li> For a lady with PCOS, you could not go wrong.</li>
            <li> When eating cereal in my PJs the next morning I was offended by a terrible smell nearby and upon closer investigation</li>

            <li> face kinda numb.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Not perfect but it works better than nothing. I think it works maybe not as well as we wish but it&#x27;s okay. Shipped quickly. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My goal in life has always been to avoid becoming the old woman who lived in a shoe. Not only did she have too many offspring, but the old gal certainly had some chin hairs that needed removing. Birth control prevented the first portion of the equation from becoming a reality while laser hair treatment combined with the Gigi lotion is taking care of the latter. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what part of my grooming ritual helped my hair grow in slowly and more fine, but either way I am not going to question the results. My assumption is that the lotion helped.</li>
            <li> This product does not work well for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money, caused lots of ingrown hairs</li>
            <li> I am sooo glad I came across this product. It is like a miracle lotion. I am a woman who suffers from PCOS, and have tried almost everything except laser hair removal because it is too pricey. This lotion however is very cheap and lasts for a long time. A small drop of this lotion goes a long way. I used to stand in front of the mirror for 15 minutes each morning plucking the coarse and thick patches of hairs on my neck.. This had lowered my self esteem greatly. I almost always wear my hair down in public to try and hide the five o clock shadow that I used to have and would try to avoid everyone and anyone including my boyfriend from touching that area on my face because it felt like a rough stubble. Kind of like a men&#x27;s beard after not shaving for a day. After using this lotion, it didn&#x27;t take long to see results. Only two days till my hair was basically ridden. I applied the lotion first thing in the morning after plucking and then taking a shower and first thing before I go to bed at night. It&#x27;s almost like the hair on my face is completely gone. My skin is extremely soft now in that area. I&#x27;m not self conscious at all about anyone touching my face anymore!! It is literally a miracle. Before using this lotion, I would pluck the hairs on my face first thing in the morning only for the same hair to grow back halfway throughout the day. If anyone looked closely at my face they would be able to see it. Especially in the sunlight. Now that I have been using this lotion I see a totally complete 100% difference. I hardly have any more hairs and the hairs that do grow back (which is very VERY minimal), are very thin and not thick at all. They are hardly even noticeable. You would only notice if you used a magnifying glass to look at them and even then they still seem like they are hardly there. I will never stop buying this product. I literally am in love. I&#x27;m so glad I have found something that finally works for me. I always had a fear that I would grow to be an old lady with a dark ugly beard all around my face and 5 o&#x27;clock shadows all day every day. But now I have hope. It&#x27;s almost like I&#x27;ve gotten laser hair removal and all growth has stopped. For a lady with PCOS, you could not go wrong. I highly recommend buying this product ladies who suffer with hair removal or PCOS. Not making this up or getting paid to write a good review either. I just love this lotion soooo much I had to let other people know how great it is.y with a dark ugly beard all around my face and 5 o&#x27;clock shadows all day every day. But now I have hope. It&#x27;s almost like I&#x27;ve gotten laser hair removal and all growth has stopped. For a lady with PCOS, you could not go wrong. I highly recommend buying this product ladies who suffer with hair removal or PCOS. Not making this up or getting paid to write a good review either. I just love this lotion soooo much I had to let other people know how great it is.</li>
            <li> This lotion did nothing for me.I saw no results from using it. Infact, I thought I saw faster hair growth.</li>
            <li> My skin absorbs the lotion pretty quickly and it does not finish oily on the skin, and the fragrance is pretty good.</li>
            <li> A nice light scent and a small amount goes a long way. It&#x27;s a bit too soon to judge whether or not it is effective reducing hair growth, but I am using it faithfully. I love the scent and it is a great moisturizer!</li>
            <li> Smells very unpleasant right out of the bottle and takes a significant amount of work to rub in-- its streaks similar to sunscreen, but more frustrating due to lack of fluidity. Upon rubbing it dries up significantly and almost becomes a \\&quot;paste\\&quot;...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be aware that several hours after application is when you can notice the WORST smell, regardless of the shower taken beforehand.  I showered at night, put the lotion on, and slept.  When eating cereal in my PJs the next morning I was offended by a terrible smell nearby and upon closer investigation i realized it was the LOTION...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have over half a bottle left and am throwing it away... Gross..</li>
            <li> its fine for skin lotion but as far as slowing down hair growth doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> Exactly what i wanted... Thanks</li>
            <li> Dark course hair- Tweezed then applied. hair growth rate reduced the next morning&lt;br /&gt;fine hair- haven&#x27;t tried&lt;br /&gt;Product has a nice smell.  It is creamy, easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.</li>
            <li> I have only owned for a short time so i hope it works &#x3D;) I figured i would give this a chance even though i do not believe things like this work. Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> This stuff works very well! I am a lighter skinned women of color with some facial hair on the chin and I use this after I tweeze. It helps tremendously with me going from tweezing once a day to once a week!!! Yes this stuff is awesome.......Will continue to buy without doubt!!!</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t do nothing to slow hair growrh</li>
            <li> This lotion did nothing for me. The hair grew back just like before. It also has so many ingredients that I cannot even pronounce.</li>
            <li> A little thicker than expected and the smell is not desirable, but it works pretty well. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple weeks now and am already seeing results. Have been recommending to everyone.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I saw no difference in the area treated.</li>
            <li> I have pcos, and I love gig slow grow products, my only issue is I received the original bottle of lotion, i was hoping to try the new brand and smell of the purple bottle, was slightly disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;but other than that I have used the original bottle of gigi before, I love the results, it will take at least a month to see good results of the product,&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of facial hair, minimizes my growth greatly</li>
            <li> This product really works. Im Dominican guy with really thick facial hair and this product really slow down the growth</li>
            <li> This product just didn&#x27;t work for me.  I have purchased other brands that work MUCH better. I tried this one because the price was really good. Lesson learned. You get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Been using for about two weeks and I see no improvement whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I&#x27;m not giving it enough time.  I will continue applying twice a day&lt;br /&gt;for a couple of months and hope it works.</li>
            <li> This product did slow hair growth but one negative aspect is that it leaves whiteness behind if you use too much (more than ½ teaspoon in any given area).  Then you have to really rub it in and it makes the product a pain to use.  If you are in a rush, it can slow you down.  They should find a way to make the formula more absorbent so that the consumer actually uses it on a regular basis!  At this point, it just sits in my drawer and I use it when I have extra time to spend putting lotion on.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product.  The texture is a little &amp;#34;greasier&amp;#34; than I thought - shows a white film on the skin if not thoroughly rubbed in.  BUT, the product does what it says - so I like that a lot!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  I showed zero difference in using the product versus not using the product.  I used the product on my right leg - not the left, and found that both legs grew back hair at the same speed.</li>
            <li> I glad I found this. The product does seem to help with regrowth and also seems to make the regrowth less coarse.</li>
            <li> The product has parbens in it which  are  cancer causing, plus to me it seemed like the hair growth increased.</li>
            <li> It does not work. Please don&#x27;t waste your money! I got it for my facial hair and used it for a few weeks very sparingly on my chin. It didn&#x27;t help at all, like not one bit. I also tried it on my legs a few times and it doesn&#x27;t work there either. I read reviews, and it worked for some people, I&#x27;m surprised how?! Because it did nothing for me.. I returned it. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the best hair minimizing lotion I have used. I would definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> I was pretty skeptical when I bought this, but, surprisingly, I think it actually works! My legs used to get prickly within 24 hours of shaving them. Since using this lotion for a few weeks, I can go 2-3 days before they start to get prickly. The hair also seems a bit softer. I will be buying this religiously from now on. :)</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t see much change..won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after trying so many others and found this one to work for me.  I&#x27;ve applied this to my legs and face and I see an improvement in minimizing hair growth.  I would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see any difference, so far it hasn&#x27;t worked</li>
            <li> This product really does smooth skin and reduce the rate of hair regrowth.  All Gigi products are usually good quality.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t work!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;regret buying it</li>
            <li> Wow, a beauty product that actually does what it says. Every morning, I have a number of hairs to pluck from my face. After about two weeks of using this, that number has decreased significantly. I gave it just 4 stars because the fragrance is pretty strong, and my skin is sensitive. But a little pimple is a fair trade for the effectiveness of the hair treatment.</li>
            <li> It does visibly reduce hair growth, easy to apply, and smells nice.</li>
            <li> From reading the reviews there was more positive feedback to base my decision to try this product. The lotion smells nice.</li>
            <li> I had very low expectations, but this is truly a miracle product. I like the smell, very clean and gender neutral. I could see results from the first day and I spend only a fraction of the time tweezing that I used to. It doesn&#x27;t take much, so the bottle will last a long time. I would recommend this to anyone with annoying facial hair. It really works!</li>
            <li> It has a light clean scent, be sure to apply a very small amount to DAMP skin; as directed on the package.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling on your skin.</li>
            <li> If i could drive it to a store and return it, I would. It doesn&#x27;t work it&#x27;s stupid and I hate it.</li>
            <li> I was really hopeful that this would work. I have Pcos . gives me a lot of extra hair. I didn&#x27;t work at all. Good for a lotion that&#x27;s it</li>
            <li> I have only used it two times, so can&#x27;t give a true review yet.</li>
            <li> This has worked for me. The hair is growing back slower and finer. I liked it the first time I used it! It is a non greasy and doesn&#x27;t cause infected hair like other lotions can after shaving. I also wax and used this one waxed areas with no problems. I don&#x27;t use perfumes or scented soaps of any kind b/c I&#x27;m sensitive to strong smells. I didn&#x27;t find the scent of this lotion too strong.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  It does what it says.  It took about 2 weeks for it to work, but it was worth the wait.  It really slows down hair growth.</li>
            <li> Have been using product every day twice daily for a month for some chin and neck growth. Works great for fine hair and has slowed growth of thicker coarse hair but still have daily stubble and have to tweeze every other day. Notably reduced scarring.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, and it really worked for me..) I tried a lot of products for this matter, and this finally did it. I am amazed.</li>
            <li> I have used this and have noticed a big difference in the length of time the hair has taken to come back in. I will be purchasing another bottle soon. The smell isn&#x27;t unpleasant and I&#x27;m the woman in the mall coughing/gagging as I walk past Bath and Body Works...  Some may tend to disagree it all depends on what you&#x27;re sensitive to.</li>
            <li> This really works. Im seeing the inprovment.</li>
            <li> It just makes my lips/face kinda numb. I don&#x27;t think it works with reducing the growth.&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps I just have really motivated hair follicles and they just grow no matter what?&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t want to say it doesn&#x27;t work at all, I notice my hair grows in patchier when I use it. So, maybe it&#x27;s me and not them..</li>
            <li> Like this lotion.  first time trying.  thank you</li>
            <li> This does slow the growth of hair (if you remember to use it). Just put it on after shaving or waxing and you will notice the hair doesn&#x27;t come back as fast!</li>
            <li> This product works but you should use it daily! I love it:) The smell isn&#x27;t bad either Kim.d of like baby powder it goes away fast though.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. It doesn&#x27;t do anything but smell but it does smell nice. It just doesn&#x27;t do what they say.</li>
            <li> I usually get stubbly same day as shaving, and have dark/coarse hair. This allows me to shave half as often as I used to. Makes skin very soft also. A little bit goes a very long way! It may look like only a small amount in your hand but it spreads very well and covers large area.</li>
            <li> Horrible.  Avon had a great one years ago and since it was discontinued, I have not been able to find one that compares.  This one does nothing.  The hair grows back like normal. No change whatsoever. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I got this and have been using it.  It working so well I have medium to course hair and just within the short amount of time I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;ve seen a big difference.  I think its a good consistency and does not have a really perfume smell to it which I really like.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product that works great and have noticed softer skin and less hair regrowth. and the hair that grows is softer and less amount. great product to use especially if skin sensitive.</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  My facial hair is thinner &amp; regrowth is slower!  I love the smell....very nice.  Be sure &amp; use it daily for best results.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t stop the hair growth at all</li>
            <li> The product does what it says.  I would have liked to have seen more substantial results but it still worked.  Slightly slower hair growth on the next two days.</li>
            <li> the product smells good and it arrived very quickly but I have been using it for a month now faithfully and I don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this, but it really works. It does slow down the hair growth if used daily. The smell is intense, but nice. Smells kind of like concentrated soap. The smell disappears after a half hour or so.</li>
            <li> In my case this lotion works very well.  My best recommendation is to wax first and after each shower apply the Gigi lotion in circular motion.  I made the test with one leg first and a good part of the hair did not grow back after the second week.  This product works very well, you just need to be patient.</li>
            <li> I m an asian male with very thick upper lip hairs and chin hairs , due to the shaving everyday I even got thicker hairs , and after I shave you could see those very light blue things (hair root) around my lips and its very obivous like I havent shaved yet. I m only 21 years old I couldn&#x27;t image how 5 years after my lip hairs are going to be so I purchased this . and this product really works for me . I normally have my hair growing out in the evening if I shave in the morning , but now hairs grow out after couple days and the roots are not that obvious anymore( how ever i still have them but much better )  . Along with this I use Lierac Homme after shave balm which works too to slow your hairs growing speed ^^ you can find it on walgreen&#x27;s site.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  However this product is kinda hard to rub in and turns to white color if you apply too much  . what I suggest is apply a little and rub it fully and do it again. :]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars</li>
            <li> 2 stars because it finally made it here late,it leaked and I didn&#x27;t receive the add on item I order.  The product is good I noticed the hair does grow back slower. I only know this because I used the product before I ordered this.</li>
            <li> I applied this immediately after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 1st application, it seemed to work.&lt;br /&gt;But each time after that, it appeared to ACCELERATE hair growth, not INHIBIT it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m extremely Disappointed. The only positive is the Smell. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;But I did not spend a ton of money on PERFUME ! ! !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted a hair Slower or Stopper. I got the Opposite.</li>
            <li> Thank god for this cream!! I&#x27;m a woman who has struggled and been self-conscious about my lady beard for years. Thick dark hairs and plenty of them would grow on my chin. I would pluck or wax daily, but the next day they would be right back again!! Now, I apply this cream as directed, and I go DAYS longer without having to pluck, and what does grow back is finer hair and in smaller amounts. Way more manageable. And my skin is soft. I&#x27;ve been dreaming of a solution like this!!</li>
            <li> Smells good. Works great as a lotion. And helped a little with shaving. But I loved it as a lotion more than anything.</li>
            <li> I use this and another cream off and on they both keep my skin smooth and soft and I have less hair on my legs.</li>
            <li> Does not work that well to slow hair growth</li>
            <li> I used it daily and it did nothing.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a month and have noticed a considerable slow hair growth on my upper lip and chin.</li>
            <li> Not only does it slow the hair growth, but after i use my epilady to remove the hair, it soothes my skin and makes it easier to epilady the next time.  Smells nice too</li>
            <li> Love love love.  I have to wax my face and it would last maybe 5 days before needing to re do it. I&#x27;m on week 2 and it still looks Judy like I had it done.  I use it 1x a day everyday.</li>
            <li> Have been using the product for about two weeks and have noticed somewhat of a difference.  Not too much to fully rate it.  I have seen minimal  reduction in hair growth.  Will try a little longer. Would like to assess after having used for approximately one month.</li>
            <li> Very unsatisfied with this productvand its promise.</li>
