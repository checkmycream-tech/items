            <li>I thought that this hair was actually ok</li>

            <li>It came in a manilla enveloIe but the hair wasnt in a plastic slip like most hair you buy in the beauty supply stores.</li>
            <li>I had to cut most of it because it was nappy at the end</li>
            <li>and then after getting it to an ok length I had to continuously spray oil sheen and water in it to keep the waviness.</li>
            <li>i love it</li>

            <li>im not even sure if this hair is brazillian because it feels and look like mix hair</li>
            <li>It was shedding a lot and tangling but as the days went by it got better</li>
            <li>I was going to buy more today but the price is way to hair now...</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t sure how the hair was supposed to be</li>
            <li>AND I LOVE IT...</li>
            <li>It was ok it got nappy after a couple of days</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I love this hair .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not for sure.</li>
            <li>iim sure iit wiill eventually leave after washiing iit though..</li>
            <li>However I have noticed that this hair does better without any styling gels or aerosols.</li>
            <li>the bundles could have been more thicker.</li>
            <li>i love it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love it....  </li>
            <li>Have not washed it yet, since I&#x27;ve seen many reviews saying it will ruin the hair.</li>
            <li>I really love this hair.</li>
            <li>I have bought Brazilian hair for a lot more than I paid for this</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I love my hair</li>
            <li>Was very soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li>, I will update when I do, but so far so good!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really nice hair you need to use all five bundles for a full hair style.</li>
            <li>but for me I&#x27;m excited!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited I recommend buying some!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft , beautiful, easy to curl.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the hair ready to order more</li>
            <li>My wife is so happy with me and this only adds more love to our relationship.</li>
            <li>havent installed yet but the hair is really soft and the texture is great for the price</li>
            <li>it bone straight and the hair is still good.</li>
            <li>loved it so much I ordered an additional 26 inch bundle.</li>
            <li>i think the hair is a good quality as long as you take good care of it .its</li>
            <li>first off the hair is beautiful, it really is.</li>
            <li>and i can honestly say it&#x27;s legit, real virgin hair!</li>
            <li>Not that quality but looked nice the first week installed</li>
            <li>It was nice when I first got it</li>
            <li>Delivered on time , hair is good quality so far !</li>
            <li>It looks great, curls are  still there from when my stylist curled it last Saturday.</li>
            <li>and I won&#x27;t do the cheap hair again</li>
            <li>that following week on May 1, 2014 which was great considering the fact that I am stationed in Japan.</li>
            <li>I say for this price the hair was worth that and more.</li>
            <li>then fact this hair is so cheap</li>
            <li>In all honesty I should  have known because if something is cheap it will be just that....cheap.</li>
            <li>and so i had to go cheap with my hair this time around</li>
            <li>ii recommend thii shaiir to anyone lookiing for cheap 100% brazillian hunman haiir ..</li>
            <li>is this cheap anyway</li>
            <li>cheap hair</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>but I mean honestly all hair does some shedding ..it&#x27;s a great bargin</li>
            <li>It feels soft, smells like all hair from hair stores and the shedding is normal, the wave isn&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li>Minimum shedding and tangling, good hair, last a while.</li>
            <li>I colored this hair washed and conditioned it and no tangling, full of body,</li>
            <li>I had to use four bundles to get a full weave.</li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t deserve a full star</li>
            <li>It is very soft and the budndles are very full!</li>
            <li>Other than that its very good her &amp; I am satisfied with my purchase so far.</li>
            <li>And another thing, it curls really good, but doesn&#x27;t take flat ironing too well.</li>
            <li>Delivery was really quick</li>
            <li>Honestly speaking the first week the hair was fleek, after that I experienced so much shedding that I began to regret why i wasted my money.  </li>
            <li>When i curl it, it looks good, but the curls do not stay long......</li>
            <li>Bought this hair twice because one set isn&#x27;t enough for a full head do but the hair is amazing</li>
            <li>Package was delivered in exactly 5 days!</li>
            <li>and it is still so pretty!</li>
            <li>First off i Ordered The Hair on The 12th &amp;&amp; got it on the 16th!</li>
            <li>Should have went to the beauty supply store I would have had my hair faster and knew exactly what I was getting!</li>
            <li>I have a really huge head and this was more than enough hair definitely worth buying...</li>
            <li>have already started the process of dying my hair and it turned out amazing will be posting photos later</li>
            <li>So far i love the hair.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t own a garage they left it at someone house</li>
            <li>For the price I pay for this hair, it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li>than that it is worth the price</li>
            <li>but what hair doesn&#x27;t other then that its good just not at that price that it is now...</li>
            <li>Called amazon right away</li>
            <li>/&gt;Another con is that The Wave washes right out.</li>
            <li>This is the right place to go.</li>
            <li>right on time</li>
            <li>I went to the gym right after it was installed( I box) with it in a ponytail, and with an hour of sparring, sweating, and push ups etc the hair never tangled.</li>
            <li>Thickness just right.</li>
            <li>The hair is nice with the amount of bundles, but when I washed it the wave pretty much left.</li>
            <li>I wanted to do more protective styles now that my hair is back in a healthy state and decided to invest a bit more money in the hair I was buying as I wanted a partial weave install.</li>
            <li>Small bundles but the length was great.</li>
            <li>so the bundles length I got is kind of too long.</li>
            <li>That is not something unique to this particular item.</li>
            <li>I like it very much</li>
            <li>not even a thank you very much</li>
            <li>With a little bit of hair spray and good care this hair will be worn for months.</li>
            <li>Going back for sure.</li>
            <li>They are silky, they do not tangle, and they don&#x27;t smell funny.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not real human hair , most of it is synthetic.</li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering Brizilian Hair &amp; offline</li>
            <li>I love it last longer then I thought</li>
            <li>I didnt have any hair left over and could have used more if I had it</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li>I had this hair in for exactly 2 weeks...</li>
            <li>Even after bleaching the hair, it still remains soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li>they definitely have a customer for life:)</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping !</li>
            <li>AT FIRST I WAS THINKING TWICE ABOUT BUYING THE HAIR</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s my first time trying it</li>
            <li>a pretty copper.</li>
            <li>It didnt tangle at first</li>
            <li>First off the hair came in a couple of days.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure you can make it come back.</li>
            <li>Besides that the hair was okay next Time</li>
            <li>First to begin when I felt the texture</li>
            <li>but it was more than enough to work with.</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t have any smell it was very soft and true to length</li>
            <li>Other than that it&#x27;s still nice hair</li>
            <li>The hair is okay, not terrible but not amazing either.</li>
            <li>I bought hair from this company before and it was good, actually or was the same type of hair I repurchased</li>
            <li>They are able to put only a certain percent of the longest hairs in them, with the rest of the hair is shorter, yet they can charge you more for them because you&#x27;re asking for that long length.</li>
            <li>Other than that its great hair i dyed it also same day</li>
            <li>it came on time it has a lot of grey but that makes it better for colouring</li>
            <li>Felt good at first waste of money!!</li>
            <li>Yes this is genuine Brazilian human hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are indeed genuine Brazilian human hair extensions.</li>
            <li>After a couple of washing this hair is straight.</li>
            <li>no shedding no worries thanks much</li>
            <li>It does have grays but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li>once I installed it I knew it was real virgin hair...</li>
            <li>be back with an update on if any oils and brushing helps smooth out the ends</li>
            <li>yu really have to take care of it</li>
            <li>if you come it it gets really frizzy</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like the hair</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s not so much</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s cheap hair you can buy at a regular hair store.</li>
            <li>The hair sheds too much and fuzzy.</li>
            <li>it was more of a wet and wavy hair than anything.</li>
            <li>I am very unpleased with this hair and will not be ordering it again.</li>
            <li>Does not stay straight.</li>
            <li>not as much as beauty supply hair.</li>
            <li>did too much of shedding.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s REAL virgin hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to install the hair.</li>
            <li>The shedding is to much .</li>
            <li>The hair sheds way too much and tangles.</li>
            <li>The longest length now looks like a 16inch do to so much shedding.</li>
            <li>Air drying makes it brittle, rough, and causes more tangles.</li>
            <li>The hair didn&#x27;t shed that much, maybe 10 strands out of 3 bundles.</li>
            <li>I did dye it and it took the dye really well</li>
            <li>It also went straight after washing.</li>
            <li>fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I got my whole head weaved and didn&#x27;t even use the whole pack</li>
            <li>Absolutly love it so far and will be definitely ordering it again soon.!!</li>
            <li>You also have to care for it more than you would care for the expensive kind.</li>
            <li>The first few days i had it there was minimum shedding, but now there is more..</li>
            <li>I also purchased a lace closure which caused me to have a full bundle plus a piece left out of the 5.</li>
            <li>was concerned about it not being enough for a full head but it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First of all let me start by saying that i’m a professional hair stylist.....</li>
            <li>Yes its enough for a full head</li>
            <li>When i wash it and braid it, there is a pretty wave pattern, but i cant wear it all day because the ends on the 20&#x27;&#x27; and 22&#x27;&#x27; are super DRY and frizzy.</li>
            <li>other than that ii absolutely love thiis haiir.. ii have no shreds and iits very soft and gourgeous ..</li>
            <li>It is very silky, &amp; I believe it to be virgin hair because there are occasional Rare gray hairs running through it.</li>
            <li>Ill upload a pic when im done thanks im A happy customer</li>
            <li>Hair came a day earlier than expected which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>The hair was very pretty when I initially pulled it out of it&#x27;s packaging.</li>
            <li>The hair is very soft and silky!</li>
            <li>bc its not thick hair,</li>
            <li>So far it hasn&#x27;t she much.</li>
            <li>I will be doing an overall review on this as to whether or not this purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li>So glad my money didn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li>They start out nice and thick and then they just peter out to nothing</li>
            <li>They think it makes it look more natural and less bulky.</li>
            <li>and it waved right back</li>
            <li>for  a short term due, it doesn&#x27;t not appear to be suitable for any re-install.</li>
            <li>but i can live with it.</li>
            <li>However, It is way darker than natural color!</li>
            <li>it was really pretty, even though my stylist wasnt a big fan of it.</li>
            <li>even my hair dresser said the quality feels nice this 5 bundles does the whole entire hair plus I had a little extra</li>
            <li>Only about 30 percent of the hairs in there are going to actually be the full length you ordered.</li>
            <li>, my only downside is that I&#x27;m sceptical that it is enough to do a full head</li>
            <li>hair is absolutely stunning , it does shed a little but its only 100 bucks ..</li>
            <li>Came much later than the expected delivery date but overall the hair is great a little shedding but no tangles</li>
            <li>Not enough to notice unless you&#x27;re really looking for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The hair also had a loud processed smell ...</li>
            <li>Comes back really well with the correct conditioner.</li>
            <li>It came early that planned.</li>
            <li>Hair is soft to the touch I sewed with a machine</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft, but i&#x27;m already seeing shedding and tangling on day two</li>
            <li>but after a week or two it wasnt as soft and manageable as i wanted it to be.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li>The hair is soft and has not tangled..</li>
            <li>Wow , this hair is with it .</li>
            <li>and it meets my expectations so far .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really soft.</li>
            <li>Either go to the hair store and get it for cheaper, or spend a few extra dollars and get something of better quality.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These hair extensions are extremely thick at the top.</li>
            <li>Nice and wavy...but really thin.</li>
            <li>Hair is thick at top but thinner towards the bottom.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend it cuz it&#x27;s good hair, but again it&#x27;s thin and too silky !</li>
            <li>So they can actually feel pretty bulky because the bottoms are so thin you will want to use more tracks to get the look you want of length and fullness.</li>
            <li>There are better grades of hair at much higher prices, don&#x27;t get me wrong,  </li>
            <li>Shedding is minimal, hair is full and bounces well, overall...........</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really rough with my hair styles thick wefts nice texture.</li>
            <li>The first picture is when I first installed it and the second picture is the same installment a month and a half later.</li>
            <li>Shedding is expected and not too much shedding i must say.</li>
            <li>Personally I prefer double drawn hair extensions where all the hair is one length, and the hair extension is just as thick at the bottom as it is at the top.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re shiny, very natural looking, and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My inky negative comment is that I wish the natural color was more off black (1B)</li>
            <li>If they used all of those long hairs in one set of extensions it wouldn&#x27;t be ableto make it go so far.</li>
            <li>The tracks are thick amd full.</li>
            <li>Really thin and tangles easily</li>
            <li>Only about 50 percent of the length of this hair extension is super thick, and then it gradually gets thinner and thinner and thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>nice little shedding  but found it was thin to the end</li>
            <li>i have seen good and bad reviews</li>
    </ol>

            <li> However I have noticed that this hair does better without any styling gels or aerosols.</li>

            <li> I love it....  </li>

            <li> I really love this hair.</li>
            <li> I have bought Brazilian hair for a lot more than I paid for this</li>

            <li> Was very soft and beautiful.</li>
            <li> , I will update when I do, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really nice hair you need to use all five bundles for a full hair style.</li>
            <li> but for me I&#x27;m excited!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited I recommend buying some!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft , beautiful, easy to curl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the hair ready to order more</li>
            <li> My wife is so happy with me and this only adds more love to our relationship.</li>
            <li> havent installed yet but the hair is really soft and the texture is great for the price</li>
            <li> it bone straight and the hair is still good.</li>
            <li> loved it so much I ordered an additional 26 inch bundle.</li>
            <li> i think the hair is a good quality as long as you take good care of it .its</li>
            <li> first off the hair is beautiful, it really is.</li>
            <li> and i can honestly say it&#x27;s legit, real virgin hair!</li>
            <li> Not that quality but looked nice the first week installed</li>
            <li> It was nice when I first got it</li>
            <li> Delivered on time , hair is good quality so far !</li>
            <li> It looks great, curls are  still there from when my stylist curled it last Saturday.</li>
            <li> and I won&#x27;t do the cheap hair again</li>
            <li> that following week on May 1, 2014 which was great considering the fact that I am stationed in Japan.</li>
            <li> I say for this price the hair was worth that and more.</li>
            <li> then fact this hair is so cheap</li>
            <li> In all honesty I should  have known because if something is cheap it will be just that....cheap.</li>
            <li> and so i had to go cheap with my hair this time around</li>
            <li> ii recommend thii shaiir to anyone lookiing for cheap 100% brazillian hunman haiir ..</li>
            <li> is this cheap anyway</li>
            <li> cheap hair</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> but I mean honestly all hair does some shedding ..it&#x27;s a great bargin</li>
            <li> It feels soft, smells like all hair from hair stores and the shedding is normal, the wave isn&#x27;t that great</li>
            <li> Minimum shedding and tangling, good hair, last a while.</li>
            <li> I colored this hair washed and conditioned it and no tangling, full of body,</li>
            <li> I had to use four bundles to get a full weave.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t deserve a full star</li>
            <li> It is very soft and the budndles are very full!</li>
            <li> Other than that its very good her &amp; I am satisfied with my purchase so far.</li>
            <li> And another thing, it curls really good, but doesn&#x27;t take flat ironing too well.</li>
            <li> Delivery was really quick</li>
            <li> Honestly speaking the first week the hair was fleek, after that I experienced so much shedding that I began to regret why i wasted my money.  </li>
            <li> When i curl it, it looks good, but the curls do not stay long......</li>
            <li> Bought this hair twice because one set isn&#x27;t enough for a full head do but the hair is amazing</li>
            <li> Package was delivered in exactly 5 days!</li>
            <li> and it is still so pretty!</li>
            <li> First off i Ordered The Hair on The 12th &amp;&amp; got it on the 16th!</li>
            <li> Should have went to the beauty supply store I would have had my hair faster and knew exactly what I was getting!</li>
            <li> I have a really huge head and this was more than enough hair definitely worth buying...</li>
            <li> have already started the process of dying my hair and it turned out amazing will be posting photos later</li>
            <li> So far i love the hair.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t own a garage they left it at someone house</li>
            <li> For the price I pay for this hair, it is well worth the money.</li>
            <li> than that it is worth the price</li>
            <li> but what hair doesn&#x27;t other then that its good just not at that price that it is now...</li>
            <li> Called amazon right away</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another con is that The Wave washes right out.</li>
            <li> This is the right place to go.</li>
            <li> right on time</li>
            <li> I went to the gym right after it was installed( I box) with it in a ponytail, and with an hour of sparring, sweating, and push ups etc the hair never tangled.</li>
            <li> Thickness just right.</li>
            <li> The hair is nice with the amount of bundles, but when I washed it the wave pretty much left.</li>
            <li> I wanted to do more protective styles now that my hair is back in a healthy state and decided to invest a bit more money in the hair I was buying as I wanted a partial weave install.</li>
            <li> Small bundles but the length was great.</li>
            <li> so the bundles length I got is kind of too long.</li>
            <li> That is not something unique to this particular item.</li>
            <li> I like it very much</li>
            <li> not even a thank you very much</li>
            <li> With a little bit of hair spray and good care this hair will be worn for months.</li>
            <li> Going back for sure.</li>
            <li> They are silky, they do not tangle, and they don&#x27;t smell funny.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not real human hair , most of it is synthetic.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering Brizilian Hair &amp; offline</li>
            <li> I love it last longer then I thought</li>
            <li> I didnt have any hair left over and could have used more if I had it</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast!</li>
            <li> I had this hair in for exactly 2 weeks...</li>
            <li> Even after bleaching the hair, it still remains soft and tangle free.</li>
            <li> they definitely have a customer for life:)</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping !</li>
            <li> AT FIRST I WAS THINKING TWICE ABOUT BUYING THE HAIR</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s my first time trying it</li>
            <li> a pretty copper.</li>
            <li> It didnt tangle at first</li>
            <li> First off the hair came in a couple of days.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure you can make it come back.</li>
            <li> Besides that the hair was okay next Time</li>
            <li> First to begin when I felt the texture</li>
            <li> but it was more than enough to work with.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t have any smell it was very soft and true to length</li>
            <li> Other than that it&#x27;s still nice hair</li>
            <li> The hair is okay, not terrible but not amazing either.</li>
            <li> I bought hair from this company before and it was good, actually or was the same type of hair I repurchased</li>
            <li> They are able to put only a certain percent of the longest hairs in them, with the rest of the hair is shorter, yet they can charge you more for them because you&#x27;re asking for that long length.</li>
            <li> Other than that its great hair i dyed it also same day</li>
            <li> it came on time it has a lot of grey but that makes it better for colouring</li>
            <li> Felt good at first waste of money!!</li>
            <li> Yes this is genuine Brazilian human hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are indeed genuine Brazilian human hair extensions.</li>
            <li> After a couple of washing this hair is straight.</li>
            <li> no shedding no worries thanks much</li>
            <li> It does have grays but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s real.</li>
            <li> once I installed it I knew it was real virgin hair...</li>
            <li> be back with an update on if any oils and brushing helps smooth out the ends</li>
            <li> yu really have to take care of it</li>
            <li> if you come it it gets really frizzy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like the hair</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s not so much</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s cheap hair you can buy at a regular hair store.</li>
            <li> The hair sheds too much and fuzzy.</li>
            <li> it was more of a wet and wavy hair than anything.</li>
            <li> I am very unpleased with this hair and will not be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> Does not stay straight.</li>
            <li> not as much as beauty supply hair.</li>
            <li> did too much of shedding.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s REAL virgin hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting ready to install the hair.</li>
            <li> The shedding is to much .</li>
            <li> The hair sheds way too much and tangles.</li>
            <li> The longest length now looks like a 16inch do to so much shedding.</li>
            <li> Air drying makes it brittle, rough, and causes more tangles.</li>
            <li> The hair didn&#x27;t shed that much, maybe 10 strands out of 3 bundles.</li>
            <li> I did dye it and it took the dye really well</li>
            <li> It also went straight after washing.</li>
            <li> fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I got my whole head weaved and didn&#x27;t even use the whole pack</li>
            <li> Absolutly love it so far and will be definitely ordering it again soon.!!</li>
            <li> You also have to care for it more than you would care for the expensive kind.</li>
            <li> The first few days i had it there was minimum shedding, but now there is more..</li>
            <li> I also purchased a lace closure which caused me to have a full bundle plus a piece left out of the 5.</li>
            <li> was concerned about it not being enough for a full head but it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> First of all let me start by saying that i’m a professional hair stylist.....</li>
            <li> Yes its enough for a full head</li>
            <li> When i wash it and braid it, there is a pretty wave pattern, but i cant wear it all day because the ends on the 20&#x27;&#x27; and 22&#x27;&#x27; are super DRY and frizzy.</li>
            <li> other than that ii absolutely love thiis haiir.. ii have no shreds and iits very soft and gourgeous ..</li>
            <li> It is very silky, &amp; I believe it to be virgin hair because there are occasional Rare gray hairs running through it.</li>
            <li> Ill upload a pic when im done thanks im A happy customer</li>
            <li> Hair came a day earlier than expected which was a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> The hair was very pretty when I initially pulled it out of it&#x27;s packaging.</li>
            <li> The hair is very soft and silky!</li>
            <li> bc its not thick hair,</li>
            <li> So far it hasn&#x27;t she much.</li>
            <li> I will be doing an overall review on this as to whether or not this purchase was worth it.</li>
            <li> So glad my money didn&#x27;t go to waste.</li>
            <li> They start out nice and thick and then they just peter out to nothing</li>
            <li> They think it makes it look more natural and less bulky.</li>
            <li> and it waved right back</li>
            <li> for  a short term due, it doesn&#x27;t not appear to be suitable for any re-install.</li>
            <li> but i can live with it.</li>
            <li> However, It is way darker than natural color!</li>
            <li> it was really pretty, even though my stylist wasnt a big fan of it.</li>
            <li> even my hair dresser said the quality feels nice this 5 bundles does the whole entire hair plus I had a little extra</li>
            <li> Only about 30 percent of the hairs in there are going to actually be the full length you ordered.</li>
            <li> , my only downside is that I&#x27;m sceptical that it is enough to do a full head</li>
            <li> hair is absolutely stunning , it does shed a little but its only 100 bucks ..</li>
            <li> Came much later than the expected delivery date but overall the hair is great a little shedding but no tangles</li>
            <li> Not enough to notice unless you&#x27;re really looking for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The hair also had a loud processed smell ...</li>
            <li> Comes back really well with the correct conditioner.</li>
            <li> It came early that planned.</li>
            <li> Hair is soft to the touch I sewed with a machine</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft, but i&#x27;m already seeing shedding and tangling on day two</li>
            <li> but after a week or two it wasnt as soft and manageable as i wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft.</li>
            <li> The hair is soft and has not tangled..</li>
            <li> Wow , this hair is with it .</li>
            <li> and it meets my expectations so far .</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really soft.</li>
            <li> Either go to the hair store and get it for cheaper, or spend a few extra dollars and get something of better quality.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These hair extensions are extremely thick at the top.</li>
            <li> Nice and wavy...but really thin.</li>
            <li> Hair is thick at top but thinner towards the bottom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d recommend it cuz it&#x27;s good hair, but again it&#x27;s thin and too silky !</li>
            <li> So they can actually feel pretty bulky because the bottoms are so thin you will want to use more tracks to get the look you want of length and fullness.</li>
            <li> There are better grades of hair at much higher prices, don&#x27;t get me wrong,  </li>
            <li> Shedding is minimal, hair is full and bounces well, overall...........</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really rough with my hair styles thick wefts nice texture.</li>
            <li> The first picture is when I first installed it and the second picture is the same installment a month and a half later.</li>
            <li> Shedding is expected and not too much shedding i must say.</li>
            <li> Personally I prefer double drawn hair extensions where all the hair is one length, and the hair extension is just as thick at the bottom as it is at the top.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re shiny, very natural looking, and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My inky negative comment is that I wish the natural color was more off black (1B)</li>
            <li> If they used all of those long hairs in one set of extensions it wouldn&#x27;t be ableto make it go so far.</li>
            <li> The tracks are thick amd full.</li>
            <li> Really thin and tangles easily</li>
            <li> Only about 50 percent of the length of this hair extension is super thick, and then it gradually gets thinner and thinner and thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nice little shedding  but found it was thin to the end</li>
            <li> i have seen good and bad reviews</li>
            <li> Hair was very soft no shedding, only down side was longer lengths are very thin and you may want to order more hair If you like a fuller hair do.</li>
            <li> I installed the hair the following day and it was beauiful and very long to have only been 22&#x27;.</li>
            <li> so I tried to add anti frizz and heat protectant when I flat ironed it</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this hair for my birthday however I didnt get to wear it that long bc of the quality of hair.</li>
            <li> Although it did curl with the flat iron (not the curling iron or wand)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bleached and colored the hair, and flat iron</li>
            <li> I also have flat ironed it and rod set it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the belleza flat iron ($40)that I purchase off amazon as we&#x27;ll and</li>
            <li> If taken care of then it can be stretched to last.</li>
            <li> You can dye the hair and flat iron it</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going to try to wear it as long as possible without washing.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s full, but the ends are too thin.</li>
            <li> Got this hair a year ago today and it last a very long time considering</li>
            <li> Sheds wayyyyy too much and the hair is absolutely wayyyy too thin!</li>
            <li> So if you purchase hair extensions that are 26 inches long realize that the majority of the hair in that extension is only going to be 22 inches long.</li>
            <li> I wore it natural (no heat or products) for a few days only brushing it.</li>
            <li> the bondles are SUPER THIN...</li>
            <li> It only has body for the first few weeks then its stiff as a board.</li>
            <li> so I haven&#x27;t had it long.</li>
            <li> but I only have a partial sew in</li>
            <li> Initially I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be enough hair for a full sew in</li>
            <li> I have only had mim shedding but other</li>
            <li> they not seem overly dry like some extensions can be.</li>
            <li> /&gt;THE BAD;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are single drawn hair extensions.</li>
            <li> All single drawn hair extensions have this issue to one degree or another.</li>
            <li> Single drawn hair extensions save the manufacture money.</li>
            <li> It was a complete waste of time as I waited 7 days after picking 3-5 business days for shipping!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a complete waste!</li>
            <li> I recently dyed it black and bleach it</li>
            <li> but I cut my hair earlier this year due to breakage and one side was healthier than the other</li>
            <li> I would only recommend it if you want something just for a month and a half.</li>
            <li> or it will become a big nappy mess.</li>
            <li> I washed, dried on low, add a little shine spray for all hair textures &amp; then used flexi rods to get the wave back.</li>
            <li> the last few inches.</li>
            <li> and I see minimal shedding.</li>
            <li> The hair does not really hold a curl and is hair store quality.</li>
            <li> I repea do not buy no real hair</li>
            <li> I expected it</li>
            <li> I ordered it 2 day shipping, And It arrived on time as expected.</li>
            <li> It had minimal shedding</li>
            <li> my 14 in bundle feels frizzy and very dry at the ends and none of the other bundles do.</li>
            <li> Do not buy this hair after a week of having it in my head it wuz a mess it definitely was not worth the pricethe hair</li>
            <li> I easily brushed out the few small tangle and was amazed that through Dying, bleaching and multiple washing the hair</li>
            <li> Idk what the other people are talking about yet</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure what they are selling now the hair I bought recently</li>
            <li> One mix lengths can&#x27;t even do the back of a person&#x27;s small head.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s been squeezed due to packaging.</li>
            <li> But I let air dry an the hair turned poofy and has no curl pattern at ALL!!!</li>
            <li> Hair is softbut my 14\\&quot; bundle is a little rough...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s looks fake but feel real...  </li>
            <li> it is thin as hell she ordered natural color</li>
            <li> I took it down today and finger combed it.</li>
            <li> Another down side is the wavy didn&#x27;t stay</li>
            <li> I call people to track my hair down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all the way down to my bottom.</li>
            <li> very minimal shedding!</li>
            <li> I am an avid Brazillian Hair weave buyer and this is by far the worst I want my money back!!!!!!</li>
            <li> It is the blackest black.  </li>
            <li> the weave was packaged poorly, previously weaves I&#x27;ve purchased have nets to separate them and help them stay less frizzy and 2)</li>
            <li> jet black</li>
            <li> i was on a tight budget</li>
            <li> I mean it sheds but all hair does after a while as long as you take care of it</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical at first when purchasing this hair based on the negative reviews it got.</li>
            <li> Minimum tangling (hair will tangle a little)</li>
            <li> Just put a little heat to it and go.</li>
            <li> it will destroy it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update to let you know how the hair does in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Packaging was a little weird, all 5 bundles came in the same package Which had me a little nervous.</li>
            <li> This way they can take the longer hairs and put them in with the shorter, less expensive, easier to find hair and to make it technically qualify for being whatever length they have listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It tangles and sheds like crazy, making the hair look super thin.</li>
            <li> Very little sheding.</li>
            <li> have had very little tangling and shedding and it holds</li>
            <li> /&gt;hair went very little besides</li>
            <li> but they are very little</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews</li>
            <li> If your head is small you might need about four in this unit...  </li>
            <li> Hair is terrible it gets tangle everyday doesn&#x27;t take dye very dry doesn&#x27;t really hold curls will never buy again waste of money</li>
            <li> very thin overall.</li>
            <li> These hair extensions were particular bad about it.</li>
            <li> It was two different colors not what I expected it shed and tangled really bad</li>
            <li> From the time received this sorry excuse for bondles</li>
            <li> it cutting the hair will definitely be buying again</li>
            <li> that was a plus for me the hair is thick</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it in for just a few days and have not experienced any serious shedding.</li>
            <li> I mean everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately it is very difficult to find double drawn hair extensions unless you have them custom made or buy synthetic.</li>
            <li> I also noticed that the bundles were very small as well.</li>
            <li> Very very small bundles.</li>
            <li> ill never wear any other extentions except this brand!</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed in my purchase people please be careful when you&#x27;re purchasing this hair because it is not worth it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a major disappointment!</li>
            <li> olive oil gloss polisher ($5)they helped with the up keep of my hair , the only bad thing I could say is that the hair sheds</li>
            <li> Not good whenever you dye it.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Received the hair and it was nice and silky. However, It is way darker than natural color! It is the blackest black.  This hair is NOT made to be colored and NOT made to curl. Disappointing quality. Called amazon right away and they sent me shipping label. Going back for sure.</li>
            <li> OMG 😍 I love this hair. Had it installed for 3-4 months. It&#x27;s soft , beautiful, easy to curl.</li>
            <li> This is a mixed review. Yes this is genuine Brazilian human hair. It is very silky, &amp; I believe it to be virgin hair because there are occasional Rare gray hairs running through it. Not enough to notice unless you&#x27;re really looking for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the lowdown on the good and the bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are indeed genuine Brazilian human hair extensions. They are silky, they do not tangle, and they don&#x27;t smell funny. The ends do not get unduly Frizzy. they not seem overly dry like some extensions can be. They have stayed shiny and lustrous looking after 20 washes. They&#x27;re shiny, very natural looking, and long lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;these are single drawn hair extensions. That means not all of the hairs are the same length. So if you purchase hair extensions that are 26 inches long realize that the majority of the hair in that extension is only going to be 22 inches long. Only about 30 percent of the hairs in there are going to actually be the full length you ordered. That is not something unique to this particular item. All single drawn hair extensions have this issue to one degree or another. They start out nice and thick and then they just peter out to nothing the last few inches. These hair extensions were particular bad about it. now some people like that. They think it makes it look more natural and less bulky. Personally I prefer double drawn hair extensions where all the hair is one length, and the hair extension is just as thick at the bottom as it is at the top. Unfortunately it is very difficult to find double drawn hair extensions unless you have them custom made or buy synthetic. Single drawn hair extensions save the manufacture money. They are able to put only a certain percent of the longest hairs in them, with the rest of the hair is shorter, yet they can charge you more for them because you&#x27;re asking for that long length. If they used all of those long hairs in one set of extensions it wouldn&#x27;t be ableto make it go so far. This way they can take the longer hairs and put them in with the shorter, less expensive, easier to find hair and to make it technically qualify for being whatever length they have listed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These hair extensions are extremely thick at the top. So they can actually feel pretty bulky because the bottoms are so thin you will want to use more tracks to get the look you want of length and fullness. Only about 50 percent of the length of this hair extension is super thick, and then it gradually gets thinner and thinner and thinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another con is that The Wave washes right out. After a couple of washing this hair is straight.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m enjoying my hair no shedding no worries thanks much</li>
            <li> Love the hair but I get two 16,18,20,22 there was no 14 in it..</li>
            <li> So far so good. It&#x27;s really nice hair you need to use all five bundles for a full hair style. It dyed and washed well. I only had it in for a week but I had it pulled back for wrk all week. I took it down today and finger combed it. It looks great, curls are  still there from when my stylist curled it last Saturday.</li>
            <li> Really thin and tangles easily</li>
            <li> So are these tracks or extinctions?</li>
            <li> Minimum shedding and tangling, good hair, last a while.</li>
            <li> Not good whenever you dye it.</li>
            <li> I bought this this hair on the 8th i believe and i&#x27;m still waiting on it. I will be doing an overall review on this as to whether or not this purchase was worth it. But, gotta admit that i&#x27;m nervous!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay so i got the hair (oct16) and i can honestly say it&#x27;s legit, real virgin hair! So glad my money didn&#x27;t go to waste. It does have grays but that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s real. I will be ordering again. Hair is softbut my 14\\&quot; bundle is a little rough... Minimum shedding.. (hair will shed people). Minimum tangling (hair will tangle a little) but over all i&#x27;m happy. Total steal. I will install sometime next month.</li>
            <li> The hair was very pretty when I initially pulled it out of it&#x27;s packaging. ..The hair also had a loud processed smell ...once I installed it I knew it was real virgin hair...the hair tangles badly and the ends are horrible!!!! Never again!!!</li>
            <li> I love this hair...😊😊😊😃😃😃</li>
            <li> worst hair ever!!!. If you wash the hair you&#x27;ll ruin it! ANNNNDDD it&#x27;s not real human hair , most of it is synthetic. And you can buy this hair from your local beauty supply store</li>
            <li> Do not buy this hair!!!! It tangles and sheds like crazy, making the hair look super thin.</li>
            <li> Love the hair... Texture and look. This is the right place to go.</li>
            <li> Great hair came fast love it</li>
            <li> Absolutely loving this hair! It is very soft and the budndles are very full! I received all 5 bundles and they were packaged just fine! The hair doesn&#x27;t smell at all. I cant wait to install it! Package was delivered in exactly 5 days!</li>
            <li> I just got this today communication and speeduneasy of this delivery was absolutely amazing.  Two cons though 1 the weave was packaged poorly, previously weaves I&#x27;ve purchased have nets to separate them and help them stay less frizzy and 2) my 14 in bundle feels frizzy and very dry at the ends and none of the other bundles do. I have no time to purchase another bundle though so im forced to sew it in as is but ill be back with an update on if any oils and brushing helps smooth out the ends</li>
            <li> I like it yu really have to take care of it cause if not it a look crazy like mind but it always come bk</li>
            <li> When I 1st bought the hair I felt  it and it felt really good with bounce and shine but when I started to apply it it was a different story... It&#x27;s looks fake but feel real...  l had it in for 2 days and it&#x27;s tangled a lot or if you come it it gets really frizzy so I tried to add anti frizz and heat protectant when I flat ironed it then it looked stringy...  I don&#x27;t really like the hair and I won&#x27;t do the cheap hair again but it is human .... I guess</li>
            <li> Not what was described. Not</li>
            <li> For the price this hair is great.  Would buy again.  I haven&#x27;t colored or bleached, but I have washed it a couple times. Very little sheding. I also purchased a lace closure which caused me to have a full bundle plus a piece left out of the 5. Have had in for over 2wks and no problems.</li>
            <li> Delivery was really quick I loved the hair it didn&#x27;t have any smell it was very soft and true to length even when I measure it some pieces were longer than it was discribed which is great for me I didn&#x27;t install the hair yet so I can&#x27;t say anything to that extent but however when I run my hands thru the hair there is no shedding.., my only downside is that I&#x27;m sceptical that it is enough to do a full head but I&#x27;ll write another review on how that turned out! Another down side is the wavy didn&#x27;t stay but that&#x27;s not so much a downside cause I&#x27;m gonna turn it into a deeper curls with flexi rods</li>
            <li> Hair is terrible it gets tangle everyday doesn&#x27;t take dye very dry doesn&#x27;t really hold curls will never buy again waste of money</li>
            <li> It was two different colors not what I expected it shed and tangled really bad I thought that this hair was actually ok but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
            <li> I have had this hair over a month and it has done me good.The first picture is when I first installed it and the second picture is the same installment a month and a half later. I refuse to pay 300-500$ on hair and this hair does the job at an affordable price. There are better grades of hair at much higher prices, don&#x27;t get me wrong,  but it&#x27;s either hair store hair or premium hair for an affordable price</li>
            <li> This hair is not Brazilian hair it&#x27;s cheap hair you can buy at a regular hair store.</li>
            <li> So far i love the hair. Minimum shredding and definitely holds a curl. I washed and dyed it, just wished it held the color better. Besides that I will definItely buy again and recommend.</li>
            <li> This hair was if very poor quality.  It frizzed after wearing it 3 weeks.  It didn&#x27;t seem to be 100% brazillan hair.</li>
            <li> Comes back really well with the correct conditioner.</li>
            <li> I brought this hair and its been amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I wahed it and greased it and it waved right back up.&lt;br /&gt;I was concerned about it not being enough for a full head but it was!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m def going to order again! This was my first time ordering Brizilian Hair &amp; offline and I&#x27;m amazed!!&lt;br /&gt;Def a good buy!</li>
            <li> I love it last longer then I thought</li>
            <li> Bought this hair twice because one set isn&#x27;t enough for a full head do but the hair is amazing I was skeptical after some of the reviews but this hair is really great !!!!!! Love the fact that I can get so many lengths out of it to achieve that layered look sigh it cutting the hair will definitely be buying again</li>
            <li> The hair sheds too much and fuzzy. You get what you pay for. Not that quality but looked nice the first week installed</li>
            <li> I recently ordered this hair for my birthday however I didnt get to wear it that long bc of the quality of hair. I order this hair April 25, 2014 and it was here that following week on May 1, 2014 which was great considering the fact that I am stationed in Japan. Upon opening the package the hair was a nice texture and the waves were beautiful and soft. It came in a manilla enveloIe but the hair wasnt in a plastic slip like most hair you buy in the beauty supply stores. I also noticed that the bundles were very small as well. I installed the hair the following day and it was beauiful and very long to have only been 22&#x27;. I didnt have any hair left over and could have used more if I had it bc its not thick hair, its very thin. All in all I only left the hair in for a week bc I couldnt handle the shedding and tangling. I had to cut most of it because it was nappy at the end and then after getting it to an ok length I had to continuously spray oil sheen and water in it to keep the waviness. Although it did curl with the flat iron (not the curling iron or wand) it was more of a wet and wavy hair than anything. I am very unpleased with this hair and will not be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> First of all let me start by saying that i’m a professional hair stylist..... i have order this hair for one of my client like a month ago well i most say that this hair is very good, and i will recommend this hair to anyone</li>
            <li> It came early that planned. Hair is soft to the touch I sewed with a machine so I haven&#x27;t had it long. The reviews say wait a week it will suck... I&#x27;m coming back later with my opinion. I haven&#x27;t put anything in it but flex rods. The wave came out perfect and shiny ,still soft. Idk what the other people are talking about yet but for me I&#x27;m excited!</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast! Hair was very soft no shedding, only down side was longer lengths are very thin and you may want to order more hair If you like a fuller hair do.</li>
            <li> All bundles installed at the same time....very thin overall. Nice and wavy...but really thin. It&#x27;s soft, but i&#x27;m already seeing shedding and tangling on day two</li>
            <li> i love it my dauugter cant wait to use hér hair the quality is great but i hope i dont encounnter any problem after washing. i have seen good and bad reviews but i hope i dōnt have that problem.</li>
            <li> Good quality ... didn&#x27;t tangle and I have colored it twice... I would definitely buy again....</li>
            <li> I had this hair in for exactly 2 weeks... And I just had to cut this hair out.... I am very disappointed and will NEVER purchase this hair again.... Felt good at first waste of money!!</li>
            <li> This hair was beautiful I absolutely love it I have tried 4 different brands on Amazon and this has been the BEST.</li>
            <li> the hair  not good quality it is no good</li>
            <li> It was nice when I first got it but after a week or two it wasnt as soft and manageable as i wanted it to be.</li>
            <li> I love this hair. I was a little skeptical at first when purchasing this hair based on the negative reviews it got. But this hair is really good. It&#x27;s soft. It doesn&#x27;t tangle or shed. I&#x27;ve bleached and colored the hair, and flat iron it bone straight and the hair is still good. Even after bleaching the hair, it still remains soft and tangle free. I say for this price the hair was worth that and more.</li>
            <li> The hair is just fabulous and it took color wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I get my hair on time i love. I bleach my hair and it looks good.i will buy again.i&#x27;m so please.</li>
            <li> I bought the hair in December and I loved it since then I have colored it washed it cut it into a bob and reused it twice and its still good I mean it sheds but all hair does after a while as long as you take care of it it will last</li>
            <li> I love then fact this hair is so cheap and it is still so pretty! I have got so many compliments about my hair, and the men are flocking to me like fly to sugar honey iced tea!</li>
            <li> loveeeee it! ill never wear any other extentions except this brand! im confused on the few bad reviews. I colored this hair washed and conditioned it and no tangling, full of body, very minimal shedding! I would recommend sealing your weft with weft sealer, but I do that with any brand. over all I love! I got a total of 5 bundles 22,20,16,14,12. loved it so much I ordered an additional 26 inch bundle. For these prices you can beat it! they definitely have a customer for life:)</li>
            <li> Shipment came on time! I was so afraid about the hair because it was so affordable. But the hair is beautiful! I&#x27;ve had it in for just a few days and have not experienced any serious shedding. The hair is soft and has not tangled.. I hope it doesnt change after I wash it.... Thanks!</li>
            <li> im a cosmetologist i think the hair is a good quality as long as you take good care of it .its best too keep it moisturized .i have had very little tangling and shedding and it holds a curl good.i would consider ordering again in the futue</li>
            <li> This hair is bomb !!! I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve had this hair in now for a month and have even dyed it twice. I also have flat ironed it and rod set it. And its amazing!!!! I have gotten so many compliments on my hair. I used every bundle but yet still had some left. This hair is affordable and awesome. Will definitely be buying it again</li>
            <li> Sheds wayyyyy too much and the hair is absolutely wayyyy too thin!</li>
            <li> Wow , this hair is with it . I read all the bad reviews befor I bought it and was kinda skeptical about the hair but I&#x27;ve had it in for about 3-4 weeks and it&#x27;s amazing .. I&#x27;ve been using the belleza flat iron ($40)that I purchase off amazon as we&#x27;ll and olive oil gloss polisher ($5)they helped with the up keep of my hair , the only bad thing I could say is that the hair sheds but I mean honestly all hair does some shedding ..it&#x27;s a great bargin</li>
            <li> Honestly speaking the first week the hair was fleek, after that I experienced so much shedding that I began to regret why i wasted my money.  In all honesty I should  have known because if something is cheap it will be just that....cheap.</li>
            <li> First off i Ordered The Hair on The 12th &amp;&amp; got it on the 16th! Fast shipping ! The hair did have shedding but what hair doesnt? One thing It need to have more hair in the bundles. Other than that its great hair i dyed it also same day</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this hair. I thought that the lengths were a bit off. I will be honest i was on a tight budget and so i had to go cheap with my hair this time around but i do not regret investing in this hair. It works wonderfully for cheaper brazilian hair. If taken care of then it can be stretched to last. Shedding is expected and not too much shedding i must say. Color was beautiful. Wand curled great and straightened great a well.</li>
            <li> Bad bad bad, not buy anything, it leaves little hair, everything is bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hair went very little besides that is not good</li>
            <li> Ok so I order hair over nite shipping for wedding I never receive my hair I call people to track my hair down and they said FedEx left my hair and movie at a garage and I don&#x27;t own a garage they left it at someone house</li>
            <li> The hair is amazing, super soft, I am so happy that I could get so many bundles of great hair, for this cheap</li>
            <li> Very very small bundles. I had to use four bundles to get a full weave. The wave was gone after I brushed it and it began to tangle after about a week. I will definitely never purchase this hair again.</li>
            <li> I wanted to give this hair 0 stars but then I wouldnt be able to write what I have to say, I still haven&#x27;t recieve my order but I saw the one my friend ordered and it is trash it is thin as hell she ordered natural color and it came jet black im not even sure if this hair is brazillian because it feels and look like mix hair and im still wondering where the hell my package is I am very disappointed</li>
            <li> Delivered on time , hair is good quality so far ! I&#x27;ve dyed it and put it in already . It was shedding a lot and tangling but as the days went by it got better 😊  I had Brazilian hair prior to this delivery and it meets my expectations so far . No complaints</li>
            <li> This hair was 109 I guess since some are buying it the seller wanted to bump up the price. I was going to buy more today but the price is way to hair now... this hair can be bleached and dyed it doea shead but what hair doesn&#x27;t other then that its good just not at that price that it is now... he can keep this hair I rather go get braids.</li>
            <li> I ordered my hair two days ago (feb 27) paid for 2 day shipping and got it today (march 1 ) right on time so that was definitely a plus! I&#x27;ve never had Brazilian before so I wasn&#x27;t sure how the hair was supposed to be but I can say it is very nice hair and I can&#x27;t to install it!! I&#x27;m so excited I recommend buying some!</li>
            <li> The hair is nice with the amount of bundles, but when I washed it the wave pretty much left. Other than that it&#x27;s still nice hair</li>
            <li> AT FIRST I WAS THINKING TWICE ABOUT BUYING THE HAIR BUT I SEEN HOW IT LOOKED WHEN MY BESTFRIEND BOUGHT IT SO I DECIDED TO ORDERED IT. I DID A 2 DAY SHIPMENT  AND IT WAS HERE THE TIME THEY SAID IT WOULD.. I HAVE IT IN MY HEAD NOW AND I LOVE IT... I WILL BE ORDERING IT AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> It was ok it got nappy after a couple of days</li>
            <li> love love love this hair!</li>
            <li> I like it very much it came on time it has a lot of grey but that makes it better for colouring I will buy it again</li>
            <li> it is great hair to use it&#x27;s my first time trying it and I love it I&#x27;m coming back for sho</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the hair ready to order more</li>
            <li> I love this hair . I got in within in 2 days as promised. Was very soft and beautiful. My inky negative comment is that I wish the natural color was more off black (1B) I received a brownish color maybe like a color 2 or 4 I&#x27;m not for sure. It Blended perfect with my natural hair. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;1 so the bundles length I got is kind of too long. It&#x27;s all the way down to my bottom. But this is a great price for good hair.</li>
            <li> i absolutely loved thiis haiir.. ii ordered last saturdayy, march 1, 2014 annd reciieved my package on tuesday, march 5, 2014. i rated 4 stars becasue my hair diidnt arriive on  the estiimated tiime.. other than that ii absolutely love thiis haiir.. ii have no shreds and iits very soft and gourgeous .. ii havent washed iit yet nor have ii iinstalled iit yet.. the haiir does have a oder .. iim sure iit wiill eventually leave after washiing iit though.. ii love iit ! ii wiill be orderiing agaiin. ii recommend thii shaiir to anyone lookiing for cheap 100% brazillian hunman haiir ..</li>
            <li> this hair is awful and so thin I am so disappointed in my purchase people please be careful when you&#x27;re purchasing this hair because it is not worth it not even a thank you very much</li>
            <li> I added the next day shipping got it the next day and had it installed the same day. The tracks are thick amd full. I wore it natural (no heat or products) for a few days only brushing it. I recently dyed it black and bleach it a pretty copper. Processing it was very easy. Does tangle when washing but what hair doesn&#x27;t if you give it a good wash. I easily brushed out the few small tangle and was amazed that through Dying, bleaching and multiple washing the hair DIDN&#x27;T SHED. VERY PLEASED</li>
            <li> Worst hair ever!! Does not stay straight. It only has body for the first few weeks then its stiff as a board. I dont recommend you wasting your money on this product.</li>
            <li> I absolutely HATE this hair and want my money back...I&#x27;ve had the hair in for 2 days and it keeps tangling and is horrible. I am an avid Brazillian Hair weave buyer and this is by far the worst I want my money back!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The hair is okay, not terrible but not amazing either. Ive had the hair for 3 weeks and have had it installed for 2 weeks. when i got the hair it was really pretty, even though my stylist wasnt a big fan of it. The first few days i had it there was minimum shedding, but now there is more.. not as much as beauty supply hair. It didnt tangle at first but now I have to comb it our or run my fingers through it every couple of hours or it will become a big nappy mess. It lost its wave pattern at night. When i wash it and braid it, there is a pretty wave pattern, but i cant wear it all day because the ends on the 20&#x27;&#x27; and 22&#x27;&#x27; are super DRY and frizzy. When i curl it, it looks good, but the curls do not stay long......Basically you get what u pay for.</li>
            <li> Hey its me again giving an update like I promised. I also enclosed a updated picture. In regards to the people who say the hair sheds and washing it will ruin it. I&#x27;m not a certified hairologist but I do believe the hair is virgin Brazilian I&#x27;ve had the hair sewed in for about a month now. I&#x27;ve dye, bleached, roller set, curled, and washed the hair on several occasions and I see minimal shedding. However I have noticed that this hair does better without any styling gels or aerosols. Just put a little heat to it and go. Or roller set it for some of those Basketball Wives curls. Lol. This hair is the best bang for your buck. I suggest keeping it curled for the best look.</li>
            <li> I like the hair a lot think you</li>
            <li> Hello i just got my hair im bout get in sewed in and diE it the bundles could have been more thicker. But its some great hair you guys need to have 18,20,22,24,26 available. But. Ill upload a pic when im done thanks im A happy customer</li>
            <li> not the best. did too much of shedding.</li>
            <li> The hair does not really hold a curl and is hair store quality. While it is o.k. for  a short term due, it doesn&#x27;t not appear to be suitable for any re-install. Either go to the hair store and get it for cheaper, or spend a few extra dollars and get something of better quality.</li>
            <li> awesome hair. i love it.</li>
            <li> First off the hair came in a couple of days. I do not wear weave often but I cut my hair earlier this year due to breakage and one side was healthier than the other so I would get a couple pieces sewn in to make the hair fuller. I have used human hair from the hair store that would tangle at the nape of my neck and look like a birds nest. This hair does not do that. I wanted to do more protective styles now that my hair is back in a healthy state and decided to invest a bit more money in the hair I was buying as I wanted a partial weave install. Of course the price is a bit low for what you are getting but the hair is great! The color matched my hair perfect as my hair is naturally light, it blends great. I went to the gym right after it was installed( I box) with it in a ponytail, and with an hour of sparring, sweating, and push ups etc the hair never tangled. It feels soft, smells like all hair from hair stores and the shedding is normal, the wave isn&#x27;t that great but I&#x27;m sure you can make it come back. With a little bit of hair spray and good care this hair will be worn for months. I will be buying this hair again!!!</li>
            <li> Got this hair a year ago today and it last a very long time considering I&#x27;m really rough with my hair styles thick wefts nice texture. I have a really huge head and this was more than enough hair definitely worth buying... I&#x27;m actually ordering again</li>
            <li> Came much later than the expected delivery date but overall the hair is great a little shedding but no tangles</li>
            <li> This hair is ok not the greatest Brazilian hair but it&#x27;s wearable . This hair sheds a lot!!! N it also gets tangled often. N it&#x27;s also very thin at the end.. Will I buy it again ? Definitely not !</li>
            <li> The worst  hair ever its really thin and</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews but i had to about this horrible hair. This is the worst hair ever. I bought hair from this company before and it was good, actually or was the same type of hair I repurchased but I&#x27;m not sure what they are selling now the hair I bought recently was crap.  It was thin no body,  felt like human mixed with synthetic. It shed everywhere, and when I say everywhere I mean everywhere.  When you comb it it shed,  when you didn&#x27;t con it it shed.  And it tangled up like crazy. This is not as advertised. .... what a rip off!!</li>
            <li> My order came very quick!!! I order it Saturday and it was at my door step Monday! The hair is very soft and silky! I haven&#x27;t had it put in yet, I will update when I do, but so far so good!</li>
            <li> This is some nasty hair do not buy I repea do not buy no real hair is this cheap anyway</li>
            <li> So I just got my hair today and I was very anxious to see the quality because of the bad reviews I seen from other people ........ well this hair was beautiful !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes you can dye it !&lt;br /&gt;Yes it&#x27;s REAL virgin hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already started the process of dying my hair and it turned out amazing will be posting photos later so you guys can see. Only problem is that you get 5 bundles but they are very little so you have to use all five. Other than that its very good her &amp; I am satisfied with my purchase so far. will update in about a month or so ..</li>
            <li> I love it. I&#x27;m getting ready to install the hair. I would refer people to purchase this hair. Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love it....  You can dye the hair and flat iron it it is real human hair trust me it&#x27;s a must have will order again.</li>
            <li> The end of this hair is very thin..... cheap hair I expected it but it could be worst. I&#x27;m happy with it</li>
            <li> The shedding is to much . Besides that the hair was okay next Time I&#x27;ll seal my wefts I&#x27;m gonna give it another shot</li>
            <li> My wife is so happy with me and this only adds more love to our relationship.</li>
            <li> These are so great. Quality is awesome.</li>
            <li> From the time received this sorry excuse for bondles I was already disappointed.... Sighss its nothing like in the pic the bondles are SUPER THIN... One mix lengths can&#x27;t even do the back of a person&#x27;s small head. If your head is small you might need about four in this unit...  Ughhh soooooooo pissed</li>
            <li> First to begin when I felt the texture it was very nice even my hair dresser said the quality feels nice this 5 bundles does the whole entire hair plus I had a little extra that was a plus for me the hair is thick n nice little shedding  but found it was thin to the end I now installed it we will see how it goes but ppl this is human hair u have to treat it as your own Cuz the weave Breaks so  can&#x27;t put any kind of sheens it will destroy it argon oil is to use for these types of hair don&#x27;t believe everything u read on here try it yourself</li>
            <li> Worst everrrr. This doesn&#x27;t deserve a full star</li>
            <li> I bought this hair about 2 weeks ago. I ordered it 2 day shipping, And It arrived on time as expected. Packaging was a little weird, all 5 bundles came in the same package Which had me a little nervous. But once fingered combed the hair gained lots of body and thickness. The length is perfect and true.! It holds a great curl. Have not washed it yet, since I&#x27;ve seen many reviews saying it will ruin the hair. So I&#x27;m going to try to wear it as long as possible without washing. One good tip, is to order you some argon morrocon oil to go with your hair. Brings the hair life if you have no time to fool with it. Absolutly love it so far and will be definitely ordering it again soon.!!</li>
            <li> Hair came a day earlier than expected which was a nice surprise. Initially I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t be enough hair for a full sew in but it was more than enough to work with. It had minimal shedding but it did smell kinda weird but a good wash took care of that.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mines installed about 3mths now. Yes its enough for a full head but I only have a partial sew in so there is hair left over. I would only recommend it if you want something just for a month and a half. The hair sheds way too much and tangles. The longest length now looks like a 16inch do to so much shedding. You also have to care for it more than you would care for the expensive kind. Weekly washing is a must, air drying does not help. I washed, dried on low, add a little shine spray for all hair textures &amp; then used flexi rods to get the wave back. Air drying makes it brittle, rough, and causes more tangles.</li>
            <li> I really love this hair. I have bought Brazilian hair for a lot more than I paid for this and they did not wear as good as these, that is why I gave a 5 stars. For the price I pay for this hair, it is well worth the money. This is maybe my 3rd time buying this hair, all my friends are asking me to purchase this for them. Shedding is minimal, hair is full and bounces well, overall........... I love the price and the quality!</li>
            <li> havent installed yet but the hair is really soft and the texture is great for the price</li>
            <li> Hair just came in today! I co washed with just conditioner, a really expensive one at that! (30)! The hair didn&#x27;t shed that much, maybe 10 strands out of 3 bundles. But I let air dry an the hair turned poofy and has no curl pattern at ALL!!! It was a complete waste of time as I waited 7 days after picking 3-5 business days for shipping! This was the worst hair I have ever purchased! My college classes start on Monday and I can&#x27;t use this hair! It&#x27;s a major disappointment! Should have went to the beauty supply store I would have had my hair faster and knew exactly what I was getting! Won&#x27;t order again! It&#x27;s a complete waste!</li>
            <li> Small bundles but the length was great. Not used yet so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s been squeezed due to packaging. It&#x27;s great fr the price. Can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
            <li> Just got hair today. It&#x27;s really soft. I did dye it and it took the dye really well which means the hair is virgin. I&#x27;ll update to let you know how the hair does in a few weeks. So far it hasn&#x27;t she much. It also went straight after washing. The 20&amp;#34; goes to my butt. Hair is thick at top but thinner towards the bottom.</li>
            <li> This is after a month of having this hair in it has be washed and a bang added and re curled I love it I have only had mim shedding but other than that it is worth the price</li>
            <li> hair is absolutely stunning , it does shed a little but its only 100 bucks .. what more could you expect!! real beautiful hair . had installed for 3 months .</li>
            <li> Well....let&#x27;s see...first off the hair is beautiful, it really is. Even after I got it sewed it, I still loved it BUT it&#x27;s too thin for my liking. It&#x27;s full, but the ends are too thin. It&#x27;s not the greatest Brazilian hair but it doesn&#x27;t tangle up or shed much. And another thing, it curls really good, but doesn&#x27;t take flat ironing too well. I&#x27;d recommend it cuz it&#x27;s good hair, but again it&#x27;s thin and too silky !</li>
            <li> Do not buy this hair after a week of having it in my head it wuz a mess it definitely was not worth the pricethe hair was it should have been like $20 smh</li>
            <li> It Was Good For Like 2weeks then it started to get tangled a lot.. I&#x27;m so used to expensive hair I would never get this hair again..</li>
            <li> fast shipping. it took like 3 days and i love it. some shedding but i can live with it. will install it soon an come back with an update</li>
            <li> I love my hair I will be buy again, they just need more hair in the bonding but prada Is good</li>
            <li> This is the best hair.....got it put in one day two days later I was put in the hospital I couldn&#x27;t even take care of it for 4 days but it still stayed looking good with any tingles. I got my whole head weaved and didn&#x27;t even use the whole pack</li>
            <li> Very satisfied! The quality was very good. Thickness just right. I am very pleased!!!</li>
