    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>price is excellent</li>
            <li>This stuff is incredible!</li>
            <li>Its the perfect product!!</li>
            <li>It is an excellent blend, it could not be any easier, or a cleaner way to dispense it too.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used!  </li>
            <li>, again I just have to say that this stuff is incredible.</li>
            <li>you sample the colors in the store with a tester; ideally, try some on your chin and not just your hand.  </li>
            <li>This is a great product.  </li>
            <li>LOL</li>
            <li>I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Very nice for travel as well.</li>
            <li>I found the coverage to be good and didn&#x27;t find it greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Good</li>
            <li>(Yes, I SAVED the tear-out card that it was on, so that I could get it if it looked good).</li>
            <li>This is a superior product.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased that I got it.</li>
            <li>It just looks like my own skin, but better!</li>
            <li>I tried the one of the 3 colors that seemed it matched my fair skin the most.</li>
            <li>That is what is so great about this foundation; it gives me a natural looking, beautiful, ethereal glow.</li>
            <li>This classic ivory is the perfect one for me.</li>
            <li>It gives natural and flawless coverage.</li>
            <li>I find Almay Clear Complexion liquid foundation is the best one I&#x27;ve tried...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very light skinned with freckles.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how this got a 4 star rating, yes it is very smooth, very light and blendable</li>
            <li>Well, that&#x27;s because you need to ADD MORE.</li>
            <li>Well, I&#x27;d have to recommend using a top quality primer beforehand.</li>
            <li>I honestly love it and want to be buried with it when I die.</li>
            <li>I love that it takes away any shine I have.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite.</li>
            <li>I like this a lot better than liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>If you have oily skin you will be better off using Mary Kay Timewise Matte liquid foundation.</li>
            <li>WooHoo, it was actually available!</li>
            <li>It is fast which is great if you&#x27;re in a hurry, as I always seem to be.</li>
            <li>GREAT foundation - bought 2 and very well satisfied..</li>
            <li>will just make it crease even more</li>
            <li>sure</li>
            <li>feels very clean going on and isn&#x27;t chalky.  </li>
            <li>Still, I love how easy it is to apply and don&#x27;t feel the need to reapply during the day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m into the natural look, so I choose products that make me look great without looking like some tacky porn star or something.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s more light than it is medium coverage, building it up</li>
            <li>And the good news is, no matter how much I smeared on, I didn&#x27;t look made-up.</li>
            <li>I pretty much love this!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and stays on until I wash my face.</li>
            <li>But it ran out very quickly.</li>
            <li>Sat on the surface and looked cakey, sat in my fine lines accentuating them.  </li>
            <li>After using Max Factor pan stick for years, it was no longer available in my area.</li>
            <li>It just melted into my skin and felt so light, like marshmallows &amp; velvet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and blends</li>
            <li>I liked it so much that I looked for it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I just tried Fit</li>
            <li>Me Shine Free today (</li>
            <li>Me Shine Free</li>
            <li>I will admit I bought a too light color and that might have been the problem.  </li>
            <li>I recommend this for just lightly beating your mug.</li>
            <li>I received a sample of this and fell in love with it right away.  </li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s overpriced for the amount of product you get, I say stick with liquid foundations, same price, more coverage, more product!</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I had to do, as the colors look very different on your skin than in the tube (which is probably true for a lot of makeup but seemed especially true for this one).  </li>
            <li>While I am writing this review, I&#x27;d like to share my other HG products (because I have great taste</li>
            <li>Panstick was great for coverage (although very obvious looking), but very oily.</li>
            <li>I applied this last night, didn&#x27;t wash my face before bed (on purpose), and I still look pretty d@mn good this morning.</li>
            <li>It is an EXACT match!</li>
            <li>Success.</li>
            <li>It just goes directly onto clean, lightly moisturized skin.</li>
            <li>I like the color I got; it is the right shade and gives some \\&quot;illumination\\&quot; to my skin tone without being at all shiny.</li>
            <li>I personally feel that it is MUCH BETTER than that product.</li>
            <li>It works pretty well at oil control.</li>
            <li>plan to rder more in the future thank you!</li>
            <li>A little light but love the coverage .</li>
            <li>nothing else ever has, and it even does a nice job covering dark circles.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, yet performs far better than any other foundation I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really use anything on my lips.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very convenient to use because it is a foundation-powder like texture, so</li>
            <li>Me&amp;#34; matte &amp; poreless pressed powder and highly recommend both!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on easily (much faster than a liquid)</li>
            <li>It works if you want to put on something fast for just going out for groceries or errands.  </li>
            <li>This product is better suited for normal /  dry skin.</li>
            <li>The only critique that I have is that it seems like I use up a whole stick of this too quickly.  </li>
            <li>Went out and bought the full size product the same day!  </li>
            <li>For a night out or a full day of wearing makeup, you&#x27;d either need to put on quite a lot or use a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
            <li>shade, 120 Classic Ivory, is basically my skin in a tube.</li>
            <li>; I have several bottles of foundation sitting in the bathroom closet (most of which I only used once!), and now I can gather them up and toss them into the trash bin.</li>
            <li>And, good for the gym too, since it&#x27;s in a plastic cylinder tube and, not a fragile glass bottle, like liquid foundation--which can be extremely messy if THAT breaks, and wasteful as well.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t actually measured how long it takes me to use up a whole one (mostly because I have a couple</li>
            <li>I have used both high end and drug store foundations.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s moderately pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>This stuff actually DOES help with my very large pores...</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many because I am waaaaaaay past the age where you should need oil-control</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is sheer but VERY build-able.</li>
            <li>It covers well but is not heavy looking.</li>
            <li>I thought it would be like the old Max Factor Panstick.  </li>
            <li>My sister frequently uses this product.</li>
            <li>Like I said, it&#x27;s sheer, but you can definitely build it up, without looking like a cake-face (unlike most other foundations).</li>
            <li>, I have a normal skin type not oily and not dry</li>
            <li>Very sheer and natural looking.</li>
            <li>When I rubbed it on my face, I could barely see it because it looks just like my skin!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t about to be sucked dry by the high prices charged for it</li>
            <li>The price is right too, I use this every day and have put my other foundations aside, including my too faced Naked in which I spent $30.00 on.</li>
            <li>their dirty fingers - I haven&#x27;t been able to find an unopened one in stores in months!</li>

            <li> Some others complained that it didn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So, now I&#x27;d like to address some complaints that I seen in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have oily skin (I have oil beginning an hour or less after washing my face).</li>
            <li> I wake up looking a little ruddy on my nose and cheeks and with just a few swipes of this</li>
            <li> (Dream Matte Mousse, a few years ago), but</li>
            <li> A few hours of wear and I feel like have to itch my chin.</li>
            <li> I like I bought 2 others a few weeks ago</li>
            <li> It was slightly similar but it was thin.  </li>
            <li> I had received a small, paper flyer sample of this out of a magazine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late thirties, btw.</li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it dries out my T-spot like crazy.</li>
            <li> Some complained that it had poor coverage.</li>
            <li> , it creases after 15 minutes, it creased around my mouth (smile lines) and around my nose it&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
            <li> Not great coverage.  </li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t cover then you have the wrong shade.</li>
            <li> but man it took 12 days to get to me wtf!</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is a great product.  Very sheer and natural looking.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply and stays on until I wash my face.</li>
            <li> After using Max Factor pan stick for years, it was no longer available in my area. I wasn&#x27;t about to be sucked dry by the high prices charged for it online so I decided to try Maybelline&#x27;s pan stick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is excellent and so is the product. I found the coverage to be good and didn&#x27;t find it greasy at all.</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! I bought a tube at Walmart last month, and I just got around to using it last night. Let me just say it blew my mind for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shade, 120 Classic Ivory, is basically my skin in a tube. It is an EXACT match! When I rubbed it on my face, I could barely see it because it looks just like my skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It glides on like silk, without being greasy like Max Factor Panstick (which I used before it was discontinued but it was really just too heavy for my oily skin). I don&#x27;t even know how to describe the way this feels. It just melted into my skin and felt so light, like marshmallows &amp; velvet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is sheer but VERY build-able. And the good news is, no matter how much I smeared on, I didn&#x27;t look made-up. It just looks like my own skin, but better! I looked nothing short of angelic. Yes, angelic. LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, yet performs far better than any other foundation I&#x27;ve ever used. I have WASTED so much money trying to find *The One*; I have several bottles of foundation sitting in the bathroom closet (most of which I only used once!), and now I can gather them up and toss them into the trash bin. Good riddance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, now I&#x27;d like to address some complaints that I seen in other reviews. Some complained that it had poor coverage. Well, that&#x27;s because you need to ADD MORE. Like I said, it&#x27;s sheer, but you can definitely build it up, without looking like a cake-face (unlike most other foundations). Some others complained that it didn&#x27;t last long. Well, I&#x27;d have to recommend using a top quality primer beforehand. I applied this last night, didn&#x27;t wash my face before bed (on purpose), and I still look pretty d@mn good this morning. And I didn&#x27;t even use a primer. So there&#x27;s that. : D  Then there were people who wanted it to be like Max Factor Panstick. I personally feel that it is MUCH BETTER than that product. Panstick was great for coverage (although very obvious looking), but very oily. Infact, they should have named it Greasestick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, again I just have to say that this stuff is incredible. It&#x27;s been a while since I&#x27;ve used a Maybelline foundation (Dream Matte Mousse, a few years ago), but I was already a very big fan of Line Stiletto (my HG liquid eyeliner). While I am writing this review, I&#x27;d like to share my other HG products (because I have great taste and you should listen to me): Mascara: L&#x27;Oreal Voluminous Million Lashes, Blush: NYX Rouge Cream Blush, Everyday eyeshadow: Physician&#x27;s Formula Classic Nudes. I don&#x27;t really use anything on my lips. I&#x27;m into the natural look, so I choose products that make me look great without looking like some tacky porn star or something. That is what is so great about this foundation; it gives me a natural looking, beautiful, ethereal glow. I honestly love it and want to be buried with it when I die. I&#x27;m in my late thirties, btw.</li>
            <li> If it doesn&#x27;t cover then you have the wrong shade. This classic ivory is the perfect one for me. I&#x27;m very light skinned with freckles. I wake up looking a little ruddy on my nose and cheeks and with just a few swipes of this all of the red is gone!! It also makes my skin feel like silk. Its the perfect product!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t blend in well with my skin.  Sat on the surface and looked cakey, sat in my fine lines accentuating them.  The &#x27;matte&#x27; stuff in the inside did nothing.  I think it&#x27;s suppose to be primer.  Won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> I pretty much love this! I love that it takes away any shine I have. Only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that it dries out my T-spot like crazy. A few hours of wear and I feel like have to itch my chin.</li>
            <li> I have used both high end and drug store foundations. This is my all time favorite. It covers well but is not heavy looking. It gives natural and flawless coverage. I like the consistency and the packaging of this product. Very nice for travel as well. I like this a lot better than liquid foundation. The price is right too, I use this every day and have put my other foundations aside, including my too faced Naked in which I spent $30.00 on. Give it a try I think you will like it.</li>
            <li> Product I like I bought 2 others a few weeks ago but man it took 12 days to get to me wtf!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have oily skin (I have oil beginning an hour or less after washing my face). This product is better suited for normal /  dry skin. It goes on smooth and blends well but it does not absorb oil or delay shine for any amount of time. If you have oily skin you will be better off using Mary Kay Timewise Matte liquid foundation. If anyone knows of a foundation that works wonders for oily skin I would like to hear of it. UPDATE: After running out of Mary Kay product, I tried Revlon ColorStay liquid foundation. It works pretty well at oil control. I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> I had received a small, paper flyer sample of this out of a magazine. I tried the one of the 3 colors that seemed it matched my fair skin the most. I liked it so much that I looked for it on Amazon. WooHoo, it was actually available! So, I ordered the SAME color Number the I.D. &#x27;d the sample I had used. (Yes, I SAVED the tear-out card that it was on, so that I could get it if it looked good). Success. It&#x27;s moderately pricey, but it&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s very convenient to use because it is a foundation-powder like texture, so you don;t need to go thru all the time-consuming steps of layering the two different products. It is an excellent blend, it could not be any easier, or a cleaner way to dispense it too. It just goes directly onto clean, lightly moisturized skin. It blends well too. It is fast which is great if you&#x27;re in a hurry, as I always seem to be. And, good for the gym too, since it&#x27;s in a plastic cylinder tube and, not a fragile glass bottle, like liquid foundation--which can be extremely messy if THAT breaks, and wasteful as well. This is a superior product. I am very pleased that I got it.</li>
            <li> This is the only makeup I wear.  The only critique that I have is that it seems like I use up a whole stick of this too quickly.  I haven&#x27;t actually measured how long it takes me to use up a whole one (mostly because I have a couple and they are all 1/2 used).  Still, I love how easy it is to apply and don&#x27;t feel the need to reapply during the day.  Plus, when ordering from Amazon I know that no one touched my makeup their dirty fingers - I haven&#x27;t been able to find an unopened one in stores in months!</li>
            <li> GREAT foundation - bought 2 and very well satisfied..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how this got a 4 star rating, yes it is very smooth, very light and blendable, it creases after 15 minutes, it creased around my mouth (smile lines) and around my nose it&#x27;s disgusting. it&#x27;s more light than it is medium coverage, building it up will just make it crease even more, I have a normal skin type not oily and not dry and this did not work for me, I&#x27;d still wear it if I were out of my regular foundation.not throwing it out, it&#x27;s overpriced for the amount of product you get, I say stick with liquid foundations, same price, more coverage, more product! This stick would probably work for contouring if you get a darker shade.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to a friend.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this and fell in love with it right away.  Went out and bought the full size product the same day!  I pray Maybelline never stops making this make-up... it&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used!  This stuff actually DOES help with my very large pores... nothing else ever has, and it even does a nice job covering dark circles.  I use it along with the &amp;#34;Fit Me&amp;#34; matte &amp; poreless pressed powder and highly recommend both!</li>
            <li> This product does not cover as well as I though it would.</li>
            <li> A little light but love the coverage .</li>
            <li> I just tried Fit Me Shine Free today (shade 120).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easily (much faster than a liquid) but it&#x27;s very sheer.  You won&#x27;t get the same coverage as a liquid.  (L. Moore:  I find Almay Clear Complexion liquid foundation is the best one I&#x27;ve tried...and I&#x27;ve tried many because I am waaaaaaay past the age where you should need oil-control makeup.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fit Me Shine Free feels very clean going on and isn&#x27;t chalky.  It works if you want to put on something fast for just going out for groceries or errands.  For a night out or a full day of wearing makeup, you&#x27;d either need to put on quite a lot or use a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you sample the colors in the store with a tester; ideally, try some on your chin and not just your hand.  That&#x27;s what I had to do, as the colors look very different on your skin than in the tube (which is probably true for a lot of makeup but seemed especially true for this one).  I like the color I got; it is the right shade and gives some \\&quot;illumination\\&quot; to my skin tone without being at all shiny.</li>
            <li> I thought it would be like the old Max Factor Panstick.  It was slightly similar but it was thin.  Not great coverage.  I will admit I bought a too light color and that might have been the problem.  But it ran out very quickly.</li>
            <li> My sister frequently uses this product. She loves it.</li>
            <li> plan to rder more in the future thank you!</li>
            <li> I recommend this for just lightly beating your mug.</li>
