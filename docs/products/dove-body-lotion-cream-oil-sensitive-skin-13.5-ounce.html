            <li>Best lotion, I have ever bought.</li>
            <li>Wonderful!</li>
            <li>The product is great.  </li>

            <li>This cream works great</li>
            <li>Good stuff -</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>, it had a very light scent which smells good, and it is practical to use, since it has the pump.</li>
            <li>I thought about another one of their lotions, but as I cannot stand scented stuff, and even their \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; products have a scent, so this is a kind of like it or leave it product.</li>
            <li>I love Dove products and LOVE love love their lotions</li>
            <li>I love the feel of this lotion and it is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also wonderfully creamy and clears up my dry, winter skin almost immediately.  </li>
            <li>Fragrance free?  </li>
            <li>I never did get comfortable with that greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>and this is the only dove product I have not been fully happy with the lotion leaves a clammy after feeling</li>
            <li>Product does not leave me feeling greasy and is light and absorbs well.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion it makes my hands and arms so soft and nice.</li>
            <li>Great lotion on dry skin.</li>
            <li>This lotion is very hydrating and agrees with my skin just fine!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a soft film that stays around and while not exactly annoying you know it&#x27;s there.</li>
            <li>Luckily it was wrapped in a plastic bag</li>
            <li>AS SOMEONE WITH MULTIPLE FOOD AND CHEMICAL SENSITIVITIES, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
            <li>My wife &amp; I both love the Dove - Sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>This is a light, gentle, refreshing, non-greasy lotion that I can use every day on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It eventually gets absorbed into the skin and feels dryer, but that takes a while.</li>
            <li>Right now, I have been using this lotion for my hands and just a dab will do ya&#x27;.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and is making my skin soft.</li>
            <li>I broke out in a rash the first time I used it</li>
            <li>The latter always has more oil.</li>
            <li>At first, I thought, \\&quot;Oh,</li>
            <li>Because I thought it was greasy because at first it appears greasy before you rub  it in.</li>
            <li>I use only the Dove Sensitive Skin bar soap and anti-perspirant, which I love for their true unscented features, and needed lotion.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty nice lotion, but it leaves a greasy feeling for a little longer than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a shame, really, as it works well.</li>
            <li>and this works very well for me.</li>
            <li>I will probably use the bottles on my body--I think my legs might benefit the most from this lotion--but I am not certain if I will keep trying it on my hands.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this in any store around where I live, so thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
            <li>This is my go-to lotion for right out of the shower general use.</li>
            <li>Great lotion just smell weird</li>
            <li>But this lotion goes right in and lasts for hours and can handle multiple hand washings throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
            <li>It does take a bit of time to get used to a new lotion</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am altering my star rating down from the original three to two stars.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to this lotion, because Dove is great, but unfortunately they are not well with me when it comes to their lotion, so it&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li>IT MAKES THE SKIN SOFT</li>
            <li>B00604MSPU Dove Body Lotion Cream Oil, Sensitive Skin, 13.5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I just wish the dove company would make the shampoo and conditioner for sensitive skin people.  </li>
            <li>I also have the  dove body wash for sensitive  skin.</li>
            <li>It is just what I need for my sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am also extremely sensitive to scents.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, the local stores don&#x27;t carry it, so am glad that the item is available via the internet.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most lotions--I usually end up with red dots from head to toe.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I need for dry skin in this dry Santa Fe, New Mexico, climate.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also in my late 40s and had begun to see fine lines and wrinkles on my hands.  </li>
            <li>This is the only one in the Sensitive Skin line</li>
            <li>The only soap that I can use is dove for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been an avid dove user since I was a little girl</li>
            <li>The smell is not pleasant and it seems more watery than the other Dove lotions on the market.</li>

            <li> AS SOMEONE WITH MULTIPLE FOOD AND CHEMICAL SENSITIVITIES, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  AFTER BECOMING SERIOUSLY ILL WITH CHEMICAL SENSITIVITIES LAST YEAR, I TRIED NUMEROUS PRODUCTS WITH NO LUCK BEFORE I FOUND THIS.  IT MAKES THE SKIN SOFT AND TRULY HAS NO ODOR.  I WOULD NOT HESITATE TO RECOMMEND IT.  JUST HOPE DOVE CONTINUES TO MAKE IT. [[ASIN:B00604MSPU Dove Body Lotion Cream Oil, Sensitive Skin, 13.5 Ounce]]</li>
            <li> I love the feel of this lotion and it is great for my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Fragrance free?  What a bunch of crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smells like ELMERS GLUE.  Its DISGUSTING.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only gave it another star because it does work.  It does moisturize perfectly.  But oh my GOD.  It smells RIDICULOUS.  Dove what are you doing?</li>
            <li> This lotion is terrible, it has a low absorption rate and stinks of chemicals. I broke out in a rash the first time I used it and I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin. I&#x27;d recommend finding it in a store to test before buying this giant bottle online. I have no idea what to do with mine.</li>
            <li> I use only the Dove Sensitive Skin bar soap and anti-perspirant, which I love for their true unscented features, and needed lotion. This is the only one in the Sensitive Skin line so I ordered three of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does work, I must say.  My skin feels instantly and noticeably softer almost immediately. Unfortunately, the oil in it seems to stay around, more on palms than anywhere else. It&#x27;s hard to describe the feeling because it&#x27;s not oily, per se. It&#x27;s more like a soft film that stays around and while not exactly annoying you know it&#x27;s there. I think that&#x27;s what I do not like about it. I will probably use the bottles on my body--I think my legs might benefit the most from this lotion--but I am not certain if I will keep trying it on my hands. Perhaps. It does take a bit of time to get used to a new lotion; that may be all I need but I don&#x27;t know at this point (about two weeks after the purchase, though I have not used it every day). I thought about another one of their lotions, but as I cannot stand scented stuff, and even their \\&quot;unscented\\&quot; products have a scent, so this is a kind of like it or leave it product. We&#x27;ll see. And I will report back later on how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edited (4/21/14): I ended up tossing this lotion out. I never did get comfortable with that greasy feeling. It&#x27;s a shame, really, as it works well. But what I went with was Lubriderm, and I find it to be just as softening without the oil. Part of that may be that it&#x27;s \\&quot;regular\\&quot; rather than intensive care lotion. The latter always has more oil. But I won&#x27;t try the dove again since the Lubriderm works so well for me. I am altering my star rating down from the original three to two stars.</li>
            <li> Good stuff - but not the same quality like the same brand in Germany. Obviously there is something missing in the lotion in the US. I like that it&#x27;s not greasy.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and this works very well for me. I just wish the dove company would make the shampoo and conditioner for sensitive skin people.  I also have the  dove body wash for sensitive  skin. It is easy to use and is making my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been an avid dove user since I was a little girl and this is the only dove product I have not been fully happy with the lotion leaves a clammy after feeling</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most lotions--I usually end up with red dots from head to toe. This lotion is very hydrating and agrees with my skin just fine!</li>
            <li> The product is great.  It is just what I need for my sensitive skin.  The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because they removed it from the subscribe &amp; save program.</li>
            <li> This is a light, gentle, refreshing, non-greasy lotion that I can use every day on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Great lotion on dry skin.</li>
            <li> It broke my skin. And I mean like made cuts in my cuticles and made my skin even drier. I was looking forward to this lotion, because Dove is great, but unfortunately they are not well with me when it comes to their lotion, so it&#x27;s going back.</li>
            <li> Great lotion just smell weird</li>
            <li> This is a pretty nice lotion, but it leaves a greasy feeling for a little longer than I&#x27;d like. It eventually gets absorbed into the skin and feels dryer, but that takes a while. I should&#x27;ve guessed that since it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;cream oil&amp;#34;...</li>
            <li> My wife &amp; I both love the Dove - Sensitive skin! We like it the best of Dove lotion options</li>
            <li> I have asthma. I am also extremely sensitive to scents. As such, it is often very difficult for me to find products that don&#x27;t burn my lungs, cause me to sneeze all day, or just generally irritate me enough that I rush to wash them off.  This lotion has no scent, as promised.  It&#x27;s also wonderfully creamy and clears up my dry, winter skin almost immediately.  I&#x27;m also in my late 40s and had begun to see fine lines and wrinkles on my hands.  This lotion clears those up as well.  My hands don&#x27;t look like they did when I was 20, but they definitely are back to how they looked in my 30s.</li>
            <li> I love Dove products and LOVE love love their lotions but this wasn&#x27;t great. The smell is not pleasant and it seems more watery than the other Dove lotions on the market. Additionally, when this arrived there was a small crack/hole in the bottle. Luckily it was wrapped in a plastic bag so it didn&#x27;t make a mess, but I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion it makes my hands and arms so soft and nice.</li>
            <li> Product does not leave me feeling greasy and is light and absorbs well.  It is unscented, which means there is no ADDED fragrance, but the product does have a smell, it is not necessarily a good smell but it is slight and soaks in and I can&#x27;t smell it after a minute or so. This is my go-to lotion for right out of the shower general use.</li>
            <li> Right now, I have been using this lotion for my hands and just a dab will do ya&#x27;. At first, I thought, \\&quot;Oh, no!\\&quot; Because I thought it was greasy because at first it appears greasy before you rub  it in. But this lotion goes right in and lasts for hours and can handle multiple hand washings throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;And no fragrance and no dyes. Best lotion, I have ever bought.</li>
            <li> I have developed extreme sensitivity around my eyes. The only soap that I can use is dove for sensitive skin. Until I ordered this lotion, everything I tried caused irritation. I can&#x27;t find this in any store around where I live, so thank goodness for Amazon! I love this product!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I need for dry skin in this dry Santa Fe, New Mexico, climate.  Unfortunately, the local stores don&#x27;t carry it, so am glad that the item is available via the internet.</li>
            <li> Definitely do not recommend this. The smell it exudes makes you wanna take a shower again.</li>
            <li> Wonderful! I can&#x27;t have any fragrance or my sinuses go crazy. This doesn&#x27;t even have that odd scent that fragrance free usually has to it. My skin looks great and I never feel greasy.</li>
            <li> This cream works great, it had a very light scent which smells good, and it is practical to use, since it has the pump.</li>
