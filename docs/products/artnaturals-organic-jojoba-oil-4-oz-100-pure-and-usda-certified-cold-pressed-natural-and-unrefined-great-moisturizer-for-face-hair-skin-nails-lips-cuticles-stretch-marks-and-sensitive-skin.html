            <li>Great carrier oil for essential oils.  </li>
            <li>It works as an after bath moisturizer and keeps skin smooth</li>
            <li>She also likes that it locks in moisture helping to keep the skin smooth around her eyes.</li>
            <li>I know packaging should never be considered because it seems so flippant.  </li>

            <li>I was provided this product for Free for review purposes.</li>
            <li>I got this free item for testing and review purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Jojoba is one of my favorite oils and this one is no disappointment.</li>
            <li>Great facial moisturizer for me.  </li>
            <li>I like how soft it made my ankles feel, and I loved the feeling all over</li>
            <li>So far, so good</li>
            <li>I like that this oil comes with an eye dropper top since it allows you dispense just the right amount for the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s high grade and safe for your face!</li>
            <li>This is most pure jojoba oil I have ever purchased!</li>
            <li>This is the best thing to add to your normal daily routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I have used many carrier oils before, but I think this jojoba oil is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li>This organic jojoba oil is fantastic, I did order it through a special deal to try it and share my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s especially good because the powder I was using to absorb the excess skin oils was causing too much dryness in the areas I don&#x27;t need to dry up and that could lead to wrinkles.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased it as a body oil</li>
            <li>, the consistency is nice not thick and gummy, yet thicker then water.</li>
            <li>I originally  bought this for my blackheads.</li>
            <li>You will see a significant difference in your nail&#x27;s appearance, saving you time and money from the nail salon.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The quality of the products I use on my skin is important to me, so I&#x27;m pleased that this Jojoba oil is 100% pure with no additives, is made in the USA</li>
            <li>100% pure, all organic, pest free, and so many uses -</li>
            <li>I use it to clean my face every night, and remove makeup.  </li>
            <li>I clean my face with this.</li>
            <li>bottle is HUGE and we&#x27;re going through it quickly.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and is odor free.</li>
            <li>The next morning my skin felt soft and wonderful.</li>
            <li>For now I could say that the oil is not greasy and it seems like it is moisturizing my skin good, I try to put this after taking a shower wherein I am not completely dry up.</li>
            <li>My hair is frizzy &amp; this is perfect to tame my frizz!  </li>
            <li>It keeps skin soft, smooth, and moisturized, helps keep you acne free, reduces stretch marks, keeps hair frizz free and conditions hair and scalp and MORE.</li>
            <li>This is a beautifully packaged bottle of top quality pure Jojoba Oil, the uses are endless.</li>
            <li>Price was right!</li>
            <li>I absolute love</li>
            <li>This oil is cool</li>
            <li>Mostly I used jojoba oil to take my eye makeup off and moisturize the rest of my body, but not as much on my face.</li>
            <li>Mix with some of your favorite lotion/facial moisturizer and you will feel very relieved of dryness that you may have.  </li>
            <li>Good oil, but the dropper leaks all over, and the bottle doesn&#x27;t seal properly.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and I love</li>
            <li>I will continue to purchase this oil at full price.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is good for several things.</li>
            <li>It has really improved my skin and made it more supple.</li>
            <li>It feels great on my skin and has even reduced my husbands very dry and itchy feet problem!</li>
            <li>Has a slight scent that I am unused to, but the color and texture are beautiful.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Jojoba oil is a great addition to have moisturized skin and can complement lotions and other skin</li>
            <li>Regarding the product, I didn&#x27;t notice any smell which is great if you are using it in combination with other oils.  </li>
            <li>Great oil...leaves my skin soft and smooth...absorbs quickly with no mess!</li>
            <li>It has no smell and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>I like to use this particular Organic Jojoba Oil  because there are many uses for it.</li>
            <li>so I had to apply it often, but my lips were better after one weekend versus a week of steady &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>i am pregnant and been using baby oil for my belly</li>
            <li>super oily residue&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>It leaves no residue and soaks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>This product is definitely worth trying if you want something both natural and effective for moisturizing anywhere on the body.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even great to replace your face moisturizer with because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your skin or clog your pores!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m new to jojoba oil, but I have to say I positively love it so very much!</li>
            <li>Overall this is a great high quality oil that I&#x27;ve already recommended to friends and coworkers already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Generous 4 ounce bottle of high quality Jojoba oil that makes a great lightweight moisturizer or carrier oil for essential oils.  </li>
            <li>This product had no smell and absorbed into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li>It is also good to use on your body immediately after bath, this can heal you cracked dry skin, i even tried mine</li>
            <li>Next time I&#x27;m making sure I get the jojoba oil from USA, not Israel!</li>
            <li>so I will be back for more!</li>
            <li>Thanks!!</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle arrived very well packages and was leak free.</li>
            <li>This oil is light and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li>By the time I am ready for lipstick, it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li>It feels very silky and light.</li>
            <li>I honestly noticed a difference the next day.  </li>
            <li>The product is allegedly made in Israel and seems of good quality.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products</li>
            <li>By far one of my favorite Jojoba oils I have had the pleasure to review.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s useful in treating sumburns.</li>
            <li>Jojoba is a thicker oil and while more natural to the oils produced by our bodies, its thickness can clog pores.</li>
            <li>I love that i can add it to my body wash to my skin soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom everywhere.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been a rough winter and were in need of some good quality oil.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I got this with intent to diffuse but after reading the uses I decided I would benefit much more with applying to my skin directly.</li>
            <li>He loves using this as it is an organic and all ingredients are natural which is safe to used.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li>I love this product i use it on my two year old daughter after a shower</li>
            <li>So far so good haven&#x27;t used long enough to see the benefits but fast shipping and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li>dries quickly and soaks in to skin really well!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other brands and nothing has been as good.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED their Jojoba Oil and love using (very sparingly)</li>
            <li>Has made my hair silky smooth and less static!  </li>
            <li>My skin just soaked it right up.</li>
            <li>This 4oz bottle is just the right size.  </li>
            <li>Smell is just right.</li>
            <li>Convenient dropper provides just the right amount needed.</li>
            <li>It does make my skin super soft and I am looking forward to see more results with my hair that has been falling, Jojoba is very emollient</li>
            <li>It absorbs well, leaves skin smooth and refined and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a high shine like others I have tried.</li>
            <li>Dry patches on my skin has vanished completely and i am really happy about that.</li>
            <li>It absorbed pretty quickly into my skin and now my skin feels well hydrated and much softer.  </li>
            <li>Received for reviewing purposes the health benefits of natural oils like coconut oil, argan oil have been evident for quite some time and Jojoba seems to be an oil that&#x27;s currently overtaking some of the most respectable</li>
            <li>This is a high quality jojoba oil and worth the price!</li>
            <li>I used the oil on my hair it made it soft and shinny and easy to manage .</li>
            <li>So far so good as with all skin products will have to check back if anything changes.</li>
            <li>We use essential oils daily and this is another great one that we have.</li>
            <li>Am in love with it already thinking of getting a second bottle..</li>
            <li>I will use as directed but have not decided how to use after a shower without using more oil than necessary.  </li>
            <li>Will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li>Just with the first use</li>
            <li>This is my first time purchasing jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I also love mixing it with essential oils.  </li>
            <li>Already have a second bottle on the way :)</li>
            <li>I was able to review this product at a deeply discounted product.</li>
            <li>While I could use it when shaving, it is more a moisturizer / cleanser for a female.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;re not counting usages, but it should last for some time unless it gets used in even more ways.</li>
            <li>I have light, sensitive skin that is prone to dryness.  </li>
            <li>love using this as a carrier oil with my essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>This jojoba oil is the real deal!</li>
            <li>I love essential oils and have started using them to help with skin issues that my daughter has.</li>
            <li>In just that amount of time, my lips are smoother than they have ever been and my daughter&#x27;s skin is holding moisture and is definitely looking better.</li>
            <li>First used the aloe vera gel to rid whiteheads and or acne, then included it with the jojoba and coconut oil skin product I made, and continued using to this date.</li>
            <li>When I use all of this I will most definitely be buying another bottle.</li>
            <li>is very silky!</li>
            <li>We love essential oils.</li>
            <li>Made my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>I got this item for testing and review purposes, and this is actually my first time using the jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>looking forward of buying more in the future</li>
            <li>This was my first time trying jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>I loved the feeling after my face dried.</li>
            <li>Art Naturals has a very pure undilluted jojoba oil that us 100% pure and organic.</li>
            <li>And with it being such high quality and don&#x27;t have to use as much which is even better!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great value for your money - the bottle will last a long time!</li>
            <li>Has little to no scent, which is fine for most situations.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a lot of time right now</li>
            <li>Not only is it all natural and organic, but it does so many things!</li>
            <li>this is great for those who have somewhat sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use sea salt alone because it&#x27;s too harsh on their skin.</li>
            <li>Love the control of the dripper only as much as you need.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil is one of my favorite natural moisturizers, so I was thrilled to find this company offering such a generous amount at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>the Product!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pretty large and the dropper is made sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;It is scentless,</li>
            <li>so thats great, and its not oily like other type of oils i have tried, i wont stop buying it ever, maybe i will try other marks later just to keep checking and comparing, anyways this is an amazing oil</li>
            <li>Makes everything super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>You could use it on your skin, scalp, hair, pretty much anything.</li>
            <li>So please bear in mind that this is just an initial  review and will follpw up or complete  my review after i have used it for an amount of time enough for me to attest how great this brand could be.</li>
            <li>I apply this oil on my hair, skin and cuticles once or twice a week to keep my skin moisturized and it restores moisture and strengthens my dry damage hair this oil gets absorbed into the skin and hair very quickly my skin and hair don&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love about this oil...feels great on my skin AND on my dry dry dry hair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and will definitely order more.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is certainly a good option for someone who wants to go the natural route, especially if you have skin problems when using non natural products.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this jojoba oil to anyone looking for a pure natural oil that leaves your skin feeling smooth.  </li>
            <li>Love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to mix with my essential oils and leaves my skin feeling moisturized but not oily.  </li>
            <li>Not very strong on its own, large in amount.</li>
            <li>Not unpleasant to this smell sensitive gal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a big advocate of using coconut oil for so many things, but this is my new face and neck conditioner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a very mild oily scent and once applied to the skin has a natural moisturising affect which blends in well with the skin restoring natural</li>
            <li>It does feel a little greasy to me on its own</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Jojoba Oil from Art Naturals for anyone who wants to take care of their skin!</li>
            <li>and I have got an amazing result in my skin in about few days after using this product.</li>
            <li>Not too oily at all and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li>The jojoba really doesn&#x27;t have any scent to it and</li>
            <li>It is very hydrating and absorbs into the skin.  </li>
            <li>I use this on my cuticles and really like the fast absorption of it.  </li>
            <li>The oil blends really well and is very moisturizing.</li>
            <li>and it only $6 almost $7 with free shipping</li>
            <li>I really wanted to use this oil for my feet and</li>
            <li>Delivery was really fast</li>
            <li>This oil has really helped my split ends and leaves my hair very shiny without looking oily.  </li>
            <li>and i really like this product</li>
            <li>very well&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>but they are always very greasy, unlike jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>It moisturizes very well.  </li>
            <li>The dropper helps you to control how much you use.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t want to use too much.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use too much on my face because it is an oil</li>
            <li>but if you apply too much it will look and feel oily.</li>
            <li>And it absorbs into the skin really well.</li>
            <li>The bottle has a dropper which is very convenient, as it helps when I distribute the oil through my hair and over my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;2)  </li>
            <li>This Jojoba oil from Art Naturals is a really high quality oil!</li>
            <li>I mix it with, and it is fast absorbing, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about greasiness when used on my skin.  </li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li>I am very cautious with what I put on skin</li>
            <li>He has eczema and this oil really helped his skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a really goo value for your money.</li>
            <li>so i can&#x27;t really compare it to anything</li>
            <li>Really like the packaging.</li>
            <li>I really like this</li>
            <li>skin really responds to jojoba&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>When I started using this, there wasn&#x27;t much of a difference in my blackheads.</li>
            <li>I plan on using this a whole lot.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this Jojoba oil from Art Naturals!</li>
            <li>I really like this jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>really get excited when the products are oils or essential oils.</li>
            <li>I mix with other oils and rose water and my hair is so soft.</li>
            <li>but this oil feels incredibly pure and natural which makes me feel this oil is of a very high quality!</li>
            <li>I did some reading online and have found many other beneficial uses for it as well and look forward to trying it as an all over moisturizer, to remove makeup, and to adding some to my shampoo to keep my hair moisturized and prevent split</li>
            <li>This is a womens best kept secret!!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experimented with too many other uses just yet</li>
            <li>This would retail in many other places for over $50.</li>
            <li>This is a large bottle of high quality jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li>The extra long dropper is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It is highly moisturizing and leaves your hair with softness and you appear to have much thicker hair.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a dark amber glass bottle to protect the oil from light and prolong its freshness and has a glass dropper so I can get just the right amount out when I want to use it without wasting any.  </li>
            <li>As a busy mom of three I have become very aware of what I am using on my skin &amp; hair &amp; I find myself gravitating towards all natural products.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a transparent light gold in colour and the thickness is consistent with other well</li>
            <li>Its cleared most of the dark spot off my neck and chest.</li>
            <li>, i use it on my hair, and my hair has never been so soft in my whole life!</li>
            <li>Received a discount on this bottle of Jojoba oil for the purposes of review, but would definitely buy again from this seller at full price.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a newbie to all the essential oils so getting recipes together for certain symptoms or problems skins is actually really fun.</li>
            <li>I use this a lot, as a facial cleanser and eye make up remover, massaged into face &amp; body after shower keeps skin supple and soft, fantastic for eczema.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it as a skin (but mainly hair) moisturizer.</li>
            <li>When I asked her what it was for she said that she uses it mainly for removing makeup around her eyes.</li>
            <li>I love to mix this with my regular unscented lotion to help give me some extra moisturizing benefits.  </li>
            <li>The main thing I like to use It for is as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li>and how it works more later in on my final review.</li>
            <li>This really helped clear up the eczema on my face!</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend</li>
            <li>Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>, this can help a lot, i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>A huge amount that I&#x27;m not sure I can use all of it since I only need a few drops but more is better</li>
            <li>I also like that this is pure and natural without any additives.</li>
            <li>Go natural and organic!!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly, non greasy, and it left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li>It has many different uses such as using it on your hair to give it a strong, healthy look, to applying it to dry and dull skin.</li>
            <li>but I do really like it so far.</li>
            <li>I normally order from Oil essentials and the price is ridiculus.</li>
            <li>Not a deep golden color.</li>
            <li>after few weeks I can&lt;br /&gt;see is much better, as well as my hair is more&lt;br /&gt;soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try a few more.</li>
            <li>what I like, because I mainly use it as a carrier oil, as a base to make my own cuticle oil, and my customers are loving it!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>So thanks to Art Naturals for they&#x27;re totally legit and 100% pure jojoba oil.</li>
            <li>It is fragrance free, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with other oils</li>
            <li>that I&#x27;m a new convert to Jojoba Oil</li>
            <li>wWell let me now say this is definitely my new go-to oil.</li>
            <li>got a new tattoo about a week ago, and applying the oil to the healing skin keeps it moisturized, but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I add a few drops to my shampoo to keep my hair healthy and shiny, and even use on damp hair or a tiny amount on dry hair to tame fly aways.</li>
            <li>My hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin around my eyes, and Art Naturals does not bother me in any way.</li>
            <li>I also use this oil as a lotion on my body and it has made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li>This keeps your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>the product is great! :(</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell so great for hair &amp; skin use without a weird smell!</li>
            <li>Skin feels soft!</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair with few other oils as a leave in treatment and when I wash it out my hair shiny and silky and just gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Many times the smaller bottles just aren&#x27;t enough and the larger bottles take too long to use which allows time to loose many of the benefits of this oil.</li>
            <li>I particularly love this for my cuticles, dry skin and dry hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li>He uses this  everyday after taking a shower and it works really great and soften his skin and no more itching.</li>
            <li>I love that this doesn&#x27;t make my skin look greasy, i work in a hospital so constantly washing my hands - hence my hands are dry as dirt!!!!</li>
            <li>It heals dry skin, even the DRIEST, cracked-dry skin, it heals stretch marks and wrinkles, it can be used as a facial cleanser (and leave your skin SO SMOOTH and MOISTURIZED), damaged hair mender, lip moisturizer, I could go on FOREVER..</li>
            <li>I also used this on my face and lips, just squeeze a few drops onto a cotton balls and apply to face rinse with warm water after, i also use jajoba on my lips when it gets dry..</li>
            <li>Jojoba &amp; essential oils plus Rosehip - results within day - skin is smoother, pores are smaller and I can use it during the day because it absorbs so quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li>need a lot of drops to properly cover large spaces (skin and hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is a large size bottle and will last you for a while, it also comes with a dropper so there is no mess when using it.</li>
            <li>I also used a drop or two on my cuticle and they feel really soft.  </li>
            <li>You put the oil on your feet and put socks on and in the morning you will have soft feet.</li>
            <li>I use the dropper near my scalp and comb it through; I also put in on my hands, rub them together and massage the ends of my hair with it, as well.</li>
            <li>Completely natural, 100% ORGANIC.</li>
            <li>coz its natural and organic</li>
            <li>I do recommend this jojoba oil, but I recommend making a body scrub out of it instead of using it straight to avoid the left over oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and my hair feels so soft and it looks healthier.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m convinced it is what makes my body butter absorb quicker, and leave your skin silky soft.</li>
            <li>She likes that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have fumes that irritates her eyes like rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li>As a body oil it keeps my skin soft all day.  </li>
            <li>My face is clearer and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li>I like the product so much that I have already made a second purchase, for my mom.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling amazingly soft without a greasy or oily sensation.</li>
            <li>Natural  </li>
            <li>I put it on before bed on my face and my skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>My daughters summer school teacher sent a note home yesterday raving about how soft and shiny her hair is.  </li>
            <li>Leaves it soft, shiny (not greasy) and manageable.</li>
            <li>The bottle that it comes in is large and will last you for a long time, you don&#x27;t need much with each use.  </li>
            <li>Not sure why people love it so much can see no real difference using it at all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this oil in the past and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li>so I can feel confident about its safety, is cold pressed to preserve the nutrients, and especially that it&#x27;s completely free from pesticides and GMOs.  </li>
            <li>I did have a small problem with my order, and Art Naturals fixed it RIGHT AWAY!</li>
            <li>this really works on dry skin when I get out of the shower I put it on with my skin still damp</li>
            <li>I put this on directly after my shower and my skin is not only soft but it seems to aid in healing any mars on my skin.</li>
            <li>Jojoba oil acts as an emollient, making my lips soft and not dry and cracked.</li>
            <li>Shipping was ridiculously fast, and the quality of this oil rivals the more expensive stuff.</li>
            <li>Her skin is very sensitive and since I can&#x27;t use a lot of lotions from the store, I thought about using essential oils instead.</li>
            <li>Do yourself a favor and stop buying harsh quemical products for your hair that are only going to dry it more.</li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly with no strong smell or greasy feel unlike coconut oil.  </li>
            <li>You only get half the size for a lot more money from other brands!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I love that is 100% pure virgin cold press and organic.</li>
            <li>I use it mixed with Young Living rosemary essential oil for my psoriasis</li>
            <li>it has work not completely gone but has soft it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had to cope with oily areas around my nose but a friend who tried this suggested that I give it a try because Jojoba oil is actually a liquefied wax similar to the same properties of the oils our skin produces naturally,</li>
            <li>The 4 oz. seems to go a long way so far.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It worked very well and now I can use less makeup because my face doesn&#x27;t have those shiny areas to have to cover up.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a natural way to tame your hair I highly suggest this oil.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way and the bottle is very large.  </li>
            <li>Been using Art Naturals Organic Pure Virgin Jojoba oil for little over two weeks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I would definitely purchase from Art Naturals again due to their high quality oils.</li>
            <li>Also, the jojoba is close to our skin&#x27;s natural composition so it won&#x27;t make you oily and definitely helps with the dry skin.  </li>
            <li>and I loved that Art Naturals jojoba oils was 100% organic and didn&#x27;t contain any bad filler oils like mineral oil.  </li>

            <li> I have used many carrier oils before, but I think this jojoba oil is my new favorite.  </li>
            <li> This organic jojoba oil is fantastic, I did order it through a special deal to try it and share my unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s especially good because the powder I was using to absorb the excess skin oils was causing too much dryness in the areas I don&#x27;t need to dry up and that could lead to wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I originally purchased it as a body oil</li>
            <li> , the consistency is nice not thick and gummy, yet thicker then water.</li>
            <li> I originally  bought this for my blackheads.</li>
            <li> You will see a significant difference in your nail&#x27;s appearance, saving you time and money from the nail salon.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The quality of the products I use on my skin is important to me, so I&#x27;m pleased that this Jojoba oil is 100% pure with no additives, is made in the USA</li>
            <li> 100% pure, all organic, pest free, and so many uses -</li>
            <li> I use it to clean my face every night, and remove makeup.  </li>
            <li> I clean my face with this.</li>
            <li> bottle is HUGE and we&#x27;re going through it quickly.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and is odor free.</li>
            <li> The next morning my skin felt soft and wonderful.</li>
            <li> For now I could say that the oil is not greasy and it seems like it is moisturizing my skin good, I try to put this after taking a shower wherein I am not completely dry up.</li>
            <li> My hair is frizzy &amp; this is perfect to tame my frizz!  </li>
            <li> It keeps skin soft, smooth, and moisturized, helps keep you acne free, reduces stretch marks, keeps hair frizz free and conditions hair and scalp and MORE.</li>
            <li> This is a beautifully packaged bottle of top quality pure Jojoba Oil, the uses are endless.</li>
            <li> Price was right!</li>
            <li> I absolute love</li>
            <li> This oil is cool</li>
            <li> Mostly I used jojoba oil to take my eye makeup off and moisturize the rest of my body, but not as much on my face.</li>
            <li> Mix with some of your favorite lotion/facial moisturizer and you will feel very relieved of dryness that you may have.  </li>
            <li> Good oil, but the dropper leaks all over, and the bottle doesn&#x27;t seal properly.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I love</li>
            <li> I will continue to purchase this oil at full price.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is good for several things.</li>
            <li> It has really improved my skin and made it more supple.</li>
            <li> It feels great on my skin and has even reduced my husbands very dry and itchy feet problem!</li>
            <li> Has a slight scent that I am unused to, but the color and texture are beautiful.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Jojoba oil is a great addition to have moisturized skin and can complement lotions and other skin</li>
            <li> Regarding the product, I didn&#x27;t notice any smell which is great if you are using it in combination with other oils.  </li>
            <li> Great oil...leaves my skin soft and smooth...absorbs quickly with no mess!</li>
            <li> It has no smell and it absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> I like to use this particular Organic Jojoba Oil  because there are many uses for it.</li>
            <li> so I had to apply it often, but my lips were better after one weekend versus a week of steady &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> i am pregnant and been using baby oil for my belly</li>
            <li> super oily residue&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> It leaves no residue and soaks into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely worth trying if you want something both natural and effective for moisturizing anywhere on the body.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even great to replace your face moisturizer with because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your skin or clog your pores!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to jojoba oil, but I have to say I positively love it so very much!</li>
            <li> Overall this is a great high quality oil that I&#x27;ve already recommended to friends and coworkers already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Generous 4 ounce bottle of high quality Jojoba oil that makes a great lightweight moisturizer or carrier oil for essential oils.  </li>
            <li> This product had no smell and absorbed into the skin quickly.</li>
            <li> It is also good to use on your body immediately after bath, this can heal you cracked dry skin, i even tried mine</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;m making sure I get the jojoba oil from USA, not Israel!</li>
            <li> so I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin feeling very smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle arrived very well packages and was leak free.</li>
            <li> This oil is light and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent.</li>
            <li> By the time I am ready for lipstick, it goes on smoothly.</li>
            <li> It feels very silky and light.</li>
            <li> I honestly noticed a difference the next day.  </li>
            <li> The product is allegedly made in Israel and seems of good quality.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products</li>
            <li> By far one of my favorite Jojoba oils I have had the pleasure to review.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s useful in treating sumburns.</li>
            <li> Jojoba is a thicker oil and while more natural to the oils produced by our bodies, its thickness can clog pores.</li>
            <li> I love that i can add it to my body wash to my skin soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom everywhere.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a rough winter and were in need of some good quality oil.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> I got this with intent to diffuse but after reading the uses I decided I would benefit much more with applying to my skin directly.</li>
            <li> He loves using this as it is an organic and all ingredients are natural which is safe to used.&lt;br /&gt;Im</li>
            <li> I love this product i use it on my two year old daughter after a shower</li>
            <li> So far so good haven&#x27;t used long enough to see the benefits but fast shipping and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> dries quickly and soaks in to skin really well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other brands and nothing has been as good.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED their Jojoba Oil and love using (very sparingly)</li>
            <li> Has made my hair silky smooth and less static!  </li>
            <li> My skin just soaked it right up.</li>
            <li> This 4oz bottle is just the right size.  </li>
            <li> Smell is just right.</li>
            <li> Convenient dropper provides just the right amount needed.</li>
            <li> It does make my skin super soft and I am looking forward to see more results with my hair that has been falling, Jojoba is very emollient</li>
            <li> It absorbs well, leaves skin smooth and refined and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a high shine like others I have tried.</li>
            <li> Dry patches on my skin has vanished completely and i am really happy about that.</li>
            <li> It absorbed pretty quickly into my skin and now my skin feels well hydrated and much softer.  </li>
            <li> Received for reviewing purposes the health benefits of natural oils like coconut oil, argan oil have been evident for quite some time and Jojoba seems to be an oil that&#x27;s currently overtaking some of the most respectable</li>
            <li> This is a high quality jojoba oil and worth the price!</li>
            <li> I used the oil on my hair it made it soft and shinny and easy to manage .</li>
            <li> So far so good as with all skin products will have to check back if anything changes.</li>
            <li> We use essential oils daily and this is another great one that we have.</li>
            <li> Am in love with it already thinking of getting a second bottle..</li>
            <li> I will use as directed but have not decided how to use after a shower without using more oil than necessary.  </li>
            <li> Will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Just with the first use</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I also love mixing it with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> Already have a second bottle on the way :)</li>
            <li> I was able to review this product at a deeply discounted product.</li>
            <li> While I could use it when shaving, it is more a moisturizer / cleanser for a female.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re not counting usages, but it should last for some time unless it gets used in even more ways.</li>
            <li> I have light, sensitive skin that is prone to dryness.  </li>
            <li> love using this as a carrier oil with my essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> This jojoba oil is the real deal!</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and have started using them to help with skin issues that my daughter has.</li>
            <li> In just that amount of time, my lips are smoother than they have ever been and my daughter&#x27;s skin is holding moisture and is definitely looking better.</li>
            <li> First used the aloe vera gel to rid whiteheads and or acne, then included it with the jojoba and coconut oil skin product I made, and continued using to this date.</li>
            <li> When I use all of this I will most definitely be buying another bottle.</li>
            <li> is very silky!</li>
            <li> We love essential oils.</li>
            <li> Made my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I got this item for testing and review purposes, and this is actually my first time using the jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> Exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> looking forward of buying more in the future</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I loved the feeling after my face dried.</li>
            <li> Art Naturals has a very pure undilluted jojoba oil that us 100% pure and organic.</li>
            <li> And with it being such high quality and don&#x27;t have to use as much which is even better!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great value for your money - the bottle will last a long time!</li>
            <li> Has little to no scent, which is fine for most situations.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a lot of time right now</li>
            <li> Not only is it all natural and organic, but it does so many things!</li>
            <li> this is great for those who have somewhat sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use sea salt alone because it&#x27;s too harsh on their skin.</li>
            <li> Love the control of the dripper only as much as you need.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is one of my favorite natural moisturizers, so I was thrilled to find this company offering such a generous amount at such a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> the Product!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pretty large and the dropper is made sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;It is scentless,</li>
            <li> so thats great, and its not oily like other type of oils i have tried, i wont stop buying it ever, maybe i will try other marks later just to keep checking and comparing, anyways this is an amazing oil</li>
            <li> Makes everything super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> You could use it on your skin, scalp, hair, pretty much anything.</li>
            <li> So please bear in mind that this is just an initial  review and will follpw up or complete  my review after i have used it for an amount of time enough for me to attest how great this brand could be.</li>
            <li> I apply this oil on my hair, skin and cuticles once or twice a week to keep my skin moisturized and it restores moisture and strengthens my dry damage hair this oil gets absorbed into the skin and hair very quickly my skin and hair don&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about this oil...feels great on my skin AND on my dry dry dry hair.</li>

            <li> You don&#x27;t want to use too much.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use too much on my face because it is an oil</li>
            <li> but if you apply too much it will look and feel oily.</li>
            <li> And it absorbs into the skin really well.</li>

            <li> but this oil feels incredibly pure and natural which makes me feel this oil is of a very high quality!</li>

            <li> This is a womens best kept secret!!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experimented with too many other uses just yet</li>

            <li> This is a large bottle of high quality jojoba oil.  </li>
            <li> The extra long dropper is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It is highly moisturizing and leaves your hair with softness and you appear to have much thicker hair.  </li>

            <li> As a busy mom of three I have become very aware of what I am using on my skin &amp; hair &amp; I find myself gravitating towards all natural products.  </li>

            <li> I&#x27;m a newbie to all the essential oils so getting recipes together for certain symptoms or problems skins is actually really fun.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot, as a facial cleanser and eye make up remover, massaged into face &amp; body after shower keeps skin supple and soft, fantastic for eczema.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it as a skin (but mainly hair) moisturizer.</li>
            <li> When I asked her what it was for she said that she uses it mainly for removing makeup around her eyes.</li>
            <li> I love to mix this with my regular unscented lotion to help give me some extra moisturizing benefits.  </li>
            <li> The main thing I like to use It for is as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> and how it works more later in on my final review.</li>
            <li> This really helped clear up the eczema on my face!</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> , this can help a lot, i highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> A huge amount that I&#x27;m not sure I can use all of it since I only need a few drops but more is better</li>
            <li> I also like that this is pure and natural without any additives.</li>
            <li> Go natural and organic!!</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly, non greasy, and it left my hair very soft.</li>
            <li> It has many different uses such as using it on your hair to give it a strong, healthy look, to applying it to dry and dull skin.</li>
            <li> but I do really like it so far.</li>
            <li> I normally order from Oil essentials and the price is ridiculus.</li>
            <li> Not a deep golden color.</li>
            <li> after few weeks I can&lt;br /&gt;see is much better, as well as my hair is more&lt;br /&gt;soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try a few more.</li>
            <li> what I like, because I mainly use it as a carrier oil, as a base to make my own cuticle oil, and my customers are loving it!&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> So thanks to Art Naturals for they&#x27;re totally legit and 100% pure jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> It is fragrance free, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with other oils</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;m a new convert to Jojoba Oil</li>
            <li> wWell let me now say this is definitely my new go-to oil.</li>
            <li> got a new tattoo about a week ago, and applying the oil to the healing skin keeps it moisturized, but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my shampoo to keep my hair healthy and shiny, and even use on damp hair or a tiny amount on dry hair to tame fly aways.</li>
            <li> My hair feels very soft.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin around my eyes, and Art Naturals does not bother me in any way.</li>
            <li> I also use this oil as a lotion on my body and it has made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> This keeps your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> the product is great! :(</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell so great for hair &amp; skin use without a weird smell!</li>
            <li> Skin feels soft!</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair with few other oils as a leave in treatment and when I wash it out my hair shiny and silky and just gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Many times the smaller bottles just aren&#x27;t enough and the larger bottles take too long to use which allows time to loose many of the benefits of this oil.</li>
            <li> I particularly love this for my cuticles, dry skin and dry hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s new.</li>
            <li> He uses this  everyday after taking a shower and it works really great and soften his skin and no more itching.</li>
            <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t make my skin look greasy, i work in a hospital so constantly washing my hands - hence my hands are dry as dirt!!!!</li>
            <li> It heals dry skin, even the DRIEST, cracked-dry skin, it heals stretch marks and wrinkles, it can be used as a facial cleanser (and leave your skin SO SMOOTH and MOISTURIZED), damaged hair mender, lip moisturizer, I could go on FOREVER..</li>
            <li> I also used this on my face and lips, just squeeze a few drops onto a cotton balls and apply to face rinse with warm water after, i also use jajoba on my lips when it gets dry..</li>
            <li> Jojoba &amp; essential oils plus Rosehip - results within day - skin is smoother, pores are smaller and I can use it during the day because it absorbs so quickly and completely.  </li>
            <li> need a lot of drops to properly cover large spaces (skin and hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is a large size bottle and will last you for a while, it also comes with a dropper so there is no mess when using it.</li>
            <li> I also used a drop or two on my cuticle and they feel really soft.  </li>
            <li> You put the oil on your feet and put socks on and in the morning you will have soft feet.</li>
            <li> I use the dropper near my scalp and comb it through; I also put in on my hands, rub them together and massage the ends of my hair with it, as well.</li>
            <li> Completely natural, 100% ORGANIC.</li>
            <li> coz its natural and organic</li>
            <li> I do recommend this jojoba oil, but I recommend making a body scrub out of it instead of using it straight to avoid the left over oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my hair feels so soft and it looks healthier.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m convinced it is what makes my body butter absorb quicker, and leave your skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> She likes that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have fumes that irritates her eyes like rubbing alcohol</li>
            <li> As a body oil it keeps my skin soft all day.  </li>
            <li> My face is clearer and my skin is soft.</li>
            <li> I like the product so much that I have already made a second purchase, for my mom.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling amazingly soft without a greasy or oily sensation.</li>
            <li> Natural  </li>
            <li> I put it on before bed on my face and my skin has never been so soft.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> My daughters summer school teacher sent a note home yesterday raving about how soft and shiny her hair is.  </li>
            <li> Leaves it soft, shiny (not greasy) and manageable.</li>
            <li> The bottle that it comes in is large and will last you for a long time, you don&#x27;t need much with each use.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why people love it so much can see no real difference using it at all.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil in the past and it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
            <li> so I can feel confident about its safety, is cold pressed to preserve the nutrients, and especially that it&#x27;s completely free from pesticides and GMOs.  </li>
            <li> I did have a small problem with my order, and Art Naturals fixed it RIGHT AWAY!</li>
            <li> this really works on dry skin when I get out of the shower I put it on with my skin still damp</li>
            <li> I put this on directly after my shower and my skin is not only soft but it seems to aid in healing any mars on my skin.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil acts as an emollient, making my lips soft and not dry and cracked.</li>
            <li> Shipping was ridiculously fast, and the quality of this oil rivals the more expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> Her skin is very sensitive and since I can&#x27;t use a lot of lotions from the store, I thought about using essential oils instead.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and stop buying harsh quemical products for your hair that are only going to dry it more.</li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly with no strong smell or greasy feel unlike coconut oil.  </li>
            <li> You only get half the size for a lot more money from other brands!!!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> I love that is 100% pure virgin cold press and organic.</li>
            <li> I use it mixed with Young Living rosemary essential oil for my psoriasis</li>
            <li> it has work not completely gone but has soft it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had to cope with oily areas around my nose but a friend who tried this suggested that I give it a try because Jojoba oil is actually a liquefied wax similar to the same properties of the oils our skin produces naturally,</li>
            <li> The 4 oz. seems to go a long way so far.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It worked very well and now I can use less makeup because my face doesn&#x27;t have those shiny areas to have to cover up.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a natural way to tame your hair I highly suggest this oil.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way and the bottle is very large.  </li>
            <li> Been using Art Naturals Organic Pure Virgin Jojoba oil for little over two weeks.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would definitely purchase from Art Naturals again due to their high quality oils.</li>
            <li> Also, the jojoba is close to our skin&#x27;s natural composition so it won&#x27;t make you oily and definitely helps with the dry skin.  </li>
            <li> and I loved that Art Naturals jojoba oils was 100% organic and didn&#x27;t contain any bad filler oils like mineral oil.  </li>
            <li> It has a slight nutty fragrance to it which is normal for these kinds of oils.</li>
            <li> True consistency, faint coloring and smell natural to the Jojoba plant, tree.</li>
            <li> I use it as a hair oil (a bit goes a LONG way), and as a carrier oil for essential oil applications.</li>
            <li> I can tell this bottle won&#x27;t last long in my house</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s organic and goes a long way - will never buy regular lotions again!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely cleared up my minor blemishes &amp; blocked pores.</li>
            <li> Its not heavy so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down.</li>
            <li> , I rinsed it out ( which took a little bit) and my hair and scalp were so soft!</li>
            <li> I left it on the spot for a couple hours before rinsing it out and today the dry spot is gone.  </li>
            <li> I have colored treated blonde hair and my hair can get very dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> It would clear a little</li>
            <li> I just dab a little on a cotton ball and it takes the mascara off effortlessly and naturally without leaving my face feeling oily.  </li>
            <li> Bottle was bigger then expected.</li>
            <li> have been using it for a long time</li>
            <li> This 4 oz bottle of Jojoba Oil goes a long ways.</li>
            <li> so its a long way to go.</li>
            <li> I applied a small amount after I shaved my legs, they are so soft and sleek!</li>
            <li> I tried it on my face before bed and the next day I had little red bumps and clogged pores.  </li>
            <li> I put this on my dry feet</li>
            <li> my cuticles because they are both really dry.  </li>
            <li> My feet are softer and are not peeling and my cuticles are no longer dry.  </li>
            <li> I noticed a dry patch on my scalp as well, so I used the oil on it.  </li>
            <li> Art Naturals Jojoba oil is working wonders on balancing the combination skin on my face and also helping moisturize the dry skin on my arms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it all over my body, face and dry feet.  </li>
            <li> I keep this with me at all times to apply to my hands whenever they feel dry.</li>
            <li> We use it on our dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try it on my horribly dry skin.</li>
            <li> My skin on my arms, face, and legs are always so dry.</li>
            <li> My body parts that I rubbed this on was no longer dry.</li>
            <li> and it makes your skin feel naturally soft without feeling greasy so long as you use just a small amount per application.</li>
            <li> stop use immediately because there must be some kind of ingredient in it, its a shame i cant use it because my skin gets extremely dry :(</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way -- this bottle will last me years probably</li>
            <li> I recommend for mixed individuals as well as black individuals.</li>
            <li> skin is very dry and</li>
            <li> Conditions my long beard as well as other jojoba and beard oils I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I like this product to use with other moisturizers, it gives a little extra TLC to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Also I enjoy not having a scent because my husband isn&#x27;t afraid to use it.</li>
            <li> I like the dropper that comes without and it works as expected.</li>
            <li> I would put it on my body as requested while my body wAS still wet.</li>
            <li> She says one feature she likes is the eye dropper so that it is easier to put a few drops on a cotton ball so that it will last longer than trying to pour it on.</li>
            <li> BUT, it can happen and is not unusual regardless of brand.</li>
            <li> I live in Arizona where the past few days have been 114</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be mixing mine with a few other oils as well as essential oils.</li>
            <li> and I need minimal other product</li>
            <li> so using Jojoba oil on my face would moisturize the dry areas while fooling  the oily areas into producing less oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I use my jojoba oil as a mosuturizer, makeup remover and to dilute other stronger oils.</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair, exclusively, so I cannot attest to its other uses</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other oils as moisturizers, like almond oil and coconut oil</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!  </li>
            <li> helps hair frizz and puffiness, just mix into a wet palm to spread around and mix into hair and the frizz is gone!</li>
            <li> Only have to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> It works well on dry skin areas!!!</li>
            <li> All oils same very pale color.</li>
            <li> I like how it comes in a dark glass bottle.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil works well with my curly, coarse, thick hair.</li>
            <li> I love this product since I have tried it from my friend, I had a very bad dry skin even in summer</li>
            <li> so I already notice less dandruff as well.</li>
            <li> I have used Jojoba oil previously on my hair.</li>
            <li> I had previously used another brand of jojoba oil that helped dissolve the blackheads on my nose.</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on my wet hair after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> My face has never been so smooth, and call me crazy, but I feel it has even erased some of my wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I even added a few drops to my damp hair and it did not weigh it down</li>
            <li> I ALSO PUT A LITTLE ON MY FACE.  </li>
            <li> This is a glass bottle and it comes with a little dropper for applying.</li>
            <li> Been using a little over a month</li>
            <li> I like that the JOJOBA OIL is 100% pure, virgin, organic and  cold pressed.</li>
            <li> No strong smell so it can be added to anything and won&#x27;t mess up the smell</li>
            <li> I use my jojoba oil everyday for my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> Just a few minutes.  </li>
            <li> I add a few drops to my moisturizer every day.</li>
            <li> Does not have a harsh smell.</li>
            <li> I have a few things to say about it.</li>
            <li> I used a few drops to my scalp and rubbed it in and let it sit for a few min</li>
            <li> My scalp gets dried out from the hair dryer and hairspray I use.</li>
            <li> It blends nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a terribly oily residue.</li>
            <li> I also added a few drops to my body lotion.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the oil about a month and a few days.</li>
            <li> I also added a few drops to my sons coconut butter</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve NEVER had pimples on my head but after a few weeks of using this now I do.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs well and isn&#x27;t all messy.</li>
            <li> Buff your nails, then apply a few drops of joboba oil, paying close attention to the cuticles.</li>
            <li> And the icing on the cake is, a friend recommended I add a few drops to my mop water.</li>
            <li> I took a shower, dried off, then rubbed it on my arms, face, and legs.</li>
            <li> Adds a small amount of shine which isn&#x27;t too terrible and can be mixed in easily into moisturizer to help spread evenly.</li>
            <li> I am an avid essential oil user and I normally use coconut oil as a base for my oils but have found it can tend to dry my skin out a little, so I was looking to try some jojoba oil as a base instead.  </li>
            <li> i have a frizz hair and  messy hair,just apply a small amount of jajoba oil onto your scalp and you fell that the dryness relieve.</li>
            <li> Received in two days, well packaged and wrapped in bubble wrap very tight.</li>
            <li> even after it healed, the skin was dry and cracked worse than anything I have ever seen.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oils is my favorite base oil!</li>
            <li> I sometimes mix a small amount of sea salt with a couple drops of jojoba oil to make a lip or body scrub</li>
            <li> Just add a small drop to a cottonball and wipe away</li>
            <li> I am used to using organic jojoba oil on my face as this is the facial oil I have been using on my face prior to this one which has organic jojoba oil in it: [...]</li>
            <li> Anxious to try it somemore.</li>
            <li> I also use droplets in my thick hair to help tame and moisturize.</li>
            <li> Usually when I woke up in the am before purchasing the oil my skin would look a little tired.</li>
            <li> Well that sucks the orice went up wich</li>
            <li> Less expensive than another brand I bought, but I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two in a blind test.  </li>
            <li> We bought this as a base oil to mix with a lavender essential oil for a diffuser, and it&#x27;s simply the base oil we were expecting.</li>
            <li> it with some other base substance for improved results&lt;br /&gt;-Minimal</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I already chipped the tip of mine, but I&#x27;m just a clutz...</li>
            <li> however it is a possibility of me being allergic to it because I broke out in a horrible rash and kept trying different products on my legs to take care of that!</li>
            <li> I can throw away all those expensive moisturizers now that I have this.  </li>
            <li> As oils tend to clog pores and cause terrible acne breakout, I combine them with refracted coconut oil prior to using on my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;**The separate dropper was broken when it got here which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> This had a weird smell to it.  </li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed if you buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and you will NOT be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Boring and ineffective.  </li>
            <li> Especially ill be saving for some of this for winter time</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil in the past and it&#x27;s fantastic. I&#x27;ve used other brands and nothing has been as good.</li>
            <li> Great great great. Going to be using it for making homemade shampoos, soaps and lotions. :)</li>
            <li> I used the oil on my hair it made it soft and shinny and easy to manage . Now I am using it on my face also to get the healthy look.</li>
            <li> This feels awesome anywhere on your body! I was skeptic but since I&#x27;ve tried it I can&#x27;t stop lathering it everywhere. Not too oily at all and absorbs fast.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oils is my favorite base oil! Art Naturals has a very pure undilluted jojoba oil that us 100% pure and organic. I use my jojoba oil as a mosuturizer, makeup remover and to dilute other stronger oils. I purchased this item using a one time promotional code, this review is written in my own words.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle arrived very well packages and was leak free. The bottle is made of glass which is great because it keeps the oil toxin free and pure for a longer amount of time. The dropper included has a rubber squeezer and works great to measure the perfect amount of oil. I absolute love the product and the seller is very quick to respond to questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase from Art Naturals again due to their high quality oils. I use my jojoba oil everyday for my hair and skin. It feels great on my skin and has even reduced my husbands very dry and itchy feet problem!</li>
            <li> The jojoba is really nice to use on your hair and skin.  It is highly moisturizing and leaves your hair with softness and you appear to have much thicker hair.  It also helps to control the flyaway hairs.  The jojoba really doesn&#x27;t have any scent to it and it you want to mix it with essential oils it carries the scent and works great.  I ave also used it in recipes for butter and it blends nicely.  It is very hydrating and absorbs into the skin.  It doesn&#x27;t stain clothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great for all over body care and giving massages.  The bottle that it comes in is large and will last you for a long time, you don&#x27;t need much with each use.  The eye dropper works great for when you want to apply to face of hair.  Also, the jojoba is close to our skin&#x27;s natural composition so it won&#x27;t make you oily and definitely helps with the dry skin.  The bottle comes safety sealed for your protection</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of this oil!  I love the amount you get!  I use this on my cuticles and really like the fast absorption of it.  Just a few minutes.  That is much better than what I am used to.  Totally recommend it!</li>
            <li> Really love this product.  Its great for taking off my makeup and also for the Oil Cleansing Method. I also used a drop or two on my cuticle and they feel really soft.  Really enjoying this.  And for the price, its such a great deal.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased to be given the opportunity to try the Jojoba oil by Art Naturals. I make my own body lotions and used this oil along with she butter. The oil blends really well and is very moisturizing. It has a slight nutty fragrance to it which is normal for these kinds of oils. It is a very generous sized bottle at a great price.</li>
            <li> This oil is cool it&#x27;s 4oz and it only $6 almost $7 with free shipping it&#x27;s organic and cruelty free!!!! Bought 2 and i will stalk up on MORE!   Well that sucks the orice went up wich is why am giving it one stsr now it was awesome but now it to pricey to keep buying and the price keeps going up....</li>
            <li> My hair feels very soft. My hair looks very healthy.I put this on my dry feet they look very good. You put the oil on your feet and put socks on and in the morning you will have soft feet. I did get this to try out.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is 100% organic and chemical free.  It has so many uses and I personally use it to moisturize my hands, cuticles, heels of my feet, my skin, my scalp, and the ends of my hair.  It has no smell and it absorbs quickly.  You get a lot of product in the bottle and it also comes with a dropper which makes it easier for application.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this purchase. Jojoba oil is a light oil and works well for me when using in my hair.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed about this jojoba oil is that it is organic and unrefined, which I love!  I really wanted to use this oil for my feet and my cuticles because they are both really dry.  I honestly noticed a difference the next day.  My feet are softer and are not peeling and my cuticles are no longer dry.  I noticed a dry patch on my scalp as well, so I used the oil on it.  I left it on the spot for a couple hours before rinsing it out and today the dry spot is gone.  This product is very good for deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> Price was right! Bottle was bigger then expected. Also I enjoy not having a scent because my husband isn&#x27;t afraid to use it. He has used it on his scalp and seems to help with dryness. Also I enjoy using it after the shower on my body and face. I&#x27;m glad I tried this product and I hope your try it out for your self too!!</li>
            <li> I love that this doesn&#x27;t make my skin look greasy, i work in a hospital so constantly washing my hands - hence my hands are dry as dirt!!!! I just tried a couple of drops on my the problem area and it feels good and lubed up but doesn&#x27;t look greasy at all but feels moisturized. Smells earthy, not bad at all, and its organic! Glad I got to try this at a great discounted rate.</li>
            <li> Love the texture of this.  This is a great product for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Excellent product for skincare and hair care.  I use it as a scalp cleanser and it is wonderful as a serum and provides shine and a healthy look to my hair.</li>
            <li> Would be awesome if it came with a back-up dropper. Unfortunately I already chipped the tip of mine, but I&#x27;m just a clutz...the product is great! :(</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is a &amp;#34;wonder&amp;#34; oil.

            <li> Wonderful!!!!! The oil is multi purpose and smells great.</li>
            <li> This is a great value! This Jojoba oil is cold-pressed and cruelty-free and eco-friendly &#x3D; smart, safe, beauty! I love that this soaks right into the skin ( best after shower) and its even fantastic to add the bath for yourself of the kids mine have bumpy skin. No dyes, colorants or irritants.</li>
            <li> I love this oil I have a  2 year and none of the medication the doctor has giving has work for her Eczema but a week applying this oil it has work not completely gone but has soft it.. I was applied it to my spouses for her Eczema and has work also the best part it doesn&#x27;t leave a oily mess safe to wear with clothes and doesn&#x27;t smell. Am in love with it already thinking of getting a second bottle.. Thank you</li>
            <li> Received oil. Love it.</li>
            <li> This is most pure jojoba oil I have ever purchased! It absorbs into my skin on contact and has no smell to to at all. I put this on directly after my shower and my skin is not only soft but it seems to aid in healing any mars on my skin. I even added a few drops to my damp hair and it did not weigh it down (I have fine hair).</li>
            <li> Delivery was really fast and I love the product, it made my hair so shiny, I put it on on my face and made my face feel smoother than any face cream I have ever used! this oil is virtually without a smell, happy with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I use this a lot, as a facial cleanser and eye make up remover, massaged into face &amp; body after shower keeps skin supple and soft, fantastic for eczema. Dropper is so handy! I add a few drops to my shampoo to keep my hair healthy and shiny, and even use on damp hair or a tiny amount on dry hair to tame fly aways. Calmed my sunburn overnight too</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love about this oil...feels great on my skin AND on my dry dry dry hair. I live in Arizona where the past few days have been 114+ so my skin is screaming for moisture. The dropper makes it convenient to use just enough. Very pleased</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil by Art Naturals is the best product I have tried for my hair and skin. I have colored treated blonde hair and my hair can get very dry and damaged. This oil has really helped my split ends and leaves my hair very shiny without looking oily.  I put a small amount on my wet hair after I get out of the shower. It is also great for skin the skin. I add a few drops to my moisturizer every day. My skin loves it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thankful to have received this oil to test and offer my honest opinion. Its great!</li>
            <li> This is a generous sized bottle for the price. Jojoba oil works well with my curly, coarse, thick hair. I use the dropper near my scalp and comb it through; I also put in on my hands, rub them together and massage the ends of my hair with it, as well. Completely natural, 100% ORGANIC. I use this for my hair, exclusively, so I cannot attest to its other uses but I am sure there are many. This formula works for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil because of its reputation among my friends.  I will use as directed but have not decided how to use after a shower without using more oil than necessary.  I will re-access at a later date.  However I do like using it on my face as both a cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I was asked to write a review on the Jojoba Oil. It is a very nice oil. I used it on my face as a moisturizer. It felt great. Not oily. My skin just soaked it right up. I loved the feeling after my face dried. Thank you for a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> Awesome product and awesome costumers service!!!!&lt;br /&gt;If you guys had a monthly subscription id definitely sign up for it.</li>
            <li> Thus is good, odorless but effective for me  , a lot of uses for me and to my family</li>
            <li> im using Jojoba Oil for my skin and hair for quite a time and i really like this product coz its natural and organic so that means its very safe to use. i will recommend this to my friends too..</li>
            <li> Art Naturals Jojoba oil is working wonders on balancing the combination skin on my face and also helping moisturize the dry skin on my arms. I&#x27;ve always had to cope with oily areas around my nose but a friend who tried this suggested that I give it a try because Jojoba oil is actually a liquefied wax similar to the same properties of the oils our skin produces naturally, so using Jojoba oil on my face would moisturize the dry areas while fooling  the oily areas into producing less oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked very well and now I can use less makeup because my face doesn&#x27;t have those shiny areas to have to cover up. That&#x27;s especially good because the powder I was using to absorb the excess skin oils was causing too much dryness in the areas I don&#x27;t need to dry up and that could lead to wrinkles. So, for me, this is a wonder oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m a new convert to Jojoba Oil I did some reading online and have found many other beneficial uses for it as well and look forward to trying it as an all over moisturizer, to remove makeup, and to adding some to my shampoo to keep my hair moisturized and prevent split ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the products I use on my skin is important to me, so I&#x27;m pleased that this Jojoba oil is 100% pure with no additives, is made in the USA so I can feel confident about its safety, is cold pressed to preserve the nutrients, and especially that it&#x27;s completely free from pesticides and GMOs.  It comes in a dark amber glass bottle to protect the oil from light and prolong its freshness and has a glass dropper so I can get just the right amount out when I want to use it without wasting any.  It absorbed pretty quickly into my skin and now my skin feels well hydrated and much softer.  100% pure, all organic, pest free, and so many uses - I love it!  Item received at discount for purposes of my evaluation - no obligation.</li>
            <li> this is a great oil, many uses, feels so smooth</li>
            <li> Great oil..however it is greasy unlike the details says it&#x27;s not. And it was so great for my faceskin type.</li>
            <li> This jojoba oil is wonderful! It keep my skin and hair moisturized without feeling greasy. I&#x27;ve also used it on my daughters braids to keep her hair moisturized as well. Will definitely buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> I was offered this product for a great deal to try and share my honest and unbiased opinion. I use essential oil for a lot of different uses in my home. This one is great. I like the dropper that comes without and it works as expected.</li>
            <li> THIS IS THE BEST MOISTURIZER!!  I USE IT SPARINGLY ON MY HAIR AND FEET.  I ALSO PUT A LITTLE ON MY FACE.  MY SKIN HAS NEVER BEEN SOFTER.</li>
            <li> Great!! Leaves my skin feeling very smooth and soft. Has no smell to it and doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling greasy</li>
            <li> Use on hair, body &amp; as a makeup remover.  Doesn&#x27;t sting eyes.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a lot of time right now so this review is going to be very quick and forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizes very well&lt;br /&gt;No scent&lt;br /&gt;Easy to add into mixtures, such as DIY hand scrubs&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t absorb very fast&lt;br /&gt;Leaves a good amount of oil all over your hands, or wherever you put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I do recommend this jojoba oil, but I recommend making a body scrub out of it instead of using it straight to avoid the left over oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it in my hair but I will do an update tomorrow morning when I try it on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Love this! No smell, and it has a great color! And I love that its in am amber jar to protect it from the sunlight. Love this!! Its not greasy either</li>
            <li> I like this Jojoba Oil because of its many many uses. You can use in your hair, on your lips, and on your nails. It can also be used to relieve the pain and discomfort of sunburn and eczema and you can even  put it on your face and body to prevent acne. It also works as an excellent carrier oil to mix with your favorite essential oils to use it as a massage oil and it has no smell which is important. I find that it is also a great moisturizer and it works well in homemade hand lotion mixed with some shea butter and some essential oils as well.</li>
            <li> Does not have a harsh smell. That&#x27;s what I like about this jojoba oil and it does what it&#x27;s suppose to do</li>
            <li> This Jojoba Oil is just what I needed.  It will work great in my beauty and health products.  Jojoba Oil is a must have in homemade soaps and will work great to get that after shower moisture we still need.  This 4oz bottle is just the right size.  Many times the smaller bottles just aren&#x27;t enough and the larger bottles take too long to use which allows time to loose many of the benefits of this oil.</li>
            <li> Loved the oil!! It is working well on my hair and body. I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin as a moisturizer and this stuff does wonders for my face! My face has never been so smooth, and call me crazy, but I feel it has even erased some of my wrinkles!</li>
            <li> I like to use this particular Organic Jojoba Oil  because there are many uses for it.I personally like to apply it after a shower. You could use it on your skin, scalp, hair, pretty much anything. The best part it that it Organic wich already says that its awesome. This is a glass bottle and it comes with a little dropper for applying. I had received this product for free, to use and give my honest opinion about the product.</li>
            <li> This jojoba oil is AMAZING!!! Just with the first use and my hair feels so soft and it looks healthier. This product also does wonders to your skin, its just incredible! Do yourself a favor and stop buying harsh quemical products for your hair that are only going to dry it more. Go natural and organic!! Buy this and enjoy of  healthy skin and hair!</li>
            <li> Mostly I used jojoba oil to take my eye makeup off and moisturize the rest of my body, but not as much on my face. Now I realize the benefits of using jojoba for cleansing my face! I&#x27;ve also learned that just like essential oils- the purity of the jojoba matters. Of course it does, like every thing else! What goes on your skin- GOES IN! So thanks to Art Naturals for they&#x27;re totally legit and 100% pure jojoba oil. It&#x27;s high grade and safe for your face!</li>
            <li> Bought for heat oil treatment for hair, works like a charm.</li>
            <li> Love jojoba oil. I use it for everything, especially for skincare.</li>
            <li> i got this product to review and i&#x27;m so glad i participated because this oil smells so good! i love how lite it feels on my skin. I&#x27;m a newbie to all the essential oils so getting recipes together for certain symptoms or problems skins is actually really fun. thank you for the awesome oil!</li>
            <li> This is my first time purchasing jojoba oil. It did take quite a while to receive it (I received it 10 days after I ordered it). I&#x27;ve never used jojoba oil before so I have nothing to compare it to but I do really like it so far. It&#x27;s moisturizing and non-greasy. I&#x27;ve used other oils as moisturizers, like almond oil and coconut oil but they are always very greasy, unlike jojoba oil. I like how it comes in a dark glass bottle. The dropper is ok..it does come out of the dropper automatically without even having to squeeze it. It&#x27;s also nice to use this on your face since it isn&#x27;t greasy and has no scent. I&#x27;d definitely reccomend this product!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product.  while it has so many benefits it works amazing on stretch marks.  It is a must have for those who are looking to diminish the signs of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> As a busy mom of three I have become very aware of what I am using on my skin &amp; hair &amp; I find myself gravitating towards all natural products.  I was very excited to get this with a coupon.  It arrived very fast &amp; is a good size bottle.  It smells good &amp; I have been using it on my hair &amp; skin.  I also love mixing it with essential oils.  My hair is frizzy &amp; this is perfect to tame my frizz!  Great product!!!</li>
            <li> This Jojoba oil is amazingI I use it mixed with Young Living rosemary essential oil for my psoriasis and it soaks in immediately with no greasy feeling. I also use it to remove eye makeup. I have very sensitive skin around my eyes, and Art Naturals does not bother me in any way. I also use Art Naturals Jojoba Oil when I make body butter. I&#x27;m convinced it is what makes my body butter absorb quicker, and leave your skin silky soft.</li>
            <li> I loved this very much thank you for all you offer</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my husband and he loves it. It definitely makes his beard softer.</li>
            <li> I love this jojoba oil. I use it on my hair with few other oils as a leave in treatment and when I wash it out my hair shiny and silky and just gorgeous. If used often it definitely gonna change the life of your hair. Plus it&#x27;s great to use as a skin moisturizer</li>
            <li> Excellent oil. Perfect costumer service.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> I wanted to wait a bit before reviewing the product, to see how I like it. I&#x27;ve been using it as a skin (but mainly hair) moisturizer. Shipping was ridiculously fast, and the quality of this oil rivals the more expensive stuff. Already have a second bottle on the way :)</li>
            <li> I was able to review this product at a deeply discounted product. I have a few things to say about it. I would put it on my body as requested while my body wAS still wet. I like how soft it made my ankles feel, and I loved the feeling all over however it is a possibility of me being allergic to it because I broke out in a horrible rash and kept trying different products on my legs to take care of that! It would clear a little then I would apply it again. ( I had no idea it was coming from the oil!) I stopped usng it a bit and kept using medication on my rash and now almost 2 weeks later it is almost gone. So it could be that I am allergic but I dont know if it is going to happen to someone else but if you break out in a rash dont assume it is something else stop use immediately because there must be some kind of ingredient in it, its a shame i cant use it because my skin gets extremely dry :(</li>
            <li> This is a large bottle of high quality jojoba oil.  I have acne prone skin and this works like a dream on my skin.  It moisturizes very well.  It absorbs very quickly.  I can throw away all those expensive moisturizers now that I have this.  I am a very satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> I decided to try Jojoba Oil as a once a week treatment, but have ended up using it every night for the last couple of months.  My skin is pretty sensitive but it seems to love this oil, and my skin looks really great in the morning. I just splash my face with water in the morning, put on a bit of makeup and go.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> Got this more for my wife than myself. While I could use it when shaving, it is more a moisturizer / cleanser for a female. She&#x27;s tried it to remove makeup, as a facial cleanser, and skin/body moisturizer. So far, so good and it does the job well. The dropper helps you to control how much you use. You don&#x27;t want to use too much. The 4 oz. seems to go a long way so far. We&#x27;re not counting usages, but it should last for some time unless it gets used in even more ways. Do not ingest to help with childbirth.  Received at a promotional price to try out and review.</li>
            <li> This organic jojoba oil is fantastic, I did order it through a special deal to try it and share my unbiased opinion. This is a very good oil in my opinion, there are many uses for jojoba oil , but my two favorite ones are as a make up remover and for my scalp. This is a large size bottle and will last you for a while, it also comes with a dropper so there is no mess when using it. It does make my skin super soft and I am looking forward to see more results with my hair that has been falling, Jojoba is very emollient so I already notice less dandruff as well. I do recommend it.</li>
            <li> The extra long dropper is amazing.  The product is allegedly made in Israel and seems of good quality.  I&#x27;ve used it all over my body, face and dry feet.  Mix with some of your favorite lotion/facial moisturizer and you will feel very relieved of dryness that you may have.  A little goes a long way and the bottle is very large.  I wouldn&#x27;t use too much on my face because it is an oil but I do blend it in with my moisturizer at night a couple times a week.  Love it.  Keeping the bottle after it is done for sure.  Love that dropper!!!</li>
            <li> Came with a broke dropper which is the only reason I bought this one...</li>
            <li> Great product excellent shipping time&lt;br /&gt;Works exactly as stated</li>
            <li> I love this product since I have tried it from my friend, I had a very bad dry skin even in summer and I have got an amazing result in my skin in about few days after using this product. Must have product always.</li>
            <li> Oh my goodness! How did I miss out on the wonderful-ness of Jojoba oil on my skin! It is my morning and evening moisturizer now and there is an amazing difference in my skin. I can&#x27;t believe it. I&#x27;m a big advocate of using coconut oil for so many things, but this is my new face and neck conditioner. Love it.</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil for essential oils.  It works as an after bath moisturizer and keeps skin smooth</li>
            <li> I ordered this as a gift for a friend. She was quite happy with it. When I asked her what it was for she said that she uses it mainly for removing makeup around her eyes. She likes that it&#x27;s all natural and doesn&#x27;t have fumes that irritates her eyes like rubbing alcohol does. She also likes that it locks in moisture helping to keep the skin smooth around her eyes. She says one feature she likes is the eye dropper so that it is easier to put a few drops on a cotton ball so that it will last longer than trying to pour it on.</li>
            <li> Great for hair or skin, leaves it feeling really soft.  Good quality jojoba oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use more natural products so I was thrilled to find this jojoba oil.  I originally purchased it as a body oil but I discovered it was great for my chapped lips, too.  I was eating/drinking a lot so I had to apply it often, but my lips were better after one weekend versus a week of steady &amp;#34;chap stick&amp;#34;.  As a body oil it keeps my skin soft all day.  A little goes a long way!  I just love it that it&#x27;s pure and has many uses and works!!!</li>
            <li> This oil is light and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent. I apply this oil on my hair, skin and cuticles once or twice a week to keep my skin moisturized and it restores moisture and strengthens my dry damage hair this oil gets absorbed into the skin and hair very quickly my skin and hair don&#x27;t feel greasy afterwards but if you apply too much it will look and feel oily. I sometimes mix a small amount of sea salt with a couple drops of jojoba oil to make a lip or body scrub this is great for those who have somewhat sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use sea salt alone because it&#x27;s too harsh on their skin.</li>
            <li> Really enjoy this jojoba oil!</li>
            <li> So I bought this to reap the benefits of what I have heard all about. 1st I used it to remove my make up. It did excellent! Just add a small drop to a cottonball and wipe away ( besure to rinse your face afterwards to rid the oil). 2. I used a few drops to my scalp and rubbed it in and let it sit for a few min, I rinsed it out ( which took a little bit) and my hair and scalp were so soft! My scalp gets dried out from the hair dryer and hairspray I use. #. I applied a small amount after I shaved my legs, they are so soft and sleek! This is a womens best kept secret!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. Been using a little over a month and i see a great difference. My face is clearer and my skin is soft. Its cleared most of the dark spot off my neck and chest. And it absorbs into the skin really well. Already placed my 2nd order. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> I know packaging should never be considered because it seems so flippant.  But I really loved the packaging!!!!  Regarding the product, I didn&#x27;t notice any smell which is great if you are using it in combination with other oils.  Will repurchase when I finish the current bottle.</li>
            <li> Good oil, but the dropper leaks all over, and the bottle doesn&#x27;t seal properly.</li>
            <li> Great quality and value. Very happy w/ my purchase.</li>
            <li> So far so good as with all skin products will have to check back if anything changes. Helps moisturize face very well and it feels great all day! Adds a small amount of shine which isn&#x27;t too terrible and can be mixed in easily into moisturizer to help spread evenly. A huge amount that I&#x27;m not sure I can use all of it since I only need a few drops but more is better I hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also helps hair frizz and puffiness, just mix into a wet palm to spread around and mix into hair and the frizz is gone! these oils serve so many great purposes hopefully I won&#x27;t have any breakouts or anything but so far great. Received product at discount for review!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also can be used as a fungicide/pesticide in your garden at &amp;#60;1% jojoba and some organic soap!</li>
            <li> I love jojoba oil! It&#x27;s so versatile. I also love that this bottle has suggestions on the bottle for use.</li>
            <li> Very nice oil. Less expensive than another brand I bought, but I can&#x27;t tell the difference between the two in a blind test.  I&#x27;ll save my money from now on.  This oil is great in all of my skin and hair essential oil blends. It blends nicely and doesn&#x27;t leave a terribly oily residue.</li>
            <li> I like the product so much that I have already made a second purchase, for my mom. I use it as a hair oil (a bit goes a LONG way), and as a carrier oil for essential oil applications. The dropper holds the product well without leaking as you take it to application sight. As a hair oil it has diminished frizz, and works as a heat protector. When I wear my hair curly it helps to define the curls and I need minimal other product (some days I need none). Great product!</li>
            <li> By far one of my favorite Jojoba oils I have had the pleasure to review. This product had no smell and absorbed into the skin quickly. This left my hair and skin feeling great and moisturized. The bottle was a really nice size and even came with a glass dropper for easy application. I keep this with me at all times to apply to my hands whenever they feel dry. I even got one of my coworkers hooked on this so much that she&#x27;s ordering her own bottle. Overall this is a great high quality oil that I&#x27;ve already recommended to friends and coworkers already!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product at a promotional price for product review purposes. All opinions are my own and reflect my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Awesome. Love that it came with two caps.</li>
            <li> This is the real deal, very nice oil.</li>
            <li> Great product. Nice bottle, makes it very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Has a slight scent that I am unused to, but the color and texture are beautiful. Shipping was prompt and packaged well.</li>
            <li> Excellent, great quality!</li>
            <li> I always looked for jojoba oil in my hair and beauty products so I was happy to be able to include it in my homemade lotions.  I use it with almond oil in my nightly beauty routine, and I enjoy the way my face feels in the morning.  I also added a few drops to my body lotion.  I enjoy using this product.</li>
            <li> This is a great Jojoba oil, very high quality! I use this oil for everything! And with it being such high quality and don&#x27;t have to use as much which is even better!</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil has many uses. It helps acne prone skin by balancing out sebum and not clogging pores. It&#x27;s useful in treating sumburns. My favorite use is for treating chapped lips. Jojoba oil acts as an emollient, making my lips soft and not dry and cracked. Apply a drop or two on your finger and rub in. Your lips will thank you.&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I was offered this product at a promotional price to share my honest opinion.</li>
            <li> I have light, sensitive skin that is prone to dryness.  Jojoba oil has been an excellent moisturizer, especially since my skin absorbs it easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How I use it:&lt;br /&gt;1) I put it in my hair, on my hands, and on my feet and cover them all with a turban, gloves, and socks.  The bottle has a dropper which is very convenient, as it helps when I distribute the oil through my hair and over my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;2)  I use it to clean my face every night, and remove makeup.  It&#x27;s light and absorbs easily, and it doesn&#x27;t seep into my eyes.  I also use a facial microdermabrasion device with it, which works well.  It helps remove the redness in the corners of my nose.&lt;br /&gt;3) As an overall moisturizer wherever needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is wonderful to mix with essential oils I also use on my face as is</li>
            <li> This Jojoba oil from Art Naturals is a really high quality oil! I did have a small problem with my order, and Art Naturals fixed it RIGHT AWAY! They have great customer service and I am very happy with my purchase from them. You will not be disappointed if you buy this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price point is great for the size..which is 4 OZ! You only get half the size for a lot more money from other brands!!!&lt;br /&gt;This dries quickly and soaks in to skin really well! It&#x27;s even great to replace your face moisturizer with because it doesn&#x27;t weigh down your skin or clog your pores!&lt;br /&gt;I love using this as a carrier oil with my essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Also, i use it on my hair, and my hair has never been so soft in my whole life! I tried Argan oil on my hair and it always made it way too greasy! When i put this Jojoba oil on my hair it makes it silky and smooth and detangles it so well!&lt;br /&gt;This has no scent which i like and appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a really nice, high quality oil for a awesome price and you will NOT be disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great. Just what I needed.</li>
            <li> oh i love this oil so much.. very useful ..</li>
            <li> I used this oil as I have used coconut oil. It is fragrance free, so it doesn&#x27;t compete with other oils I mix it with, and it is fast absorbing, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about greasiness when used on my skin.  Discounted sample provided for review.</li>
            <li> I basically use oil for facial cleansing instead of soaps or cleansers and I have a collection of various oils. Jojoba is a staple oil for me.  Art Naturals is the best jojoba oil I have used by far.  It absorbs well, leaves skin smooth and refined and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a high shine like others I have tried. Wonderful oil!</li>
            <li> Good product, can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> Quality of esta product is excellent, it has worked in the hair, and face Beautifully , came fast , watch out well, would buy</li>
            <li> This is good stuff. I use it on my face my hair my body. Smell is just right. Love the control of the dripper only as much as you need.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I normally order from Oil essentials and the price is ridiculus. I found out that this oil works the same and its way cheaper. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Great product,will purchase again</li>
            <li> Boring and ineffective.  Not a deep golden color. Next time I&#x27;m making sure I get the jojoba oil from USA, not Israel!</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil and addition to lotions.</li>
            <li> Received for reviewing purposes the health benefits of natural oils like coconut oil, argan oil have been evident for quite some time and Jojoba seems to be an oil that&#x27;s currently overtaking some of the most respectable oils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extracted from the seed of the jojoba plant in the south west of America and this product is presented in a 120mL dropper pipette glass bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a transparent light gold in colour and the thickness is consistent with other well know oils like Virgin olive oil and argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s organic, unrefined and has been processed at lower temperates which ensures that it&#x27;s vitamins are not damaged and it also contains a number of minerals (not affected by heat treatment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very mild oily scent and once applied to the skin has a natural moisturising affect which blends in well with the skin restoring natural oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this to have a beneficial effect on my hair, scalp, skin, body, face and lips and I did not experience any undesirable side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order for you to make the most of the product its recommended to follow the manufacturers instructions which are well documented on the side of the bottle in an easy to read way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is certainly a good option for someone who wants to go the natural route, especially if you have skin problems when using non natural products.</li>
            <li> This jojoba oil is the real deal! I use it in my hair products and my hair is flourishing! I couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
            <li> Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I use it for my hair/ mixing with Shampoo&#x27;s and&lt;br /&gt;conditioner/, my skin by adding it to my body&lt;br /&gt;lotions, as well to my face , by using with my&lt;br /&gt;face creams together.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very dry and after few weeks I can&lt;br /&gt;see is much better, as well as my hair is more&lt;br /&gt;soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> This AMAZING oil has SO many uses, I don&#x27;t know where to start!! It heals dry skin, even the DRIEST, cracked-dry skin, it heals stretch marks and wrinkles, it can be used as a facial cleanser (and leave your skin SO SMOOTH and MOISTURIZED), damaged hair mender, lip moisturizer, I could go on FOREVER.. I HIGHLY recommend this to EVERYONE! Why? Because EVERYONE can find a use for it!! TWO THUMBS UP!!!!</li>
            <li> Great oil to help the skin heal or moisturizer it</li>
            <li> I have used Jojoba oil previously on my hair. But in researching it, I found that it is good on scars and great on skin. I recently had surgery and I have been using it on my incision. It is amazing!!! My incision is healing and its not drying out. It is also minimizing the scar. I mix it with grapeseed oil and olive oil to use on my hair daily. Its not heavy so it doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I highly recommend it and will definitely order more. I received this at a promotional discount for an honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Comes on-time. Beautiful golden honey color. I use it on my face and my hair. I clean my face with this. I apply the oil on my face with cotton rounds or balls then I rinse off with water. I can definitely see a difference. I am almost done with my second bottle and will be ordering a third. I wake up in the morning and look in the mirror and it looks as if I had never been to sleep. Usually when I woke up in the am before purchasing the oil my skin would look a little tired. That has changed. I recommend for mixed individuals as well as black individuals. I am mixed myself. I&#x27;ve been using the oil about a month and a few days.</li>
            <li> This product arrived on time and intact. I first love that it is in a glass bottle and the dropped included is perfect! It is incredibly moisturizing and ideal if you want to make your own face or body oil creations. I&#x27;ll be mixing mine with a few other oils as well as essential oils. Excellent product and would definitely recommend!</li>
            <li> This Jojoba oil is just what I needed to make homemade gnat and mosquito spray!</li>
            <li> Best natural moisturizer I&#x27;ve found. Absorbs quickly with no strong smell or greasy feel unlike coconut oil.  Also, the customer service with this company is amazing. I will definitely be ordering from them again.</li>
            <li> I am an avid essential oil user and I normally use coconut oil as a base for my oils but have found it can tend to dry my skin out a little, so I was looking to try some jojoba oil as a base instead.  I am very cautious with what I put on skin and I loved that Art Naturals jojoba oils was 100% organic and didn&#x27;t contain any bad filler oils like mineral oil.  I received my oil 2 days after ordering in perfect condition in a sealed box.  wWell let me now say this is definitely my new go-to oil. It works great with my essential oils as well as by itself.  It goes on great and feels awesome too. Love that it doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin either.  I can tell this bottle won&#x27;t last long in my house so I will be back for more!</li>
            <li> Great Product, Makes my face feel wonderful, I was glad I purchased this product I will be getting more for gifts as well!!</li>
            <li> Started using for skincare.  Jojoba &amp; essential oils plus Rosehip - results within day - skin is smoother, pores are smaller and I can use it during the day because it absorbs so quickly and completely.  Love this oil!&lt;br /&gt;I put about two drops (3 drops @ night) on damp hands, distribute, then apply to moist face.  It&#x27;s organic and goes a long way - will never buy regular lotions again!</li>
            <li> It has a great price for the size. No strong smell so it can be added to anything and won&#x27;t mess up the smell, the consistency is nice not thick and gummy, yet thicker then water.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and I love the Product!&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is pretty large and the dropper is made sturdy.&lt;br /&gt;It is scentless, what I like, because I mainly use it as a carrier oil, as a base to make my own cuticle oil, and my customers are loving it!&lt;br /&gt;My daughter uses it to treat her teenage acne and it is part of our hair regime.&lt;br /&gt;I got a new tattoo about a week ago, and applying the oil to the healing skin keeps it moisturized, but not greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy again and I can only recommend product and vendor!</li>
            <li> Wonderful...my skin is clearer already!</li>
            <li> I must admit, i was a lil worried but to my surprise this product is amazing. The smell was great and I really enjoyed using this in my hair. I also added a few drops to my sons coconut butter and it was great. He has eczema and this oil really helped his skin. I hope you try the product, you will thank me later!</li>
            <li> My skin already feels softer. I mix with grapeseed oil and coconut oil and use rosewater and glycerin spray to finish. My skin feels amazing and glows.</li>
            <li> So far so good haven&#x27;t used long enough to see the benefits but fast shipping and feels great on my skin.</li>
            <li> Super size! I love this oil for my skin AND my hair. Makes everything super soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I love to mix this with my regular unscented lotion to help give me some extra moisturizing benefits.  It mixes really well and also does great on it&#x27;s own!  I have been &amp;#34;treating&amp;#34; my stretch marks as well. It does feel a little greasy to me on its own which is why I mix it. So many wonderful uses for this oil. I can&#x27;t wait to try a few more. Any recommendations?</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Has made my hair silky smooth and less static!  Has also help my daughter&#x27;s hands, they were peeling a lot.  This will be something we continue to buy!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful oil. I use it to make a peppermint leave in conditioner. It leaves my hair so healthy and shiny. Say goodbye to fly aways! If you&#x27;re looking for a natural way to tame your hair I highly suggest this oil.</li>
            <li> Love the Jojoba oil!!  It works well on dry skin areas!!!</li>
            <li> I love essential oils and have started using them to help with skin issues that my daughter has. Her skin is very sensitive and since I can&#x27;t use a lot of lotions from the store, I thought about using essential oils instead. I have heard about jojoba oil and it&#x27;s many uses for the body. So when I was offered this Jojoba Oil from Art Naturals for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a bottle. I have been using it for about a week now on her skin and on my lips. In just that amount of time, my lips are smoother than they have ever been and my daughter&#x27;s skin is holding moisture and is definitely looking better. I highly recommend this Jojoba Oil from Art Naturals for anyone who wants to take care of their skin!</li>
            <li> I use jojoba oil often.  This is the best I have used.  I was given a discount to test it and give my honest opinion.  I will continue to purchase this oil at full price.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> Love it and easy to use with the dropper</li>
            <li> Love this and the company who sent it.</li>
            <li> I love this Jojoba oil!  I got it at a really great price and it s such a big bottle. I had to take pictures. It&#x27;s a really goo value for your money.</li>
            <li> I get massages on a regular basis for my health. Once I received the Jojoba oil, I took it to my massage therapist, who incidentally is a medical sports massage therapist, not a &amp;#34;feel good&amp;#34; massage therapist. I asked her to use the oil while massaging me. She read everything on the bottle, and stated that it seemed to be quality oil. She used it to massage me and it smelled really nice. BTW- she uses coconut oil as a carrier oil. We both agreed that this is quality oil~</li>
            <li> i am pregnant and been using baby oil for my belly so i wont get stretch mark, then my friend told me this one is the best and i tried it well yeah its more lubricated and like the smell..</li>
            <li> This is a high quality jojoba oil and worth the price!</li>
            <li> This company sells diluted oils. Do not recommend. They claim to be organic, but there is no &amp;#34; organic certified&amp;#34; sign on the label. All oils same very pale color.</li>
            <li> I guess it&#x27;s good. I haven&#x27;t used jojoba before so i can&#x27;t really compare it to anything but it seems fine. It doesn&#x27;t leak and the dropper is very handy. A little goes a long way -- this bottle will last me years probably</li>
            <li> Been using Art Naturals Organic Pure Virgin Jojoba oil for little over two weeks. Very exceptional quality of virgin pure Jojoba oil: from how its manufactured to delivery. True consistency, faint coloring and smell natural to the Jojoba plant, tree. Not unpleasant to this smell sensitive gal. The company would greatly benefit customers, by also seal protecting the lip of bottle before cap stealing. ALSO, by supplying a better grade pharmaceutical dropper, given the products superior grade. Art Naturals has awesome customer service personnel who immediately addresses and remedy customer concerns. I HIGHLY RECOMMENDED their Jojoba Oil and love using (very sparingly) it for my skin and hair. As oils tend to clog pores and cause terrible acne breakout, I combine them with refracted coconut oil prior to using on my face. Jojoba is a thicker oil and while more natural to the oils produced by our bodies, its thickness can clog pores. It did cause me to breakout after initial use. Immediately remedied by adding organic aloe vera gel to assist with healing and preventing further breakout. First used the aloe vera gel to rid whiteheads and or acne, then included it with the jojoba and coconut oil skin product I made, and continued using to this date. For me (combination skin), this turned out to be a great morning and before bed moisturizer. Aloe also protects skin from sunburn, so not problematic for me to use and wear under makeup. As a further note: Not everyone will breakout from use of oils to face. BUT, it can happen and is not unusual regardless of brand. Should any oil cause severe and ongoing acne breakouts, stop using immediately and seek assistance from your doctor or Dermatologist to alleviate. Best wishes for all.</li>
            <li> I love the oil. It absorbs quickly, non greasy, and it left my hair very soft. I&#x27;ll recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Not too sure about this.  It definitely listens the scalp but now I have severe scalp acne.  I&#x27;ve NEVER had pimples on my head but after a few weeks of using this now I do.</li>
            <li> Really love the packaging, the dropper bottle makes it easy to use</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is well known for its moisturizing and restoration effects.  I decided to try this product from Art Naturals and am very pleased with the quality of this product.  Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> Really like the packaging. Great product, very silky oil. Love jojoba!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m new to jojoba oil, but I have to say I positively love it so very much! My boyfriend and I use it as a massage oil and I must say it serves that purpose amazingly! It leaves my skin feeling amazingly soft without a greasy or oily sensation. I haven&#x27;t experimented with too many other uses just yet but this oil feels incredibly pure and natural which makes me feel this oil is of a very high quality!</li>
            <li> There is no expiration date on the bottle that I received.  However, it looks/smells okay, so I have started using it.</li>
            <li> I really like this it&#x27;s not too greasy  I use it for my hair face and hands. Will buy this again.</li>
            <li> I use this to make my own whipped mango butter for my hair and skin I really love it.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product. I use it on my lips to moisturizer while I apply my makeup. By the time I am ready for lipstick, it goes on smoothly. I also use droplets in my thick hair to help tame and moisturize. Great product.</li>
            <li> This stuff works! My husband has acne on his back and we have tried everything! This has started clearing his back acne up. Natural  oils and remedies are the way to go!!!!</li>
            <li> Love that it has a dropper!&lt;br /&gt;My skin really responds to jojoba&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for a long time&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m currently using it to prevent stretch marks on my Prego belly&lt;br /&gt;No strong smell&lt;br /&gt;No super oily residue&lt;br /&gt;Very close chemical structure to human sebum</li>
            <li> I originally  bought this for my blackheads. I had previously used another brand of jojoba oil that helped dissolve the blackheads on my nose. When I started using this, there wasn&#x27;t much of a difference in my blackheads. It&#x27;s fabulous for hair though, which is what I am using it for now.</li>
            <li> I saw no improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> This is an amazing product! Not only is it all natural and organic, but it does so many things! It keeps skin soft, smooth, and moisturized, helps keep you acne free, reduces stretch marks, keeps hair frizz free and conditions hair and scalp and MORE. It feels so good on my skin and isn&#x27;t sticky. It leaves no residue and soaks into the skin quickly. I plan on using this a whole lot. I am very impressed! I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> Conditions my long beard as well as other jojoba and beard oils I&#x27;ve used. Has little to no scent, which is fine for most situations.</li>
            <li> Great product!! Doesn&#x27;t really have a smell so great for hair &amp; skin use without a weird smell!</li>
            <li> Loved it.. Looking forward to purchasing some more 😊</li>
            <li> A great moisturizer for skin! I put it on before bed on my face and my skin has never been so soft. Would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I love it. This is the only oil that I think is working with my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I was able to get this product discounted for a review.&lt;br /&gt;I really get excited when the products are oils or essential oils. Jojoba oil is good for several things. The main thing I like to use It for is as a carrier oil. I like to mix it with different essential oils. I also like to use it as a face moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face over oily and it blends well after I put my makeup on.</li>
            <li> Jojoba oil is one of my favorite natural moisturizers, so I was thrilled to find this company offering such a generous amount at such a reasonable price. This would retail in many other places for over $50. I like that this oil comes with an eye dropper top since it allows you dispense just the right amount for the job. A little bit goes a long way. Jojoba is the closest oil out there to our own body oil, so the body soaks it up and it makes your skin feel naturally soft without feeling greasy so long as you use just a small amount per application. This product is definitely worth trying if you want something both natural and effective for moisturizing anywhere on the body.</li>
            <li> I love this jojoba oil!  Not too greasy - great as a moisturizer or to use as a carrier with essential oils!  It&#x27;s a great value for your money - the bottle will last a long time!</li>
            <li> I use this for all of its uses. I love adding it to my shampoo and making my hair silks smooth. I love that i can add it to my body wash to my skin soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom everywhere. When I use all of this I will most definitely be buying another bottle. This is the best thing to add to your normal daily routine!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have received this product for a non biased review.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!! I put a tiny drop on my hands then rub it on my hair and it leaves is very silky! Also great skin moisturizer!:)</li>
            <li> We love essential oils. We use essential oils daily and this is another great one that we have. We use it on our dry hands and feet. It&#x27;s been a rough winter and were in need of some good quality oil.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is HUGE and we&#x27;re going through it quickly. The dropper is an excellent way to get the oil out of the bottle, rather than pouring it out and making a mess. The oil absorbs well and isn&#x27;t all messy. We recommend​ this oil.</li>
            <li> I got this ptoduct on a good discounted price and i am really thankful that i got to try this stuff. Made my skin soft and smooth. Love this jojoba oil. It has really improved my skin and made it more supple. I also use this oil as a lotion on my body and it has made my skin very soft. Dry patches on my skin has vanished completely and i am really happy about that. Highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> I got this item for testing and review purposes, and this is actually my first time using the jojoba oil.I have heard that yhis is good for the skin and so i thought I would try some. So please bear in mind that this is just an initial  review and will follpw up or complete  my review after i have used it for an amount of time enough for me to attest how great this brand could be. For now I could say that the oil is not greasy and it seems like it is moisturizing my skin good, I try to put this after taking a shower wherein I am not completely dry up.Heard it is best to do that then after I used it I do follow up on lotion which seema to be helping  in maintining the moisture.so far the jojoba oil works good for me, will let you know how mucb more i like it and how it works more later in on my final review.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, item as described, great price</li>
            <li> I love this Jojoba oil  It&#x27;s great, by itself as a super-intense moisturizer.  I use it too, as a carrier for essential oils.  It does not leave my skin feeling greasy or sticky.  It&#x27;s has a light, but pleasant scent.  Great quality.  Thanks!!</li>
            <li> Jojoba Oil is one of the best carrier oils in the market. It has many different uses such as using it on your hair to give it a strong, healthy look, to applying it to dry and dull skin. It&#x27;s also wonderful on nails and cuticles. Buff your nails, then apply a few drops of joboba oil, paying close attention to the cuticles. You will see a significant difference in your nail&#x27;s appearance, saving you time and money from the nail salon. This 4 oz bottle of Jojoba Oil goes a long ways. Just a couple of drops is all that is needed. I purchased this bottle at a promotional value to product test. My review is based on my own experience and opinion of the product.</li>
            <li> I love this oil its light and it seals the moisture in my hair wonderfully, I have not really tried it on my skin yet but if it&#x27;s anything like the results I got with my hair I will be a happy camper.</li>
            <li> this really works on dry skin when I get out of the shower I put it on with my skin still damp</li>
            <li> Great, pure product in a nicely made bottle!</li>
            <li> Works good i mix mine with aloe</li>
            <li> Love it. Exactly as pictured. I love the designs on the bottle. It&#x27;s clear that it&#x27;s new. And I had no idea that it was Vegan, which is even more of a plus. :)</li>
            <li> It took longer than I expected for this to arrive, but when it did I was very happy with this product. This is a beautifully packaged bottle of top quality pure Jojoba Oil, the uses are endless. I particularly love this for my cuticles, dry skin and dry hair. I love these results!</li>
            <li> This jojoba oil is very moisturizing great on hair i love it. i also like that it has a dropper top</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and its great for my essential oils and for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have used many carrier oils before, but I think this jojoba oil is my new favorite.  It is easy to mix with my essential oils and leaves my skin feeling moisturized but not oily.  I would highly recommend this jojoba oil to anyone looking for a pure natural oil that leaves your skin feeling smooth.  I received this jojoba oil as part of a promotion and will defenately be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> I love this Jojoba oil! Jojoba oil has so many uses but my favorite way to use this oil is right after I get out of the shower as a skin moisturizer.  It leaves my skin feeling silky and smooth, without feeling oily because it absorbs into my skin very quickly.  I also love to use this to remove my stubborn waterproof mascara.  I just dab a little on a cotton ball and it takes the mascara off effortlessly and naturally without leaving my face feeling oily.  I was provided this product for Free for review purposes. I highly recommend this Jojoba oil from Art Naturals!</li>
            <li> My skin loves this oil! It feels very silky and light. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Works great in the body scrub I make.</li>
            <li> I honestly love this product, Iused it after y shower and it kept my legs moist and there was no oily film .I liked that it did not stain my pants even more my husband tried it on his face after shaving and loves it. We now fight over it.I received this as complimentary for honest unbiased opinion.</li>
            <li> Received in two days, well packaged and wrapped in bubble wrap very tight. This bottle is so sturdy I accidentally dropped it out of the package and it didn&#x27;t break. I got this with intent to diffuse but after reading the uses I decided I would benefit much more with applying to my skin directly. I had a massage scheduled with my good friend so I took my Jojoba Oil for her to do the massage with this oil! It was great and not oily. I am planning on using this to remove my makeup nightly also. The smell is great so light and refreshing, easy to smell. Convenient dropper provides just the right amount needed. I was able to buy this product during a promotion and am happy to share my experience with it.</li>
            <li> Received a discount on this bottle of Jojoba oil for the purposes of review, but would definitely buy again from this seller at full price.  Generous 4 ounce bottle of high quality Jojoba oil that makes a great lightweight moisturizer or carrier oil for essential oils.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t think this oil helps with hair loss but it definitely good for making the hair look smooth and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;Apply on damp hair and this works awesome..</li>
            <li> Not smelly like some cheaper brands. Skin feels soft! But I think it broke me out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**The separate dropper was broken when it got here which is disappointing.</li>
            <li> Great product, will purchase again...</li>
            <li> Because of all the raving reviews I bought several bottles of Jojoba oil. I bought different brands. Not sure why people love it so much can see no real difference using it at all.</li>
            <li> This Jojoba oil is one of the best treatment for dry skin,My husband is always using the coconut oil for his skin but i dont like the smell so i found this and tried it as this one doesnt have odor,and yes theres no scent at all.He uses this  everyday after taking a shower and it works really great and soften his skin and no more itching.He loves using this as it is an organic and all ingredients are natural which is safe to used.&lt;br /&gt;Im looking forward of buying more in the future and i would lovely recommend this to my friends and family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this for testing in review purposes.</li>
            <li> convienent dropper. this lasted me longer than I thought. very light and moisturize feeling like it&#x27;s not even there. very light on my hair also does not dampen. put this in your deep conditioner and it&#x27;s even better for your hair.</li>
            <li> I like that the JOJOBA OIL is 100% pure, virgin, organic and  cold pressed. I used it on my feet,face and hands after a shower. It absorbs quickly and is odor free.The next morning my skin felt soft and wonderful.I feel privileged to have selected this product to give a review.</li>
            <li> Great oil...leaves my skin soft and smooth...absorbs quickly with no mess! Will buy this product again!</li>
            <li> This Jajoba Organi oil is 100% organic from artnaturals,what i like on this oil is you can apply it on your  frizzy hair and scalp, its perfect for me becuase i have a frizz hair and  messy hair,just apply a small amount of jajoba oil onto your scalp and you fell that the dryness relieve.It is also good to use on your body immediately after bath, this can heal you cracked dry skin, i even tried mine i have a dry skin too its perfectly work..i was amazed the result.I also used this on my face and lips, just squeeze a few drops onto a cotton balls and apply to face rinse with warm water after, i also use jajoba on my lips when it gets dry..Especially ill be saving for some of this for winter time, this can help a lot, i highly recommend this.The bottle content is big like 120 ml  so its a long way to go.I got this free item for testing and review purposes.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I love this oil!! Jojoba is one of my favorite oils and this one is no disappointment. It&#x27;s very moisturizing without being too heavy or oily. I use it to dilute essential oils. It absorbs nicely and I love the dropper!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny. I love it. i did receive this product for a review.</li>
            <li> I love this product i use it on my two year old daughter after a shower</li>
            <li> This keeps your skin very soft. Only have to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> LOVE this!!!  Used in a face serum and lovely and light, absorbed nicely and no breakouts!!!</li>
            <li> After reading the benefits of jojoba oil, I wanted to try it.  I use this oil on my hair, face, add to my skin lotion, shampoo, conditioner and any hair products.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Thought I ordered a bigger bottle. Kind of pricey for the size. Good quality otherwise.</li>
            <li> This had a weird smell to it.  I tried it on my face before bed and the next day I had little red bumps and clogged pores.  I am used to using organic jojoba oil on my face as this is the facial oil I have been using on my face prior to this one which has organic jojoba oil in it: [...]</li>
            <li> I need to find out more uses for this. Anxious to try it somemore.</li>
            <li> Great facial moisturizer for me.  I use it along with rose hip oil instead of lotion on my face twice a day.</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying jojoba oil. I wanted to try it on my horribly dry skin. But two weeks before I placed my order, I got bitten by a spider on my foot. My foot swelled to twice it&#x27;s size and even after it healed, the skin was dry and cracked worse than anything I have ever seen. I applied this oil twice a day for three days and my foot looks better than ever. We have used it on the skin and hair of every member of the family. My daughters summer school teacher sent a note home yesterday raving about how soft and shiny her hair is.  And the icing on the cake is, a friend recommended I add a few drops to my mop water. My tile has never been so shiny!</li>
            <li> I really like this jojoba oil. My skin on my arms, face, and legs are always so dry. I took a shower, dried off, then rubbed it on my arms, face, and legs. My body parts that I rubbed this on was no longer dry. I love that this product absorbs so quickly into my skin. I also like that this isn&#x27;t greasy or leaving a residue. I like that it doesn&#x27;t smell either. I&#x27;m looking forward to trying this on my hair also the next time I take a shower. I&#x27;m very impressed with this product. I love that is 100% pure virgin cold press and organic. I also like that this is pure and natural without any additives. My skin looks so beautiful and radiate after I use this. I recommend this to anyone that wants nice smooth skin after your shower. I like that this product is 100% satisfaction guaranteed.&lt;br /&gt;I got this product for free for giving my honest opinion, all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I use on my hair my skin uggh I just love this. Smells great. Big bottle. I mix with other oils and rose water and my hair is so soft. I even put on my dogs coat after washing and he looks so good. I did receive for review..</li>
            <li> I massage about 2 drops on each ear every night, it keeps them moisturized and helps them heal faster! Also works great as a lube for tapers/tunnels when moving up a size. They literally just slip in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also great for styling your hair when you don&#x27;t want to put product in it. Leaves it soft, shiny (not greasy) and manageable.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my essential oils!! :) this is a great deal!!</li>
            <li> Nice smooth feeling oil</li>
            <li> This really helped clear up the eczema on my face!</li>
            <li> We bought this as a base oil to mix with a lavender essential oil for a diffuser, and it&#x27;s simply the base oil we were expecting. Not very strong on its own, large in amount.</li>
            <li> I like this product to use with other moisturizers, it gives a little extra TLC to dry skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> its the first time i try jojoba oil, and i did most in my face, i have to say that im impressed with what it does to me, doesn&#x27;t has any smell so thats great, and its not oily like other type of oils i have tried, i wont stop buying it ever, maybe i will try other marks later just to keep checking and comparing, anyways this is an amazing oil</li>
            <li> I love this Jojoba oil! It&#x27;s made a huge difference in my face. I use it along with castor oil to wash my face &amp; it does a great job of dissolving the oils &amp; cleaning my face without stripping it. It&#x27;s definitely cleared up my minor blemishes &amp; blocked pores.</li>
            <li> Great value for jojoba oil!</li>
