            <li>I love it!!  </li>
            <li>I am really enjoying this &amp;#34;brightener&amp;#34;!!</li>
            <li>Perfect for under-eye bags, as a primer, and on top of cheekbones.</li>
            <li>This is the best form of highlight too, because it&#x27;s not powdery so you can place the shine precisely where you want it with no fall out!</li>
            <li>Smells great too :)</li>
            <li>I feel great about using a natural product on my face and the highlighter adds just the perfect amount of luminescence to my skin without making me look shiny or glittery</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Nice highlighter.</li>
            <li>on smooth&lt;br /&gt;Blends easily&lt;br /&gt;Has a Nice sheen for a &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li>Bright and light, love to use it for cheeks and eyes.</li>
            <li>This is another awesome product that is weightless, easy to apply, and natural.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Using the Bio Brightener Stick UNDER a setting powder though, washed out most of the effects of the highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the moonlike shimmer it gives.</li>
            <li>I love W3LL People&#x27;s products and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>My friend tried mine and is buying her own right now!</li>
            <li>Even if you are running out of the house with no other make-up on this is a perfect quick fix for a brighter look.</li>
            <li>I determined that this product works best when applied on top of foundation, and then using little to no setting powder on top.</li>
            <li>Armed with this information, the second time applying it was much more successful.</li>
            <li>My skin had full coverage and a light, dewy, sheen that I considered quite lovely when the light hit my cheekbones.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After that, I watched a w3ll people YouTube video on what parts of your face are best suited for the brightener, and I noticed how LITTLE of the product the girl used.</li>
            <li>Feels light on skin.</li>
            <li>It does not blend in very well, so while I did have a nice glow</li>
            <li>/&gt;Absolutely one of my new favorite things :)</li>
            <li>I really believe that all the W3LL People cosmetics are safe for my skin-</li>
            <li>But I really like the ingredients, and its a good natural highlighter option!</li>
            <li>My skin without anything on it actually feels better and looks better after using these products.</li>
            <li>It has multiple uses and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Honestly this was a great buy, I have normal skin, sometimes it&#x27;s dry, so this brightener helps me to achieve that natural Dewey finnish.  </li>
            <li>I am a BB cream/3-in-1 tinted moisturizer and mascara kind of lady and this product takes my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look to a whole new level.</li>
            <li>It smells great too, a little like peppermint.</li>
            <li>The shade is light enough to make for a lovely highlighter, and the amount of shimmer is spot-on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have near as many breakouts.</li>
            <li>-- it looks like my skin was freshly washed and moisturized</li>
            <li>It provides a nice subtle glow to the face and glides on nicely.</li>
            <li>It adds just the right amount of shimmer.</li>
            <li>It highlights in just the right places.</li>
            <li>I quick dab of the brightener in the corners of my eyes makes me look awake, and a swipe above the Cupid&#x27;s Bow of my upper lip, on my cheekbones, and along my brow bone serves as a great highlighter.</li>
            <li>The W3LL PEOPLE line is my absolute favorite for natural makeup.</li>
            <li>It gives a kind of dewy glow that is really flattering and acts like an instant pick-me-up.</li>
            <li>Since switching all my makeup to natural and organic products, I can see a huge difference in the quality of my complexion.</li>
            <li>I really liked the color: a cream colored nude, with hints of pink.</li>
            <li>This product works very well!</li>
            <li>I only wore concealer, foundation, and mascara before I bought and fell in love with a sample of this Bio Brightener.</li>
            <li>One stick is going to last me a long time, making this is a great value.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure how much I would actually use it when I bought it</li>
            <li>(all places that light would naturally hit for highlights) and it brightens up my whole complexion and makes me look awake and refreshed.</li>
            <li>I initially bought this just to apply along the underside of my eyebrows, but it comes with other great ideas for where to apply for a lift.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s no secret</li>
            <li>and they work really well with my acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Exceptionally fast customer service from Carbon Beauty.</li>
            <li>but this is a new staple for me!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this if you are looking for a product without all the chemicals</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I do wish it had a little more staying power though.</li>
            <li>It works great around the eye area to give just a little shimmer and covers dark</li>
            <li>The stick is a great size for the price (much bigger than a tube of lipstick) and a little goes a long way</li>
            <li>So, I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance and this extra make-up step is worth it, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, and this product doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation.</li>
            <li>It is very natural looking, without the glitter evening style look.  </li>
            <li>It never feels like you&#x27;re wearing makeup, yet enhances your natural beauty!</li>
            <li>It was long-wearing, and provided a natural glowy highlight for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>You can apply with your finger or a brush, but I wouldn&#x27;t apply it directly to my face because the diameter of the tube is about 1 inch.</li>
            <li>Does not look overdone but natural.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a product that will give your skin a youthful natural glow, this product is for you.  </li>
            <li>and you are looking for a natural look.  </li>
            <li>Like that it is a fragrance-free natural product.</li>
            <li>Not heavy, not oily.</li>
            <li>I like that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>TOTALLY OBSESSED with this gorgeous stick of perfection.</li>
            <li>The first time I used the bio brightener, I used it mainly around my under eyes because I thought it would help brighten my dark circles.</li>
            <li>This brightener is much better suited for subtle contouring around your temples, under your eyebrows, etc.</li>
            <li>cooler tone is a little too cool for my tan skin but not too noticeable.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>It was a radiance that is so subtle you can just as easily blot it on your cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin before applying your foundation</li>
            <li>As with most other natural beauty products I&#x27;ve tried, the key is a little bit of trial and error!</li>
            <li>After trying several other highlighters (Sephora, RMS, Boots) I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a versatile highlighter made with natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>would recommend this product, just be aware it can be a little finicky to apply.</li>

            <li> It has a very high sheen and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Blends well alone and with powders, haven&#x27;t had any issues with mixing it with any other makeup types so far</li>
            <li> Gives you a soft glow and only need a little bit...</li>

            <li> There&#x27;s no better way to achieve a natural glow.</li>
            <li> I use it on my cheek bones, on the interior corners of my eyes, down the bridge of my nose and a little on the center of my forehead</li>
            <li> anywhere else you want a little brighter.</li>
            <li> little sparkly&lt;br</li>
            <li> This brightener stick works wonders for my appearance, especially when I&#x27;m tired.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, my problem with this product is that it was a little hard to blend onto powdered skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly switching over all my makeup to W3ll People</li>
            <li> I like this product for adding a little glow, but it is very subtle, so it is a brightener not a highlighter.</li>
            <li> This was a bad purchase for me.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I&#x27;m slowly switching over all my makeup to W3ll People and I have to say this product does not disappoint. It is definitely a multi-functional stick. I use it on my cheeks, under eyes and eyelids. It adds just the right amount of shimmer. I do wish it had a little more staying power though.</li>
            <li> Love it! There&#x27;s no better way to achieve a natural glow. I have very sensitive skin, and this product doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation. It actually makes my skin feel healthier.</li>
            <li> This brightening stick is perfect for highlighting. Gives you a soft glow and only need a little bit...this stick will last forever. Came in a timely manner and was in perfect shape.</li>
            <li> I used this product to add highlighting to my face. I began my applying liquid foundation and a setting powder onto my face. I then took the Bio Brightener Stick and applied it to the tops of my cheekbones, my lower forehead (between my brows), and the bridge of my nose. I really liked the color: a cream colored nude, with hints of pink. The shade is light enough to make for a lovely highlighter, and the amount of shimmer is spot-on. Just enough sheen to make my face pop a bit, without looking overly sparkly or glittery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, my problem with this product is that it was a little hard to blend onto powdered skin. I expected the application to be a bit smoother, but the stick is quite solid and the stick tugged just a bit at my skin. The highlighter also accentuated any hint of dryness and made my face appear flaky in spots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the Bio Brightener Stick UNDER a setting powder though, washed out most of the effects of the highlighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I determined that this product works best when applied on top of foundation, and then using little to no setting powder on top. When used like this, the Bio Stick performed beautifully. It was long-wearing, and provided a natural glowy highlight for my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product, just be aware it can be a little finicky to apply. But I really like the ingredients, and its a good natural highlighter option!</li>
            <li> Illuminates skin without being glittery. Does crease a bit if used on eyelids but nothing a dusting of powder can&#x27;t set.</li>
            <li> I love the moonlike shimmer it gives. Perfect for under-eye bags, as a primer, and on top of cheekbones. Smells great too :)</li>
            <li> I had been using W3LL People&#x27;s multi-use color stick in shade #2 but decided to give their Bio Brightener stick a try. It&#x27;s no secret I love W3LL People&#x27;s products and this is no exception. I quick dab of the brightener in the corners of my eyes makes me look awake, and a swipe above the Cupid&#x27;s Bow of my upper lip, on my cheekbones, and along my brow bone serves as a great highlighter.</li>
            <li> I tried this both ways. Applying it underneath my foundation and applying it over my foundation. Applying it under my foundation provided the nicest results. My skin had full coverage and a light, dewy, sheen that I considered quite lovely when the light hit my cheekbones. It was a radiance that is so subtle you can just as easily blot it on your cheeks, forehead, nose, and chin before applying your foundation and it doesn&#x27;t look like you&#x27;ve caked on a highlighter. Looking forward to trying the bio brightener powder. Does anyone know if the cera alba in this is organic?</li>
            <li> This product works very well! It provides a nice subtle glow to the face and glides on nicely.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It highlights in just the right places. It goes on light and thin. Doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing makeup at all when it is on.</li>
            <li> This is a great highlighter! It has a very high sheen and a little bit goes a long way. I swear this tube will never run out. I&#x27;ve used it on my cheeks, nose, brow bone, and under my eyes. It&#x27;s very bright but not glittery. This is not a concealer, it is strictly a highlight. This is the best form of highlight too, because it&#x27;s not powdery so you can place the shine precisely where you want it with no fall out! You can apply with your finger or a brush, but I wouldn&#x27;t apply it directly to my face because the diameter of the tube is about 1 inch. Honestly this was a great buy, I have normal skin, sometimes it&#x27;s dry, so this brightener helps me to achieve that natural Dewey finnish.  It has multiple uses and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I really believe that all the W3LL People cosmetics are safe for my skin- and they work really well with my acne prone skin. Since switching all my makeup to natural and organic products, I can see a huge difference in the quality of my complexion. I don&#x27;t have near as many breakouts. Now, getting to the Bio Brightener! This is another awesome product that is weightless, easy to apply, and natural. It never feels like you&#x27;re wearing makeup, yet enhances your natural beauty! The Bio Brightener is not too sparkly or shiny (and I have oily skin) and it&#x27;s just enough to give me some GLOW.</li>
            <li> Nice highlighter. Does not look overdone but natural. Wears well and does not have to be put on multiple times. Feels light on skin. My skin without anything on it actually feels better and looks better after using these products.</li>
            <li> This was a bad purchase for me. I was looking for something a couple of shades lighter than my skin tone to illuminate and I thought this would be it, but is way to shiny, so if you have oily skin like me this is definitively not for you, I will not buy this again, and probably just use this here and there under my eyes only, trying to somehow use what I bought so I don&#x27;t throw it away.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this!! I wasn&#x27;t sure how much I would actually use it when I bought it but this is a new staple for me! It&#x27;s not greasy at all and not too shiny either. I have used it on my eyes, cheeks, and anywhere else you want a little brighter. My friend tried mine and is buying her own right now!</li>
            <li> Exceptionally fast customer service from Carbon Beauty. The W3LL PEOPLE line is my absolute favorite for natural makeup. The bio brightener stick is the perfect highlighter and gives my skin a healthy, dewy glow! I love, love, love this product!</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a product that will give your skin a youthful natural glow, this product is for you.  I apply it underneath my power bronzer along my cheekbones. I love it!!  It is very natural looking, without the glitter evening style look.  I highly recommend this if you are looking for a product without all the chemicals and you are looking for a natural look.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The first time I used the bio brightener, I used it mainly around my under eyes because I thought it would help brighten my dark circles. It does not blend in very well, so while I did have a nice glow, I felt overly oily/shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After that, I watched a w3ll people YouTube video on what parts of your face are best suited for the brightener, and I noticed how LITTLE of the product the girl used. Armed with this information, the second time applying it was much more successful. This brightener is much better suited for subtle contouring around your temples, under your eyebrows, etc. and not as an all over highlighter. As with most other natural beauty products I&#x27;ve tried, the key is a little bit of trial and error!</li>
            <li> Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;Goes on smooth&lt;br /&gt;Blends easily&lt;br /&gt;Has a Nice sheen for a &amp;#34;glowy&amp;#34; look&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;A little sparkly&lt;br /&gt;The cooler tone is a little too cool for my tan skin but not too noticeable.</li>
            <li> I like this product for adding a little glow, but it is very subtle, so it is a brightener not a highlighter. Like that it is a fragrance-free natural product.</li>
            <li> I am really enjoying this &amp;#34;brightener&amp;#34;!! It works great around the eye area to give just a little shimmer and covers dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely one of my new favorite things :)</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This brightener stick works wonders for my appearance, especially when I&#x27;m tired. I initially bought this just to apply along the underside of my eyebrows, but it comes with other great ideas for where to apply for a lift. It gives a kind of dewy glow that is really flattering and acts like an instant pick-me-up. I only wore concealer, foundation, and mascara before I bought and fell in love with a sample of this Bio Brightener. So, I&#x27;m pretty low maintenance and this extra make-up step is worth it, in my opinion. One stick is going to last me a long time, making this is a great value. Overall, I would highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> TOTALLY OBSESSED with this gorgeous stick of perfection. I will now pronounce this the ultimate Youth in a Stick for immediate results for younger looking skin. Even if you are running out of the house with no other make-up on this is a perfect quick fix for a brighter look.</li>
            <li> Bright and light, love to use it for cheeks and eyes. Not heavy, not oily. Blends well alone and with powders, haven&#x27;t had any issues with mixing it with any other makeup types so far</li>
            <li> Great product. I use just a tiny bit to highlight my cheekbones and brow bone. I like that it&#x27;s all natural. It smells great too, a little like peppermint.</li>
            <li> I am a BB cream/3-in-1 tinted moisturizer and mascara kind of lady and this product takes my &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look to a whole new level. I feel great about using a natural product on my face and the highlighter adds just the perfect amount of luminescence to my skin without making me look shiny or glittery -- it looks like my skin was freshly washed and moisturized which is perfect for me. I use it on my cheek bones, on the interior corners of my eyes, down the bridge of my nose and a little on the center of my forehead (all places that light would naturally hit for highlights) and it brightens up my whole complexion and makes me look awake and refreshed. The stick is a great size for the price (much bigger than a tube of lipstick) and a little goes a long way so this is a great value as well. After trying several other highlighters (Sephora, RMS, Boots) I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a versatile highlighter made with natural ingredients.</li>
