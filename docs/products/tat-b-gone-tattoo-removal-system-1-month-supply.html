    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>SMDH Laser removal is the best and effective way to go.</li>
            <li>The reason needles have to be used to create a tattoo is because your epidermis is quite effective as a barrier.</li>
            <li>the more tan lotion you put on, the darker your skin becomes.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for over a month, as the directions say for the most part, and can see the tiniest bit of fade between treated and untreated areas.  </li>
            <li>that did the diamond had a &amp;#34;heavy hand&amp;#34; when it came to the lines, if that helps a bit more.</li>
            <li>Things like UV light breaks them down...not lotion-like creams.     </li>
            <li>so so far so good...</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, I knew I had been duped because it seemed too good/easy to be true, though I was still hopeful.</li>
            <li>but I believe it&#x27;s a bout a months worth or work.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this reflects on the seller as much as it does on the product itself.</li>
            <li>I used it twice sometimes three times a day depending on how much I showered.</li>
            <li>I bought this 10 years ago and found out you can buy the main ingredient skin bleach at the pharmacy like Walgreens.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your precious time and money on this tatbgone garbage.</li>
            <li>I am currently getting laser tattoo removal and the process is much easier.</li>
            <li>I go in to my dermatologist&#x27;s office to get it zapped once every two months and after 10 treatments, my tattoo is nearly gone.</li>
            <li>After the shower, I apply Step2 so that the cream completely covers the tattoo area, and leave it on for the designated 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>It would take me 20 years and a lot of money to completely remove my tattoos with this, but it would do something eventually.  </li>
            <li>New layers of skin are actually created closer to the surface than the tattoo, which is why they don&#x27;t just fade away after a couple of weeks.     </li>
            <li>I used my first with no results, called them up said I didn&#x27;t use it long enough....</li>
            <li>No other steps except the Tat-B-Gone creams.</li>
            <li>I used it for 7 months and it barely lightened my tattoo if at all.</li>
            <li>Tattoo was the size of my palm, of a wolf head howling in an enclosed full moon, all black, located on my upper left arm.</li>
            <li>Sure, they break down, but not easily.</li>
            <li>I am pleased to say that the tattoo that I am trying to rid myself (A medium sized Diamond), has a few lines that have thinned and some of the shading has lightened a little.</li>

            <li> Iv read alot of bad reviews about all creams but so far this one has been around the longest and appears to fade only the most outer layer</li>
            <li> i have a long way 2 go since its a big tattoo</li>
            <li> If you look at the other reviews of the few authors that gave this product 5 stars, you&#x27;ll notice that they have only reviewed this one product giving it 5 stars or they have reviewed this same product multiple times under different product categories, etc.    </li>
            <li> I am a medium skinned black female and the artist</li>
            <li> I saw all the negative reviews as well as the few positive reviews.</li>
            <li> I carried out the treatment for about two months or so before I gave up because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results and the process was becoming very tedious.</li>
            <li> My Dr. said the 1st session did what he expected</li>
            <li> this is not real like we all wish it would be.</li>
            <li> I am thinking to use other product.&lt;br /&gt;SW from Florida</li>
            <li> When I called to ask when the other two steps would arrive they told me they couldn&#x27;t send the other two steps.  </li>
            <li> Tattoo started fading in spots, but is now hardly recognizable; looks like a splotchy spray-tan gone wrong.</li>
            <li> stupidly orderd more.  </li>
            <li> and they said I wasn&#x27;t putting it on thick enough.  </li>
            <li> Putting the ink on your skin for hours wouldn&#x27;t let it seep into the dermal layer, and putting this product on your skin won&#x27;t get down to the dermal layer either unless you&#x27;re going over your tattoo with a tattoo gun, so it doesn&#x27;t have a chance to get to the inks.     </li>
            <li> All these facts mean that you don&#x27;t even have to consider whether or not the fancy Norwegian scientist and &#x27;clinical&#x27; (not bona fide) trials are to be believed.</li>
            <li> The fading is so slight, it could be my imagination.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for tattoos gone wrong.</li>
            <li> Anyhow, curiosity killed the cat</li>
            <li> Just save your money for laser removal, and don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> It did not do anything to my tattoo after few months use.</li>
            <li> I wasted alot of money and almost a year of my time on this bogus product</li>
            <li> I apply a gauze pad covering so that my clothes don&#x27;t rub the dried cream off the tattoo area, and I&#x27;m done.</li>
            <li> wasted my money on something I could have gotten from the beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
            <li> What a waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I thought that after the 1st session it would AT LEAST remove faster b/c I was using this cream.</li>
            <li> Been using it 2x/day/everyday since late March 2010.</li>
            <li> This product is poorly advertised.  </li>
            <li> now that I stared at the photo gallery and saw a picture that had a poorly photoshoped pic in it (clone tool marks)</li>
            <li> Do NOT Purchase its merely a bleaching cream wish I had listen to the reviews.</li>
            <li> Because tattoos are insoluble inks embedded in the dermal layer of your skin, there&#x27;s no way that a casual product like this is going to remove it.    </li>
            <li> so I thought I would give it a shot despite the bad reviews.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> just started it havent had any problems yet...i c a bit fading inside my tattoo. i have a long way 2 go since its a big tattoo haha. so so far so good...only time will tell!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. I used it for 7 months and it barely lightened my tattoo if at all.</li>
            <li> I saw all the negative reviews as well as the few positive reviews. If you look at the other reviews of the few authors that gave this product 5 stars, you&#x27;ll notice that they have only reviewed this one product giving it 5 stars or they have reviewed this same product multiple times under different product categories, etc.    Anyhow, curiosity killed the cat and I caved in and ordered the 3 month supply. Right off the bat, I knew I had been duped because it seemed too good/easy to be true, though I was still hopeful. I carried out the treatment for about two months or so before I gave up because I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results and the process was becoming very tedious. I saw no fading whatsoever... What a waste of time and money! I am currently getting laser tattoo removal and the process is much easier. I go in to my dermatologist&#x27;s office to get it zapped once every two months and after 10 treatments, my tattoo is nearly gone. Don&#x27;t waste your precious time and money on this tatbgone garbage.</li>
            <li> this thing doesn&#x27;t work. Just save your money for laser removal, and don&#x27;t waste your time and money on this product.</li>
            <li> It did not do anything to my tattoo after few months use. I am thinking to use other product.&lt;br /&gt;SW from Florida</li>
            <li> I got this about 4 months ago. I have a 3\\&quot; tattoo that is already faded so I thought I would give it a shot despite the bad reviews. I should have listened to the reviews. I followed the directions and after 3 months of using it, NOTHING happened! When you put the cream on it actually looks like its lightening up but i think its b/c of the thickness and whiteness of the cream. when it dries up, it looks the same. I took pictures of my tattoo every month and not one change. AFter 4 months of using this I did start the laser removal process for my tattoo and I don&#x27;t think it helped with that either. I thought that after the 1st session it would AT LEAST remove faster b/c I was using this cream. My Dr. said the 1st session did what he expected so I don&#x27;t think that the cream helped. I WOULD RATE THIS NO STARS IF I COULD. why are these people still in business???</li>
            <li> This product is poorly advertised.  It&#x27;s a three step system and they only sent me one step.  When I called to ask when the other two steps would arrive they told me they couldn&#x27;t send the other two steps.  They did give me a refund, but I wanted what I had ordered.  Do not order this product.  It isn&#x27;t what they say.</li>
            <li> I used my first with no results, called them up said I didn&#x27;t use it long enough....stupidly orderd more.  NO results still.  I called them up again and they said I wasn&#x27;t putting it on thick enough.  I wasted alot of money and almost a year of my time on this bogus product and they wouldn&#x27;t give me a refund!  Be warned!</li>
            <li> havent tried it yet. now that I stared at the photo gallery and saw a picture that had a poorly photoshoped pic in it (clone tool marks) i have a hunch its not its 90% fullproof as they say    just to double check.. just looked again.. def. photoshoped</li>
            <li> I would have gave it 0 stars if I could have.  I cant even believe that Amazon would offer this on their website.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 6 months as directed on the instructions and I have not seen a differnece at all on my ink.  Dont kid yourself this is not real like we all wish it would be. This is another scam. Laser Tattoo unfortunaltley is our only hope.  Maybe someday it will be affordable.</li>
            <li> Been using it 2x/day/everyday since late March 2010. Tattoo was the size of my palm, of a wolf head howling in an enclosed full moon, all black, located on my upper left arm. Crappy job by 20-something artist. Tattoo started fading in spots, but is now hardly recognizable; looks like a splotchy spray-tan gone wrong. No other steps except the Tat-B-Gone creams. I highly recommend this product for tattoos gone wrong. You just have to do as the instructions say, and be patient. I use Step1 in the shower, and massage it in for about 2-3 minutes. After the shower, I apply Step2 so that the cream completely covers the tattoo area, and leave it on for the designated 10 minutes. I apply Step3 over the cream already on my arm, rub it in and mix the two creams together, and leave that on for another 10 minutes. I apply a gauze pad covering so that my clothes don&#x27;t rub the dried cream off the tattoo area, and I&#x27;m done. I would compare this process to self-tanners: the more tan lotion you put on, the darker your skin becomes. Some concept. It DOES work.</li>
            <li> I have been using it as directed but i am yet to see its effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I purchased this with the purpose of fading a tattoo.  It did not work.  I don&#x27;t think this reflects on the seller as much as it does on the product itself.</li>
            <li> It would take me 20 years and a lot of money to completely remove my tattoos with this, but it would do something eventually.  I have been using this for over a month, as the directions say for the most part, and can see the tiniest bit of fade between treated and untreated areas.  The fading is so slight, it could be my imagination.</li>
            <li> Iv read alot of bad reviews about all creams but so far this one has been around the longest and appears to fade only the most outer layer so i will give it a try</li>
            <li> Because tattoos are insoluble inks embedded in the dermal layer of your skin, there&#x27;s no way that a casual product like this is going to remove it.    1) The dermal layer is below the epidermis, which is the part of the skin you see and touch on a daily basis. New layers of skin are actually created closer to the surface than the tattoo, which is why they don&#x27;t just fade away after a couple of weeks.     2) The reason needles have to be used to create a tattoo is because your epidermis is quite effective as a barrier. Putting the ink on your skin for hours wouldn&#x27;t let it seep into the dermal layer, and putting this product on your skin won&#x27;t get down to the dermal layer either unless you&#x27;re going over your tattoo with a tattoo gun, so it doesn&#x27;t have a chance to get to the inks.     3) Insoluble inks are just that: insoluble. They do not dissolve in a solution. Sure, they break down, but not easily. Things like UV light breaks them down...not lotion-like creams.     All these facts mean that you don&#x27;t even have to consider whether or not the fancy Norwegian scientist and &#x27;clinical&#x27; (not bona fide) trials are to be believed. This product simply doesn&#x27;t do what it claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product about a month now. I used it twice sometimes three times a day depending on how much I showered. I am pleased to say that the tattoo that I am trying to rid myself (A medium sized Diamond), has a few lines that have thinned and some of the shading has lightened a little. I don&#x27;t see any drastic changes but I believe it&#x27;s a bout a months worth or work. I haven&#x27;t finished using the jars yet so that&#x27;s a plus also. All in all I would recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;Also I am a medium skinned black female and the artist that did the diamond had a &amp;#34;heavy hand&amp;#34; when it came to the lines, if that helps a bit more.</li>
            <li> Still waiting on if it&#x27;s going to work I know it not going to be over night</li>
            <li> Do NOT Purchase its merely a bleaching cream wish I had listen to the reviews. wasted my money on something I could have gotten from the beauty supply store. SMDH Laser removal is the best and effective way to go.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this. I bought this 10 years ago and found out you can buy the main ingredient skin bleach at the pharmacy like Walgreens. Don&#x27;t be fooled by these fools.</li>
