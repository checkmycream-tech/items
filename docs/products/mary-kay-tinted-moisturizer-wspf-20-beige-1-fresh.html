            <li> Great product. Will continue using this and have replaced my previous tinted moisturizer.  I have combination skin and it is perfect for me, doesn&#x27;t leave a shiny, oily appearance at all.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer.  I use it and then apply powder.  Looks great.  If you want a great look, try this.</li>
            <li> Have been using this for years and years, it&#x27;s all I use for foundation.  Love it!!!</li>
            <li> This product was given to me and after using it I just had to buy more.  I honestly don&#x27;t need to wear anything more than this.  I gave a tube to my sister and she is just as impressed as I am.</li>
            <li> It gives my face the moisture that I need with a little tint along with sunscreen!  I love it.  It is light and fresh.  i won&#x27;t go anywhere without it.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Good product, just as described and very fast shipping. I believe it has been discontinued and I will miss it.</li>
            <li> Wish Mary Kay would reproduce this. I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Have used Mary Kay tinted moisturizer in the past and was pleasantly surprised to find that it was still available.  A great product for someone looking for a light coverage and not a heavy foundation.  Bought both Ivory for winter and Beige for summer.</li>
            <li> Love the nice light moisturizing coverage this gives me. As a bonus it has a sun block that doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted, good on shipping.</li>
            <li> Get lots of compliments, protects my face from sun damage, evens out my skin tone. I wear this color when I have a tan (I&#x27;m white).</li>
            <li> perfect for dry skin.</li>
            <li> product is easy to apply. Has no heavy feeling and gives skin a natural glow with just a hint of color.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products over the years and Mary Kay is the best.  The tinted moisturizer is perfect for natural looking coverage without the look of makeup.  Very fast shipping.</li>

            <li> Product appeared to be packaged in an old version Mary Kay box for the tinted moisturizer.  The bottom of the box where the expiration date normally would appear only had a slight smudge with no visual date.  I opened the package and on the rim the expiration date is 03/10, obviously March 2010.  This is fraud.  I was definitely cheated and I better not have any problems returning this and not incur any additional charges.  I rate this product with the maximum number of NEGATIVE stars.  I AM FURIOUS!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cover like it should.</li>
            <li> I was looking for just a tinted moisturizer and have use Mary Kay in past.  This is a little thick so have to make sure to spread evenly.  Overall is a good product as I will use in place of makeup some days when just want to add a little color.  I use the Beige 1 powder in summer so knew the color was right for me.  I like Mary Kay so was pleased with product, it is up to their standards.  I like the one step process moisturize and color.&lt;br /&gt;Note: If prone to skin problems not sure if you would like I have combination of normal/dry skin.</li>
            <li> So upset they have stopped making this product..why why why do they discontinue what we use</li>
