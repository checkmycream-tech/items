            <li>This Bullfrog received a 2 on their scale which is very good.</li>
            <li>This is a great sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Lol</li>
            <li>Great stuff.  </li>
            <li>Great, great stuff.  </li>
            <li>It is great for the face because it moisturizes.</li>
            <li>Works great</li>
            <li>I have tried many sunscreens and this is the best.</li>
            <li>Excellent sunscreen with quality ingredients that are safe and effective.  </li>
            <li>really good protection too.</li>
            <li>But, not quite a good in the water.</li>
            <li>It gives me good sun protection without my looking like a ghost and does not run or get sticky.</li>
            <li>i liked the feel of the sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving the lightness of this lotion and it does the job.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent.</li>
            <li>Good coverage easy to apply.</li>
            <li>This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m certified as a professional scuba divemaster -</li>
            <li>The original bullfrog was good.</li>
            <li>It feels very light with almost no sunscreen-stickiness.  </li>
            <li>I love this sunblock its natural, nice scent, rubs in nicely &amp; works great</li>
            <li>Love Bull Frog sun screen - it has always worked well for me</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so light, and honestly I have not ever burned while wearing it.  </li>
            <li>, so I suspect the problems with it may involve water - if you sweat a lot or are going to the beach, you&#x27;re really better off buying a sunblock that&#x27;s certified as waterproof.  </li>
            <li>Love this hypoallergenic sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>best sun screen ever it actually works to stop skin cancer from happening</li>
            <li>but like everything else that is better for us</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t gotten sunburned yet, so I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>This one is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Nice, mild scent and not greasy or sticky.</li>
            <li>The Environmetal Working Group gives it a 2 on their scale of good sunscreen products, I can certainly live with that!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li>Easy to apply and is not greasy.  </li>
            <li>Easy to pack, easy to use, and it works</li>
            <li>Kept me burnt free in Mexico &amp; the kids.</li>
            <li>I like this sunscreen because it goes on silky smooth, not greasy.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for everyday use as you don&#x27;t walk around feeling like you have a layer of shortening all over you</li>
            <li>Not greasy, goes on clean.  </li>
            <li>and i go every 6 months to the dermatologist for full body checks.  </li>
            <li>Good amount that will last all summer.</li>
            <li>The only problem is I dont feel that it protects as good as the alcohol based formation they make.</li>
            <li>Perhaps it would be better to say that you lay a tissue on your face, gently press, and then remove it.</li>
            <li>Apparently others liked it as well as someone walked off with while swimming.</li>
            <li>This stuff must actually wear off on its own.</li>
            <li>Quickly absorbed and has no residue.</li>
            <li>We were looking for a couple of CHEMICAL sunscreens that received a good review from EWG.org to supplement our PHYSICAL sunscreen we normally use (but leaves a whitish film).</li>
            <li>ingredients, not greasy, goes on easily and clearly.</li>
            <li>most likely wont buy it anymore.  </li>
            <li>I wish it came in a higher spf.</li>
            <li>Bullfrog sunscreens have always been my first choice.</li>
            <li>for use this summer, if like other Bullfrog products we will love it</li>
            <li>I really like the new bullfrog formulation.</li>
            <li>and I have very sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy really does the job.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s fine except when you suddenly run out or are not at home with your stash of extra tubes.</li>
            <li>I play tennis 4-5 times a week and live in sunny humid South Florida.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick, so I can actually spread it instead of rubbing it in in order to spread it in the skin</li>
            <li>At last, a sunscreen I can live with!&lt;br /&gt;After reading reports about most OTC sunscreens containing questionable ingredients I found this.  </li>
            <li>(generally body shine isn&#x27;t as big an issue for people).</li>
            <li>I use it when I am going to have limited sun exposure that is too much to wear no sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t want to get all sticky with other stuff.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not thick, so I can actually spread it instead of rubbing it in in order to spread it in the skin</li>
            <li> The original bullfrog was good. This stuff must actually wear off on its own. 3 hours in the sun in Maui, all covered in this stuff - got burnt. If you have this stuff- be paranoid and apply often, even if your not doing anything.    Wont buy it again.     Zinc based sunscreen on children with no tan didnt burn. We tanned alot, and used this Bullfrog SunBlock and got burnt.</li>
            <li> Excellent sunscreen with quality ingredients that are safe and effective.  Easy to apply and is not greasy.  Quickly absorbed and has no residue.</li>
            <li> This is a great sunscreen. It&#x27;s not heavy really does the job.  I&#x27;ll buy again this year for the beach.</li>
            <li> for use this summer, if like other Bullfrog products we will love it</li>
            <li> Kept me burnt free in Mexico &amp; the kids. Apparently others liked it as well as someone walked off with while swimming. Lol</li>
            <li> Use this on my son and myself.  Not greasy or sticky.  Good coverage easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Hi, i ordered this product and took it out to Arizona.  I put it on my upper body to go hiking hour before i went out in the sun.  i got burnt all 3 days.  i tried to write Bullfrog myself but couldnt get the email to go thru.  there is a history of Skin Cancer in my family and i go every 6 months to the dermatologist for full body checks.  i was  very disappointed in the product.  most likely wont buy it anymore.  i liked the feel of the sunscreen.  wasnt thick and sticky.  Oh well.</li>
            <li> Best sunscreen I can find: no &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; ingredients, not greasy, goes on easily and clearly. really good protection too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving the lightness of this lotion and it does the job.  I highly recommend this product</li>
            <li> It feels very light with almost no sunscreen-stickiness.  However, I echo what others have said that it does not last long.  I use it when I am going to have limited sun exposure that is too much to wear no sunscreen, but I don&#x27;t want to get all sticky with other stuff.  It also does not stain so you can wear it with dressier clothes.  This is not a good choice for prolonged sun exposure, especially if you will sweat since this is not waterproof at all.  Definitely re-apply every 2 hours or so.</li>
            <li> Nice, mild scent and not greasy or sticky. Did the job of protecting sunburns and didn&#x27;t have that glow in the day look of white masky lotion slathered on!</li>
            <li> Bought this for our trip to Mexico.  Not greasy, goes on clean.  I re-applied every 3 hours and never burned.</li>
            <li> I love this sunblock its natural, nice scent, rubs in nicely &amp; works great</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  Not nearly as greasy as the gel.  But, not quite a good in the water.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my face Oily feeling. Hasn&#x27;t caused me any Acne</li>
            <li> Love Bull Frog sun screen - it has always worked well for me and I have very sensitive skin! I have never burned when I have used Bull Frog and I am a red head.</li>
            <li> This is the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;m certified as a professional scuba divemaster - so I&#x27;ve tried a lot of it.  Great, great stuff.  You don&#x27;t even notice you have it on, it&#x27;s so light, and honestly I have not ever burned while wearing it.  Disclosure:  My uses of it have involved going to all-day rock concerts outside, going hiking, etc., so I suspect the problems with it may involve water - if you sweat a lot or are going to the beach, you&#x27;re really better off buying a sunblock that&#x27;s certified as waterproof.  Banana Boat products, also sold here at Amazon, are what I&#x27;d reach for under those circumstances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is I&#x27;m here to buy five or six tubes of Bullfrog, since I can&#x27;t find it locally and I&#x27;m afraid they&#x27;re going to stop making it.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen because it goes on silky smooth, not greasy. It is perfect for everyday use as you don&#x27;t walk around feeling like you have a layer of shortening all over you and it doesn&#x27;t smell like sunscreen. There are two negatives. One, it isn&#x27;t waterproof so if you are going to be swimming or sweating a lot you will need to reapply. Two, it is hard to find in local stores so you will need to stock up from Amazon. That&#x27;s fine except when you suddenly run out or are not at home with your stash of extra tubes.</li>
            <li> Love this hypoallergenic sunscreen.  As always, you have to reapply throughout the day for continued protection. Nice scent.</li>
            <li> Good lotion and sun repellent.  Just as described.  Not much scent and doesn&#x27;t clog pores.  Good amount that will last all summer.</li>
            <li> I really like the new bullfrog formulation. It is great for the face because it moisturizes. The only problem is I dont feel that it protects as good as the alcohol based formation they make.</li>
            <li> We were looking for a couple of CHEMICAL sunscreens that received a good review from EWG.org to supplement our PHYSICAL sunscreen we normally use (but leaves a whitish film). This Bullfrog received a 2 on their scale which is very good. It IS NOT as water-resistant as they indicate (probably closer to 30-40 minutes versus the 80 they say).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no whiteness left by this product; however, it does leave a sheen to your skin. This can be augmented by applying it, waiting 10 minutes or so, and then taking a paper towel or tissue and simply dabbing it once off your face (generally body shine isn&#x27;t as big an issue for people). You are NOT wiping it; merely dabbing ONCE! Perhaps it would be better to say that you lay a tissue on your face, gently press, and then remove it. This was sufficient to remove 90% of the sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this for quite awhile and got no burn though I was wearing a baseball cap. My kids had it on and they also did not receive any burns.</li>
            <li> best sun screen ever it actually works to stop skin cancer from happening</li>
            <li> I play tennis 4-5 times a week and live in sunny humid South Florida. I have tried many sunscreens and this is the best. It gives me good sun protection without my looking like a ghost and does not run or get sticky. I have this on auto ship as I use it every day.</li>
            <li> At last, a sunscreen I can live with!&lt;br /&gt;After reading reports about most OTC sunscreens containing questionable ingredients I found this.  It goes on like a lotion and smells great!  I wish it was a bit cheaper but like everything else that is better for us it costs more.&lt;br /&gt;It does NOT contain retinyl palmitate or oxybenzone.  The Environmetal Working Group gives it a 2 on their scale of good sunscreen products, I can certainly live with that!&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
            <li> I garden almost every day and use this protection.  I haven&#x27;t gotten sunburned yet, so I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Works well. I wish it came in a higher spf.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Works great and I use it every day.  Would definitely be buying it again and recommend it for using on your face especially.</li>
            <li> Bullfrog sunscreens have always been my first choice. This one is my favorite. Easy to pack, easy to use, and it works</li>
    </ol>
