            <li>Good product and</li>

            <li>I love the scent!</li>

            <li>Some nice shampoo and the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li>Kind of leaves your hair feeling as though there&#x27;s a residue on it, though.  </li>
            <li>So it appears to be effective.</li>
            <li>This Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Its a nice product</li>
            <li>I received this product in exchange for an HONEST review.</li>
            <li>Never used head and shoulders before, but it did smell good, would probably buy again :)</li>
            <li>It lathered up nicely.  </li>
            <li>Will have to see how effective it is.</li>
            <li>It smells really good and leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li>But there was a really good deal on this that I couldn&#x27;t pass up, and with its rating and the product info I thought this could be a great opportunity to try something new...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, it is a great shampoo and conditioner combo if it is right for your hair type.</li>
            <li>Overall, another great product with a great smell.</li>
            <li>It smells nice and It left my hair feeling nice (and with no dandruff!!!)</li>
            <li>product is very gentle and has a great fragrance to it.</li>
            <li>I have always used Head &amp; Shoulders and it has consistently been a great performer.</li>
            <li>, it smells so good, lathered easy and rinsed easy, it made her hair</li>
            <li>In a way, I guess that is appealing, because it is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice light aloe scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many no named &amp;#34;compare to&amp;#34; products</li>
            <li>My husband has used Head and Shoulders for many years to control his dandruff.  </li>
            <li>The Purely gentle scalp care is another great product in this line.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite &#x27;winter&#x27; shampoo.</li>
            <li>It cleared up my scalp and has made my Hair nice and silky smooth.</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed using it too.</li>
            <li>and we&#x27;ve noticed that his scalp has gotten better.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has been a while since I have used Head &amp; Shoulders and I was glad I had an opportunity to try this version out.  </li>
            <li>My generally healthy, shoulder length hair looked like a mass of straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This just makes it look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li>The smell is fantastic to boot!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and love it.</li>
            <li>What more can you ask for from a dandruff shampoo?</li>
            <li>I like it better than Pantene.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair healthy for 2 days with no product but just blow drying.</li>
            <li>I love this 2 in 1.</li>
            <li>masking tape keeping top from coming undone could have prevented that.</li>
            <li>I guess I just expect to be able to tell when I&#x27;ve just shampooed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is better.</li>
            <li>This is OK</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li>DOES THE JOB RIGHT FOR A GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a great smell, too...very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>My wife has allergies to most strong scents, so this is better because of that.</li>
            <li>My hair really feels amazing after using this!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The scent is good for men or women as it&#x27;s a very light, clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li>This latest version is very mild and has a fruity aroma.</li>
            <li>but with a gentle side to it and a pleasant</li>
            <li>Best shampoo for dry scalp</li>
            <li>Its good stuff for a good price... definitely recommended!</li>
            <li>I love having the shampoo and conditioner together in one quick step in the mornings before work!</li>
            <li>I have been using these for years and my hair feels natural and great all the time.</li>
            <li>Nice big bottle for good price and</li>
            <li>Luckily, my Husband is the true Head &amp; Shoulders fan in the house and he liked it.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s much more mild.</li>
            <li>bottle size is perfect when I travel and the cap stays on tight without any leaks.</li>
            <li>I love that they keep developing new products that address different kinds of scalp problems and on the surface, this was the perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li>This shampoo really makes my head tingle when I use it, and it kind of stings my forehead</li>
            <li>Not too much dandruff here with the warm California winters,</li>
            <li>This is a great shampoo I actually use as a soap on my body.</li>
            <li>Would purchase next time works great for my hair</li>
            <li>My Daughter likes the gentle but effective results from this Head &amp; Shoulders product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It feels light to the touch, light in the hair, and the hair feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No problems at all with this transaction as everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li>Great low price also.</li>
            <li>but I like it and would recommend as of right now, the more I use it</li>
            <li>I use Head and Shoulders products almost exclusively on my hair, and I&#x27;m never disappointed in how they make my hair and scalp look and feel.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for years and wish they hadn&#x27;t changed the original formula(sensitive)</li>
            <li>Works great at getting rid of my dandruff problem and leave my hair feeling clean for a long time.</li>
            <li>The clean scent is an added bonus.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It also works as a shampoo and keeps my hair clean.</li>
            <li>However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair as clean as the others do.  </li>
            <li>This new formulation is as good as the old and smells better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that Head &amp; Shoulders have recently been releasing many new versions of their dependable shampoos and conditioners with new pleasant scents and this is no exception.</li>
            <li>Overall, good product.</li>
            <li>oh man, i love it so much.</li>
            <li>even though it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize my hair any more than just shampoo alone.</li>
            <li>The only reason I docked a star is ,after my mother used it i interviewed her, and she said she loved it</li>
            <li>Its cool that it has dandruff control</li>
            <li>shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much, which would be okay</li>
            <li>Been using Head &amp; Shoulders Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2 in 1 shampoo &amp; conditioner for some time now and love it.</li>
            <li>It gets the hair clean and the scalp feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li>I shampooed my hair 7 times, and I still feel there is some residue left in the hair on top of my head, where I used the most of the Head and Shoulders shampoo.</li>
            <li>Purely Gentle is easy on the scalp while giving you that Head and Shoulders protection that they are so known for.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive scalp and am allergic to many things</li>
            <li>absolutely recommend any version of this product!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Helps cut down on flakes for me (which is the entire point), smells good, and is a good price.</li>
            <li>as expected good product</li>
            <li>I love that Head and Shoulders can clear that up in just a couple of washes.</li>
            <li>I liked the way it left my hair afterwards too.</li>
            <li>My husband has dandruff and this is the only shampoo that helps keep his hair free and clean!  </li>
            <li>Right away, I tried to wash it off with another shampoo, then another.</li>
            <li>Just right in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The new 2 in 1 purely gentle scalp care is even better.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice fresh smell to it and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair or scalp.</li>
            <li>Usually I dread this because the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell great</li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t last all day, which is good because I&#x27;m sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li>Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1</li>
            <li>Very gentle.</li>
            <li>This is a very gentle shampoo and conditioner that does not tingle or sting your scalp.  </li>
            <li>This doesn&#x27;t have that, which is a little worrying, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my hair since using it, so it must be doing a good job.</li>
            <li>-- I lather it in and rinse and then simply want my hair to feel clean and relatively smooth.</li>
            <li>and I really like it!</li>
            <li>and it really gets the dandruff out!</li>
            <li>First time ordering from Amazon and I must say the package came well-packed and</li>
            <li>Because I&#x27;m constantly putting my hands in it, I have to watch how oily the shampoo makes my hair, so a 2-in-1 seemed like it would be okay</li>
            <li>but her head still itched from her dandruff, she said selson blue was better with keeping her head not to itch, you couldn&#x27;t see her dandruff</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>After many years of battling dandruff, I&#x27;ve finally found my remedy.</li>
            <li>It was packaged great, it came in the box with my other prime products ( really not excited for the day my prime free trail ends!</li>
            <li>It not only controls flakes and dandruff, but is very friendly to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>It leaves his hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>feel/ look soft and clean</li>
            <li>I have long hair and can brush it out easily after washing with this, no crazy tangles.  </li>
            <li>I appreciate the head &amp; shoulders line for coming up with new scents to keep my scalp and hair feeling fresh.</li>
            <li>My husband has always had a dry scalp, he is in love with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It certainly helps contain the flakes and the 2 in 1 protection washes and conditions.</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s a big fan of things being easy and fast in the shower.</li>
            <li>I previously used and loved Head and Shoulders SENSITIVE SCALP which also used Aloe Vera.  </li>
            <li>Funny thing, I always pictured head &amp; shoulders for older people with dandruff.</li>
            <li>This kind of head and shoulders in a little gentler</li>
            <li>Then I went to have a shower and washed hair with the shampoo, it lathered up fine, but left my hair very greasy.</li>
            <li>Since starting to use Head &amp; Shoulders Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-in-1, he has been flake free.  </li>
            <li>We have used this shampoo for years and it does really well.</li>
            <li>In the morning my hair felt really oily, but I was not blaming the shampoo at the moment, thought maybe I was sweating too much, or something.</li>
            <li>Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner 13.5 Fl Oz.</li>
            <li>; I use a light shampoo and conditioner now, this didn&#x27;t seem like a big leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I started using this shampoo, and after three weeks things have really improved.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>Shipped fast.</li>
            <li>But it just costs way way way to much) and it was wrapped in plastic</li>
            <li>There was no leak, I just appreciated getting this packaged well.</li>
            <li>My husband loves this every gentle doesn&#x27;t have the menthol that burns your scalp.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping, always use this shampoo.</li>
            <li>Overall, it&#x27;s smooth and silky and I like it.  </li>
            <li>If they are advertising it as being &amp;#34;PURELY GENTLE&amp;#34; then why did they add so much conditioner and fragrance.  </li>
            <li>However, I can&#x27;t really tell I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li>I still use and like but not as much.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not much to say.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure the addition of Aloe Vera and other healing agents have helped to accomplish the gentleness to the scalp.  </li>
            <li>I guess if it leaked so it wouldn&#x27;t get on my other items, it came fast actually a few days before the estimated arrival time and so far it&#x27;s a pretty good shampoo!</li>
            <li>This cleans my hair well and rinses off nicely, but I&#x27;m not sure what the aloe is accomplishing.  </li>
            <li>We both tested out this new Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Until Amazon itself stocks it regularly, take a look at your local warehouse store for a much better value.</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with the SENSITIVE SCALP Head and Shoulders and the fragrance was minimal which is better for peole with allergies.  </li>
            <li>Decent smell too.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this new Head and Shoulders shampoo!</li>
            <li>It seems a bit high on the conditioning side of things, but I like that.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathers well and smells fantastic, soft and slightly green, and it rinses quickly.</li>
            <li>He said it left his hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li>Other than that, it is very mild on the scalp and skin.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, it seems that as I&#x27;m getting older dandruff is becoming more of a problem.</li>
            <li>It lathers well and gets the job done as far as dandruff control goes with the added benefit of being gentle on my scalp.  </li>
            <li>I have straight, soft and sometimes oily hair.</li>
            <li>I felt his hair and it really did feel soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves hair very manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>H &amp; S PURELY GENTLE replaced SENSITIVE SCALP</li>
            <li>The Head and Shoulders brand is definitely my #1 pick for shampoo as it cleans my hair and leaves it smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>This appears to be an updated version of the previous Sensitive care shampoo which is my favorite.</li>
            <li>Also, usually dandruff shampoos are very strong and while they clear dandruff, they also tend to damage hair.</li>
            <li>The actual product is pretty normal (no qualms).</li>
            <li>The smell is light fake berry-ish, nothing potent.  </li>
            <li>Was surprised by this Head &amp; Shoulders because I&#x27;ve become used to things smelling a certain way, a certain medical like smell.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li>My husband loves it thus far, and I have to admit I like it, too!</li>
            <li>I think part of the problem is that I normally don&#x27;t put conditioner near my scalp and with this product you have to.</li>
            <li>Enter Head &amp; Shoulders Dandruff shampoo, problem number one solved, dandruff is completely gone!</li>
            <li>It also has the same look and feel when it comes to actual use, and every bit as effective on dandruff control as their other H&amp;S products.</li>
            <li>Otherwise, H&amp;S is totally fine for an everyday shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have been using Head and Shoulders for my entire life well except for those early years where I don&#x27;t remember a whole lot.</li>
            <li>Recently, he has tried the 2 in 1 style and really likes the conditioning aspect of it.  </li>
            <li>My 4 year old son struggled with itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>I usually stick to bumble and bumble or Bamboo but was finding my hair was becoming greasy after 24hrs.</li>
            <li>When my head gets really itchy though, I alternate in a tar gel product.</li>
            <li>I am used to conditioner that leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair surprisingly soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>Makes my scalp and hair feel soft and</li>
            <li>I have been trying a variety of Head and Shoulders shampoos lately and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li>They should have never changed their old product that did work.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this type of shampoo for nearly a year now.  </li>
            <li>I would recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>B00VSC1C6A Skingenixx Professional Strength Hair Regrowth and Thickening Shampoo]]</li>
            <li>it made my hair feel soft and clean, maybe a little to conditioned</li>
            <li>I find that regular Head and Shoulders tends to dry out my scalp and hair too much, but that doesn&#x27;t happen with this Purely Gentle formula.</li>
            <li>Other shampoos and conditioners smell better, but don&#x27;t also include active ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li>had my fair share of bad shampoos, but this one is certainly tops the list.</li>
            <li>I need something gentle for my scalp; my general issue is that I have fine, thin hair and an itchy scalp that needs tender care.</li>
            <li>This specific SKU is also shampoo plus conditioner -- for my male thinning hair, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between it and product without conditioner.</li>
            <li>HEAD AND SHOULDERS BRING BACK THE SENSITIVE SCALP FORMULA!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think this is any big improvement on regular H&amp;S shampoo, which I usually buy, except for one thing: the light scent, which is much lighter than the regular formula.  </li>
            <li>My skin has also been a bit more sensitive and dry of late and it helps with that as well.</li>
            <li>In the past I have always bought different shampoos because I have never noticed a difference; however, this Head and Shoulders two in one has made a tremendous difference in my hair quality!</li>
            <li>H&amp;S left my hair feeling soft and moist.</li>
            <li>It left my hair soft, shiny and manageable and took care of my itchy scalp problem.</li>
            <li>While I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin necessarily, my wife does.  </li>
            <li>Mom used the old style Head &amp; Shoulders back in the 1960&#x27;s, and she still likes it.  </li>
            <li>the smell isn&#x27;t gross like the old stuff was.</li>
            <li>I have two big issues with my hair, the first is dandruff and the other is thinning hair.</li>
            <li>He didn&#x27;t notice anything especially different about this versus other types but his skin type is normal and someone with sensitive skin may have found a difference that he did nto.</li>
            <li>Yesterday, I washed my hair with it, but was really busy all day long to see what is going on.</li>
            <li>As my hair air dried as usual, my cowlicks started swirling (I don&#x27;t normally have issues with them) and little flyaway hairs rose up all over my head.</li>
            <li>I made fun of my boyfriend for using it but it has done wonders to my thin normal hair.</li>
            <li>my scalp is a little picky and will itch and flake if it doesn&#x27;t like a certain shampoo.</li>
            <li>Not only is my scalp dry &amp; sensitive, but my hair tends to be as well.  </li>
            <li>I like that Subscribe &amp; Save brings two large bottles to my door every few months at a discounted price</li>
            <li>But this is not true with H&amp;S, especially with Gentle Scalp Care, I have noticed lesser hair breakage.</li>

            <li> Hair is  good.</li>

            <li> Good product and</li>
            <li> A good shampoo at a good price.  </li>
            <li> clean- best yet, no signs of dandruff!</li>

            <li> Very happy to have a product that is both effective on dandruff and offers great conditioning benefits as well.</li>
            <li> I would buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> I love the scent!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pleasant and satisfying.</li>

            <li> It smells nice and keeps my head from itching me to death.</li>
            <li> Some nice shampoo and the bottle lasts forever.</li>
            <li> Kind of leaves your hair feeling as though there&#x27;s a residue on it, though.  </li>
            <li> So it appears to be effective.</li>
            <li> This Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner works wonderfully.</li>
            <li> Its a nice product</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an HONEST review.</li>
            <li> Never used head and shoulders before, but it did smell good, would probably buy again :)</li>
            <li> It lathered up nicely.  </li>
            <li> Will have to see how effective it is.</li>
            <li> It smells really good and leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> But there was a really good deal on this that I couldn&#x27;t pass up, and with its rating and the product info I thought this could be a great opportunity to try something new...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, it is a great shampoo and conditioner combo if it is right for your hair type.</li>
            <li> Overall, another great product with a great smell.</li>
            <li> It smells nice and It left my hair feeling nice (and with no dandruff!!!)</li>
            <li> product is very gentle and has a great fragrance to it.</li>
            <li> I have always used Head &amp; Shoulders and it has consistently been a great performer.</li>
            <li> , it smells so good, lathered easy and rinsed easy, it made her hair</li>
            <li> In a way, I guess that is appealing, because it is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice light aloe scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many no named &amp;#34;compare to&amp;#34; products</li>
            <li> My husband has used Head and Shoulders for many years to control his dandruff.  </li>
            <li> The Purely gentle scalp care is another great product in this line.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite &#x27;winter&#x27; shampoo.</li>
            <li> It cleared up my scalp and has made my Hair nice and silky smooth.</li>
            <li> I have enjoyed using it too.</li>
            <li> and we&#x27;ve noticed that his scalp has gotten better.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has been a while since I have used Head &amp; Shoulders and I was glad I had an opportunity to try this version out.  </li>
            <li> My generally healthy, shoulder length hair looked like a mass of straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This just makes it look and feel healthy.</li>
            <li> The smell is fantastic to boot!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and love it.</li>
            <li> What more can you ask for from a dandruff shampoo?</li>
            <li> I like it better than Pantene.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair healthy for 2 days with no product but just blow drying.</li>
            <li> I love this 2 in 1.</li>
            <li> masking tape keeping top from coming undone could have prevented that.</li>
            <li> I guess I just expect to be able to tell when I&#x27;ve just shampooed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is better.</li>
            <li> This is OK</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this.</li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB RIGHT FOR A GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got a great smell, too...very fresh and clean.</li>
            <li> My wife has allergies to most strong scents, so this is better because of that.</li>
            <li> My hair really feels amazing after using this!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The scent is good for men or women as it&#x27;s a very light, clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> This latest version is very mild and has a fruity aroma.</li>
            <li> but with a gentle side to it and a pleasant</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for dry scalp</li>
            <li> Its good stuff for a good price... definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> I love having the shampoo and conditioner together in one quick step in the mornings before work!</li>
            <li> I have been using these for years and my hair feels natural and great all the time.</li>
            <li> Nice big bottle for good price and</li>
            <li> Luckily, my Husband is the true Head &amp; Shoulders fan in the house and he liked it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s much more mild.</li>
            <li> bottle size is perfect when I travel and the cap stays on tight without any leaks.</li>
            <li> I love that they keep developing new products that address different kinds of scalp problems and on the surface, this was the perfect fit for me.</li>
            <li> This shampoo really makes my head tingle when I use it, and it kind of stings my forehead</li>
            <li> Not too much dandruff here with the warm California winters,</li>
            <li> This is a great shampoo I actually use as a soap on my body.</li>
            <li> Would purchase next time works great for my hair</li>
            <li> My Daughter likes the gentle but effective results from this Head &amp; Shoulders product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It feels light to the touch, light in the hair, and the hair feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No problems at all with this transaction as everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great low price also.</li>
            <li> but I like it and would recommend as of right now, the more I use it</li>
            <li> I use Head and Shoulders products almost exclusively on my hair, and I&#x27;m never disappointed in how they make my hair and scalp look and feel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and wish they hadn&#x27;t changed the original formula(sensitive)</li>
            <li> Works great at getting rid of my dandruff problem and leave my hair feeling clean for a long time.</li>
            <li> The clean scent is an added bonus.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It also works as a shampoo and keeps my hair clean.</li>
            <li> However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair as clean as the others do.  </li>
            <li> This new formulation is as good as the old and smells better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that Head &amp; Shoulders have recently been releasing many new versions of their dependable shampoos and conditioners with new pleasant scents and this is no exception.</li>
            <li> Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> oh man, i love it so much.</li>
            <li> even though it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize my hair any more than just shampoo alone.</li>
            <li> The only reason I docked a star is ,after my mother used it i interviewed her, and she said she loved it</li>
            <li> Its cool that it has dandruff control</li>
            <li> shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much, which would be okay</li>
            <li> Been using Head &amp; Shoulders Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2 in 1 shampoo &amp; conditioner for some time now and love it.</li>
            <li> It gets the hair clean and the scalp feeling fresh.  </li>
            <li> I shampooed my hair 7 times, and I still feel there is some residue left in the hair on top of my head, where I used the most of the Head and Shoulders shampoo.</li>
            <li> Purely Gentle is easy on the scalp while giving you that Head and Shoulders protection that they are so known for.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive scalp and am allergic to many things</li>
            <li> absolutely recommend any version of this product!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Helps cut down on flakes for me (which is the entire point), smells good, and is a good price.</li>
            <li> as expected good product</li>
            <li> I love that Head and Shoulders can clear that up in just a couple of washes.</li>
            <li> I liked the way it left my hair afterwards too.</li>
            <li> My husband has dandruff and this is the only shampoo that helps keep his hair free and clean!  </li>
            <li> Right away, I tried to wash it off with another shampoo, then another.</li>
            <li> Just right in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The new 2 in 1 purely gentle scalp care is even better.  </li>
            <li> It has a nice fresh smell to it and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair or scalp.</li>
            <li> Usually I dread this because the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell great</li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last all day, which is good because I&#x27;m sensitive to smells.  </li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1</li>
            <li> Very gentle.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle shampoo and conditioner that does not tingle or sting your scalp.  </li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t have that, which is a little worrying, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my hair since using it, so it must be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> -- I lather it in and rinse and then simply want my hair to feel clean and relatively smooth.</li>
            <li> and I really like it!</li>
            <li> and it really gets the dandruff out!</li>
            <li> First time ordering from Amazon and I must say the package came well-packed and</li>
            <li> Because I&#x27;m constantly putting my hands in it, I have to watch how oily the shampoo makes my hair, so a 2-in-1 seemed like it would be okay</li>
            <li> but her head still itched from her dandruff, she said selson blue was better with keeping her head not to itch, you couldn&#x27;t see her dandruff</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> After many years of battling dandruff, I&#x27;ve finally found my remedy.</li>
            <li> It was packaged great, it came in the box with my other prime products ( really not excited for the day my prime free trail ends!</li>
            <li> It not only controls flakes and dandruff, but is very friendly to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> It leaves his hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> feel/ look soft and clean</li>
            <li> I have long hair and can brush it out easily after washing with this, no crazy tangles.  </li>
            <li> I appreciate the head &amp; shoulders line for coming up with new scents to keep my scalp and hair feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> My husband has always had a dry scalp, he is in love with this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It certainly helps contain the flakes and the 2 in 1 protection washes and conditions.</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s a big fan of things being easy and fast in the shower.</li>
            <li> I previously used and loved Head and Shoulders SENSITIVE SCALP which also used Aloe Vera.  </li>
            <li> Funny thing, I always pictured head &amp; shoulders for older people with dandruff.</li>
            <li> This kind of head and shoulders in a little gentler</li>
            <li> Then I went to have a shower and washed hair with the shampoo, it lathered up fine, but left my hair very greasy.</li>
            <li> Since starting to use Head &amp; Shoulders Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-in-1, he has been flake free.  </li>
            <li> We have used this shampoo for years and it does really well.</li>
            <li> In the morning my hair felt really oily, but I was not blaming the shampoo at the moment, thought maybe I was sweating too much, or something.</li>
            <li> Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner 13.5 Fl Oz.</li>
            <li> ; I use a light shampoo and conditioner now, this didn&#x27;t seem like a big leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using this shampoo, and after three weeks things have really improved.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast.</li>
            <li> But it just costs way way way to much) and it was wrapped in plastic</li>
            <li> There was no leak, I just appreciated getting this packaged well.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this every gentle doesn&#x27;t have the menthol that burns your scalp.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, always use this shampoo.</li>
            <li> Overall, it&#x27;s smooth and silky and I like it.  </li>
            <li> If they are advertising it as being &amp;#34;PURELY GENTLE&amp;#34; then why did they add so much conditioner and fragrance.  </li>
            <li> However, I can&#x27;t really tell I&#x27;ve used it.  </li>
            <li> but I really can&#x27;t tell much of a difference.</li>
            <li> I still use and like but not as much.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Not much to say.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure the addition of Aloe Vera and other healing agents have helped to accomplish the gentleness to the scalp.  </li>
            <li> I guess if it leaked so it wouldn&#x27;t get on my other items, it came fast actually a few days before the estimated arrival time and so far it&#x27;s a pretty good shampoo!</li>
            <li> This cleans my hair well and rinses off nicely, but I&#x27;m not sure what the aloe is accomplishing.  </li>
            <li> We both tested out this new Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Until Amazon itself stocks it regularly, take a look at your local warehouse store for a much better value.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with the SENSITIVE SCALP Head and Shoulders and the fragrance was minimal which is better for peole with allergies.  </li>
            <li> Decent smell too.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this new Head and Shoulders shampoo!</li>
            <li> It seems a bit high on the conditioning side of things, but I like that.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathers well and smells fantastic, soft and slightly green, and it rinses quickly.</li>
            <li> He said it left his hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
            <li> Other than that, it is very mild on the scalp and skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems that as I&#x27;m getting older dandruff is becoming more of a problem.</li>
            <li> It lathers well and gets the job done as far as dandruff control goes with the added benefit of being gentle on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have straight, soft and sometimes oily hair.</li>
            <li> I felt his hair and it really did feel soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves hair very manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> H &amp; S PURELY GENTLE replaced SENSITIVE SCALP</li>
            <li> The Head and Shoulders brand is definitely my #1 pick for shampoo as it cleans my hair and leaves it smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> This appears to be an updated version of the previous Sensitive care shampoo which is my favorite.</li>
            <li> Also, usually dandruff shampoos are very strong and while they clear dandruff, they also tend to damage hair.</li>
            <li> The actual product is pretty normal (no qualms).</li>
            <li> The smell is light fake berry-ish, nothing potent.  </li>
            <li> Was surprised by this Head &amp; Shoulders because I&#x27;ve become used to things smelling a certain way, a certain medical like smell.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> My husband loves it thus far, and I have to admit I like it, too!</li>
            <li> I think part of the problem is that I normally don&#x27;t put conditioner near my scalp and with this product you have to.</li>
            <li> Enter Head &amp; Shoulders Dandruff shampoo, problem number one solved, dandruff is completely gone!</li>
            <li> It also has the same look and feel when it comes to actual use, and every bit as effective on dandruff control as their other H&amp;S products.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, H&amp;S is totally fine for an everyday shampoo.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have been using Head and Shoulders for my entire life well except for those early years where I don&#x27;t remember a whole lot.</li>
            <li> Recently, he has tried the 2 in 1 style and really likes the conditioning aspect of it.  </li>
            <li> My 4 year old son struggled with itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I usually stick to bumble and bumble or Bamboo but was finding my hair was becoming greasy after 24hrs.</li>
            <li> When my head gets really itchy though, I alternate in a tar gel product.</li>
            <li> I am used to conditioner that leaves my hair soft.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair surprisingly soft and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> Makes my scalp and hair feel soft and</li>
            <li> I have been trying a variety of Head and Shoulders shampoos lately and this is definitely my favorite.</li>
            <li> They should have never changed their old product that did work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type of shampoo for nearly a year now.  </li>
            <li> I would recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> B00VSC1C6A Skingenixx Professional Strength Hair Regrowth and Thickening Shampoo]]</li>
            <li> it made my hair feel soft and clean, maybe a little to conditioned</li>
            <li> I find that regular Head and Shoulders tends to dry out my scalp and hair too much, but that doesn&#x27;t happen with this Purely Gentle formula.</li>
            <li> Other shampoos and conditioners smell better, but don&#x27;t also include active ingredients.&lt;br</li>
            <li> had my fair share of bad shampoos, but this one is certainly tops the list.</li>
            <li> I need something gentle for my scalp; my general issue is that I have fine, thin hair and an itchy scalp that needs tender care.</li>
            <li> This specific SKU is also shampoo plus conditioner -- for my male thinning hair, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between it and product without conditioner.</li>
            <li> HEAD AND SHOULDERS BRING BACK THE SENSITIVE SCALP FORMULA!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think this is any big improvement on regular H&amp;S shampoo, which I usually buy, except for one thing: the light scent, which is much lighter than the regular formula.  </li>
            <li> My skin has also been a bit more sensitive and dry of late and it helps with that as well.</li>
            <li> In the past I have always bought different shampoos because I have never noticed a difference; however, this Head and Shoulders two in one has made a tremendous difference in my hair quality!</li>
            <li> H&amp;S left my hair feeling soft and moist.</li>
            <li> It left my hair soft, shiny and manageable and took care of my itchy scalp problem.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin necessarily, my wife does.  </li>
            <li> Mom used the old style Head &amp; Shoulders back in the 1960&#x27;s, and she still likes it.  </li>
            <li> the smell isn&#x27;t gross like the old stuff was.</li>
            <li> I have two big issues with my hair, the first is dandruff and the other is thinning hair.</li>
            <li> He didn&#x27;t notice anything especially different about this versus other types but his skin type is normal and someone with sensitive skin may have found a difference that he did nto.</li>
            <li> Yesterday, I washed my hair with it, but was really busy all day long to see what is going on.</li>
            <li> As my hair air dried as usual, my cowlicks started swirling (I don&#x27;t normally have issues with them) and little flyaway hairs rose up all over my head.</li>
            <li> I made fun of my boyfriend for using it but it has done wonders to my thin normal hair.</li>
            <li> my scalp is a little picky and will itch and flake if it doesn&#x27;t like a certain shampoo.</li>
            <li> Not only is my scalp dry &amp; sensitive, but my hair tends to be as well.  </li>
            <li> I like that Subscribe &amp; Save brings two large bottles to my door every few months at a discounted price</li>
            <li> But this is not true with H&amp;S, especially with Gentle Scalp Care, I have noticed lesser hair breakage.</li>
            <li> This flavor doesn&#x27;t seem to dry me out as bad and it is pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> I rarely care enough, especially when I keep my hair cut short, so a weak conditioner is usually no big</li>
            <li> This is the small H&amp;S bottle, not the large one.</li>
            <li> I actually purchased this for my Westie&#x27;s dry skin, but the Vet did not feel the PH was proper for a dog,</li>
            <li> Some products claim to include conditioner only to leave your hair feeling dry and tangled.</li>
            <li> It also made it feel coarse, dry and straw-</li>
            <li> Therefor many shampoos are a bit harsh for me and can make my problems worse instead of</li>
            <li> I have fewer flakes and feel a lot better about my hair when cold weather arrives.</li>
            <li> I have used H&amp;S for years, but I have always used the regular shampoo alongside a wide variety of conditioners.</li>
            <li> Still need separate conditioner if you have long hair.</li>
            <li> Strange.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders has always been well, head and shoulders above any other dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used and that hasn&#x27;t changed.</li>
            <li> My scalp gets really dry and itchy and flaky as well during the winter months</li>
            <li> I bought it for my husband to try on his dry scalp.</li>
            <li> The shampoo itself seems to work well since my husband has suffered from dry scalp for years</li>
            <li> It helped my dry scalp to stop itching after about a weeks use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve often commented in my reviews of their products that I like feeling that characteristic &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation so that I know that the product is working.  </li>
            <li> I currently have coconut and aloe vera branded products in my bathroom from H&amp;S - the smell is very similar - I can hardly tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products are standard at 1% pyrithione zinc, the medicinal anti-dandruff ingredient.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s certainly not worth the inflated price of a Hamilton, especially if you&#x27;re getting the 14 ounce bottle.</li>
            <li> He has thick dark hair, so flakes would be very noticeable.  </li>
            <li> like that it came in a plastic bag that would have prevented any leak from making a larger mess.</li>
            <li> I recently chopped off my hair and started over from scratch and along with the new growth is dandruff so this has been welcomed and works well my dandruff has significantly decreased.</li>
            <li> It is affordable and works as expected.</li>
            <li> It has a very mild fragrance that is neither unpleasant nor medicinal smelling.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders has really increased their lineup of products in the past few years, but I find there is actually little difference between SKUs.</li>
            <li> It was not overly dry yet not overly weighed down.  </li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders has upped their game lately and the products they are presenting are of a better quality than some I&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used head and shoulders before, neither had my mother she usually uses selson blue ex.</li>
            <li> little goes a long way, so it lasts forever.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He gets dandruff if he uses other shampoos.</li>
            <li> My Husband on the other hand likes this 2-in-1 formula.</li>
            <li> A small tad goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, and after using Head and Shoulders for years, it seemed to be irritating the skin around my hairline and contributing to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> My husband uses this shampoo every time he washes his hair as he has had issues with dandruff and dry scalp in the past.  </li>
            <li> No more dry itchy scalp</li>
            <li> Typical Head &amp; Shoulders product</li>
            <li> She has never noticed a problem with previous versions of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, but I could see how some people with sensative skin might.  </li>
            <li> He typically does not use conditioner.</li>
            <li> It also leaves one&#x27;s head smelling odd.  </li>
            <li> I wear black a lot</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that this bottle is a bit small.</li>
            <li> My hair has dried now, and it looks greasy as if I have not washed it in days.</li>
            <li> not one of my shampoos actually broke or were broken.</li>
            <li> like it&#x27;s been really dried out.</li>
            <li> The Shampoo feels harsh and irritated my scalp.  </li>
            <li> I was so tired of the white flakes on my shoulders and the hair in the drain after every shower.</li>
            <li> This is the most horrible shampoo I had ever tried in my life.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair cut really short, so it&#x27;s difficult for me to comment on how well it conditions my hair.</li>
            <li> , my husband said he thinks it is causing him to have breakouts, which he doesn&#x27;t usually get as often.  </li>
            <li> I have to use H&amp;S at least once a week to keep my flakes at bay.</li>
            <li> The conditioner part of the 2-in-1 formula is weak, but that is weak on all of the 2-in-1 formulas I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li> I had used a 2 in 1 before and was not particularly happy with how it made my hair feel and smell.</li>
            <li> Worse yet as if you hadn&#x27;t even washed your hair at all.  </li>
            <li> My husband has horrible dry scalp &amp; dandruff and Head and Shoulders seems to always do the job.</li>
            <li> The only bad side is the price (at nearly $10) is insane for a 13.5 oz bottle.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> If her dandruff is bad and itching her.</li>
            <li> It made your hair feel all dirty like you had used a ton of hair spray!</li>
            <li> , this was horrible for my hair.</li>
            <li> and it is a horrible replacement.  </li>
            <li> PG has a disgusting fragrance that gives me a headache.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> as expected good product</li>
            <li> Quality is Just like the price</li>
            <li> This Head &amp; Shoulder&#x27;s includes shampoo and conditioner and I really like it! Some products claim to include conditioner only to leave your hair feeling dry and tangled. H&amp;S left my hair feeling soft and moist. It has a nice light aloe scent and I have always trusted H&amp;S for dandruff control and have never had an issue. This is a great product that I recommend, suds up nicely without having to pile on the shampoo. The only bad side is the price (at nearly $10) is insane for a 13.5 oz bottle. This is the small H&amp;S bottle, not the large one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many no named &amp;#34;compare to&amp;#34; products but I keep coming back to this.  This is head and shoulders above the competition.</li>
            <li> I have always used Head &amp; Shoulders and it has consistently been a great performer. It is one of the most effective treatments to prevent dandruff and it also leaves my hair in great shape. This latest version is very mild and has a fruity aroma. Of course, it is not a baby shampoo and it stings if you get it in your eyes. Other than that, it is very mild on the scalp and skin. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that Head &amp; Shoulders have recently been releasing many new versions of their dependable shampoos and conditioners with new pleasant scents and this is no exception. This one has a really nice, aloe vera scent. It&#x27;s pleasant and satisfying. Gone is the medicinal smell. It also has the same look and feel when it comes to actual use, and every bit as effective on dandruff control as their other H&amp;S products. The white creamy shampoo lathers well and cleans well. A small tad goes a long way. Overall, another great product with a great smell.</li>
            <li> This product has nice smell and works great...my scalp is a little picky and will itch and flake if it doesn&#x27;t like a certain shampoo. this shampoo helps keep flaking and itchy to minimum...would buy again</li>
            <li> My husband has used Head and Shoulders for many years to control his dandruff.  Recently, he has tried the 2 in 1 style and really likes the conditioning aspect of it.  The Purely gentle scalp care is another great product in this line.  He liked the fragrance and the way it controls his scalp issues.  He didn&#x27;t notice anything especially different about this versus other types but his skin type is normal and someone with sensitive skin may have found a difference that he did nto.</li>
            <li> My husband has horrible dry scalp &amp; dandruff and Head and Shoulders seems to always do the job. We tried this one because it&#x27;s 2 in 1 and he&#x27;s a big fan of things being easy and fast in the shower. Smells good to boot!</li>
            <li> I have used H&amp;S for years, but I have always used the regular shampoo alongside a wide variety of conditioners. I had never used a 2-in-1 product like this. After using it for five applications I can say that I will no longer be purchasing two separate products. It seems a bit high on the conditioning side of things, but I like that. It also has a nice scent, no medicinal smell. Very happy to have a product that is both effective on dandruff and offers great conditioning benefits as well. Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> Great price to have. I love it.</li>
            <li> This smells so great and it really gets the dandruff out!</li>
            <li> My husband uses this shampoo every time he washes his hair as he has had issues with dandruff and dry scalp in the past.  He has thick dark hair, so flakes would be very noticeable.  Since starting to use Head &amp; Shoulders Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-in-1, he has been flake free.  It also smells great when washing and for a bit after washing.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last all day, which is good because I&#x27;m sensitive to smells.  Will keep buying forever!</li>
            <li> This cleans my hair well and rinses off nicely, but I&#x27;m not sure what the aloe is accomplishing.  This shampoo really makes my head tingle when I use it, and it kind of stings my forehead the longer I leave it on.  Isn&#x27;t aloe supposed to be soothing?  The conditioner part of the 2-in-1 formula is weak, but that is weak on all of the 2-in-1 formulas I&#x27;ve tried.  If you want a good conditioner, get a separate conditioner.  I rarely care enough, especially when I keep my hair cut short, so a weak conditioner is usually no big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t think this is any big improvement on regular H&amp;S shampoo, which I usually buy, except for one thing: the light scent, which is much lighter than the regular formula.  My wife has allergies to most strong scents, so this is better because of that.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair feeling waxy.</li>
            <li> Bought for promo price of $2.22 on 3/31/15. The actual product is pretty normal (no qualms). But the price was exceptional!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite &#x27;winter&#x27; shampoo. My scalp gets really dry and itchy and flaky as well during the winter months so this is the shampoo that I prefer during the colder months. It smells nice and keeps my head from itching me to death. I have fewer flakes and feel a lot better about my hair when cold weather arrives. We have used this shampoo for years and it does really well.</li>
            <li> This is the most horrible shampoo I had ever tried in my life. Yesterday, I washed my hair with it, but was really busy all day long to see what is going on. In the morning my hair felt really oily, but I was not blaming the shampoo at the moment, thought maybe I was sweating too much, or something. Then I went to have a shower and washed hair with the shampoo, it lathered up fine, but left my hair very greasy. Right away, I tried to wash it off with another shampoo, then another. I shampooed my hair 7 times, and I still feel there is some residue left in the hair on top of my head, where I used the most of the Head and Shoulders shampoo. Fells like I have peanut butter in my hair. My hair has dried now, and it looks greasy as if I have not washed it in days. My scalp is itchy and sore, too, but I am not blaming the shampoo, 7 subsequent shampooings would do this to any scalp. Looks like I am going to wear a hat today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had my fair share of bad shampoos, but this one is certainly tops the list.</li>
            <li> Some nice shampoo and the bottle lasts forever. I have short hair so i dont have to use a lot and this stuff is awesome.  It cleared up my scalp and has made my Hair nice and silky smooth. Will get again.</li>
            <li> I tend to suffer from extra greasy hair as we transition from winter to spring, and that inevitably leads to flakes and itching. I love that Head and Shoulders can clear that up in just a couple of washes. I find that regular Head and Shoulders tends to dry out my scalp and hair too much, but that doesn&#x27;t happen with this Purely Gentle formula.</li>
            <li> Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner 13.5 Fl Oz. My husband has always had a dry scalp, he is in love with this shampoo and conditioner. No more dry itchy scalp and he even likes the pleasant scent. It leaves his hair feeling clean and soft. I have enjoyed using it too.</li>
            <li> This is a great product! I bought it for my husband to try on his dry scalp. He noticed a difference in the reduction of flakes after 1 week of use.  He loves the tingle sensation this product provides. The clean scent is an added bonus. It is affordable and works as expected.</li>
            <li> First time ordering from Amazon and I must say the package came well-packed and not one of my shampoos actually broke or were broken. The shampoo itself seems to work well since my husband has suffered from dry scalp for years and we&#x27;ve noticed that his scalp has gotten better.</li>
            <li> Typical Head &amp; Shoulders product but with a gentle side to it and a pleasant scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been a while since I have used Head &amp; Shoulders and I was glad I had an opportunity to try this version out.  Not only is my scalp dry &amp; sensitive, but my hair tends to be as well.  Therefor many shampoos are a bit harsh for me and can make my problems worse instead of better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is very gentle and has a great fragrance to it. It lathers well and gets the job done as far as dandruff control goes with the added benefit of being gentle on my scalp.  I liked the way it left my hair afterwards too. It was not overly dry yet not overly weighed down.  Just right in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the one I will be buying in the future.</li>
            <li> Head and Shoulders has always been well, head and shoulders above any other dandruff shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used and that hasn&#x27;t changed. I love that they keep developing new products that address different kinds of scalp problems and on the surface, this was the perfect fit for me. I need something gentle for my scalp; my general issue is that I have fine, thin hair and an itchy scalp that needs tender care. Because I&#x27;m constantly putting my hands in it, I have to watch how oily the shampoo makes my hair, so a 2-in-1 seemed like it would be okay; I use a light shampoo and conditioner now, this didn&#x27;t seem like a big leap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, this was horrible for my hair. I could tell as soon as I rinsed it that there were going to be problems. The shampoo lathers well and smells fantastic, soft and slightly green, and it rinses quickly. As my hair air dried as usual, my cowlicks started swirling (I don&#x27;t normally have issues with them) and little flyaway hairs rose up all over my head. My generally healthy, shoulder length hair looked like a mass of straw.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend the 2-in-1 version of this product unless you have short hair; otherwise I suggest going for the separate shampoo and conditioner version.</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well.  Kind of leaves your hair feeling as though there&#x27;s a residue on it, though.  Overall, good product.</li>
            <li> My hair really feels amazing after using this! Some shampoos...especially dandruff shampoo can leave my hair feeling like it&#x27;s been really dried out. This just makes it look and feel healthy. I also haven&#x27;t noticed any itching or flaking which is also amazing. It&#x27;s got a great smell, too...very fresh and clean. I use Head and Shoulders products almost exclusively on my hair, and I&#x27;m never disappointed in how they make my hair and scalp look and feel.</li>
            <li> Was surprised by this Head &amp; Shoulders because I&#x27;ve become used to things smelling a certain way, a certain medical like smell.  This is aloe vera scented and it smells really good.  Other shampoos and conditioners smell better, but don&#x27;t also include active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Helps cut down on flakes for me (which is the entire point), smells good, and is a good price.</li>
            <li> oh man, i love it so much.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband and because it was a great deal! My husband loves it thus far, and I have to admit I like it, too! The smell is fantastic to boot!</li>
            <li> Funny thing, I always pictured head &amp; shoulders for older people with dandruff. My 4 year old son struggled with itchy scalp. After searching, I went with this. It smells amazing &amp; works great!! After washing his hair ONE time he wasn&#x27;t itchy anymore! I recommend this product</li>
            <li> Great product in a nice size container.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it seems that as I&#x27;m getting older dandruff is becoming more of a problem. I started using this shampoo, and after three weeks things have really improved. So it appears to be effective. I&#x27;m pleased (as is my wife!). I&#x27;ll continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works as a shampoo and keeps my hair clean. This is 2-in-1, with conditioner. I keep my hair cut really short, so it&#x27;s difficult for me to comment on how well it conditions my hair.</li>
            <li> Purely Gentle is easy on the scalp while giving you that Head and Shoulders protection that they are so known for. I have been using Head and Shoulders for my entire life well except for those early years where I don&#x27;t remember a whole lot. It certainly helps contain the flakes and the 2 in 1 protection washes and conditions. My whole family uses it and loves it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received this product at a discounted price and i can not wait to use it.Thank you so much. Excellent quality</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner is great. It smells really good and leaves my hair smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week and love it. It works great. Nice volume, pleasant smell, and no flakes. What more can you ask for from a dandruff shampoo?</li>
            <li> Got rid of my dandruff. Does the job. No negatives!</li>
            <li> This appears to be an updated version of the previous Sensitive care shampoo which is my favorite. It is the only shampoo that doesn&#x27;t make my head itch and yet doesn&#x27;t turn my hair into straw.</li>
            <li> It made your hair feel all dirty like you had used a ton of hair spray!</li>
            <li> Great product with excellent price using coupon</li>
            <li> This has been my go to brand for itchy scalp for years. This new formulation is as good as the old and smells better. It left my hair soft, shiny and manageable and took care of my itchy scalp problem.</li>
            <li> Smells great and feels luxurious. I like it better than Pantene. I do use a separate conditioner so can&#x27;t speak for its conditioning abilities.</li>
            <li> Shipped fast. Great product.</li>
            <li> I usually stick to bumble and bumble or Bamboo but was finding my hair was becoming greasy after 24hrs. Head &amp; Shoulders is a great shampoo to switch up products. It keeps my hair healthy for 2 days with no product but just blow drying. I made fun of my boyfriend for using it but it has done wonders to my thin normal hair.</li>
            <li> Works great at getting rid of my dandruff problem and leave my hair feeling clean for a long time. 1 star off cause even though it&#x27;s a 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner, it doesn&#x27;t really moisturize my hair any more than just shampoo alone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really used head and shoulders before, neither had my mother she usually uses selson blue ex. If her dandruff is bad and itching her. But there was a really good deal on this that I couldn&#x27;t pass up, and with its rating and the product info I thought this could be a great opportunity to try something new... It was packaged great, it came in the box with my other prime products ( really not excited for the day my prime free trail ends! But it just costs way way way to much) and it was wrapped in plastic just incase I guess if it leaked so it wouldn&#x27;t get on my other items, it came fast actually a few days before the estimated arrival time and so far it&#x27;s a pretty good shampoo! The only reason I docked a star is ,after my mother used it i interviewed her, and she said she loved it, it smells so good, lathered easy and rinsed easy, it made her hair feel/ look soft and clean but her head still itched from her dandruff, she said selson blue was better with keeping her head not to itch, you couldn&#x27;t see her dandruff but she still could feel it I guess...i used it it made my hair feel soft and clean, maybe a little to conditioned but I like it and would recommend as of right now, the more I use it, if any thing changes I will update my review..</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders has really increased their lineup of products in the past few years, but I find there is actually little difference between SKUs. The biggest difference is the smell, which has changed over the years from something with moderate medicinal odor to a sweeter smell with a hint of whatever scent they label on the bottle. I currently have coconut and aloe vera branded products in my bathroom from H&amp;S - the smell is very similar - I can hardly tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The products are standard at 1% pyrithione zinc, the medicinal anti-dandruff ingredient. This specific SKU is also shampoo plus conditioner -- for my male thinning hair, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference between it and product without conditioner. Your mileage may vary, but I&#x27;m not too picky -- I lather it in and rinse and then simply want my hair to feel clean and relatively smooth. Not too much dandruff here with the warm California winters, but I do occasionally have an itchy scalp and H&amp;S does help alleviate that. When my head gets really itchy though, I alternate in a tar gel product. Otherwise, H&amp;S is totally fine for an everyday shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s certainly not worth the inflated price of a Hamilton, especially if you&#x27;re getting the 14 ounce bottle. Until Amazon itself stocks it regularly, take a look at your local warehouse store for a much better value.</li>
            <li> ...and good on the hair too. Head &amp; Shoulders has upped their game lately and the products they are presenting are of a better quality than some I&#x27;ve used in the past. This is a good shampoo that works well on the hair and scalp. I don&#x27;t need to use a separate conditioner when using this. This is a great shampoo I actually use as a soap on my body. It works, and looks like it minimized dandruff issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Kort</li>
            <li> Somehow it works as advertised - no flaking yet hair is conditioned. For an all-in-one, it&#x27;s a reliable solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it came in a plastic bag that would have prevented any leak from making a larger mess. There was no leak, I just appreciated getting this packaged well.</li>
            <li> While I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin necessarily, my wife does.  She has never noticed a problem with previous versions of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, but I could see how some people with sensative skin might.  I&#x27;ve often commented in my reviews of their products that I like feeling that characteristic &amp;#34;burning&amp;#34; sensation so that I know that the product is working.  This doesn&#x27;t have that, which is a little worrying, but I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my hair since using it, so it must be doing a good job.</li>
            <li> the lid was open when i got it. the shampoo was everywhere</li>
            <li> I love this 2 in 1. I had used a 2 in 1 before and was not particularly happy with how it made my hair feel and smell. This Head and Shoulders though is different. It smells nice and It left my hair feeling nice (and with no dandruff!!!) I will def buy this again and would recommend it to anyone who has dandruff problems.</li>
            <li> Would purchase next time works great for my hair</li>
            <li> My Daughter likes the gentle but effective results from this Head &amp; Shoulders product. I like that Subscribe &amp; Save brings two large bottles to my door every few months at a discounted price I can not beat locally.</li>
            <li> It perfectly does it work as a dandruff shampoo. No dandruff or itching at all after using any Head &amp; Shoulder shampoo but the application has to be repeated after 4-5 days. Also, usually dandruff shampoos are very strong and while they clear dandruff, they also tend to damage hair. But this is not true with H&amp;S, especially with Gentle Scalp Care, I have noticed lesser hair breakage.</li>
            <li> Great product for price!</li>
            <li> Great product! Received a coupon code for This which made this shampoo 1.98$ thank you!</li>
            <li> I have been using Head and Shoulders shampoo for years, with excellent results.  The new 2 in 1 purely gentle scalp care is even better.  It not only controls flakes and dandruff, but is very friendly to the scalp.  I&#x27;m sure the addition of Aloe Vera and other healing agents have helped to accomplish the gentleness to the scalp.  I highly recommend this new Head and Shoulders shampoo!</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel great</li>
            <li> My Husband uses Head &amp; Shoulders on a daily basis. He gets dandruff if he uses other shampoos. He typically does not use conditioner. I use a variety of regular shampoo and conditioner combos. We both tested out this new Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-in-1 Shampoo and Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally did not like the shampoo and conditioner combo. I have straight, soft and sometimes oily hair. It made my hair really, really oily looking at the scalp after a few hours. It also made it feel coarse, dry and straw-like immediately after rinsing it out of my hair. I am used to conditioner that leaves my hair soft. I think part of the problem is that I normally don&#x27;t put conditioner near my scalp and with this product you have to. My Husband on the other hand likes this 2-in-1 formula. He said it left his hair feeling clean and soft. I felt his hair and it really did feel soft. It also kept his dandruff away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a great shampoo and conditioner combo if it is right for your hair type. Luckily, my Husband is the true Head &amp; Shoulders fan in the house and he liked it. Therefore, I am giving my star rating based on his experience.</li>
            <li> It is not the H&amp;S from your youth.  Great scent, works well!  I love having the shampoo and conditioner together in one quick step in the mornings before work!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo for dry scalp</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair surprisingly soft and conditioned.  I actually purchased this for my Westie&#x27;s dry skin, but the Vet did not feel the PH was proper for a dog, so now I use it.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with dandruff, but it does keep my scalp and hair feeling good.  I recommend.  Very gentle.</li>
            <li> Great product. Loved the smell. I wished it would have come in a bigger size though. Will order again when I place my next order.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this every gentle doesn&#x27;t have the menthol that burns your scalp.</li>
            <li> The Head and Shoulders brand is definitely my #1 pick for shampoo as it cleans my hair and leaves it smelling fresh. Also, it is the #1 dermatologist recommended brand of shampoo to use and it has healing effects on the scalp and on the skin. I have been using these for years and my hair feels natural and great all the time. I will continue to use for the years to come.</li>
            <li> I suffer from dandruff a couple times of year.  I appreciate the head &amp; shoulders line for coming up with new scents to keep my scalp and hair feeling fresh.</li>
            <li> Great stuff. Makes my scalp and hair feel soft and clean- best yet, no signs of dandruff! I would buy again for sure!</li>
            <li> DOES THE JOB RIGHT FOR A GOOD PRICE</li>
            <li> Head and shoulders is a good shampoo.  I&#x27;ve used it for about 100 years, never had any dandruff, works good.</li>
            <li> To me this has the feel of &amp;#34;gentle&amp;#34; as defined by &amp;#34;baby shampoo.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels light to the touch, light in the hair, and the hair feels soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a fan of &amp;#34;Head &amp; Shoulders&amp;#34; so this is another great product from them.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, always use this shampoo.Hair is  good. so is the mood. if anyone ask about shampoo i will recommended.</li>
            <li> This is a very gentle shampoo and conditioner that does not tingle or sting your scalp.  It does not have the tar in it that the neutropenia dandruff soaps have, it&#x27;s much more mild. It helped my dry scalp to stop itching after about a weeks use.  The smell is light fake berry-ish, nothing potent.  I have long hair and can brush it out easily after washing with this, no crazy tangles.  Overall, it&#x27;s smooth and silky and I like it.  No complaints.</li>
            <li> I have been trying a variety of Head and Shoulders shampoos lately and this is definitely my favorite. It leaves hair very manageable and soft. and it seems to have reduced the itchiness of my scalp and is controlling dandruff. It has a very mild fragrance that is neither unpleasant nor medicinal smelling. All in all a good anti-dandruff product that I would buy again.</li>
            <li> HEAD AND SHOULDERS BRING BACK THE SENSITIVE SCALP FORMULA!  I previously used and loved Head and Shoulders SENSITIVE SCALP which also used Aloe Vera.  H &amp; S PURELY GENTLE replaced SENSITIVE SCALP and it is a horrible replacement.  I have a very sensitive scalp and am allergic to many things but I didn&#x27;t seem to have a problem with the SENSITIVE SCALP Head and Shoulders and the fragrance was minimal which is better for peole with allergies.  PG has a disgusting fragrance that gives me a headache.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to rinse out of your hair and leaves your hair so oily that it becomes flattened.  Worse yet as if you hadn&#x27;t even washed your hair at all.  I called corporate Head and Shoulders to complain.  The Shampoo feels harsh and irritated my scalp.  If they are advertising it as being &amp;#34;PURELY GENTLE&amp;#34; then why did they add so much conditioner and fragrance.  Yuck!  They should have never changed their old product that did work.</li>
            <li> My husband has dandruff and this is the only shampoo that helps keep his hair free and clean!  I love the scent!</li>
            <li> good price and product.&lt;br /&gt;wasn&#x27;t packaged well at all and leaked inside box.&lt;br /&gt;some masking tape keeping top from coming undone could have prevented that.</li>
            <li> In the past I have always bought different shampoos because I have never noticed a difference; however, this Head and Shoulders two in one has made a tremendous difference in my hair quality! All my friends and family even noticed the improvement in my hair!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping! Great price, and great product!</li>
            <li> Works well and has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li> Works great. I don&#x27;t have scalp anymore and my head feels great. My only complaint is that this bottle is a bit small.</li>
            <li> I have to use H&amp;S at least once a week to keep my flakes at bay. Usually I dread this because the shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell great and it dries my hair out. This flavor doesn&#x27;t seem to dry me out as bad and it is pleasant smelling.</li>
            <li> I did not like the way my hair felt after using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> No problems at all with this transaction as everything went smoothly.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and feels great when lathering it on my hair. The 13.5 fl oz. bottle size is perfect when I travel and the cap stays on tight without any leaks. No flakes &#x3D; a great day!</li>
            <li> Excellent price, good quality</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. Still need separate conditioner if you have long hair. Smells great and leaves hair feeling great like all Head and Shoulders I&#x27;ve tried. Even works great for kids that have a stubborn case of craddle cap.</li>
            <li> This Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2-in-1 Dandruff Shampoo + Conditioner works wonderfully. It&#x27;s a plus that it has conditioner included..and of course aloe is always a plus as well. I recently chopped off my hair and started over from scratch and along with the new growth is dandruff so this has been welcomed and works well my dandruff has significantly decreased. My skin has also been a bit more sensitive and dry of late and it helps with that as well. Its good stuff for a good price... definitely recommended!</li>
            <li> This is my regular shampoo and I find it does a great job of controlling dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way, so it lasts forever.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is good for men or women as it&#x27;s a very light, clean, fresh fragrance.</li>
            <li> Its a nice product but it came open and was leaked throughout the package....so a percentage of it was gone</li>
            <li> Does not work well, leaves flakes.  It also leaves one&#x27;s head smelling odd.  I will not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> I got this shampoo, strictly as a shampoo. I do however, wrestle. Its cool that it has dandruff control but i don&#x27;t have that problem. I&#x27;ve seen some of the guys get ringworm on their scalps, perhaps this shampoo prevents it. I wear black a lot so its a good &amp;#34;safety net&amp;#34; to have. It has a really pleasant odor and does a good job of removing the dirt oil and sweat I accumulate throughout a day/workout.</li>
            <li> Great price for H&amp;S shampoo. Decent smell too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type of shampoo for nearly a year now.  After many years of battling dandruff, I&#x27;ve finally found my remedy.</li>
            <li> It has been some time since I used a Head &amp; Shoulders product so I decided to give it another try.  It gets the hair clean and the scalp feeling fresh.  It contains everything I could ask for in a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have this on subscribe and save. I have noticed an improvement in the thickness of my hair since I started using head and shoulders regularly. Even my hair stylist noticed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been going through a shampoo identity crisis.  I have extremely sensitive skin, and after using Head and Shoulders for years, it seemed to be irritating the skin around my hairline and contributing to breakouts.  I&#x27;ve been shampoo experimenting for the last couple of months.&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather much, which would be okay if I felt like it was still doing its job.  However, I can&#x27;t really tell I&#x27;ve used it.  In a way, I guess that is appealing, because it is very light and doesn&#x27;t leave any residue.  I guess I just expect to be able to tell when I&#x27;ve just shampooed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also, my husband said he thinks it is causing him to have breakouts, which he doesn&#x27;t usually get as often.  We will probably use up the bottle, but won&#x27;t be buying again.  Time to look for the next experiment!</li>
            <li> This kind of head and shoulders in a little gentler but I really can&#x27;t tell much of a difference. It has a nice fresh smell to it and it doesn&#x27;t dry my hair or scalp. I would recommend it if you have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Mom used the old style Head &amp; Shoulders back in the 1960&#x27;s, and she still likes it.  For her nursing home it is perfect having the conditioner with it. Nice big bottle for good price and the smell isn&#x27;t gross like the old stuff was.</li>
            <li> Good product and it does what it should do, prevent Dandruff. Great low price also.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years and wish they hadn&#x27;t changed the original formula(sensitive) but what can you do?  I still use and like but not as much.</li>
            <li> I love Head and Shoulders, and this one smells great.  However, it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave my hair as clean as the others do.  Strange.</li>
            <li> Head &amp; Shoulders Classic Clean 2 in 1 Dandruff Shampoo &amp; Conditioner is better. This is OK</li>
            <li> Been using Head &amp; Shoulders Purely Gentle Scalp Care 2 in 1 shampoo &amp; conditioner for some time now and love it. Great smell and no flakes seen. Also, it does seem to soothe the scalp. Don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s my imagination or not, but I don&#x27;t care. Love it.</li>
            <li> There is nothing I love more than Head and Shoulders!!! I will use this products until the day I die! absolutely recommend any version of this product!! I use this product not only on me, but my entire family (including my dog!!) It works like a charm</li>
            <li> I received this product in exchange for an HONEST review. Never used head and shoulders before, but it did smell good, would probably buy again :)</li>
            <li> Short and to the point:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not much to say.  A good shampoo at a good price.  No problems with the order or item.</li>
            <li> I have two big issues with my hair, the first is dandruff and the other is thinning hair. I was so tired of the white flakes on my shoulders and the hair in the drain after every shower. Enter Head &amp; Shoulders Dandruff shampoo, problem number one solved, dandruff is completely gone! Problem number two, my thinning hair, enter Skingenixx Hair Regrowth Shampoo [[ASIN:B00VSC1C6A Skingenixx Professional Strength Hair Regrowth and Thickening Shampoo]] – my hair is thicker and fuller after only 6 weeks of use. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> It lathered up nicely.  No burn.  Will have to see how effective it is.</li>
            <li> Love the smell of this. Makes my hair very soft</li>
            <li> Great product and a great buy on Amazon!</li>
