            <li>That&#x27;s why even though I saw genuinely impressive results after two days of using the AcneFree kit, I held off writing this review until now.    </li>

            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m one happy acne free girl!!!</li>
            <li>Neutrogena much better!!</li>

            <li>It is AMAZING!  </li>

            <li>Worked fairly well for my 15 year-old son.</li>
            <li>I started using Acnefree and had fairly good results.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has worked fairly well for me.</li>
            <li>Hope this review help and good luck with the battle against acne.</li>
            <li>but i have a really good moisturizer to battle with that.</li>
            <li>and i figured this would be good to try</li>
            <li>Well, acnefree it was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li>I literally had convinced myself that I was never going to have good skin..</li>
            <li>someone tried rubbing it off which they didn&#x27;t do a good job at.</li>
            <li>Good luck in finding your acne answer.</li>
            <li>Good, but not as good as proactive.</li>
            <li>But still a good product.</li>
            <li>Product worked great during warm moist months.</li>
            <li>Good Stuff ..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as good as proactive</li>
            <li>The toner has witch hazel in it which is good for healing acne and acne scars.  </li>
            <li>the result is fairy good.</li>
            <li>Now to the good stuff.      </li>
            <li>Not as good, and</li>
            <li>This order came promptly, well-packaged and is a good value.  </li>
            <li>Its making me not want to buy it anymore... works good though</li>
            <li>but it just makes me feel good to have the roughness.     </li>
            <li>Good News:</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s nice to have attractive skin again.</li>
            <li>If you miss a day here and then, you shouldn&#x27;t expect good results.</li>
            <li>i used to use) and works almost as good or just as good.</li>
            <li>Good sale.</li>
            <li>Good product for the price.</li>
            <li>I read on this website to give the medicine a good 4-6 weeks, so I stuck in there.</li>
            <li>and I have used my fair share of acne products.</li>
            <li>Even though the MK acne products didnt work for me, there are still tons of amazing skin care products and these moisturizers make the skin feel amazing!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always taken excellent care of my skin, and had mild acne.</li>
            <li>I was very pleased with my order.</li>
            <li>so I decided to try the Severe Acne treatment and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li>I eat very healthily.....</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s completely worth it for my skin to be awesome.</li>
            <li>ALso i eat very healthy and take vitamins.</li>
            <li>She now uses a treatment kind of like the one on acne.org, it works good for her.</li>
            <li>Great product, great price, quick delivery</li>
            <li>but its the best thing right now.</li>
            <li>In just three days, my acne has cleared up and my skin looks better than ever!  </li>
            <li>A much better price than Proactiv!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li>I bought this product and at first thought it was wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I wanted to look beautiful and acne free.</li>
            <li>Be sure to test it on your skin before you use it!</li>
            <li>Proactive has never done this, and in my opinion i think Proactive works much better!  </li>
            <li>It must be the ACNE FREE product!!&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I love it!  </li>
            <li>Preventative care is much better than dealing with acne once it develops!  </li>
            <li>Since using this product, I&#x27;ve been complemented on my complexion many times, something I never thought I&#x27;d hear!  </li>
            <li>We love it!</li>
            <li>More Like \\&quot;FreeAcne\\&quot;, because that&#x27;s what you get when you use this product!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the Murad line for acne skin and found this product worked better for a fraction of the price!  </li>
            <li>im satisfied!</li>
            <li>It has a oil free purifying cleanser, renewing toner and repair lotion and comes in a very attractive packaging with easy instructions.</li>
            <li>Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li>The difference in my skin is amazing.  </li>
            <li>But this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li>It works amazingly.</li>
            <li>The toner is amazing</li>
            <li>I saw all the great reviews about Acne Free and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>Honestly the best thing for clear skin is a good diet and drinking water.</li>
            <li>He continued using it on his own and began seeing results.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any unusual or timely breakouts from use of the product line, but Kardashian&#x27;s Perfect Skin cleanser always seemed to cause pimples on my skin anytime I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>so I had decided to try the Perfect Skin cleanser again, but much to my dismay,</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>I used this product for 2 1/2 days and was thrilled with it until this evening.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wonderful, affordable, and really works.</li>
            <li>Still I loved it and you can love it too,</li>
            <li>I am using something to try to combat the scarring, but it hasn&#x27;t been that effective.</li>
            <li>When I opened the package the two products that have expiration dates we&#x27;re expired and it looked liked</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve told my sisters so they can have nice skin.</li>
            <li>After a week, I was absolutely thrilled.  </li>
            <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how Proactive is still in business after AcneFree came out</li>
            <li>and I liked the smell of the products</li>
            <li>Do they not have any kind of quality control at all?</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own (and my son&#x27;s).</li>
            <li>I all but gave up hope of finding an effective treatment.</li>
            <li>, so I especially liked the fact that this kit included a gentle benzoyl peroxide lotion.     </li>
            <li>and I am happy to say I am more than pleased with the results....</li>
            <li>I did not think this product did anything to be honest.</li>
            <li>it works just as good or better than proactive</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>, I am glad word of mouth is still the way we share good news.</li>
            <li>Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li>It is gentle yet effective and does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li>so i tried this because it&#x27;s supposed to be just as effective...</li>
            <li>And I just want you reviewers out there to know that I got this product for free to try and review, but all opinions (AND RESULTS!!) are 100% my own :)</li>
            <li>We received this for free to sample and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>Cheaper and more easily available than ProActive, this product works great.  </li>
            <li>I can honestly say that this is the most amazing product</li>
            <li>But as a mild benzoyl peroxide product, this one is great.  </li>
            <li>Quick delivery , great product.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of all of my pimples, but it&#x27;s cleared my skin up a fair bit which is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works awesome for adult acne.  </li>
            <li>and i think i&#x27;m breaking out even more to be honest.</li>
            <li>now i can&#x27;t find anything to clear it up perfectly.</li>
            <li>so i started using Klear action - it was great!</li>
            <li>That is because the best way to treat acne is prevent it, not try and clear it up.  </li>
            <li>Just like ProActive, but honestly, I think better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best I have ever tried for clear skin.</li>
            <li>I am so thrilled we just love this product.  </li>
            <li>not a bad product really effective!</li>
            <li>This is especially true if you wait a while for the toner (I tend to run out of that the quickest) to dry and set 100% before applying the lotion, which I find to be the best route.</li>
            <li>these product are too strong!</li>
            <li>It is very important to use all three steps.  </li>
            <li>, I really liked how easy it was to use too.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thrilled that something so easy to get would work so much better than any hyped up product.  </li>
            <li>It is very smooth and calming and refreshing.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got the opportunity to try otherwise</li>
            <li>He began suffering from acne last year and though it bothers him, he hasn&#x27;t been the best at keeping routine to wash and take care of his skin.</li>
            <li>sure to check the date on the box to receive product with maximum efficacy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This can lead to more breakouts once you moisturize in order to offset the dryness and dehydration.</li>
            <li>as I&#x27;d emailed them via their website.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, and good luck, everyone.e it appear more clear, bright and even-toned.</li>
            <li>She has more self confidence now and has been more outgoing</li>
            <li>Plus, my skin tone was more even.</li>
            <li>thought maybe combining both would provide better results.</li>
            <li>But I really think this combo is worth a shot, I am very impressed with how well it worked for me.</li>
            <li>Works real quick.</li>
            <li>it has cleared up most my acne</li>
            <li>but overall best one i have ever tried.</li>
            <li>This product made my skin break out more.</li>
            <li>Spend the $10 more and get severe.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m fed up -- I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, but I&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
            <li>We started using the Acne Free and it cleared her up!</li>
            <li>After a year of use, my skin is still much better that it once was</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll probably love it.    </li>
            <li>Okay what regement were you on before you started using this?</li>
            <li>and I had to go to eBay to order more toner after just a week, but</li>
            <li>After about three weeks I started to notice that I was getting more breakouts, but I wasn;t worried, because products like this are supposed to make you break out</li>
            <li>But part of me feels like if this were stronger medicine it would have had a better effect.</li>
            <li>I experience most on jaw area from hormones or stress, etc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many treatments, including ProActive which didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li>face NEVER cleared up and, in fact, I broke out even more.</li>
            <li>I tried sticking to it for about a month just to see and it just never got better.</li>
            <li>This system is fabulous!</li>
            <li>This product creates more problems than it fixes plus all of my clothes have bleach marks.</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>but I love it</li>
            <li>but when I switched to the twice a day regime I took out the toner and everything seemed to be ok.</li>
            <li>The whole process works great for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We are going to try olive oil to return the skin to healthy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s relatively cheap!  </li>
            <li>And then get Accutane:).</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Then it started getting better</li>
            <li>It feels more like a lotion; as if i am applying lotion to my face and then rinsing it off.</li>
            <li>Do you want more break outs and a greasy face?  </li>
            <li>I thought I knew better by now.  </li>
            <li>Curse you Acne Free!</li>
            <li>Most of the pimples went away</li>
            <li>but when I used the so-called \\&quot;Repairing Lotion\\&quot;, it CAUSED more pimples.</li>
            <li>and it is doing a much better job.  </li>
            <li>Got this as a free sample from smiley360 and it works amazingly well and cleared up my face in just a matter of days.</li>
            <li>By the forth day, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looked.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years and love the results.</li>
            <li>A couple of tips to make sure this works for you:  1.</li>
            <li>Seems to work okay.</li>
            <li>as well, and for the price it&#x27;s a better deal for me</li>
            <li>The cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather, which is okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I switched over from Proactive to AcneFree.</li>
            <li>To me it seems likes the product works much better.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s 1000x better and cheaper.</li>
            <li>it has cleared up most my acne</li>
            <li>Also, any redness caused by the acne has also disappeared, and my skin tone is even and healthy looking.    </li>
            <li>I just need to do a better job, I suppose.    </li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>When I saw acnefree claimed to work better than proactive, and reminding me of how well proactive worked for me, I had to give this stuff a try.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of proactive, but for me, works even better.</li>
            <li>It is a superb quality item at a price that simply cannot be beat.</li>
            <li>We had to make sure that he always had plenty of lotion applied to his skin.  </li>
            <li>The Toner doesn&#x27;t sting and its not sticky like most acne toners.</li>
            <li>And I am really glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li>My skin has gotten even better with fewer breakouts and more even texture.</li>
            <li>This product worked much better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li>it gets a lot better</li>
            <li>and then it stops and doesnt get better than that</li>
            <li>&#x3D;) .</li>
            <li>I just use the #3 repair lotion, and nothing I found is better.</li>
            <li>(this did not work at all, it made him break out even more, this was after a week of using this product.  </li>
            <li>Just make sure</li>
            <li>, I was going to order more</li>
            <li>I was told they are constantly tweaking their product to see what people like best.</li>
            <li>If you find a product that clears most of your acne, then stick with it.</li>
            <li>Luck :)</li>
            <li>I have always had much better results with the Proactiv System.</li>
            <li>This just was not the product for me! :)</li>
            <li>I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Preventative care is much better than dealing with acne once it develops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>When I saw so many people say that AcneFree works better than ProActiv, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really glad I found this</li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m confident that my face will be cleared up before I go.</li>
            <li>I love my skin, I&#x27;m 36</li>
            <li>and it does make your face a touch softer without you know, putting more chemicals on your face.</li>
            <li>Most products tell you not to apply to the eye area.</li>
            <li>I love this product...</li>
            <li>I love it...</li>
            <li>Some days I use it twice, but most days I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>decided not to use it any more      </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Purifying cleanser 1 night and realized that with my old-mom-skin that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this every night.</li>
            <li>nights passed and she was okay.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a while now and love it.</li>
            <li>It keep us both pimple free!</li>
            <li>The part i enjoyed was it set a skin routine for her that she still follows now.</li>
            <li>I have been using this as directed for almost a week now, and I already see greater clarity.</li>
            <li>it seems to work better if you wash any makeup off your face before cleansing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 25, but I still have acne from stress and too many sweets, so I try to remember to use this stuff every day.  </li>
            <li>I love this</li>
            <li>Maybe it won&#x27;t work for everyone but to someone who has tried most and tried Pro Activ</li>
            <li>I am so glad I took the chance and tried something that compares to Pro Activ, it never had a reverse effect where I broke out before it got better</li>
            <li>My skin is glowing :)</li>
            <li>After being fed up with most supposed \\&quot;miracle</li>
            <li>By the second week, I had absolutely perfect skin.</li>
            <li>This product works better than anything else.</li>
            <li>More than a month out: Acne is close to zero.</li>
            <li>- I just wanted it to get better.</li>
            <li>I was using proactiv before, which helped a lot, but then I saw this in store that said \\&quot;works better than proactiv\\&quot;(What a crock of poop),so</li>
            <li>more vegetable and fruit...... drink more water......</li>
            <li>Most of my breakouts are in the chin area.</li>
            <li>That being said, it is clearing up the acne, and my skin is looking better day by day.</li>
            <li>and I could feel the effects of drying a bit, mostly under my eyes, so</li>
            <li>I need to give it more time to see if it has any preventative qualities as well.</li>
            <li>So I would make sure you didnt get a product that was out of date or something.</li>
            <li>I am glad there is no foul smell to the products.</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>everything ive tried worked OK.</li>
            <li>and i just bought 2 for $10.99 each love the product but its way over priced here</li>
            <li>and omggg my face looks better than it has in a longggg time.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also happen to love this line...</li>
            <li>There is no practical purpose for these microbeads given that using a cotton pad with their step 2 toner exfoliates better than microbeads.  </li>
            <li>In four, it felt better and looked better than it had in years.</li>
            <li>my skin looks so much better</li>
            <li>I, however, have tried many many products since my 20s till now</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll give it a try two more weeks and will update my rating if it improve.  </li>
            <li>I have tried all sorts of treatments including many prescription medications and even antibiotics.  </li>
            <li>However, Acnefree is better than all of them.  </li>
            <li>I had been getting them mostly on my cheeks, and I wanted something that would get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>ABSO love</li>
            <li>Product was as advertised, I haven&#x27;t used it at this time so this isn&#x27;t overly appropriate.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t find a better price anywhere</li>
            <li>And all I recommend to try this is an acceptable price :)</li>
            <li>I love this face wash.</li>
            <li>This is a great product, it really works.</li>
            <li>sure you never miss a day.</li>
            <li>Works better.</li>
            <li>My complexion got a lot better and then started to decline about 2 years ago when I stopped using birth control.</li>
            <li>Results will always vary from person to person so I am glad I did not get my hopes up.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased as punch to have the opportunity for my son to try this product.</li>
            <li>I love Proactic</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this system for about 3 months now, and I love it.</li>
            <li>but i really hope that acne free will work, even if it&#x27;s taking forever for me to see RESULTS!!!</li>
            <li>I have dealt with super oily, very acne-prone skin for thirty years, and I honeslty didn&#x27;t expect the kind of great results that I have achieved with this product line.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really want to try Acnefree at first because my best friend told me that it \\&quot;sucks.\\&quot;</li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling very clean.</li>
            <li>and it worked pretty good for a while</li>
            <li>I purchase at the warehouse stores and the price is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>an hastle folks try it for the first time or switch to it for good</li>
            <li>In my experience using it for 3 days, as it promised, showed a great difference, clearing breakouts and preventing new ones.</li>
            <li>I am a new happy user.</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t too great, but it&#x27;s not disgusting or someone that will completely put you off.</li>
            <li>Gentle and pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li>Good price for such a good product.</li>
            <li>i think for me the BP ingredient was way too strong for my skin(i have pretty fair colored skin) but</li>
            <li>Great price, super fast delivery!</li>
            <li>My husband is on proactiv and it works fine too, it just costs more money.</li>
            <li>I loved the way it cleared up my acne and made my skin feel, but didn&#x27;t love the high price tag that came with it.</li>
            <li>This has been easily remedied with a rich moisturizer (I found Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Lotion with SPF 15 for the day, and Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream for night use to work</li>
            <li>I like Acne Free better than Proactiv.</li>
            <li>I have even tried the severe (all orange packaging) and found that it works brilliantly to jump start the process of clearing up your face - by about the end of the \\&quot;severe\\&quot; and using it daily (not nightly)</li>
            <li>My makeup also looks great when my skin is so clear and non-greasy.    </li>
            <li>and it said better than proactiv and had a free acnefree terminator with it</li>
            <li>Thanks, and good luck, everyone.</li>
            <li>I know that not everything works for everyone, but having clearer skin is nice, so this might be worth a shot for you too.</li>
            <li>I was ready to just throw in the towl and see a dermatologist thinking that if I didnt I would be stuck with this for the rest of my life, and my sister saw a dermatologist and had good results.</li>
            <li>It works very well just as good as proactive.</li>
            <li>After this I switched right to proactiv and my skin is now Acnefree because of proavtic!!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for over 5 years; it made a huge difference from the first time I used it to this day!!!</li>
            <li>it may be worth your while, and no expensive commercials or famous actors to stand by it either!!</li>
            <li>but frankly, dont have that kind of money right now.</li>
            <li>My face is smooth, clean &amp; at the rate AcneFree is working, I should look flawless in the next week or so.</li>
            <li>It would make it appear more clear, bright and even-toned.</li>
            <li>All I have is healthy skin that feels and looks smooth and blemish free.</li>
            <li>but after a few more days I have had and continue to have the best skin i have ever had.</li>
            <li>It works and it has three easy steps.</li>
            <li>and it goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li>It is some strong stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This product is way too strong and all you will get it hurt and irritated skin.      </li>
            <li>The benzoyl peroxide in the repair lotion is strong, so I use it once a day, (at night.)</li>
            <li>I got this product for my daughter but it was to strong for her skin.</li>
            <li>, the products smelled so strong, the scents of each one were nauseating.</li>
            <li>You can have your beautiful skin and your confidence back.</li>
            <li>My son has acne and I&#x27;ve tried several products before this one and really have not been impressed by many.  </li>
            <li>Okay, let me start this review with my full story.</li>
            <li>My makeup applies better, my acne scars have faded, no peeling, and no painful dryness.</li>
            <li>This is the best product hands down that I have used</li>
            <li>Alcohol also dries the skin and emphasizes fine lines.</li>
            <li>if you&#x27;re stressed to use it twice a day, otherwise it&#x27;s fine to use it once per day.</li>
            <li>I believe AcneFree could easily do the job, but they miss the boat on an important element: exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I peeled a little bit at first, but you kind of have to work the program to what fits best for you.</li>
            <li>This is the biggest thing Proactiv does right, with the perfect amount of gentle exfoliation that actually removes skin cells gently and leaves the skin looking and feeling great.  </li>
            <li>so when i got the chance to try Acne free for no cost, i thought it would be a good opportunity for her to try something new for her skin.</li>
            <li>It sounds like some people are allergic, but I&#x27;m not, and I saw results, no joke, the very first time I used it!  </li>
            <li>I tried this stuff and after 2 or 3 weeks I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li>I get huge cyst like pimples.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li>I received this product free from smiley and figured I might as well give it a try.</li>
            <li>I received the AcneFree 24 Hour Acne Clearing System Kit free from Smiley360.</li>
            <li>: I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product to anybody who is suffering from acne as this product is great for clearing up acne.</li>
            <li>I just started using acne free 3 step kit</li>
            <li>One month later my skin looks great.  </li>
            <li>i decided to try acne free</li>
            <li>Please stay away from Acne Free products.</li>
            <li>I also tried pro-active, and I have seen several dermatologists, but I still experienced whiteheads, blackheads, and cysts.</li>
            <li>Yes, Acne Free does work wonders.</li>
            <li>Overall, a great product; I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so time consuming.</li>
            <li>But the transition was rather smooth.</li>
            <li>Sooo After i had these stress pimples popping up i went to the store and grabbed this Acne Free.</li>
            <li>This product has always worked for me and it was at a great low price.</li>
            <li>Free from acne.</li>
            <li>I use the Acne Free Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Step 2.</li>
            <li>Acne Free Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>Acne Free does.  </li>
            <li>So I would not buy Acne Free again.  </li>
            <li>My cousin told me about Acne Free</li>
            <li>It made my skin feel really smooth.  </li>
            <li>Since I got it at my Shop Rite, it came with a free Acne and Blackhead Terminator.  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I received this as a  free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>Blemishes that begin to erupt just disappear after a day or two of applying Acne Free.</li>
            <li>Around day 6 or 7 I started getting compliments from my co-workers about how clear and bright my complexion was.  </li>
            <li>&quot; vitamins with acne free as well see how that goes</li>
            <li>As a person who is in his mid-late 20&#x27;s who has struggled with acne for most of my life, I have some information that may be useful as I have researched and tried everything, including prescriptions.    </li>
            <li>but they stopped selling it at the drug store, so i started getting acne free instead.</li>
            <li>and I thought that this product would help me, but when I applied the cleanser to my face, it felt itchy, burning, and it did not feel smooth at all.</li>
            <li>I have been acne free for about two months now.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially important to hit the spots that you aren&#x27;t going to use repair lotion on, so those areas can some daily exposure to the benzoyl peroxide medication.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially important to hit the spots that you aren&#x27;t going to use repair lotion on, so those areas can some daily exposure to the benzoyl peroxide medication.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always wanted my skin to be blemish free, so</li>
            <li>My face is smooth.</li>
            <li>finally, I&#x27;m free.    </li>
            <li>I was shopping in Ulta and came across this acne free kit and bought it because it had a free knock off clarisonic skin unit attached.</li>
            <li>Its great, I saw results instantly from both, but proactive helped to fix the burns I recieved from the off brand.  </li>
            <li>It is still important to moisturize your skin, no matter if it&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li>Go get an oil free moisturizer and apply it after your cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li>I use Mary Kay oil free moisturizer as well as MK oil free hydrating gel.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a shot :)</li>
            <li>I purchased acne free one week ago.</li>
            <li>Bought Acne Free</li>
            <li>Use Acne Free</li>
            <li>Her skin was free of acne within three days of using this product.</li>
            <li>I started using Acne Free in Sept 2010.</li>
            <li>Acne free works so well</li>
            <li>I received a free AcneFree kit through Smiley360.  </li>
            <li>I received this as a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>It is extremely smooth and does not exfoliate, unlike Proactiv.</li>
            <li>an enjoy the results</li>
            <li>It would be called Free Ance instead of Ance Free.</li>
            <li>Although I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is necessarily better, this purchase is definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is cheap and works.</li>
            <li>I bought Acne Free on August 14, 2007.</li>
            <li>Today is August 22, I  can say my chin is smooth again</li>
            <li>I have not had this issue with Acne Free</li>
            <li>I ordered/paid for the Acne Free 3-piece kit from Pharmapacks on 8/14/12.</li>
            <li>I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>Imagine my shock when my skin looked fantastic again</li>
            <li>I received this product free to try.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast, and package was nice.</li>
            <li>She loves how it works, and we&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement of her skin since using Acne Free.  </li>
            <li>:  I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>So cheap as compared to stores.</li>
            <li>so I thought I would give Acne free a chance.  </li>
            <li>I received this product free for the purpose of reviewing it.</li>
            <li>I got to try this for free from Smiley 360 for my son.  </li>
            <li>He is so happy and his confidence is coming back .  </li>
            <li>&amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li>I received AcneFree 3 step products as a free sample from Smiley360.</li>
            <li>I bought AcneFree a couple months ago when I ran out of my beloved Klear Action.</li>
            <li>I feel much more confident about myself and people now compliment my much clearer complexion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been over 4 months now, and my skin has not look this good since I was 10 years old.</li>
            <li>I found this to be far more effective than Proactiv.  </li>
            <li>To be fair though, the warning on the package clearly states to keep the product away from the eyes.</li>
            <li>Better and more gentle than Pro-Activ.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good--</li>
            <li>This has completely turned my life around, and its at a fair price.</li>
            <li>Acnefree works as good as regular proactiv an better than proactiv plus for a fraction of the  price....</li>
            <li>This price on AMAZON is more than what I pay for AcneFree Severe which is much stronger, includes 4 bottles, and costs more at any store you buy it (between $21.89-31.</li>
            <li>The best part is, I&#x27;m wearing way less make-up!</li>
            <li>The best part is, I&#x27;m wearing way less make-up!  </li>
            <li>But the AcneFree has worked beautifully for me, so as long as they keep making it, I plan to keep buying and using it!    </li>
            <li>I started out using the sensitive version, which was good, but decided to use the original.</li>
            <li>You have to try it for longer than two or three days to really see the results!!!</li>
            <li>I  want to say that after using it  I have already noticed that my skin is more calm and clean.</li>
            <li>do want to say that after using it for two days I have already noticed that my skin is more calm and clean.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin clean and free of acne.</li>
            <li>Acne free has kept my face clean for over a year now</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>The system is straight forward and very easy to use.</li>
            <li>Neither one completely cured my acne, but it&#x27;s good for people with some mild acne, not a cure all.</li>
            <li>My daughter began to use it and achieve good results in less than three weeks effectively as I remove the unwanted acne.</li>
            <li>I started getting the great big puss filled ones, which I rarely got like that before.  </li>
            <li>do love the first 2 steps (oil-free purifying cleanser &amp; renewing toner)</li>
            <li>First I tried the many of Oxy pads, clearasil cleansers, etc and nothing was working.  </li>
            <li>At first this stuff was like a magic kit on face.</li>
            <li>I can usually use anything and still have perfect skin.  </li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the past 7 years, it is the best product out there (in my opinion).  </li>
            <li>It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>The solution doesn&#x27;t rid your body of acne permanently, but if you are consistent and dedicated, it will remove most of your acne.  </li>
            <li>It isn&#x27;t worth it!  </li>
            <li>was going to use the original Proactiv but found this cheaper offshoot product</li>
            <li>First 2 days were okay...</li>
            <li>This series of products has cleared up my daughter&#x27;s pimples and significantly reduced her blackheads.  </li>
            <li>I had recently started applying pure tea tree oil to my face and felt the combination would be ideal.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and honestly is a great bargain when you consider that other acne creams alone can cost close to $15.</li>
            <li>It does take time to work - any new treatment for Acne takes 6 weeks to become fully effective.  </li>
            <li>If you do this twice a day you will have clean face.</li>
            <li>clean and exercise.</li>
            <li>By eating clean</li>
            <li>Clean your shower towel once a week.</li>
            <li>Clean your comforter covers once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Follow this regiment every day and you should have a clean face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottom line is that my skin looks incredible, for half the price and none of the frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This was a great product except that i had to stop using it because it made my skin so dry and itchy.</li>
            <li>I am sooo happy to report I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple in a month now.</li>
            <li>I am 30 years old and have been breaking out more now than when I was 16!</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and looks really healthy!</li>
            <li>I guess they call it Acne Free because it gives you just the right conditions for acne to run free all over your face.  </li>
            <li>I looked up reviews of other treatments, and saw a brand \\&quot;exposed\\&quot; that received many good reviews.</li>
            <li>Acne Free is the first system to work!</li>
            <li>My diet is excellent and very healthy, and I&#x27;ve tried various vitamins and herbs with little success.</li>
            <li>I tried it on in the evening and by 8:00 pm my face looked like a blowfish; bright cherry red.</li>
            <li>for the first time in several years people were commenting on how great my skin looked and wanted to know what I was using.</li>
            <li>When I got this, I was a bit skeptic because I&#x27;ve tried so many acne products that claims to work fast over the years, and yet I ended with no results.</li>
            <li>His acne cleared up and his skin has started to look much healthier than it did before he started using the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with the fast acting results and with the ease of use.</li>
            <li>Most of them don&#x27;t help much</li>
            <li>so i tried the free trial of proactive and it was a months worth of product.</li>
            <li>so i really didnt want to spend any more money on it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it really keeps my acne under control.</li>
            <li>AcneFree seemed similar, and had a good price.</li>
            <li>For me, it was worth the sacrifice to be pimple free.</li>
            <li>Getting back to my story, I loved proactive.</li>
            <li>so it is good to use a moisturizer as a fourth step.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad to say that the product really works.  </li>
            <li>so I believe this is true.    </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve actually noticed a good improvement.</li>
            <li>The true reason I got it was because I was on a budget and proactive</li>
            <li>One thing I do wish is that the cleanser had more grittiness to it to exfoliate the skin but it works so I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I would pay way more for this even if it took much longer.</li>
            <li>Love it and so much cheaper than proactiv.</li>
            <li>I love it , It really works.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as it continues to improve my skin, and I think it&#x27;s been more effective than any other skin treatment I&#x27;ve tried (which isn&#x27;t very many!).</li>
            <li>I got the product right through smiley360 free.</li>
            <li>Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear acne fighting kit, clearasil advanced, and a bunch more.  </li>
            <li>I am a guy out on his own paying his own bills and am on an extremely tight budget, I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $50,$40, even $30 a month on a skin product, even though I wish I had the money</li>
            <li>I have been using acne free for about a year now and had fantastic results but it eventually plateaued at a certain point</li>
            <li>This product would be great IF you have extremely oily skin?</li>
            <li>I stopped peeling immediately and still had fresh clean skin.  </li>
            <li>The morning following application of Perfect Skin cleanser, my skin had tiny pimples on the cheeks and a hive type of blemish on my chin.</li>
            <li>The morning following application of Perfect Skin cleanser, my skin had tiny pimples on the cheeks and a hive type of blemish on my chin.</li>
            <li>Now I am trying to find a more natural alternative like tea tree oil cleanser,alcohol free toner, etc..</li>
            <li>The only time I break out is when I get my period and for a girl who has been constantly struggling for years,this is the best thing that could happen!</li>
            <li>The spot treatment dries and clears up blemishes quickly.</li>
            <li>For the price however, it&#x27;s a sufficient product for those with mild acne (3-4 pimples a week).</li>
            <li>Embarassed and wanting it gone quickly</li>
            <li>My daughter is 14 and has mild acne but gets stress breakouts.  </li>
            <li>After weeks of frustration, I began reading online about my options, and it quickly appeared that a benzoyl peroxide-based solution would be preferable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is truly a dupe of Proactiv, but you can still use it if your skin isn&#x27;t super greasy (mine isn&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li>It feels better and it actually looks better.</li>
            <li>Before I buy anything, I review it extensively, to make sure I get the most for my money.</li>
            <li>Put some darn mild abrasives in your cleanser, would ya?</li>
            <li>The 3 steps are quick and painless - it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to be clearing up my skin, but if you&#x27;re looking for a product that works quickly, this is not it.</li>
            <li>It feels better and it actually looks better.</li>
            <li>i do have a mild acne problem, but there are days when my face just tends to break out.</li>
            <li>I have mild acne and sometimes it flares up from stress, drinking, etc.</li>
            <li>I have never had a product that worked so well and so quickly.</li>
            <li>, I highly recommend it to any one with acne problems I also love how affordable it is.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also concerned that stripping the skin with alcohol leads to dehydration, flaking and possible emphasis of fine lines since hydration and propr balance are especially important for mature skin.</li>
            <li>The perscription didn&#x27;t get rid of all the acne, about 90-95 percent of it, which is good enough, right?     </li>
            <li>In the first week of using this product there was a huge difference in her complexion.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a really good scrubber too, I rub, I lightly use my fingers, and I rub my cleansers in for quite a while, and I had never had this problem with other cleansers.    </li>
            <li>Be very consistent.</li>
            <li>Free Severe Acne Treatment (this also did not work at all, even though the acid in this product was a higher</li>
            <li>I first started using Acne Free almost 2 months ago.</li>
            <li>One pimple will clear up and start looking good and another 3 will pop up, I read some reviews and read that you will break out more in the beginning as it cleanses deep in your pores, so i stuck with it thinking</li>
            <li>However, over the last three years as I went into my twenties, I started get more and more breaks out on my face, mostly centered on my chin and on the side of my face near my cheekbones.</li>
            <li>im not quite sure, and ive gotten new pimples, some that have gone and some that have stayed.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to clean normal</li>
            <li>The product came very quickly and was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I tried this stuff and loved it, then my skin started to dry out</li>
            <li>I limited the use to once a day and got a good moisturizer, which helped with the dryness.</li>
            <li>thought that the lotion had a positive effect on my mom skin, but it&#x27;s too drying for me, at my advanced age, to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stick to Proactiv or a similar brand you know and are confident in!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 20 with mild/moderate acne and this actually worked better for me than the Proactiv that I tried!  </li>
            <li>love this and would completely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li>A WHOLE MONTH!!</li>
            <li>If you are looking to reduce your acne quickly, and are willing to follow the directions given, I have no doubts that this system will help you out; I recommend it with full confidence.</li>
            <li>The first night we used it , it made our skin feel really clean.</li>
            <li>Burts Bees peach scrub, which I loved the way it moisturized, but caused me to still break out because it was too oily and left a film on my skin, though the toners were good but buying everything in conjunction was just a little to pricey.</li>
            <li>I have acne, acne scars and huge pores that are really visible.</li>
            <li>I was using proactive but eventually tried Acne Free because it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li>my child skin  cleard up thanks to ance free .she</li>
            <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t have after trying tons of products before without success</li>
            <li>will keep you posted on whether the University Medical products are effective as they&#x27;ve just been purchased.</li>
            <li>I will keep you posted on whether the University Medical products are effective as they&#x27;ve just been purchased.</li>
            <li>I would say within a week you have glowing skin, yes a pimple here and there, but the amount that disappears is worth the use.</li>
            <li>I will have to keep using the product to see if it keeps working, but so far, I love it</li>
            <li>After 4 months of using AcneFree, my skin is so much more clear.</li>
            <li>and I actually liked to use it three times a day, especially if I was sweating a lot.    </li>
            <li>I personally love the way the whole treatment works, the wash isn&#x27;t slimy, it washes off real well.</li>
            <li>be fooled, it&#x27;s not going to give you perfect skin, but it most likely will help your acne, at least if it&#x27;s mild/moderate.</li>
            <li>ok once they clear out it will work.</li>
            <li>I could almost deal with the fact that none of the products smell particularly nice if they actually worked.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After months of \\&quot;dealing\\&quot; with the problem, I finally determined it wouldn&#x27;t go away on its own.  </li>
            <li>It was worth the try for $16</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t honestly say I recommend this to everyone because everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li>Maybe it has something to do with one&#x27;s skin, because I see where a number of people have had success with this product, while others, like myself, did not.</li>
            <li>klear action is much better</li>
            <li>and I figured that it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Family and friends have even commented; even though I&#x27;ve never had much acne, they&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks much smoother and more radiant than before.  </li>
            <li>Family and friends have even commented; even though I&#x27;ve never had much acne, they&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks much smoother and more radiant than before.  </li>
            <li>I looked at reviews for AcneFree and saw a lot of success stories for people with moderate-to-severe acne</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really clear my face up any better than anything I could&#x27;ve bought over-the-counter.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this stuff I was constantly self-conscious about the state of my face and had days when I honestly dreaded leaving the house as a result.</li>
            <li>when i started using Acne Free, within 2 or three days i had MORE pimples all over, my face was red..</li>
            <li>worth the money</li>
            <li>Klear Action worked better but is discontinued.</li>
            <li>Though, don&#x27;t put this on in conjunction, as in right after using the system or before, it&#x27;s more like an afternoon thing between uses, otherwise it just kind of renders doing either kind of useless.  </li>
            <li>My experience with this product has been a very positive one.</li>
            <li>Thayer&#x27;s is alcohol free, inexpensive right here on Amazon, and much gentler on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Thayer&#x27;s is alcohol free, inexpensive right here on Amazon, and much gentler on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Wishing just two weeks,I saw amazing results and have never loved my skin more!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about six months since my original review, and my skin is still smooth and completely acne-free.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s been about six months since my original review, and my skin is still smooth and completely acne-free.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried neutrogena, proactive, and many other acne cleansers and they all seemed to make me break out more and made my skin oliy.</li>
            <li>My first try was AcneFree &amp; I am so lucky b/c</li>
            <li>After using it for the first week, I quickly noticed the difference....</li>
            <li>One other thing that she really liked was that her skin felt soft, clean and healthy.</li>
            <li>I comparable this kit in some ways to original Proactiv, but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li>Very inexpensive, I paid $20, its worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as it has really changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li>This one started to work right away.  </li>
            <li>Not having the money right then to buy Proactiv, I settled for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>who ever said it suck all the acne causeing garbage to the surface then gets rid of it was right.</li>
            <li>I just saw my cousin 2 days ago &amp; he noticed my face right away.</li>
            <li>I do not recommend mixing the products right away though, after washing if I didn&#x27;t wait about 5 min</li>
            <li>My recommendation is to try this product on your neck or something first to make sure you are not overly sensitive.  </li>
            <li>(mainly cause it was cheap at the drugstore)</li>
            <li>We received this full sized product for FREE from Smiley360 and tried it with my 13 year old son.</li>
            <li>Frankly I am not really sure how effective this is even though my acne situation is getting much better now.....</li>
            <li>By the next day it was practically gone, but instead of a huge bump I got a huge acne scar.</li>
            <li>We switched to  The Clean and Clear Advantage System  for the last week and it has worked amazing.</li>
            <li>If you have a sensitive skin like me, I strongly recommend logona products for blemished skin.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a more natural exfoliate that&#x27;s still gentle</li>
            <li>The cleanser is a bit harsh on the skin, but the toner and lotion are amazing and indispensable .</li>
            <li>I have actually tried Proactive and loved it, but for the price, I would use this again if it keeps my skin mostly clear.</li>
            <li>granted, this is better than a bar of soap, but it&#x27;s definately worth spending the extra $20 to get proactiv.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t done so, but based on the many reviews I&#x27;ve read, your skin will bounce right back to square</li>
            <li>Miracle in a bottle, it not only clears the acne but it makes your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li>it does work and is readily available at most stores, but if Proactive were available at the same places for the same price or close to it I would switch in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li>a huge advocate of the Proactiv Original System, but reviewing University Medical 24 Hour ClearIng System as well since I&#x27;ve tried both</li>
            <li>This has helped clear up my face tremendously!</li>
            <li>I was happy that it calmed down the bumps, but after a day, more bumps and whiteheads were appearing in the healed area due to irritation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 25 year old white male with very fair skin.</li>
            <li>I even used a brand new clean face exfoliator with the cleanser to see if that would do the trick..</li>
            <li>I have seen such a huge difference in just a week!</li>
            <li>I would defiantly buy the first 2 steps of this skin system again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li>the years passed, I started to get interested in trying out skincare with anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li>So I had acne most of my teenage years and now I am 25 and still have some spots here</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty convinced now that there are no miracle overnight acne cures</li>
            <li>My acne was never terrible, but it was enough that it used to make me pretty self-conscious; I always had pimples on my chin and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This was her first year</li>
            <li>First, the acne just got wilder.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many different products.</li>
            <li>For the first time in six years, my skin is nearly acne free.  </li>
            <li>My only wish is that the cleanser would be a bit more exfoliating.</li>
            <li>I did it just at night for the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li>That is part of the reason I use another face wash first, plus you cannot use the acne wash on your eye area.</li>
            <li>I was starting to notice i was getting more acne</li>
            <li>I have been using it faithfully morning and night for 3-4 weeks now, at first it seemed to be working</li>
            <li>, i think its just simply making me break out even more</li>
            <li>At first nothing changed, for like the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>and then it really cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li>so make sure you have an outside moisturizer to throw into your routine.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product :)</li>
            <li>Ii&#x27;m fifteen, and used this system exactly as directed (twice a day, morning and night).</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>You just got to be consistent to see results</li>
            <li>I decided to try it first.  </li>
            <li>I love this stuff and the next thing I want to try is their Sulfur mask.</li>
            <li>The first time I purchased this product I started to notice results in 3 days, just as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li>First off, I want to start by saying I used to use proactive twice a day.</li>
            <li>I do not have severe acne, I do not even have moderate acne most of the time, so I would say I am somewhere between light-moderate acne level.</li>
            <li>For these reasons, I gladly recommend this product to others in hopes it will give them the same results.</li>
            <li>He has tried many medications, topical and pill, but everything irritated him.  </li>
            <li>Free Clear Skin System 3-step Kit</li>
            <li>It works really well!</li>
            <li>I continued to use the second shipment of Murad because everything I read said that the purging cycle could take 4 or more weeks.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I saw results!  </li>
            <li>I really wasn&#x27;t expecting AcneFree to work, but for the price, it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>Ok, tried this, got it at our local store.  </li>
            <li>*, though the grapefruit one worked much better, it occasionally caused my face to peel.</li>
            <li>I had been using proactiv for quite some time (5 years or so) and it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li>I am 24 and have mostly hormonal, moderately severe acne.</li>
            <li>This is the first thing to make a difference.</li>
            <li>I remembered getting hot spots and breaking out after using pro activ.</li>
            <li>The products leave your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>All in all I love this product and will be using it until further notice.</li>
            <li>I let my daughter use the cleanser and ONLY the cleanser because I was trying to see which item was the most</li>
            <li>This product seems to work, but don&#x27;t over do it at first until you know how you react to the ingredients.</li>
            <li>She has used it consistently for weeks and her skin looks as smooth and soft as it did before she was a teenager.</li>
            <li>This system is well worth its cost, and is not too much work.</li>
            <li>We started the 3 step system on the first night, all was well.</li>
            <li>So, we tried it the next day and it was much better.</li>
            <li>I think its more of a psychological thing</li>
            <li>I was worried about this at first</li>
            <li>: Thanks AcneFree!</li>
            <li>First of all I&#x27;d like to say that I have never suffered from severe acne.</li>
            <li>I tried so many different things to get it plunder control...</li>
            <li>This stuff works GREAT if you use precautions and common sense.</li>
            <li>I am in my mid 20s and have struggled with mild/moderate acne most of my life</li>
            <li>When I first started using it, I almost gave up on it because I didn&#x27;t see immediate results.</li>
            <li>Even though I&#x27;ve been using plenty of product twice a day, I&#x27;m still on my first kit, which I bought in the beginning of July, and I really feel that the products included are worth the money.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 45 years old and found Acne-Free works GREAT for adult acne when used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>This may be the first review I&#x27;ve ever written, but this product has worked so well for me, I had to.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use white towels and cover your shirts when using this product as it will bleach your stuff!  </li>
            <li>I have consistently been using this system for 18 months and in those 18 months I have noticed my skin has become oily.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 female and pretty healthy.</li>
            <li>not only has this given her a self esteem boost and noticeably better skin, it&#x27;s opened up a line of communication (</li>
            <li>This is real progress!</li>
            <li>It is important to use Acnefree when your skin is clear as a preventative measure to prevent blocked oil glands.    </li>
            <li>I started using the 3 step process twice daily, for many months.  </li>
            <li>, the first time I used AcneFree, I did it exactly as they told us to.</li>
            <li>First I cleansed my face, then I used the toner</li>
            <li>Wish it had more of a gritty texture for exfoliating.</li>
            <li>Needless to say, I&#x27;m happy with the transition!</li>
            <li>but I love to read reviews prior to buying.  </li>
            <li>I started reading reviews of many different products</li>
            <li>However, for this exact product you can pay $21.89 for at Target.</li>
            <li>First I have to say that I have tried proactive and it contains sulfur.</li>
            <li>must admit I was hesitant to try acnefree as I really do believe that you (usually) get what you pay for and thought it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li>and it just can&#x27;t be good for your skin if it is that harsh.</li>
            <li>all three steps, very important, if you do not use all three as directed then the formula is not effective, again, very important).</li>
            <li>I have compared the old regime to the new regime and the old regime feels more safe on the skin then the new ones.</li>
            <li>and that you really need to experiment to find what&#x27;s right for you - but that also means giving a product a chance to work.</li>
            <li>I tried Acnefree several years ago with awesome results, but eventually got lazy with the three-step process, then I later tried the severe version which proved too much for my skin and broke me out even more.</li>
            <li>My skin is smooth and silky now with only a rare blemish every once in a blue moon, and that is more hormonal from monthly menses.</li>
            <li>The face wash was creamy and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling very clean, while the repairing lotion was gritty and had to be applied with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li>I tried moisturizers, but maybe if I had bought a moisturizer that was more powerful and used it twice a day it would have brought my face back to normal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so thrilled to see the price has gone down even further, I just wish this was available for Amazon subscribe!</li>
            <li>I have mild acne that I have been dealing with for years - I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv as well as many other products</li>
            <li>My skin is clean and clear all the time.</li>
            <li>The clean and clear burned my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the holy grail of a clean and clear complexion.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products to clear up my mild to moderate acne.  </li>
            <li>NOW, i use this product ONLY at night, and it seems to be keeping my skin nice and clear.</li>
            <li>I always ignored that, most cleansers are gentle enough that it didnt matter either way for me.</li>
            <li>I have been using this for a little over 6 months and am thrilled that Amazon is carrying this for a price better than the \\&quot;big box</li>
            <li>I decided to give it a little more time, but after using it for a full month, I was getting acne breakouts consistently.</li>
            <li>This stuff sounded pretty promising.</li>
            <li>So to WalMart I went, and within the first 3 days my skin had showed so much improvement.</li>
            <li>I started using it as directed and at first I didn&#x27;t see much of a change.</li>
            <li>You also have too keep in mind good acne prevention tips, like not touching your face and washing pillows</li>
            <li>I am considering applying the Original in the evening and the Sensitive formula during the AM, but I&#x27;m very much concerned about the amount of ALCOHOL that&#x27;s in the Renewing Toner of the Original System, listed as the second and seventh ingredient while glycolic acid is listed as the eighth.</li>
            <li>Great product but not worth the extra money not to mention shipping charges.</li>
            <li>so when I saw this I thought it might work and liked that it costs much less.</li>
            <li>I am not sure if I would recommend this product to people with sensitive skin, but if you can handle the benzoyl peroxide and you have stubborn acne, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Not completely dry but not baby butt smooth.</li>
            <li>I was, however surprised by its quick effectiveness.</li>
            <li>I have had practically severe acne for about 2 to 3 years now since adolescence and have tried everything from proactiv to clean and clear and home remedies and even a fast on nothing but apples for 3 days and absolutely nothing I did worked at all.</li>
            <li>a funny thing happened though, acne free actually works, quite well!</li>
            <li>However, I still broke out during certain times of the month.</li>
            <li>Certainly advise them to proceed cautiously.</li>
            <li>I dont have acne like the kinda that is disforming or really large cysts or anything like that</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and a half now and am happy knowing that I&#x27;ve finally found something that works for me after dealing with acne since puberty</li>
            <li>I have adult acne that just appeared when I got pregnant and doesn&#x27;t seem to want to go away, so this has been really helpful.</li>
            <li>And, as someone who has finally woken up with beautiful skin after trying desperately to achieve this for ten years, I can tell you it feels great.</li>
            <li>Before i started this i just used a simple apricot face wash and my face was always just fine</li>
            <li>Overall, I solid product and will be buying again for sure!     </li>
            <li>Though it is slightly better than Neutrogena Oil-Free when it comes to drying and peeling, my skin is still rough and dry and it hurts even more than Neutrogena.</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate acne and I have tried many different products on my face.</li>
            <li>at day 7 she excitedly sent me a pic and was actually chatting with me about how surprised she was to see such a remarkable difference in her skin, breakouts clearing up, less oil and more of a natural glow.</li>
            <li>Overall a good system to use daily, for mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li>I started using proactiv and while that seemed to work for a while, it seemed that over time it caused me to get more breakouts rather then helping them, right around the time they claimed to have changed the formula slightly.</li>
            <li>I did break out more in the first couple of weeks but, thanks to the words I read on this and other websites</li>
            <li>It helped calm and maintain my breakouts but never really cleared my skin to a comfortable state.</li>
            <li>Anyway, thank you AcneFree for such an amazing and affordable product and thank you Amazon for making it so simple to get!</li>
            <li>It definitely cleared up my skin, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how my pillowcases and towels were getting huge bleach spots on them.  </li>
            <li>As I write this, my face is one huge, swollen, itchy, red welt.</li>
            <li>The reason I gave this system 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t really care for the Repair Lotion (Step 3).</li>
            <li>The terminator I think is what really cleared my skin.</li>
            <li>I began to stay inside all the time and also became very moody as well.  </li>
            <li>but this product really seemed to work for me</li>
            <li>The 3-step system really works.</li>
            <li>My skin is starting to look smooth instead of</li>
            <li>I rarely use the products (maybe once every 3-4 months) and my face stays wonderfully clear.</li>
            <li>It is gentle and produced no peeling or sensitivity whatsoever.</li>
            <li>As a longterm sufferer of skin breakouts, it&#x27;s really been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li>Regular benzoyl peroxide cream wasn&#x27;t helping, so I tried Acne Free.  </li>
            <li>I cleaned my whole face with the cleanser then used the toner and lotion just on my problem areas.  </li>
            <li>VERY oily skin    </li>
            <li>The repair lotion didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.  </li>
            <li>It gave my face a really greasy feeling</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper</li>
            <li>Application:&lt;br /&gt;After washing and using toner - face feels very stripped.&lt;br /&gt;After applying the \\&quot;repair\\&quot; lotion - face feels coated and wants to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
            <li>the lotion is very silky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really rather</li>
            <li>This really worked for me</li>
            <li>I ordered the free trial pack, and after one day, I woke up the next morning and allready see a difference.  </li>
            <li>This product started working from the very beginning</li>
            <li>This system works very well for my skin.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s so much cheaper too.</li>
            <li>My problem isn&#x27;t really acne</li>
            <li>But you really do get what you pay for with this product.</li>
            <li>But fact is that it gives too much redness and sometimes hurts on the skin</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so important to wash your face, especially at night to rid it of the toxins you&#x27;ve collected from the day.&lt;br /&gt;Third,</li>
            <li>the face wash is gritty and the repairing lotion is smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a much needed improvement.</li>
            <li>And soo I read some testimonials on Acne Free, and I was started to feel hopeful, sooo i went and bought it at the local drug store (walgreens)</li>
            <li>i really thought that this was gonna be the one product that would work.i will still continue to use it for awhile</li>
            <li>This product really works wonders.  </li>
            <li>This product really works wonders.  </li>
            <li>and my skin would get really oily.  </li>
            <li>, I also found that it really helps to wipe your make-up off with non-scented baby wipes ormake-up remover wipes before washing your face.  </li>
            <li>but it probably helped and was cheap enough at Target that it wasn&#x27;t a burden to add to the regimen.</li>
            <li>Fast forward</li>
            <li>All the reviews were very encouraging</li>
            <li>I guess you have to condition your skin especially if it&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have always had very oily and acne prone skin throughout adolescence and even now at 24.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s improved my skin so much.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve suffered from acne my whole life.</li>
            <li>I bought this system because I could not afford Proactiv, so I started it not expecting much.</li>
            <li>After applying all 3 products as directed my face feels very oily.</li>
            <li>this product actually caused my light acne to jump to medium.</li>
            <li>My skin that was normally really oily isn&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li>and it is so much cheaper than Pro Activ</li>
            <li>My skin is also so much healthier.</li>
            <li>Yes, it did get rid of my acne, my acne was gone in a matter of three days; however, with every application of the product, my face would tingle and burn so much</li>
            <li>His face was totally clear and fresh looking.</li>
            <li>My skin has really responded well to it.      </li>
            <li>It even worked at evening out the skin on my cheeks and nose, it really does work</li>
            <li>All I want to say is, if you really want to make your acnes go away</li>
            <li>Be careful when touching clothing and towels, the peroxide can have a bleaching effect on fabrics.</li>
            <li>so I cant give a detailed review but from just the last two days I can tell you I have already noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Medicinally, this product is comparable to the Proactiv brand and really does the job.</li>
            <li>downhill real fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>We have been booby that the product the rest of the month Does it fit this thing I want financial returns immediately</li>
            <li>I think it really depends on the person.</li>
            <li>I found that proactive works really well</li>
            <li>This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li>Really helps with my skin.  </li>
            <li>This product really irritated my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>it works really really fast.</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very noticeably results in two days and cleared up in a week.</li>
            <li>This skin system really worked well for me.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much cheaper than proactive and works well.</li>
            <li>I also found that I went through the renewing toner much faster than the cleanser and wash.</li>
            <li>You can buy this MUCH cheaper at Target, CVS, or Kmart.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very drying.</li>
            <li>Thanks AcneFree</li>
            <li>and I have really started to notice a change in his skin.</li>
            <li>I received this product for free from smiley360 and the review is based on my opinion only.  </li>
            <li>I guess we will have to just spend the $ and get Proactive to see if there is really any difference between the products.</li>
            <li>and I used this acne system for about three days and all it did was made my face very shiny and oily</li>
            <li>This review is my own personal opinion based on the results I have seen through the use of my teenage son.</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the kit, I was initially worried that my 14 year old would not be able to keep up the 3-step system in order to see results.</li>
            <li>you are experiencing dehydration, dryness, tightness, or flakiness of the skin, please consider sending University Medical Customer Service an email via their website explaining your side effects and expressing a desire in an alcohol-free based toner which instead includes well-received and regarded ingredients, such as salicylic, glycolic, AHA, fruit acids, glycerin, sodium PCA, aloe, rose, witch hazel,</li>

            <li>(April 2011): More than 2 years later my skin is still marvelously clear.</li>
            <li>When I use it daily my face is clear and I get many compliments on my complexion.  </li>
            <li>The witch hazel in AcneFree doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of natural oils, which ultimately makes more oil!&lt;br /&gt;Added TIP:</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and so far so good.</li>
            <li>The product is also pretty good at reducing redness/hyper-pigmentation left by previous post-acne marks.   </li>
            <li>so much cheaper than Proactiv and just as good (if not better!)</li>
            <li>If this change in routine can&#x27;t tame it, I might switch to AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment System for more powerful treatment.</li>
            <li>Benzoyl peroxide is somewhat harsh, but very effective, and is the key ingredient in both the AcneFree and Proactiv systems.  </li>
            <li>I heard about AcneFree sensitive kit for people with sensitive skin and can&#x27;t handle the original formula</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that one of the representatives of University Medical will read this review and consider forwarding the comment to their Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Dept. to consider an alcohol-free reformulation of the toner in the Original 3 pc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m hoping that one of the representatives of University Medical will read this review and consider forwarding the comment to their Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Dept. to consider an alcohol-free reformulation of the toner in the Original 3 pc.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never had to replace my original AcneFree kit and still have lots left.</li>
            <li>My face feels smooth and I don&#x27;t need to put on foundation or concealer, which I usually do every day to cover up the redness - so I&#x27;m sure the lack of makeup is also helping my face stay clear.</li>
            <li>I do not usually write reviews; this is my first one.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m familiar with the acne.org regimen though I hadn&#x27;t been following it</li>
            <li>It seems though that after letting it absorb it got better (because naturally the peroxide is drying because it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job of killing the bacteria, but that&#x27;s with any facial cleanser that has it, nothing new).</li>
            <li>This particular kit worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li>I use the cotton ball for the second step and even though I&#x27;m clean it still get dirt from my face and</li>
            <li>I currently wash my face with Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean face wash, then wash with AcneFree&#x27;s face wash.</li>
            <li>and it contains more of the active ingredient</li>
            <li>but I really think that the main thing that you need is Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li>I have used many facial cleansers over the years and the only one that really seemed to work and keep my skin fresh and clear was Proactiv.</li>
            <li>It did work for a while, but then I suddenly started getting those deep cysts on my chin, something I hadn&#x27;t experienced in a couple of years on Klear Action, then next to my nose....</li>
            <li>/&gt;Explanation: I purchased AcneFree after my usual regimen (Clean and Clear 3 Step) was no longer able to fight break outs.</li>
            <li>The three step system from Clean and Clear (which is quite similar to this, but you have to buy the wash, toner, and moisturizer separately), was the first thing that seemed to make a dent in my face.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m absolutely sure that it&#x27;s possible to get good results by diligently following a similar regimen made up of other products with benzoyl peroxide in them.</li>
            <li>Product is comparable to other top acne treatments, without the high price tag.</li>
            <li>Use twice daily for your skin to stay clear and it is a easy 3 step program.</li>
            <li>, my pores got bigger, I&#x27;m pretty sure, and never cleared out, and every day there was a new giant pimple waiting to say hello in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Let me start off by saying I never really had acne growing into my teens, which I had considered myself pretty lucky with that as I was fortunate to only get a pimple here or there.</li>
            <li>When I consistently use this skincare kit, my skin always seems clear, but the toner can be a bit dehydrating if I don&#x27;t apply a noncomedogenic hydrating cream after cleansing and before toning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pretty clear within 3 days.  </li>
            <li>Within 2 months, my forehead was completely clear, the first time in 10 years.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and my skin is pretty much completely clear.</li>
            <li>Now that stuff isn&#x27;t any cheaper in the long run but someone else mentioned Acne Free in their review</li>
            <li>and my skin was pretty clear.</li>
            <li>in the first week it didnt work but overtime like three weeks my face started to clear up</li>
            <li>I therefore decided to purchase both University Medical Original 24 Hour Clearing System and the Sensitive Skin as an immediate measure since these are available at local pharmacies.</li>
            <li>So i&#x27;m willing to run over to walmart and try out the sensitive kit.     </li>
            <li>and I first ordered the AcneFree sensitive skin version.</li>
            <li>The same is true with the lotion.</li>
            <li>/&gt;During the first month of use, I did notice a lot of flakiness and what appeared to be sensitive, chemical burns on my neck (from the benzoyl peroxide).  </li>
            <li>This product burned my face completely off after the first use.  </li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li>I have used the product for the last 4 years and it&#x27;s the only product that keeps my facial blemishes under control and my skin looking good.</li>
            <li>These kind of products are for people who stay consistant and aren&#x27;t lazy.</li>
            <li>The marks from old pimples have not faded and are pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li>The following evening she used the cleanser and the toner, and followed it up with a very light &#x27;regular&#x27; moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I still get a few large zits (mostly just before my period).</li>
            <li>When I started a new BC pill, my skin went haywire!</li>
            <li>AcneFree works better (for me) than Proactive and at half the cost.  </li>
            <li>After 3 months my skin started getting significantly better, and I was noticing how much less acne I had every morning.</li>
            <li>Acne free does dry out your skin</li>
            <li>WE have tried everything nothing has worked when we was given this to try for free i figured it would be like everything else it wouldnt work and dry up our face...</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s half the cost and works better.</li>
            <li>I still use the lotion when my skin is dry, but the cleanser alone keeps me free.    </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would recommend it because it&#x27;s a decent price</li>
            <li>I recently bought the Acne Free Clear Skin 3 Step Kit.  </li>
            <li>The results came gradually but steadily.  </li>
            <li>After using the product for over two months nonstop, his back was almost completely acne free.  </li>
            <li>; So clever....  </li>
            <li>Either way, proactive is better, but this stuff does work just dont use too much or only once daily instead of twice.</li>
            <li>Neutragena exofiolant didn&#x27;t really work for me all that much, they made my skin soft and that was about it</li>
            <li>but I noticed that my face isn&#x27;t as red as it once was where the pimples are, and the overall texture is better.</li>
            <li>I used to buy this stuff for 20$ dollars but it keeps getting more and more expensive.</li>
            <li>, I just have alot, mainly blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li>I am 30 and have had mild to moderate acne all of my life.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I read the packaging that claimed this product was even better than Proactiv, and I didn&#x27;t see too many reviews from Proactiv users.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product mainly because it can ruin your linens</li>
            <li>But only clothes after these funds in the area of application on the body, fade when washed and ends quickly tonic.</li>
            <li>Then I was finally done being pregnant and breastfeeding then</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get to try AcneFree 24 hour acne clearing system from Smiley360.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist says this product has a high content of benzoyl peroxide for an over-the-counter product.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product...but don&#x27;t give up on it.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product to acne/rosacea sufferers of all ages.this product to acne/rosacea sufferers of all ages.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend Acnefree and plan to continue using it indefinitely.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product as opposed to Proactive.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomenet that product for all skin types.</li>
            <li>I know everyone doesn&#x27;t share my point of view here, but I think proactive is a quality product at a high price.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend using AcneFree.</li>
            <li>I rate it highly, and would recommend it for faults who are deling with acne problems.</li>
            <li>Use of Proactiv original system (low dosages of benzoyl peroxide) seems to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>Use of Proactiv original system (low dosages of benzoyl peroxide) seems to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>It is constant amazing exfoliation, unlike other exfoliating cleansers.  </li>
            <li>so I need something strong enough to fight the acne but gentle enough that my face doesn&#x27;t swell up like a balloon.</li>
            <li>The driness (which wasn&#x27;t excessive) over the past month has been totally worth it because it has revealed beautiful new skin.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would even make it just a little better.</li>
            <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product because all other products had the same reviews.</li>
            <li>We have tried many protried with little results.  </li>
            <li>Overall I give this 4 stars because if it did not dry out my skin, this would have easily been 5 stars.</li>
            <li>pretty certain it was stress related.   </li>
            <li>He has no problems using benzoyl peroxide in other products but this one might be a bit too strong.     </li>
            <li>This kit work very well on my 13 yrs old son, highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li>The 3-step formula works excellent if you use all three steps once a day (twice a day, morning and night, if it is REALLY bad).  </li>
            <li>These two products really have helped my face clear up.</li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin and was very suprised when this happened.</li>
            <li>So far I really like it.</li>
            <li>University Medical AF is a solid, effective, affordable 3 pc system and the price here is incredibly low.</li>
            <li>After a few days, my face broke out more than ever.  </li>
            <li>Maybe try the sentitive version, regards I am keeping it simple with Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser and drinking plenty of water.</li>
            <li>I just think my skin has gotten used to the normal AcneFree.</li>
            <li>I rarely get any acne now after using regularly.     </li>
            <li>I tried the orange bottles (\\&quot;severe\\&quot; variety) with similar success.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it keep the blemishes away, but the witch hazel keeps my face looking fresh and even colored.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it keep the blemishes away, but the witch hazel keeps my face looking fresh and even colored.  </li>
            <li>Me breaking out WAY more (even though I would wait a few weeks in case my skin just needed to get use to the product), or B)</li>
            <li>THIS DOES WORK, BUT if u have sensitive skin only use once daily, or go with proactive its much better, wont hurt ur skin.  </li>
            <li>(Why it waited for the middle of a fun school function, I don&#x27;t know.)</li>
            <li>I am using an antihistamine and steroids to try to get rid of the reaction and return my face to normal.  </li>
            <li>i bought this stuff trying to save a few bucks b/c it claims to be better than proactiv.</li>
            <li>The only thing worth it from this kit is the acne lotion.  </li>
            <li>started to use in April and a month or two came to naught rash on the chest and back, the skin was cleaned and I&#x27;m not afraid to go at the beach in a swimwear.</li>
            <li>few more tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worse than proactiv but not as good.</li>
            <li>As an adult acne sufferer it is easy to become hopeless- even when you&#x27;re starting to see changes but they aren&#x27;t coming fast enough.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has regular skin; not too dry, not too oily and still this product was able to damage his skin.</li>
            <li>I developed mild acne after deciding to go off of my regular birth control pill.  </li>
            <li>so I am always leary of products like this because more often than not they dry out my skin, turn it red</li>
            <li>in all, this product works, costs only $20, and can easily be obtained at your local convenience store.</li>
            <li>I started using the 3 step system right away and after only two uses of it (morning and night)</li>
            <li>Great results but a little harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li>I would like to see make up remover and other things from Acne Free.  </li>
            <li>I also don&#x27;t have any new pimples.</li>
            <li>When I purchase something new I expect new.</li>
            <li>My husband is coming for Christmas since he is a soldier and we live apart</li>
            <li>My complexion started going downhill when I moved to a new state...new water, new air...</li>
            <li>Yes, I still get some blackheads, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>I find that applying the lotion to those acne-prone areas keeps any new blemishes from forming.  </li>
            <li>I find that applying the lotion to those acne-prone areas keeps any new blemishes from forming.  </li>
            <li>I also bought the Terminator to deal with the new bumps that came up.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Each time it got rid of a pimple, a new pimple would pop up.</li>
            <li>Illinois and New York have banned microbeads.  </li>
            <li>This is my new go to acne product.</li>
            <li>My skin tone also changed into a much darker and more dull color.  </li>
            <li>But anyway, the same thing happened to two huge whiteheads that I later got on my forehead.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s less expensive and it works just as good or in my opinion even better.</li>
            <li>I think this may work for some people, but be careful that it is strong and that goes for both the Clear Skin Formula and the Sensitive Skin Formula.</li>
            <li>I have been using this brand for a few years now, which has been the only effective product ever (over the counter or prescription products never helped rosacea acne.)  </li>
            <li>Definitely don&#x27;t use any kind of harsh scrubs or exfoliators - your skin needs to heal, not have irritants thrown at it.</li>
            <li>, I barely have large breakouts or breakouts at all.</li>
            <li>My skin has never been more clear, and it started working in less than a week!</li>
            <li>My face feels very soft after use.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive and finicky skin</li>
            <li>have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>This product keeps my skin feeling extremely fresh all day long and seems to be having an antibacterial effect that prevents new breakouts during the day.</li>
            <li>I also put a very little on a zit in the morning but nothing more, just that.</li>
            <li>Her face looks so clear!</li>
            <li>It took me a week to get my face clear again!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and my skin is completely clear!</li>
            <li>However, over the first week, I actually see my face clearing up!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried it again, my face was burning and red, but I thought to myself</li>
            <li>I had to go to work with this red blotchiness and have people comment on it (very embarrassing!).  </li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>You get the exact same amount as you would with Proactive for each step and you use it exactly the same way.</li>
            <li>It is better than Proactiv, me being a past user of proactiv.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have the initial \\&quot;break-out-alot\\&quot; issue when I first started using it.  </li>
            <li>I first came across a bottle left over in the shower at my gym.</li>
            <li>For once, I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li>I applied it all over my face the first night and the next day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d imagine that range of reviews (from those who say it works to those who don&#x27;t) is due mostly to the vast variety of skin types out there.  </li>
            <li>Went another 3 days using the system and WOW!</li>
            <li>and i have pretty moderate acne break outs</li>
            <li>So I tried AcneFree, which I could buy locally and was not expensive.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if AcneFree is the reason why my skin looks better, because it occurred to me that maybe my breakouts were just meant to stop occurring at this age or something.</li>
            <li>I usually do not write reviews for products</li>
            <li>I paid just over $8 for this as an add on item, walmart sells the exact same product for about 20 bucks.</li>
            <li>I watched all the infomercials and decided to go with Murad&#x27;s Acne Complex Kit expecting the glowing, perfect skin that they promised within a few short weeks.  </li>
            <li>Early on, I found that the skin toner runs out very quickly and the high alcohol content sometimes stung and dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li>Early on, I found that the skin toner runs out very quickly and the high alcohol content sometimes stung and dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li>I had mild to moderate acne through high school and college and Accutane finally got rid of it.  </li>
            <li>Well i have had enough there is no way in heck this stuff would take 4 weeks to deep clean</li>
            <li>Rinse first and apply lightly on dry skin and dab more on trouble spots.</li>
            <li>My skin feels healthy and the constant pain due to inflammation is completely gone.</li>
            <li>skincare has always left my skin blemish free for as long as I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li>Well, after using it for about a month my skin has stayed exactly the same and completely clear of blemishes.      </li>
            <li>Wipe my face dry with a fresh paper towel&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li>I def agree with the reviews that i have read that claim it makes your skin worse at first but then makes it better.</li>
            <li>My teen was encouraged to use it by the positive reviews and with knowing that he would just need to stick with it for awhile.</li>
            <li>my face was pretty much the same, but my face wasn&#x27;t as red, but i still had a bunch of pimples.</li>
            <li>Other reviewers that it can bleach towels and clothing are correct - this is true of all benzoyl peroxide preparations.  </li>
            <li>Purchased this for my teenage daughter who has mild to moderate acne and blackheads.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d found that when I had applied the toner to dry skin right after cleansing, my skin would wind up dehydrated or parched.</li>
            <li>I probably stopped using the product at that point, and then a week or two later, my skin had mostly healed completely from the havoc created over the previous months.  </li>
            <li>However, I will not be purchasing it again since my first experience with it was negative, and also, as stated originally, this product did not work as well as Proactiv in clearing up my acne.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY similar, and certainly cheaper, esp with Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li>Made my skin look and feel smooth and helped with the dark spots too!</li>
            <li>Leaves me feeling clean and clear, and it works as long as I remember to use it religiously.</li>
            <li>(I am Black with a med complexion), and the appearance of post acne marks is significantly improved.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would like is maybe a little more grit in the  cleanser.</li>
            <li>Some even consider glycolic acid an anti-aging ingredient, because it brightens dull skin and aids in gentle exfoliation while keeping the pores free of debris.</li>

            <li>The choice of alcohol as the second and seventh ingredients in the University Medical toner to dilute the product and place glycolic acid as the eighth ingredient (UM) instead of the second ingredient (Proactiv) would explain the price differential as alcohol is a cheap ingredient, but it&#x27;s also an inferior ingredient.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for three days so far and it completely cleared up my existing acne.</li>
            <li>Since the red blotches are not on my whole face, I&#x27;m assuming either the toner or lotion is what my skin can&#x27;t handle.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even have particularly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a 16 year old girl and have been using this product for a year now.</li>
            <li>and my skin isn&#x27;t really sensitive</li>
            <li>So thats my background, and I&#x27;ve had acne since 6th grade so about when I was 11 years old.</li>
            <li>If Sensitive kit in AcneFree don&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll have to head over to Max Clarity or see my doc.</li>
            <li>I never realized how much bacteria is still left on the face after washing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got oily and sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this Sensitive formula for nearly 2 weeks and have had immediate results.</li>
            <li>The cleanser really had no exfoliating beads or anything, it felt like putting soap on my face and afterwards when I used the toner, there was still A LOT of left over dirt on my face.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m surprised to see the price.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I would definately stay away from benzoyl peroxide if you have sensitive skin and use salicylic acid or natural applicants like diluted tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>and i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I only use the repair lotion on my T-zone, because my cheeks tend to be much drier than the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li>If you still want to give it a try, use the Acnefree sensitive skin system instead.</li>
            <li>Even the old scars are going away...</li>
            <li>I would not order from Amazon.com again unless I completely understand that I am infact getting the product that I want.</li>
            <li>I ordered Acne Free thinking it would work on my grandchild who is having trouble with acne on her forehead and nose.  </li>
            <li>It looks like I need to pick up a package of the white or orange bottles (doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference to me</li>
            <li>I like the results so far.</li>
            <li>However it isn&#x27;t sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This product worked really well for me, and not only for break outs of acne.</li>
            <li>Acnefree has saved me money, works well with my skin type (somewhat oily), and offers a quality product.</li>
            <li>If a person is sensitive to Benzoyl Peroxide, you should not use this product.</li>
            <li>With all Benzoyl Peroxide products, it will irritate the skin of anybody sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li>After the toner has dried, apply step 3 with another cotton pad in a LIGHT layer.    </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d think that being this big of a company they would 1)-Have their stories straight; and 2)-KNOW</li>
            <li>Also, do not listen to the directions as far as the amounts to use.</li>
            <li>I am 16 years old, and ever since I started breaking out in pimples this year, I&#x27;ve started to feel so self concious.</li>
            <li>I tried a number of different types of face wash, but none of them seemed to work, so I resorted to AcneFree without much hope in its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t consider myself to have particularly sensitive skin, but I used AcneFree one time in the morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 19 and I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li>Pairing it with a very creamy moisturizer that you know would not break you out is enough to fix this issue.</li>
            <li>It only takes 5 minutes to do the whole routine, and the directions say to do it twice a day.</li>
            <li>This morning I almost couldn&#x27;t open my eyes because it was very puffy.</li>
            <li>If you have a SENSITIVE SKIN, don&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li>I have an 18 year old son who also uses Acnefree....</li>
            <li>Well, maybe your product was old or something.</li>
            <li>will say that I do NOT have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I am 24 years old and have moderate adult acne and very oily skin.</li>
            <li>It is far cheaper than Proactiv(which</li>
            <li>she has been using another seen on TV system for quite some time but still has frequent breakouts and oily skin.</li>
            <li>THough I agree that my lotion was gritty, which I didn&#x27;t like, and doesn&#x27;t feel very moist....</li>
            <li>So far AcneFree works for me.</li>
            <li>My 13 year old daughter used this and proactive.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 19 year old</li>
            <li>I am a 35 year old woman who has never had a reaction to any product.  </li>
            <li>I do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I brought this for my kids so far it&#x27;s working well for them.</li>
            <li>I have never had a real acne problem, even during the teenage years.  </li>
            <li>I did notice results as early as 2 days.  </li>
            <li>He went from having baby soft skin to having &amp;#34;face demons/pimples&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I just this product on my 12 year old daughter who has been struggling with acne.  </li>
            <li>Her acne is almost cleared completely up</li>
            <li>I would still recommend this product to people who doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>A few days passed, and my pimples and blemishes became more red and irriated and my face itched.</li>
            <li>So we tried a few more different topicals and a spa treatment.</li>
            <li>If you are prone to dry skin, that would probably dry your skin out, but for me it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>After the first week though, all of my old flare-ups were drying out and I had no new pimples.</li>
            <li>I should note that with the Original system, I have found it necessary to apply a hydrating cream such as Cetaphil moisturizing cream after cleansing/prior to application of toner in order to offset the potentially dehydrating effects of the toner.</li>
            <li>No more breakouts for either one of us and our skin is very clear, smooth and no drying at all.</li>
            <li>The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because if you have dry skin it may dry it out even more, since my skin is oily</li>
            <li>For the first time, I can wear makeup without having it slide off my face by mid-day and there are no new break-outs.  </li>
            <li>I constantly read reviews before I spend my hard earned money on something, as I did before I bought this, but this is worth it, even at full price.</li>
            <li>Acnefree, at less than half the cost of proactive, is simply amazing.</li>
            <li>I got this because my Neutrogena face wash is getting less and less effective.</li>
            <li>I was reading a few of the more recent reviews and apparently this company has changed</li>
            <li>/&gt;During the first few weeks of using AcneFree, my regular acne disappeared right away.  </li>
            <li>My mysterious sickness went away the next day (after 2 weeks, the exact time I been using the product) and my linens were not bleaching themselves out anymore.  </li>
            <li>I never write reviews for products, but realized reviews are mainly what I use to gauge the effectiveness of a product, especially on amazon.com.</li>
            <li>It has been reduced and my skin is not half as oily as it was.</li>
            <li>This 3-step kit contains Benzoyl Peroxide though, which is the main ingredient in Proactiv and the only thing that seems to work for me</li>
            <li>I left my face wet which is important and applied the cleanser starting out without rubbing first couple of days and did not leave on long.</li>
            <li>Rinse and I applied toner lightly to dry skin and then a little more as time went by.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m extremely tempted to try that out since my skin perscription isn&#x27;t working right now and</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using it  and haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts, and the red spots from my old acne are even fading without the fade cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months and haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts, and the red spots from my old acne are even fading without the fade cream.  </li>
            <li>He just started getting some acne and trouble spots on his face, so receiving this product was right on time!</li>
            <li>I usually pick at my acne even though you&#x27;re not supposed to, and Acne Free is healing up marks from picking, too.</li>
            <li>I apparently need to use benzoyl peroxide to stay clear, so my plan is to keep using it indefinitely.</li>
            <li>(My skin is combination skin (oily T zone normal face overall)</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s only $15 and twice the normal size (8oz of step 1 &amp; 2, 4 oz of step 3).  </li>
            <li>and I couldn&#x27;t get it back to normal for weeks.</li>
            <li>I have normal skin with a recent occurrence of acne after my pregnancy and have never had a reaction to any product like this.</li>
            <li>my face has a light red tint and itchy a little bit..is this normal for just starting it??</li>
            <li>, it will def dry my skin out, which is not fun when you can&#x27;t move your face easily without pain.</li>
            <li>I tried the lavender scrub and that helped calm it down *</li>
            <li>I understand that certain products work different on different people.  </li>
            <li>The only problem is that right after using it, my skin (especially my cheeks and my nose) gets really red.</li>
            <li>&quot; it&#x27;s usually minimal, and I layer on a little bit more of the lotion in that spot</li>
            <li>I increased rubbing a little more harder and longer over time.</li>
            <li>Also, this is such a minor complaint, but I always seem to end up with way more toner than the cleanser and the lotion!</li>
            <li>It might have saved me from a lot of facial scarring that I have to live with to this day.  </li>
            <li>new recent product that he is using now</li>
            <li>Would dry out my skin and be very painful/uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li>clear skin ladies in three days, continued use of Acnefree twice daily, clear skin continues...</li>
            <li>On days when my face gets really oily the cleanser seems to just suck out the oil--without leaving my face TOO dry.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and suddenly developed mild/moderate acne on my jawline and chin earlier this year.</li>
            <li>I still have a few scars of course, but my skin is smooth, the bumps are gone, and I&#x27;ve only had a couple pimples sprout up, but</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used Proactive in years, but I am at least as pleased with this product now as I was with Proactive as a teen.</li>
            <li>This product could be such a cheap alternative to Proactiv, but they are blindly missing the boat.  </li>
            <li>I started having frequent acne breakouts in my thirties and early forties, and after using several products and monthly facials</li>
            <li>Ive had redness on my cheeks, nose and chin with mild break out for a few years.</li>
            <li>I have called to complain before since this different mix is not as effective or sometimes causes worse results</li>
            <li>I finally have clear skin again!</li>
            <li>I mean, I&#x27;m not saying that all of my acne are gone, but the fact is that my acne is definitely lessening for sure.</li>
            <li>I saw major results in a week.  </li>
            <li>Anytime my acne gets out of control, to the point that no other products help, this one never disappoints.</li>
            <li>the morning after using it for the first time she awoke to find that the breakout on her forehead was not as red and puffy as it had been...... 3 days later the breakout was actually going away.......</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t a major difference</li>
            <li>It makes your skin dry at first, like taught, so I only use the repair cream once a day before bed and the toner &amp; wash twice.</li>
            <li>or it could cause lifting of the skin just due to the  benzoyl peroxide and other strong ingredients it contains.</li>
            <li>After four days of using this product, nearly all of the small acne on my chin are gone, and the larger acne have diminished in size quite significantly.</li>
            <li>then I would feel a burning but this was easily avoided by just waiting a few min for my face to be completely dry.  </li>
            <li>(A few final words of advice: if you feel you need this product and you&#x27;re planning to spend the money to try it, you owe it to yourself to give it a good, long trial period during which you use it morning and night, and cut back on any other products you might be using (or cut them out altogether).</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with dry or sensitive skin, but I noticed they do make a kit for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d always have the concern in the back of my mind that the products could contribute to breakouts or not keep my skin clear, but I&#x27;ve tried nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;Derm</li>
            <li>etc.. have all been shown in proper combination to help to clear pores, increase cell turnover and exfoliation, soothe, hydrate and have anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li>etc.. have all been shown in proper combination to help to clear pores, increase cell turnover and exfoliation, soothe, hydrate and have anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li>My skin was going from clear to blotchy red almost overnight</li>
            <li>so I went out during my lunch break and picked up the regular AcneFree Clear Skin System.  </li>
            <li>My skin is now mostly clear with the occasional blemish that still pops up once in a while--</li>
            <li>I feel absolutely comfortable leaving the house with just a dusting of powder and a tiny bit of concealer on some scars (which are fading - though I&#x27;m not sure I can give credit to the AcneFree for that</li>
            <li>It clearly states on the box or bottles that it can bleach facial hair and clothes.</li>
            <li>In addition, it is simple to use, and the instructions are clear.  </li>
            <li>When my face remained clear, I went to just using the cleanser once daily in the shower.  </li>
            <li>Well after a week of using both my acne was completely gone and after 3 weeks all the blemishes and red spots were gone!</li>
            <li>only thing that had ever fixed my skin was the contraceptive pill, but as I stopped taking it 3 months ago, I wanted to find an alternative to fixing my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My only wish is that they would include a moisturizer in the pack so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy the sensitive skin pack just to get one.</li>
            <li>and I barely recognize my face.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After only a week of use, my face is completely \\&quot;acnefree\\&quot;, my skin tone is brighter</li>
            <li>For the last six years I&#x27;ve battled adult cystic acne caused from an imbalance of hormones.</li>
            <li>I am 40 and started to get adult acne, I have oily skin inmy T-Zone only .</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a male who got adult acne at age 29.  </li>
            <li>i can say it is enough for young age.</li>
            <li>I can only speak from experience, but following this method will give you the most amount of effectiveness and the least amount of side effects.</li>
            <li>I started using AcneFree about six months ago to deal with a sudden onset of adult acne.  </li>
            <li>I have red hair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I am in my early 30&#x27;s and never had a problem with acne until my mid 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>So far it has only been two days</li>
            <li>I have literally tried everything, especially all natural home remedies; honey, turmeric, tomato, lemon juice, Apple cider vinegar, yogurt, egg whites, ice cubes, I can&#x27;t even remember what all I&#x27;ve rubbed on my face</li>
            <li>/&gt;By the way, for reference, I do consider my skin somewhat sensitive, have rosacea, and only use this product at night.</li>
            <li>O_O</li>
            <li>I have had moderate to severe acne since I was about 15 years old.</li>
            <li>I believe I used this as a teen myself, now 30 years old</li>
            <li>The first week my skin was really rough (only to the touch, you couldn&#x27;t tell by looking) which worried me, but after some research it turned out just to be my skin adjusting to the benzoil peroxide.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seems like most of the complaints about these products is that it made acne worse.</li>
            <li>I find the toner can be more irritating</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t make it ANY better at all, it made it WORSE.  </li>
            <li>I was going through a stressful time and was more broken out than I had ever been.</li>
            <li>Be forewarned that it will cause blemishes to get worse before they get better.</li>
            <li>I just think it is kind of scary the level of chemicals that I was putting on my face for it to bleach these fabrics.  </li>
            <li>A few more products, down the line I read the reviews and with the price</li>
            <li>I have mild to moderate acne, nothing too bad, but I wanted to try something more than the usual acne washes I was using, and I decided on Acne Free because it was the cheapest \\&quot;skin</li>
            <li>I purchased Acne Free at a pharmacy and it ran me 4 dollars more so purchasing on line was less expensive than buying it locally.</li>
            <li>My skin starting breaking out pretty terribly, worse than it had in years, soon after I got pregnant.</li>
            <li>I have used ProActive for years and thought that this might be a great less expensive alternative.  </li>
            <li>the third day the skin was so dry and cracked it was very</li>
            <li>i mean afterall proactiv says not to buy cheap imitations..</li>
            <li>and I began to see results less than a week after my first application.</li>
            <li>the only problem is the first soln is used up slower than the other two.</li>
            <li>Let me start by saying that I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews, but I was compelled to do so because I&#x27;ve seen tremendous results with this product.</li>
            <li>I have avoided this so far by switching towels, using the wash only in the shower, and using the lotion only at night with old T-shirts and white sheets.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use it twice a day because I feel like it&#x27;s a bit harsh on my skin, and I normally moisturise parts of my face straight after the 3 steps because I found it really dried out parts of my skin when I first started losing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Alcohol is a cheap ingredient known to strip and dehydrate the skin and water down the potency of the other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Alcohol is a cheap ingredient known to strip and dehydrate the skin and water down the potency of the other ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and it seems to have worked really well for other people.</li>
            <li>It took two months of consistent use for me to achieve completely clear skin but from there on after, I might get a tiny pimple every 3 or 4 months that disappears within a few days.   </li>
            <li>The facial cleanser (Step 1) is a little more water-y than other generic Proactiv&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I have purchased this from the same store over and over and several times the wash and/or lotion will be a different texture, color, and consistency than it normally is.</li>
            <li>It has been only 5 days and my face is finally starting to return back to normal.  </li>
            <li>Not a SINGLE break out since.</li>
            <li>Several years later, I started getting occasional zits and very small bumps mostly on my forehead.  </li>
            <li>When I start using it twice a day regularly my skin gets a little tight, but I&#x27;ve tried other products that made my skin flake off in chunks or made my cheeks bright red.</li>
            <li>I decided to try something new, and a bit more expensive (only three dollars...but who&#x27;s counting?)</li>
            <li>I can completely see the difference when I travel and don&#x27;t take all of the steps - cheating by just taking Step 1 isn&#x27;t enough for a 5 day trip - but as soon as I get home, within 3 days, I&#x27;m back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>He is Asian, in his mid 20s&#x27;, who is suffering from severe adult acne all over his lower cheeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never really had acne my whole life up until the last couple of years.</li>
            <li>a tip, so you do not waste money paying EXTRA for the product and then EXTRA for shipping &amp; handling.</li>
            <li>and i started getting more and more acne and hated it</li>
            <li>The first week I had it, I saw little to no improvement.</li>
            <li>i noticed the black heads was gone and for the first week we both had some white head</li>
            <li>Not sure this is doing anything more or less than Proactive would.  </li>
            <li>Think about how long you&#x27;ve had acne, two to four weeks is not that look to wait for clear skin.</li>
            <li>but I was suffering from both regular acne and some very noticeable cystic and nodular acne that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get rid of through other means.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d cured acne before using natural products, but it took a long time.</li>
            <li>I reviewed the claims of the product with him and helped him through his first few time of using the product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;*At first this stuff dried out my lips and made them chap</li>
            <li>At first it seemed like it was clearing out my skin, but that was just for a few weeks.    </li>
            <li>so we&#x27;ll have to order a more expensive bottle of lotion online to make up for the loss absorbed by the cotton round.</li>
            <li>Acne Free system is the only thing that works on people with serious acne.</li>
            <li>I was depressed, I didn&#x27;t even wanted to go out anymore, and even when I did, I try not to make eye contact and just look down the whole time.     </li>
            <li>, my normal skin was starting to dry out which is why I switched to the regular.</li>
            <li>I must say though that the first step (Purifying Cleanser) stings/tingles a little bit, but it goes away after the next two steps.  </li>
            <li>This works well for the major problems but doesn&#x27;t clean up the real small bumps or blackheads.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product over proactive or other brands one might find in retail strores or online.</li>
            <li>Face is really dry after using it for a week, but my face is clear</li>
            <li>I was so desperate that I probably spent a small fortune trying pretty much every kind of acne \\&quot;cure\\</li>
            <li>then became pregnant in my late 20&#x27;s/30&#x27;s and still no skin problems.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After a couple of days the small bumps on forehead and nose began to clear but were immediately followed by large red bumps on cheeks.</li>
            <li>, I certainly seem to have less redness overall).</li>
            <li>I found that it does work better than ProActiv, and at (at least) half the cost.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re having trouble deciding between which treatment to get, I would certainly recommend the Severe Acne treatment over this one.</li>
            <li>a few large, deep acne spots on my chin and on my cheeks.</li>
            <li>I thought this product would be extremely helpful for getting rid of my acne due to the high amount of salicylic acid; however the result was the complete opposite.</li>
            <li>My face was swollen, eyelids swollen, bright red, burned and hurt really bad.  </li>
            <li>i generally have a difficult time finding things to talk about without it becoming an argument......</li>

            <li> That&#x27;s why even though I saw genuinely impressive results after two days of using the AcneFree kit, I held off writing this review until now.    </li>

            <li> It is AMAZING!  </li>

            <li> Great product, just as good as I remember.</li>

            <li> Worked fairly well for my 15 year-old son.</li>
            <li> I started using Acnefree and had fairly good results.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It has worked fairly well for me.</li>
            <li> Hope this review help and good luck with the battle against acne.</li>
            <li> but i have a really good moisturizer to battle with that.</li>
            <li> and i figured this would be good to try</li>
            <li> Well, acnefree it was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I literally had convinced myself that I was never going to have good skin..</li>
            <li> someone tried rubbing it off which they didn&#x27;t do a good job at.</li>
            <li> Good luck in finding your acne answer.</li>
            <li> Good, but not as good as proactive.</li>
            <li> But still a good product.</li>
            <li> Product worked great during warm moist months.</li>
            <li> Good Stuff ..</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as good as proactive</li>
            <li> The toner has witch hazel in it which is good for healing acne and acne scars.  </li>
            <li> the result is fairy good.</li>
            <li> Now to the good stuff.      </li>
            <li> Not as good, and</li>
            <li> This order came promptly, well-packaged and is a good value.  </li>
            <li> Its making me not want to buy it anymore... works good though</li>
            <li> but it just makes me feel good to have the roughness.     </li>
            <li> Good News:</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s nice to have attractive skin again.</li>
            <li> If you miss a day here and then, you shouldn&#x27;t expect good results.</li>
            <li> i used to use) and works almost as good or just as good.</li>
            <li> Good sale.</li>
            <li> Good product for the price.</li>
            <li> I read on this website to give the medicine a good 4-6 weeks, so I stuck in there.</li>
            <li> and I have used my fair share of acne products.</li>
            <li> Even though the MK acne products didnt work for me, there are still tons of amazing skin care products and these moisturizers make the skin feel amazing!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always taken excellent care of my skin, and had mild acne.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my order.</li>
            <li> so I decided to try the Severe Acne treatment and have been very satisfied with the results.</li>
            <li> I eat very healthily.....</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s completely worth it for my skin to be awesome.</li>
            <li> ALso i eat very healthy and take vitamins.</li>
            <li> She now uses a treatment kind of like the one on acne.org, it works good for her.</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, quick delivery</li>
            <li> but its the best thing right now.</li>
            <li> In just three days, my acne has cleared up and my skin looks better than ever!  </li>
            <li> A much better price than Proactiv!</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> What&#x27;s not to love!</li>
            <li> I bought this product and at first thought it was wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> and I wanted to look beautiful and acne free.</li>
            <li> Be sure to test it on your skin before you use it!</li>
            <li> Proactive has never done this, and in my opinion i think Proactive works much better!  </li>
            <li> It must be the ACNE FREE product!!&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I love it!  </li>
            <li> Preventative care is much better than dealing with acne once it develops!  </li>
            <li> Since using this product, I&#x27;ve been complemented on my complexion many times, something I never thought I&#x27;d hear!  </li>
            <li> We love it!</li>
            <li> More Like \\&quot;FreeAcne\\&quot;, because that&#x27;s what you get when you use this product!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> Love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Murad line for acne skin and found this product worked better for a fraction of the price!  </li>
            <li> im satisfied!</li>
            <li> It has a oil free purifying cleanser, renewing toner and repair lotion and comes in a very attractive packaging with easy instructions.</li>
            <li> Amazing stuff.  </li>
            <li> The difference in my skin is amazing.  </li>
            <li> But this product is amazing.  </li>
            <li> It works amazingly.</li>
            <li> The toner is amazing</li>
            <li> I saw all the great reviews about Acne Free and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Honestly the best thing for clear skin is a good diet and drinking water.</li>
            <li> He continued using it on his own and began seeing results.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any unusual or timely breakouts from use of the product line, but Kardashian&#x27;s Perfect Skin cleanser always seemed to cause pimples on my skin anytime I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> so I had decided to try the Perfect Skin cleanser again, but much to my dismay,</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 1/2 days and was thrilled with it until this evening.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wonderful, affordable, and really works.</li>
            <li> Still I loved it and you can love it too,</li>
            <li> I am using something to try to combat the scarring, but it hasn&#x27;t been that effective.</li>
            <li> When I opened the package the two products that have expiration dates we&#x27;re expired and it looked liked</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve told my sisters so they can have nice skin.</li>
            <li> After a week, I was absolutely thrilled.  </li>
            <li> Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how Proactive is still in business after AcneFree came out</li>
            <li> and I liked the smell of the products</li>
            <li> Do they not have any kind of quality control at all?</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own (and my son&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> I all but gave up hope of finding an effective treatment.</li>
            <li> , so I especially liked the fact that this kit included a gentle benzoyl peroxide lotion.     </li>
            <li> and I am happy to say I am more than pleased with the results....</li>
            <li> I did not think this product did anything to be honest.</li>
            <li> it works just as good or better than proactive</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> , I am glad word of mouth is still the way we share good news.</li>
            <li> Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> It is gentle yet effective and does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> so i tried this because it&#x27;s supposed to be just as effective...</li>
            <li> And I just want you reviewers out there to know that I got this product for free to try and review, but all opinions (AND RESULTS!!) are 100% my own :)</li>
            <li> We received this for free to sample and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> Cheaper and more easily available than ProActive, this product works great.  </li>
            <li> I can honestly say that this is the most amazing product</li>
            <li> But as a mild benzoyl peroxide product, this one is great.  </li>
            <li> Quick delivery , great product.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of all of my pimples, but it&#x27;s cleared my skin up a fair bit which is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Works awesome for adult acne.  </li>
            <li> and i think i&#x27;m breaking out even more to be honest.</li>
            <li> now i can&#x27;t find anything to clear it up perfectly.</li>
            <li> so i started using Klear action - it was great!</li>
            <li> That is because the best way to treat acne is prevent it, not try and clear it up.  </li>
            <li> Just like ProActive, but honestly, I think better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I have ever tried for clear skin.</li>
            <li> I am so thrilled we just love this product.  </li>
            <li> not a bad product really effective!</li>
            <li> This is especially true if you wait a while for the toner (I tend to run out of that the quickest) to dry and set 100% before applying the lotion, which I find to be the best route.</li>
            <li> these product are too strong!</li>
            <li> It is very important to use all three steps.  </li>
            <li> , I really liked how easy it was to use too.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thrilled that something so easy to get would work so much better than any hyped up product.  </li>
            <li> It is very smooth and calming and refreshing.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got the opportunity to try otherwise</li>
            <li> He began suffering from acne last year and though it bothers him, he hasn&#x27;t been the best at keeping routine to wash and take care of his skin.</li>
            <li> sure to check the date on the box to receive product with maximum efficacy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This can lead to more breakouts once you moisturize in order to offset the dryness and dehydration.</li>
            <li> as I&#x27;d emailed them via their website.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, and good luck, everyone.e it appear more clear, bright and even-toned.</li>
            <li> She has more self confidence now and has been more outgoing</li>
            <li> Plus, my skin tone was more even.</li>
            <li> thought maybe combining both would provide better results.</li>
            <li> But I really think this combo is worth a shot, I am very impressed with how well it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Works real quick.</li>
            <li> it has cleared up most my acne</li>
            <li> but overall best one i have ever tried.</li>
            <li> This product made my skin break out more.</li>
            <li> Spend the $10 more and get severe.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m fed up -- I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, but I&#x27;m not one of them.</li>
            <li> We started using the Acne Free and it cleared her up!</li>
            <li> After a year of use, my skin is still much better that it once was</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll probably love it.    </li>
            <li> Okay what regement were you on before you started using this?</li>
            <li> and I had to go to eBay to order more toner after just a week, but</li>
            <li> After about three weeks I started to notice that I was getting more breakouts, but I wasn;t worried, because products like this are supposed to make you break out</li>
            <li> But part of me feels like if this were stronger medicine it would have had a better effect.</li>
            <li> I experience most on jaw area from hormones or stress, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many treatments, including ProActive which didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> face NEVER cleared up and, in fact, I broke out even more.</li>
            <li> I tried sticking to it for about a month just to see and it just never got better.</li>
            <li> This system is fabulous!</li>
            <li> This product creates more problems than it fixes plus all of my clothes have bleach marks.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> but I love it</li>
            <li> but when I switched to the twice a day regime I took out the toner and everything seemed to be ok.</li>
            <li> The whole process works great for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;We are going to try olive oil to return the skin to healthy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s relatively cheap!  </li>
            <li> And then get Accutane:).</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Then it started getting better</li>
            <li> It feels more like a lotion; as if i am applying lotion to my face and then rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> Do you want more break outs and a greasy face?  </li>
            <li> I thought I knew better by now.  </li>
            <li> Curse you Acne Free!</li>
            <li> Most of the pimples went away</li>
            <li> but when I used the so-called \\&quot;Repairing Lotion\\&quot;, it CAUSED more pimples.</li>
            <li> and it is doing a much better job.  </li>
            <li> Got this as a free sample from smiley360 and it works amazingly well and cleared up my face in just a matter of days.</li>
            <li> By the forth day, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looked.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years and love the results.</li>
            <li> A couple of tips to make sure this works for you:  1.</li>
            <li> Seems to work okay.</li>
            <li> as well, and for the price it&#x27;s a better deal for me</li>
            <li> The cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather, which is okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I switched over from Proactive to AcneFree.</li>
            <li> To me it seems likes the product works much better.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s 1000x better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> it has cleared up most my acne</li>
            <li> Also, any redness caused by the acne has also disappeared, and my skin tone is even and healthy looking.    </li>
            <li> I just need to do a better job, I suppose.    </li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> When I saw acnefree claimed to work better than proactive, and reminding me of how well proactive worked for me, I had to give this stuff a try.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of proactive, but for me, works even better.</li>
            <li> It is a superb quality item at a price that simply cannot be beat.</li>
            <li> We had to make sure that he always had plenty of lotion applied to his skin.  </li>
            <li> The Toner doesn&#x27;t sting and its not sticky like most acne toners.</li>
            <li> And I am really glad I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> My skin has gotten even better with fewer breakouts and more even texture.</li>
            <li> This product worked much better than I thought it would.</li>
            <li> it gets a lot better</li>
            <li> and then it stops and doesnt get better than that</li>
            <li> &#x3D;) .</li>
            <li> I just use the #3 repair lotion, and nothing I found is better.</li>
            <li> (this did not work at all, it made him break out even more, this was after a week of using this product.  </li>
            <li> Just make sure</li>
            <li> , I was going to order more</li>
            <li> I was told they are constantly tweaking their product to see what people like best.</li>
            <li> If you find a product that clears most of your acne, then stick with it.</li>
            <li> Luck :)</li>
            <li> I have always had much better results with the Proactiv System.</li>
            <li> This just was not the product for me! :)</li>
            <li> I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Preventative care is much better than dealing with acne once it develops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> When I saw so many people say that AcneFree works better than ProActiv, I decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really glad I found this</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m confident that my face will be cleared up before I go.</li>
            <li> I love my skin, I&#x27;m 36</li>
            <li> and it does make your face a touch softer without you know, putting more chemicals on your face.</li>
            <li> Most products tell you not to apply to the eye area.</li>
            <li> I love this product...</li>
            <li> I love it...</li>
            <li> Some days I use it twice, but most days I don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> decided not to use it any more      </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Purifying cleanser 1 night and realized that with my old-mom-skin that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this every night.</li>
            <li> nights passed and she was okay.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now and love it.</li>
            <li> It keep us both pimple free!</li>
            <li> The part i enjoyed was it set a skin routine for her that she still follows now.</li>
            <li> I have been using this as directed for almost a week now, and I already see greater clarity.</li>
            <li> it seems to work better if you wash any makeup off your face before cleansing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25, but I still have acne from stress and too many sweets, so I try to remember to use this stuff every day.  </li>
            <li> I love this</li>
            <li> Maybe it won&#x27;t work for everyone but to someone who has tried most and tried Pro Activ</li>
            <li> I am so glad I took the chance and tried something that compares to Pro Activ, it never had a reverse effect where I broke out before it got better</li>
            <li> My skin is glowing :)</li>
            <li> After being fed up with most supposed \\&quot;miracle</li>
            <li> By the second week, I had absolutely perfect skin.</li>
            <li> This product works better than anything else.</li>
            <li> More than a month out: Acne is close to zero.</li>
            <li> - I just wanted it to get better.</li>
            <li> I was using proactiv before, which helped a lot, but then I saw this in store that said \\&quot;works better than proactiv\\&quot;(What a crock of poop),so</li>
            <li> more vegetable and fruit...... drink more water......</li>
            <li> Most of my breakouts are in the chin area.</li>
            <li> That being said, it is clearing up the acne, and my skin is looking better day by day.</li>
            <li> and I could feel the effects of drying a bit, mostly under my eyes, so</li>
            <li> I need to give it more time to see if it has any preventative qualities as well.</li>
            <li> So I would make sure you didnt get a product that was out of date or something.</li>
            <li> I am glad there is no foul smell to the products.</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> everything ive tried worked OK.</li>
            <li> and i just bought 2 for $10.99 each love the product but its way over priced here</li>
            <li> and omggg my face looks better than it has in a longggg time.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also happen to love this line...</li>
            <li> There is no practical purpose for these microbeads given that using a cotton pad with their step 2 toner exfoliates better than microbeads.  </li>
            <li> In four, it felt better and looked better than it had in years.</li>
            <li> my skin looks so much better</li>
            <li> I, however, have tried many many products since my 20s till now</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll give it a try two more weeks and will update my rating if it improve.  </li>
            <li> I have tried all sorts of treatments including many prescription medications and even antibiotics.  </li>
            <li> However, Acnefree is better than all of them.  </li>
            <li> I had been getting them mostly on my cheeks, and I wanted something that would get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> ABSO love</li>
            <li> Product was as advertised, I haven&#x27;t used it at this time so this isn&#x27;t overly appropriate.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a better price anywhere</li>
            <li> And all I recommend to try this is an acceptable price :)</li>
            <li> I love this face wash.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it really works.</li>
            <li> sure you never miss a day.</li>
            <li> Works better.</li>
            <li> My complexion got a lot better and then started to decline about 2 years ago when I stopped using birth control.</li>
            <li> Results will always vary from person to person so I am glad I did not get my hopes up.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased as punch to have the opportunity for my son to try this product.</li>
            <li> I love Proactic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for about 3 months now, and I love it.</li>
            <li> but i really hope that acne free will work, even if it&#x27;s taking forever for me to see RESULTS!!!</li>
            <li> I have dealt with super oily, very acne-prone skin for thirty years, and I honeslty didn&#x27;t expect the kind of great results that I have achieved with this product line.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really want to try Acnefree at first because my best friend told me that it \\&quot;sucks.\\&quot;</li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling very clean.</li>
            <li> and it worked pretty good for a while</li>
            <li> I purchase at the warehouse stores and the price is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> an hastle folks try it for the first time or switch to it for good</li>
            <li> In my experience using it for 3 days, as it promised, showed a great difference, clearing breakouts and preventing new ones.</li>
            <li> I am a new happy user.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t too great, but it&#x27;s not disgusting or someone that will completely put you off.</li>
            <li> Gentle and pleasant aroma.  </li>
            <li> Good price for such a good product.</li>
            <li> i think for me the BP ingredient was way too strong for my skin(i have pretty fair colored skin) but</li>
            <li> Great price, super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> My husband is on proactiv and it works fine too, it just costs more money.</li>
            <li> I loved the way it cleared up my acne and made my skin feel, but didn&#x27;t love the high price tag that came with it.</li>
            <li> This has been easily remedied with a rich moisturizer (I found Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Lotion with SPF 15 for the day, and Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream for night use to work</li>
            <li> I like Acne Free better than Proactiv.</li>
            <li> I have even tried the severe (all orange packaging) and found that it works brilliantly to jump start the process of clearing up your face - by about the end of the \\&quot;severe\\&quot; and using it daily (not nightly)</li>
            <li> My makeup also looks great when my skin is so clear and non-greasy.    </li>
            <li> and it said better than proactiv and had a free acnefree terminator with it</li>
            <li> Thanks, and good luck, everyone.</li>
            <li> I know that not everything works for everyone, but having clearer skin is nice, so this might be worth a shot for you too.</li>
            <li> I was ready to just throw in the towl and see a dermatologist thinking that if I didnt I would be stuck with this for the rest of my life, and my sister saw a dermatologist and had good results.</li>
            <li> It works very well just as good as proactive.</li>
            <li> After this I switched right to proactiv and my skin is now Acnefree because of proavtic!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years; it made a huge difference from the first time I used it to this day!!!</li>
            <li> it may be worth your while, and no expensive commercials or famous actors to stand by it either!!</li>
            <li> but frankly, dont have that kind of money right now.</li>
            <li> My face is smooth, clean &amp; at the rate AcneFree is working, I should look flawless in the next week or so.</li>
            <li> It would make it appear more clear, bright and even-toned.</li>
            <li> All I have is healthy skin that feels and looks smooth and blemish free.</li>
            <li> but after a few more days I have had and continue to have the best skin i have ever had.</li>
            <li> It works and it has three easy steps.</li>
            <li> and it goes away very quickly.</li>
            <li> It is some strong stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This product is way too strong and all you will get it hurt and irritated skin.      </li>
            <li> The benzoyl peroxide in the repair lotion is strong, so I use it once a day, (at night.)</li>
            <li> I got this product for my daughter but it was to strong for her skin.</li>
            <li> , the products smelled so strong, the scents of each one were nauseating.</li>
            <li> You can have your beautiful skin and your confidence back.</li>
            <li> My son has acne and I&#x27;ve tried several products before this one and really have not been impressed by many.  </li>
            <li> Okay, let me start this review with my full story.</li>
            <li> My makeup applies better, my acne scars have faded, no peeling, and no painful dryness.</li>
            <li> This is the best product hands down that I have used</li>
            <li> Alcohol also dries the skin and emphasizes fine lines.</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re stressed to use it twice a day, otherwise it&#x27;s fine to use it once per day.</li>
            <li> I believe AcneFree could easily do the job, but they miss the boat on an important element: exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I peeled a little bit at first, but you kind of have to work the program to what fits best for you.</li>
            <li> This is the biggest thing Proactiv does right, with the perfect amount of gentle exfoliation that actually removes skin cells gently and leaves the skin looking and feeling great.  </li>
            <li> so when i got the chance to try Acne free for no cost, i thought it would be a good opportunity for her to try something new for her skin.</li>
            <li> It sounds like some people are allergic, but I&#x27;m not, and I saw results, no joke, the very first time I used it!  </li>
            <li> I tried this stuff and after 2 or 3 weeks I noticed a huge difference.</li>
            <li> I get huge cyst like pimples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference.  </li>
            <li> I received this product free from smiley and figured I might as well give it a try.</li>
            <li> I received the AcneFree 24 Hour Acne Clearing System Kit free from Smiley360.</li>
            <li> : I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product to anybody who is suffering from acne as this product is great for clearing up acne.</li>
            <li> I just started using acne free 3 step kit</li>
            <li> One month later my skin looks great.  </li>
            <li> i decided to try acne free</li>
            <li> Please stay away from Acne Free products.</li>
            <li> I also tried pro-active, and I have seen several dermatologists, but I still experienced whiteheads, blackheads, and cysts.</li>
            <li> Yes, Acne Free does work wonders.</li>
            <li> Overall, a great product; I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so time consuming.</li>
            <li> But the transition was rather smooth.</li>
            <li> Sooo After i had these stress pimples popping up i went to the store and grabbed this Acne Free.</li>
            <li> This product has always worked for me and it was at a great low price.</li>
            <li> Free from acne.</li>
            <li> I use the Acne Free Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Step 2.</li>
            <li> Acne Free Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> Acne Free does.  </li>
            <li> So I would not buy Acne Free again.  </li>
            <li> My cousin told me about Acne Free</li>
            <li> It made my skin feel really smooth.  </li>
            <li> Since I got it at my Shop Rite, it came with a free Acne and Blackhead Terminator.  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received this as a  free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> Blemishes that begin to erupt just disappear after a day or two of applying Acne Free.</li>
            <li> Around day 6 or 7 I started getting compliments from my co-workers about how clear and bright my complexion was.  </li>
            <li> &quot; vitamins with acne free as well see how that goes</li>
            <li> As a person who is in his mid-late 20&#x27;s who has struggled with acne for most of my life, I have some information that may be useful as I have researched and tried everything, including prescriptions.    </li>
            <li> but they stopped selling it at the drug store, so i started getting acne free instead.</li>
            <li> and I thought that this product would help me, but when I applied the cleanser to my face, it felt itchy, burning, and it did not feel smooth at all.</li>
            <li> I have been acne free for about two months now.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially important to hit the spots that you aren&#x27;t going to use repair lotion on, so those areas can some daily exposure to the benzoyl peroxide medication.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially important to hit the spots that you aren&#x27;t going to use repair lotion on, so those areas can some daily exposure to the benzoyl peroxide medication.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted my skin to be blemish free, so</li>
            <li> My face is smooth.</li>
            <li> finally, I&#x27;m free.    </li>
            <li> I was shopping in Ulta and came across this acne free kit and bought it because it had a free knock off clarisonic skin unit attached.</li>
            <li> Its great, I saw results instantly from both, but proactive helped to fix the burns I recieved from the off brand.  </li>
            <li> It is still important to moisturize your skin, no matter if it&#x27;s oily.</li>
            <li> Go get an oil free moisturizer and apply it after your cleansing regimen.</li>
            <li> I use Mary Kay oil free moisturizer as well as MK oil free hydrating gel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a shot :)</li>
            <li> I purchased acne free one week ago.</li>
            <li> Bought Acne Free</li>
            <li> Use Acne Free</li>
            <li> Her skin was free of acne within three days of using this product.</li>
            <li> I started using Acne Free in Sept 2010.</li>
            <li> Acne free works so well</li>
            <li> I received a free AcneFree kit through Smiley360.  </li>
            <li> I received this as a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> It is extremely smooth and does not exfoliate, unlike Proactiv.</li>
            <li> an enjoy the results</li>
            <li> It would be called Free Ance instead of Ance Free.</li>
            <li> Although I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is necessarily better, this purchase is definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is cheap and works.</li>
            <li> I bought Acne Free on August 14, 2007.</li>
            <li> Today is August 22, I  can say my chin is smooth again</li>
            <li> I have not had this issue with Acne Free</li>
            <li> I ordered/paid for the Acne Free 3-piece kit from Pharmapacks on 8/14/12.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> Imagine my shock when my skin looked fantastic again</li>
            <li> I received this product free to try.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, and package was nice.</li>
            <li> She loves how it works, and we&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement of her skin since using Acne Free.  </li>
            <li> :  I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> So cheap as compared to stores.</li>
            <li> so I thought I would give Acne free a chance.  </li>
            <li> I received this product free for the purpose of reviewing it.</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free from Smiley 360 for my son.  </li>
            <li> He is so happy and his confidence is coming back .  </li>
            <li> &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review.</li>
            <li> I received AcneFree 3 step products as a free sample from Smiley360.</li>
            <li> I bought AcneFree a couple months ago when I ran out of my beloved Klear Action.</li>
            <li> I feel much more confident about myself and people now compliment my much clearer complexion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been over 4 months now, and my skin has not look this good since I was 10 years old.</li>
            <li> I found this to be far more effective than Proactiv.  </li>
            <li> To be fair though, the warning on the package clearly states to keep the product away from the eyes.</li>
            <li> Better and more gentle than Pro-Activ.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good--</li>
            <li> This has completely turned my life around, and its at a fair price.</li>
            <li> Acnefree works as good as regular proactiv an better than proactiv plus for a fraction of the  price....</li>
            <li> This price on AMAZON is more than what I pay for AcneFree Severe which is much stronger, includes 4 bottles, and costs more at any store you buy it (between $21.89-31.</li>
            <li> The best part is, I&#x27;m wearing way less make-up!</li>
            <li> The best part is, I&#x27;m wearing way less make-up!  </li>
            <li> But the AcneFree has worked beautifully for me, so as long as they keep making it, I plan to keep buying and using it!    </li>
            <li> I started out using the sensitive version, which was good, but decided to use the original.</li>
            <li> You have to try it for longer than two or three days to really see the results!!!</li>
            <li> I  want to say that after using it  I have already noticed that my skin is more calm and clean.</li>
            <li> do want to say that after using it for two days I have already noticed that my skin is more calm and clean.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clean and free of acne.</li>
            <li> Acne free has kept my face clean for over a year now</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> The system is straight forward and very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Neither one completely cured my acne, but it&#x27;s good for people with some mild acne, not a cure all.</li>
            <li> My daughter began to use it and achieve good results in less than three weeks effectively as I remove the unwanted acne.</li>
            <li> I started getting the great big puss filled ones, which I rarely got like that before.  </li>
            <li> do love the first 2 steps (oil-free purifying cleanser &amp; renewing toner)</li>
            <li> First I tried the many of Oxy pads, clearasil cleansers, etc and nothing was working.  </li>
            <li> At first this stuff was like a magic kit on face.</li>
            <li> I can usually use anything and still have perfect skin.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 7 years, it is the best product out there (in my opinion).  </li>
            <li> It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> The solution doesn&#x27;t rid your body of acne permanently, but if you are consistent and dedicated, it will remove most of your acne.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t worth it!  </li>
            <li> was going to use the original Proactiv but found this cheaper offshoot product</li>
            <li> First 2 days were okay...</li>
            <li> This series of products has cleared up my daughter&#x27;s pimples and significantly reduced her blackheads.  </li>
            <li> I had recently started applying pure tea tree oil to my face and felt the combination would be ideal.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use and honestly is a great bargain when you consider that other acne creams alone can cost close to $15.</li>
            <li> It does take time to work - any new treatment for Acne takes 6 weeks to become fully effective.  </li>
            <li> If you do this twice a day you will have clean face.</li>
            <li> clean and exercise.</li>
            <li> By eating clean</li>
            <li> Clean your shower towel once a week.</li>
            <li> Clean your comforter covers once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Follow this regiment every day and you should have a clean face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The bottom line is that my skin looks incredible, for half the price and none of the frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This was a great product except that i had to stop using it because it made my skin so dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I am sooo happy to report I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple in a month now.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have been breaking out more now than when I was 16!</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and looks really healthy!</li>
            <li> I guess they call it Acne Free because it gives you just the right conditions for acne to run free all over your face.  </li>
            <li> I looked up reviews of other treatments, and saw a brand \\&quot;exposed\\&quot; that received many good reviews.</li>
            <li> Acne Free is the first system to work!</li>
            <li> My diet is excellent and very healthy, and I&#x27;ve tried various vitamins and herbs with little success.</li>
            <li> I tried it on in the evening and by 8:00 pm my face looked like a blowfish; bright cherry red.</li>
            <li> for the first time in several years people were commenting on how great my skin looked and wanted to know what I was using.</li>
            <li> When I got this, I was a bit skeptic because I&#x27;ve tried so many acne products that claims to work fast over the years, and yet I ended with no results.</li>
            <li> His acne cleared up and his skin has started to look much healthier than it did before he started using the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with the fast acting results and with the ease of use.</li>
            <li> Most of them don&#x27;t help much</li>
            <li> so i tried the free trial of proactive and it was a months worth of product.</li>
            <li> so i really didnt want to spend any more money on it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it really keeps my acne under control.</li>
            <li> AcneFree seemed similar, and had a good price.</li>
            <li> For me, it was worth the sacrifice to be pimple free.</li>
            <li> Getting back to my story, I loved proactive.</li>
            <li> so it is good to use a moisturizer as a fourth step.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad to say that the product really works.  </li>
            <li> so I believe this is true.    </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve actually noticed a good improvement.</li>
            <li> The true reason I got it was because I was on a budget and proactive</li>
            <li> One thing I do wish is that the cleanser had more grittiness to it to exfoliate the skin but it works so I really can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I would pay way more for this even if it took much longer.</li>
            <li> Love it and so much cheaper than proactiv.</li>
            <li> I love it , It really works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as it continues to improve my skin, and I think it&#x27;s been more effective than any other skin treatment I&#x27;ve tried (which isn&#x27;t very many!).</li>
            <li> I got the product right through smiley360 free.</li>
            <li> Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear acne fighting kit, clearasil advanced, and a bunch more.  </li>
            <li> I am a guy out on his own paying his own bills and am on an extremely tight budget, I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $50,$40, even $30 a month on a skin product, even though I wish I had the money</li>
            <li> I have been using acne free for about a year now and had fantastic results but it eventually plateaued at a certain point</li>
            <li> This product would be great IF you have extremely oily skin?</li>
            <li> I stopped peeling immediately and still had fresh clean skin.  </li>
            <li> The morning following application of Perfect Skin cleanser, my skin had tiny pimples on the cheeks and a hive type of blemish on my chin.</li>
            <li> The morning following application of Perfect Skin cleanser, my skin had tiny pimples on the cheeks and a hive type of blemish on my chin.</li>
            <li> Now I am trying to find a more natural alternative like tea tree oil cleanser,alcohol free toner, etc..</li>
            <li> The only time I break out is when I get my period and for a girl who has been constantly struggling for years,this is the best thing that could happen!</li>
            <li> The spot treatment dries and clears up blemishes quickly.</li>
            <li> For the price however, it&#x27;s a sufficient product for those with mild acne (3-4 pimples a week).</li>
            <li> Embarassed and wanting it gone quickly</li>
            <li> My daughter is 14 and has mild acne but gets stress breakouts.  </li>
            <li> After weeks of frustration, I began reading online about my options, and it quickly appeared that a benzoyl peroxide-based solution would be preferable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is truly a dupe of Proactiv, but you can still use it if your skin isn&#x27;t super greasy (mine isn&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li> It feels better and it actually looks better.</li>
            <li> Before I buy anything, I review it extensively, to make sure I get the most for my money.</li>
            <li> Put some darn mild abrasives in your cleanser, would ya?</li>
            <li> The 3 steps are quick and painless - it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to be clearing up my skin, but if you&#x27;re looking for a product that works quickly, this is not it.</li>
            <li> It feels better and it actually looks better.</li>
            <li> i do have a mild acne problem, but there are days when my face just tends to break out.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne and sometimes it flares up from stress, drinking, etc.</li>
            <li> I have never had a product that worked so well and so quickly.</li>
            <li> , I highly recommend it to any one with acne problems I also love how affordable it is.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also concerned that stripping the skin with alcohol leads to dehydration, flaking and possible emphasis of fine lines since hydration and propr balance are especially important for mature skin.</li>
            <li> The perscription didn&#x27;t get rid of all the acne, about 90-95 percent of it, which is good enough, right?     </li>
            <li> In the first week of using this product there was a huge difference in her complexion.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a really good scrubber too, I rub, I lightly use my fingers, and I rub my cleansers in for quite a while, and I had never had this problem with other cleansers.    </li>
            <li> Be very consistent.</li>
            <li> Free Severe Acne Treatment (this also did not work at all, even though the acid in this product was a higher</li>
            <li> I first started using Acne Free almost 2 months ago.</li>
            <li> One pimple will clear up and start looking good and another 3 will pop up, I read some reviews and read that you will break out more in the beginning as it cleanses deep in your pores, so i stuck with it thinking</li>
            <li> However, over the last three years as I went into my twenties, I started get more and more breaks out on my face, mostly centered on my chin and on the side of my face near my cheekbones.</li>
            <li> im not quite sure, and ive gotten new pimples, some that have gone and some that have stayed.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to clean normal</li>
            <li> The product came very quickly and was very inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Anyway, I tried this stuff and loved it, then my skin started to dry out</li>
            <li> I limited the use to once a day and got a good moisturizer, which helped with the dryness.</li>
            <li> thought that the lotion had a positive effect on my mom skin, but it&#x27;s too drying for me, at my advanced age, to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stick to Proactiv or a similar brand you know and are confident in!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 20 with mild/moderate acne and this actually worked better for me than the Proactiv that I tried!  </li>
            <li> love this and would completely recommend it to anyone!</li>
            <li> A WHOLE MONTH!!</li>
            <li> If you are looking to reduce your acne quickly, and are willing to follow the directions given, I have no doubts that this system will help you out; I recommend it with full confidence.</li>
            <li> The first night we used it , it made our skin feel really clean.</li>
            <li> Burts Bees peach scrub, which I loved the way it moisturized, but caused me to still break out because it was too oily and left a film on my skin, though the toners were good but buying everything in conjunction was just a little to pricey.</li>
            <li> I have acne, acne scars and huge pores that are really visible.</li>
            <li> I was using proactive but eventually tried Acne Free because it&#x27;s much cheaper.</li>
            <li> my child skin  cleard up thanks to ance free .she</li>
            <li> I probably wouldn&#x27;t have after trying tons of products before without success</li>
            <li> will keep you posted on whether the University Medical products are effective as they&#x27;ve just been purchased.</li>
            <li> I will keep you posted on whether the University Medical products are effective as they&#x27;ve just been purchased.</li>
            <li> I would say within a week you have glowing skin, yes a pimple here and there, but the amount that disappears is worth the use.</li>
            <li> I will have to keep using the product to see if it keeps working, but so far, I love it</li>
            <li> After 4 months of using AcneFree, my skin is so much more clear.</li>
            <li> and I actually liked to use it three times a day, especially if I was sweating a lot.    </li>
            <li> I personally love the way the whole treatment works, the wash isn&#x27;t slimy, it washes off real well.</li>
            <li> be fooled, it&#x27;s not going to give you perfect skin, but it most likely will help your acne, at least if it&#x27;s mild/moderate.</li>
            <li> ok once they clear out it will work.</li>
            <li> I could almost deal with the fact that none of the products smell particularly nice if they actually worked.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After months of \\&quot;dealing\\&quot; with the problem, I finally determined it wouldn&#x27;t go away on its own.  </li>
            <li> It was worth the try for $16</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t honestly say I recommend this to everyone because everyone&#x27;s skin is different.</li>
            <li> Maybe it has something to do with one&#x27;s skin, because I see where a number of people have had success with this product, while others, like myself, did not.</li>
            <li> klear action is much better</li>
            <li> and I figured that it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Family and friends have even commented; even though I&#x27;ve never had much acne, they&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks much smoother and more radiant than before.  </li>
            <li> Family and friends have even commented; even though I&#x27;ve never had much acne, they&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks much smoother and more radiant than before.  </li>
            <li> I looked at reviews for AcneFree and saw a lot of success stories for people with moderate-to-severe acne</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really clear my face up any better than anything I could&#x27;ve bought over-the-counter.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this stuff I was constantly self-conscious about the state of my face and had days when I honestly dreaded leaving the house as a result.</li>
            <li> when i started using Acne Free, within 2 or three days i had MORE pimples all over, my face was red..</li>
            <li> worth the money</li>
            <li> Klear Action worked better but is discontinued.</li>
            <li> Though, don&#x27;t put this on in conjunction, as in right after using the system or before, it&#x27;s more like an afternoon thing between uses, otherwise it just kind of renders doing either kind of useless.  </li>
            <li> My experience with this product has been a very positive one.</li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s is alcohol free, inexpensive right here on Amazon, and much gentler on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Thayer&#x27;s is alcohol free, inexpensive right here on Amazon, and much gentler on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Wishing just two weeks,I saw amazing results and have never loved my skin more!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about six months since my original review, and my skin is still smooth and completely acne-free.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about six months since my original review, and my skin is still smooth and completely acne-free.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried neutrogena, proactive, and many other acne cleansers and they all seemed to make me break out more and made my skin oliy.</li>
            <li> My first try was AcneFree &amp; I am so lucky b/c</li>
            <li> After using it for the first week, I quickly noticed the difference....</li>
            <li> One other thing that she really liked was that her skin felt soft, clean and healthy.</li>
            <li> I comparable this kit in some ways to original Proactiv, but at a much lower price.</li>
            <li> Very inexpensive, I paid $20, its worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as it has really changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li> This one started to work right away.  </li>
            <li> Not having the money right then to buy Proactiv, I settled for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> who ever said it suck all the acne causeing garbage to the surface then gets rid of it was right.</li>
            <li> I just saw my cousin 2 days ago &amp; he noticed my face right away.</li>
            <li> I do not recommend mixing the products right away though, after washing if I didn&#x27;t wait about 5 min</li>
            <li> My recommendation is to try this product on your neck or something first to make sure you are not overly sensitive.  </li>
            <li> (mainly cause it was cheap at the drugstore)</li>
            <li> We received this full sized product for FREE from Smiley360 and tried it with my 13 year old son.</li>
            <li> Frankly I am not really sure how effective this is even though my acne situation is getting much better now.....</li>
            <li> By the next day it was practically gone, but instead of a huge bump I got a huge acne scar.</li>
            <li> We switched to  The Clean and Clear Advantage System  for the last week and it has worked amazing.</li>
            <li> If you have a sensitive skin like me, I strongly recommend logona products for blemished skin.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a more natural exfoliate that&#x27;s still gentle</li>
            <li> The cleanser is a bit harsh on the skin, but the toner and lotion are amazing and indispensable .</li>
            <li> I have actually tried Proactive and loved it, but for the price, I would use this again if it keeps my skin mostly clear.</li>
            <li> granted, this is better than a bar of soap, but it&#x27;s definately worth spending the extra $20 to get proactiv.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t done so, but based on the many reviews I&#x27;ve read, your skin will bounce right back to square</li>
            <li> Miracle in a bottle, it not only clears the acne but it makes your skin very smooth.</li>
            <li> it does work and is readily available at most stores, but if Proactive were available at the same places for the same price or close to it I would switch in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> a huge advocate of the Proactiv Original System, but reviewing University Medical 24 Hour ClearIng System as well since I&#x27;ve tried both</li>
            <li> This has helped clear up my face tremendously!</li>
            <li> I was happy that it calmed down the bumps, but after a day, more bumps and whiteheads were appearing in the healed area due to irritation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old white male with very fair skin.</li>
            <li> I even used a brand new clean face exfoliator with the cleanser to see if that would do the trick..</li>
            <li> I have seen such a huge difference in just a week!</li>
            <li> I would defiantly buy the first 2 steps of this skin system again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure</li>
            <li> the years passed, I started to get interested in trying out skincare with anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li> So I had acne most of my teenage years and now I am 25 and still have some spots here</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty convinced now that there are no miracle overnight acne cures</li>
            <li> My acne was never terrible, but it was enough that it used to make me pretty self-conscious; I always had pimples on my chin and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This was her first year</li>
            <li> First, the acne just got wilder.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many different products.</li>
            <li> For the first time in six years, my skin is nearly acne free.  </li>
            <li> My only wish is that the cleanser would be a bit more exfoliating.</li>
            <li> I did it just at night for the first couple of weeks</li>
            <li> That is part of the reason I use another face wash first, plus you cannot use the acne wash on your eye area.</li>
            <li> I was starting to notice i was getting more acne</li>
            <li> I have been using it faithfully morning and night for 3-4 weeks now, at first it seemed to be working</li>
            <li> , i think its just simply making me break out even more</li>
            <li> At first nothing changed, for like the first 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> and then it really cleared up my skin!</li>
            <li> so make sure you have an outside moisturizer to throw into your routine.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> Ii&#x27;m fifteen, and used this system exactly as directed (twice a day, morning and night).</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> You just got to be consistent to see results</li>
            <li> I decided to try it first.  </li>
            <li> I love this stuff and the next thing I want to try is their Sulfur mask.</li>
            <li> The first time I purchased this product I started to notice results in 3 days, just as it was advertised.  </li>
            <li> First off, I want to start by saying I used to use proactive twice a day.</li>
            <li> I do not have severe acne, I do not even have moderate acne most of the time, so I would say I am somewhere between light-moderate acne level.</li>
            <li> For these reasons, I gladly recommend this product to others in hopes it will give them the same results.</li>
            <li> He has tried many medications, topical and pill, but everything irritated him.  </li>
            <li> Free Clear Skin System 3-step Kit</li>
            <li> It works really well!</li>
            <li> I continued to use the second shipment of Murad because everything I read said that the purging cycle could take 4 or more weeks.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I saw results!  </li>
            <li> I really wasn&#x27;t expecting AcneFree to work, but for the price, it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> Ok, tried this, got it at our local store.  </li>
            <li> *, though the grapefruit one worked much better, it occasionally caused my face to peel.</li>
            <li> I had been using proactiv for quite some time (5 years or so) and it worked pretty well.  </li>
            <li> I am 24 and have mostly hormonal, moderately severe acne.</li>
            <li> This is the first thing to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I remembered getting hot spots and breaking out after using pro activ.</li>
            <li> The products leave your face soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> All in all I love this product and will be using it until further notice.</li>
            <li> I let my daughter use the cleanser and ONLY the cleanser because I was trying to see which item was the most</li>
            <li> This product seems to work, but don&#x27;t over do it at first until you know how you react to the ingredients.</li>
            <li> She has used it consistently for weeks and her skin looks as smooth and soft as it did before she was a teenager.</li>
            <li> This system is well worth its cost, and is not too much work.</li>
            <li> We started the 3 step system on the first night, all was well.</li>
            <li> So, we tried it the next day and it was much better.</li>
            <li> I think its more of a psychological thing</li>
            <li> I was worried about this at first</li>
            <li> : Thanks AcneFree!</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;d like to say that I have never suffered from severe acne.</li>
            <li> I tried so many different things to get it plunder control...</li>
            <li> This stuff works GREAT if you use precautions and common sense.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 20s and have struggled with mild/moderate acne most of my life</li>
            <li> When I first started using it, I almost gave up on it because I didn&#x27;t see immediate results.</li>
            <li> Even though I&#x27;ve been using plenty of product twice a day, I&#x27;m still on my first kit, which I bought in the beginning of July, and I really feel that the products included are worth the money.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old and found Acne-Free works GREAT for adult acne when used on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> This may be the first review I&#x27;ve ever written, but this product has worked so well for me, I had to.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to use white towels and cover your shirts when using this product as it will bleach your stuff!  </li>
            <li> I have consistently been using this system for 18 months and in those 18 months I have noticed my skin has become oily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 female and pretty healthy.</li>
            <li> not only has this given her a self esteem boost and noticeably better skin, it&#x27;s opened up a line of communication (</li>
            <li> This is real progress!</li>
            <li> It is important to use Acnefree when your skin is clear as a preventative measure to prevent blocked oil glands.    </li>
            <li> I started using the 3 step process twice daily, for many months.  </li>
            <li> , the first time I used AcneFree, I did it exactly as they told us to.</li>
            <li> First I cleansed my face, then I used the toner</li>
            <li> Wish it had more of a gritty texture for exfoliating.</li>
            <li> Needless to say, I&#x27;m happy with the transition!</li>
            <li> but I love to read reviews prior to buying.  </li>
            <li> I started reading reviews of many different products</li>
            <li> However, for this exact product you can pay $21.89 for at Target.</li>
            <li> First I have to say that I have tried proactive and it contains sulfur.</li>
            <li> must admit I was hesitant to try acnefree as I really do believe that you (usually) get what you pay for and thought it was too good to be true.</li>
            <li> and it just can&#x27;t be good for your skin if it is that harsh.</li>
            <li> all three steps, very important, if you do not use all three as directed then the formula is not effective, again, very important).</li>
            <li> I have compared the old regime to the new regime and the old regime feels more safe on the skin then the new ones.</li>
            <li> and that you really need to experiment to find what&#x27;s right for you - but that also means giving a product a chance to work.</li>
            <li> I tried Acnefree several years ago with awesome results, but eventually got lazy with the three-step process, then I later tried the severe version which proved too much for my skin and broke me out even more.</li>
            <li> My skin is smooth and silky now with only a rare blemish every once in a blue moon, and that is more hormonal from monthly menses.</li>
            <li> The face wash was creamy and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling very clean, while the repairing lotion was gritty and had to be applied with a cotton ball.</li>
            <li> I tried moisturizers, but maybe if I had bought a moisturizer that was more powerful and used it twice a day it would have brought my face back to normal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so thrilled to see the price has gone down even further, I just wish this was available for Amazon subscribe!</li>
            <li> I have mild acne that I have been dealing with for years - I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv as well as many other products</li>
            <li> My skin is clean and clear all the time.</li>
            <li> The clean and clear burned my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the holy grail of a clean and clear complexion.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products to clear up my mild to moderate acne.  </li>
            <li> NOW, i use this product ONLY at night, and it seems to be keeping my skin nice and clear.</li>
            <li> I always ignored that, most cleansers are gentle enough that it didnt matter either way for me.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over 6 months and am thrilled that Amazon is carrying this for a price better than the \\&quot;big box</li>
            <li> I decided to give it a little more time, but after using it for a full month, I was getting acne breakouts consistently.</li>
            <li> This stuff sounded pretty promising.</li>
            <li> So to WalMart I went, and within the first 3 days my skin had showed so much improvement.</li>
            <li> I started using it as directed and at first I didn&#x27;t see much of a change.</li>
            <li> You also have too keep in mind good acne prevention tips, like not touching your face and washing pillows</li>
            <li> I am considering applying the Original in the evening and the Sensitive formula during the AM, but I&#x27;m very much concerned about the amount of ALCOHOL that&#x27;s in the Renewing Toner of the Original System, listed as the second and seventh ingredient while glycolic acid is listed as the eighth.</li>
            <li> Great product but not worth the extra money not to mention shipping charges.</li>
            <li> so when I saw this I thought it might work and liked that it costs much less.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I would recommend this product to people with sensitive skin, but if you can handle the benzoyl peroxide and you have stubborn acne, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Not completely dry but not baby butt smooth.</li>
            <li> I was, however surprised by its quick effectiveness.</li>
            <li> I have had practically severe acne for about 2 to 3 years now since adolescence and have tried everything from proactiv to clean and clear and home remedies and even a fast on nothing but apples for 3 days and absolutely nothing I did worked at all.</li>
            <li> a funny thing happened though, acne free actually works, quite well!</li>
            <li> However, I still broke out during certain times of the month.</li>
            <li> Certainly advise them to proceed cautiously.</li>
            <li> I dont have acne like the kinda that is disforming or really large cysts or anything like that</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and a half now and am happy knowing that I&#x27;ve finally found something that works for me after dealing with acne since puberty</li>
            <li> I have adult acne that just appeared when I got pregnant and doesn&#x27;t seem to want to go away, so this has been really helpful.</li>
            <li> And, as someone who has finally woken up with beautiful skin after trying desperately to achieve this for ten years, I can tell you it feels great.</li>
            <li> Before i started this i just used a simple apricot face wash and my face was always just fine</li>
            <li> Overall, I solid product and will be buying again for sure!     </li>
            <li> Though it is slightly better than Neutrogena Oil-Free when it comes to drying and peeling, my skin is still rough and dry and it hurts even more than Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne and I have tried many different products on my face.</li>
            <li> at day 7 she excitedly sent me a pic and was actually chatting with me about how surprised she was to see such a remarkable difference in her skin, breakouts clearing up, less oil and more of a natural glow.</li>
            <li> Overall a good system to use daily, for mild to moderate acne.</li>
            <li> I started using proactiv and while that seemed to work for a while, it seemed that over time it caused me to get more breakouts rather then helping them, right around the time they claimed to have changed the formula slightly.</li>
            <li> I did break out more in the first couple of weeks but, thanks to the words I read on this and other websites</li>
            <li> It helped calm and maintain my breakouts but never really cleared my skin to a comfortable state.</li>
            <li> Anyway, thank you AcneFree for such an amazing and affordable product and thank you Amazon for making it so simple to get!</li>
            <li> It definitely cleared up my skin, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how my pillowcases and towels were getting huge bleach spots on them.  </li>
            <li> As I write this, my face is one huge, swollen, itchy, red welt.</li>
            <li> The reason I gave this system 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t really care for the Repair Lotion (Step 3).</li>
            <li> The terminator I think is what really cleared my skin.</li>
            <li> I began to stay inside all the time and also became very moody as well.  </li>
            <li> but this product really seemed to work for me</li>
            <li> The 3-step system really works.</li>
            <li> My skin is starting to look smooth instead of</li>
            <li> I rarely use the products (maybe once every 3-4 months) and my face stays wonderfully clear.</li>
            <li> It is gentle and produced no peeling or sensitivity whatsoever.</li>
            <li> As a longterm sufferer of skin breakouts, it&#x27;s really been a lifesaver.</li>
            <li> Regular benzoyl peroxide cream wasn&#x27;t helping, so I tried Acne Free.  </li>
            <li> I cleaned my whole face with the cleanser then used the toner and lotion just on my problem areas.  </li>
            <li> VERY oily skin    </li>
            <li> The repair lotion didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.  </li>
            <li> It gave my face a really greasy feeling</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper</li>
            <li> Application:&lt;br /&gt;After washing and using toner - face feels very stripped.&lt;br /&gt;After applying the \\&quot;repair\\&quot; lotion - face feels coated and wants to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Face</li>
            <li> the lotion is very silky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really rather</li>
            <li> This really worked for me</li>
            <li> I ordered the free trial pack, and after one day, I woke up the next morning and allready see a difference.  </li>
            <li> This product started working from the very beginning</li>
            <li> This system works very well for my skin.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s so much cheaper too.</li>
            <li> My problem isn&#x27;t really acne</li>
            <li> But you really do get what you pay for with this product.</li>
            <li> But fact is that it gives too much redness and sometimes hurts on the skin</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so important to wash your face, especially at night to rid it of the toxins you&#x27;ve collected from the day.&lt;br /&gt;Third,</li>
            <li> the face wash is gritty and the repairing lotion is smooth.</li>
            <li> This is a much needed improvement.</li>
            <li> And soo I read some testimonials on Acne Free, and I was started to feel hopeful, sooo i went and bought it at the local drug store (walgreens)</li>
            <li> i really thought that this was gonna be the one product that would work.i will still continue to use it for awhile</li>
            <li> This product really works wonders.  </li>
            <li> This product really works wonders.  </li>
            <li> and my skin would get really oily.  </li>
            <li> , I also found that it really helps to wipe your make-up off with non-scented baby wipes ormake-up remover wipes before washing your face.  </li>
            <li> but it probably helped and was cheap enough at Target that it wasn&#x27;t a burden to add to the regimen.</li>
            <li> Fast forward</li>
            <li> All the reviews were very encouraging</li>
            <li> I guess you have to condition your skin especially if it&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have always had very oily and acne prone skin throughout adolescence and even now at 24.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s improved my skin so much.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne my whole life.</li>
            <li> I bought this system because I could not afford Proactiv, so I started it not expecting much.</li>
            <li> After applying all 3 products as directed my face feels very oily.</li>
            <li> this product actually caused my light acne to jump to medium.</li>
            <li> My skin that was normally really oily isn&#x27;t anymore.</li>
            <li> and it is so much cheaper than Pro Activ</li>
            <li> My skin is also so much healthier.</li>
            <li> Yes, it did get rid of my acne, my acne was gone in a matter of three days; however, with every application of the product, my face would tingle and burn so much</li>
            <li> His face was totally clear and fresh looking.</li>
            <li> My skin has really responded well to it.      </li>
            <li> It even worked at evening out the skin on my cheeks and nose, it really does work</li>
            <li> All I want to say is, if you really want to make your acnes go away</li>
            <li> Be careful when touching clothing and towels, the peroxide can have a bleaching effect on fabrics.</li>
            <li> so I cant give a detailed review but from just the last two days I can tell you I have already noticed a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Medicinally, this product is comparable to the Proactiv brand and really does the job.</li>
            <li> downhill real fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> We have been booby that the product the rest of the month Does it fit this thing I want financial returns immediately</li>
            <li> I think it really depends on the person.</li>
            <li> I found that proactive works really well</li>
            <li> This stuff really does work.</li>
            <li> Really helps with my skin.  </li>
            <li> This product really irritated my daughter&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> it works really really fast.</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very noticeably results in two days and cleared up in a week.</li>
            <li> This skin system really worked well for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much cheaper than proactive and works well.</li>
            <li> I also found that I went through the renewing toner much faster than the cleanser and wash.</li>
            <li> You can buy this MUCH cheaper at Target, CVS, or Kmart.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very drying.</li>
            <li> Thanks AcneFree</li>
            <li> and I have really started to notice a change in his skin.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from smiley360 and the review is based on my opinion only.  </li>
            <li> I guess we will have to just spend the $ and get Proactive to see if there is really any difference between the products.</li>
            <li> and I used this acne system for about three days and all it did was made my face very shiny and oily</li>
            <li> This review is my own personal opinion based on the results I have seen through the use of my teenage son.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the kit, I was initially worried that my 14 year old would not be able to keep up the 3-step system in order to see results.</li>

            <li> (April 2011): More than 2 years later my skin is still marvelously clear.</li>
            <li> When I use it daily my face is clear and I get many compliments on my complexion.  </li>
            <li> The witch hazel in AcneFree doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of natural oils, which ultimately makes more oil!&lt;br /&gt;Added TIP:</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and so far so good.</li>
            <li> The product is also pretty good at reducing redness/hyper-pigmentation left by previous post-acne marks.   </li>
            <li> so much cheaper than Proactiv and just as good (if not better!)</li>
            <li> If this change in routine can&#x27;t tame it, I might switch to AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment System for more powerful treatment.</li>
            <li> Benzoyl peroxide is somewhat harsh, but very effective, and is the key ingredient in both the AcneFree and Proactiv systems.  </li>
            <li> I heard about AcneFree sensitive kit for people with sensitive skin and can&#x27;t handle the original formula</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that one of the representatives of University Medical will read this review and consider forwarding the comment to their Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Dept. to consider an alcohol-free reformulation of the toner in the Original 3 pc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m hoping that one of the representatives of University Medical will read this review and consider forwarding the comment to their Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Dept. to consider an alcohol-free reformulation of the toner in the Original 3 pc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had to replace my original AcneFree kit and still have lots left.</li>
            <li> My face feels smooth and I don&#x27;t need to put on foundation or concealer, which I usually do every day to cover up the redness - so I&#x27;m sure the lack of makeup is also helping my face stay clear.</li>
            <li> I do not usually write reviews; this is my first one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m familiar with the acne.org regimen though I hadn&#x27;t been following it</li>
            <li> It seems though that after letting it absorb it got better (because naturally the peroxide is drying because it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job of killing the bacteria, but that&#x27;s with any facial cleanser that has it, nothing new).</li>
            <li> This particular kit worked really well for me.  </li>
            <li> I use the cotton ball for the second step and even though I&#x27;m clean it still get dirt from my face and</li>
            <li> I currently wash my face with Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean face wash, then wash with AcneFree&#x27;s face wash.</li>
            <li> and it contains more of the active ingredient</li>
            <li> but I really think that the main thing that you need is Benzoyl Peroxide.</li>
            <li> I have used many facial cleansers over the years and the only one that really seemed to work and keep my skin fresh and clear was Proactiv.</li>
            <li> It did work for a while, but then I suddenly started getting those deep cysts on my chin, something I hadn&#x27;t experienced in a couple of years on Klear Action, then next to my nose....</li>
            <li> /&gt;Explanation: I purchased AcneFree after my usual regimen (Clean and Clear 3 Step) was no longer able to fight break outs.</li>
            <li> The three step system from Clean and Clear (which is quite similar to this, but you have to buy the wash, toner, and moisturizer separately), was the first thing that seemed to make a dent in my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely sure that it&#x27;s possible to get good results by diligently following a similar regimen made up of other products with benzoyl peroxide in them.</li>
            <li> Product is comparable to other top acne treatments, without the high price tag.</li>
            <li> Use twice daily for your skin to stay clear and it is a easy 3 step program.</li>
            <li> , my pores got bigger, I&#x27;m pretty sure, and never cleared out, and every day there was a new giant pimple waiting to say hello in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I never really had acne growing into my teens, which I had considered myself pretty lucky with that as I was fortunate to only get a pimple here or there.</li>
            <li> When I consistently use this skincare kit, my skin always seems clear, but the toner can be a bit dehydrating if I don&#x27;t apply a noncomedogenic hydrating cream after cleansing and before toning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Pretty clear within 3 days.  </li>
            <li> Within 2 months, my forehead was completely clear, the first time in 10 years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and my skin is pretty much completely clear.</li>
            <li> Now that stuff isn&#x27;t any cheaper in the long run but someone else mentioned Acne Free in their review</li>
            <li> and my skin was pretty clear.</li>
            <li> in the first week it didnt work but overtime like three weeks my face started to clear up</li>
            <li> I therefore decided to purchase both University Medical Original 24 Hour Clearing System and the Sensitive Skin as an immediate measure since these are available at local pharmacies.</li>
            <li> So i&#x27;m willing to run over to walmart and try out the sensitive kit.     </li>
            <li> and I first ordered the AcneFree sensitive skin version.</li>
            <li> The same is true with the lotion.</li>
            <li> /&gt;During the first month of use, I did notice a lot of flakiness and what appeared to be sensitive, chemical burns on my neck (from the benzoyl peroxide).  </li>
            <li> This product burned my face completely off after the first use.  </li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive</li>
            <li> I have used the product for the last 4 years and it&#x27;s the only product that keeps my facial blemishes under control and my skin looking good.</li>
            <li> These kind of products are for people who stay consistant and aren&#x27;t lazy.</li>
            <li> The marks from old pimples have not faded and are pretty noticeable.</li>
            <li> The following evening she used the cleanser and the toner, and followed it up with a very light &#x27;regular&#x27; moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I still get a few large zits (mostly just before my period).</li>
            <li> When I started a new BC pill, my skin went haywire!</li>
            <li> AcneFree works better (for me) than Proactive and at half the cost.  </li>
            <li> After 3 months my skin started getting significantly better, and I was noticing how much less acne I had every morning.</li>
            <li> Acne free does dry out your skin</li>
            <li> WE have tried everything nothing has worked when we was given this to try for free i figured it would be like everything else it wouldnt work and dry up our face...</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s half the cost and works better.</li>
            <li> I still use the lotion when my skin is dry, but the cleanser alone keeps me free.    </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would recommend it because it&#x27;s a decent price</li>
            <li> I recently bought the Acne Free Clear Skin 3 Step Kit.  </li>
            <li> The results came gradually but steadily.  </li>
            <li> After using the product for over two months nonstop, his back was almost completely acne free.  </li>
            <li> ; So clever....  </li>
            <li> Either way, proactive is better, but this stuff does work just dont use too much or only once daily instead of twice.</li>
            <li> Neutragena exofiolant didn&#x27;t really work for me all that much, they made my skin soft and that was about it</li>
            <li> but I noticed that my face isn&#x27;t as red as it once was where the pimples are, and the overall texture is better.</li>
            <li> I used to buy this stuff for 20$ dollars but it keeps getting more and more expensive.</li>
            <li> , I just have alot, mainly blackheads and whiteheads.</li>
            <li> I am 30 and have had mild to moderate acne all of my life.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I read the packaging that claimed this product was even better than Proactiv, and I didn&#x27;t see too many reviews from Proactiv users.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product mainly because it can ruin your linens</li>
            <li> But only clothes after these funds in the area of application on the body, fade when washed and ends quickly tonic.</li>
            <li> Then I was finally done being pregnant and breastfeeding then</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get to try AcneFree 24 hour acne clearing system from Smiley360.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist says this product has a high content of benzoyl peroxide for an over-the-counter product.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product...but don&#x27;t give up on it.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product to acne/rosacea sufferers of all ages.this product to acne/rosacea sufferers of all ages.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend Acnefree and plan to continue using it indefinitely.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product as opposed to Proactive.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomenet that product for all skin types.</li>
            <li> I know everyone doesn&#x27;t share my point of view here, but I think proactive is a quality product at a high price.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend using AcneFree.</li>
            <li> I rate it highly, and would recommend it for faults who are deling with acne problems.</li>
            <li> Use of Proactiv original system (low dosages of benzoyl peroxide) seems to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> Use of Proactiv original system (low dosages of benzoyl peroxide) seems to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> It is constant amazing exfoliation, unlike other exfoliating cleansers.  </li>
            <li> so I need something strong enough to fight the acne but gentle enough that my face doesn&#x27;t swell up like a balloon.</li>
            <li> The driness (which wasn&#x27;t excessive) over the past month has been totally worth it because it has revealed beautiful new skin.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would even make it just a little better.</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product because all other products had the same reviews.</li>
            <li> We have tried many protried with little results.  </li>
            <li> Overall I give this 4 stars because if it did not dry out my skin, this would have easily been 5 stars.</li>
            <li> pretty certain it was stress related.   </li>
            <li> He has no problems using benzoyl peroxide in other products but this one might be a bit too strong.     </li>
            <li> This kit work very well on my 13 yrs old son, highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> The 3-step formula works excellent if you use all three steps once a day (twice a day, morning and night, if it is REALLY bad).  </li>
            <li> These two products really have helped my face clear up.</li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin and was very suprised when this happened.</li>
            <li> So far I really like it.</li>
            <li> University Medical AF is a solid, effective, affordable 3 pc system and the price here is incredibly low.</li>
            <li> After a few days, my face broke out more than ever.  </li>
            <li> Maybe try the sentitive version, regards I am keeping it simple with Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser and drinking plenty of water.</li>
            <li> I just think my skin has gotten used to the normal AcneFree.</li>
            <li> I rarely get any acne now after using regularly.     </li>
            <li> I tried the orange bottles (\\&quot;severe\\&quot; variety) with similar success.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it keep the blemishes away, but the witch hazel keeps my face looking fresh and even colored.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it keep the blemishes away, but the witch hazel keeps my face looking fresh and even colored.  </li>
            <li> Me breaking out WAY more (even though I would wait a few weeks in case my skin just needed to get use to the product), or B)</li>
            <li> THIS DOES WORK, BUT if u have sensitive skin only use once daily, or go with proactive its much better, wont hurt ur skin.  </li>
            <li> (Why it waited for the middle of a fun school function, I don&#x27;t know.)</li>
            <li> I am using an antihistamine and steroids to try to get rid of the reaction and return my face to normal.  </li>
            <li> i bought this stuff trying to save a few bucks b/c it claims to be better than proactiv.</li>
            <li> The only thing worth it from this kit is the acne lotion.  </li>
            <li> started to use in April and a month or two came to naught rash on the chest and back, the skin was cleaned and I&#x27;m not afraid to go at the beach in a swimwear.</li>
            <li> few more tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worse than proactiv but not as good.</li>
            <li> As an adult acne sufferer it is easy to become hopeless- even when you&#x27;re starting to see changes but they aren&#x27;t coming fast enough.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has regular skin; not too dry, not too oily and still this product was able to damage his skin.</li>
            <li> I developed mild acne after deciding to go off of my regular birth control pill.  </li>
            <li> so I am always leary of products like this because more often than not they dry out my skin, turn it red</li>
            <li> in all, this product works, costs only $20, and can easily be obtained at your local convenience store.</li>
            <li> I started using the 3 step system right away and after only two uses of it (morning and night)</li>
            <li> Great results but a little harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I would like to see make up remover and other things from Acne Free.  </li>
            <li> I also don&#x27;t have any new pimples.</li>
            <li> When I purchase something new I expect new.</li>
            <li> My husband is coming for Christmas since he is a soldier and we live apart</li>
            <li> My complexion started going downhill when I moved to a new state...new water, new air...</li>
            <li> Yes, I still get some blackheads, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> I find that applying the lotion to those acne-prone areas keeps any new blemishes from forming.  </li>
            <li> I find that applying the lotion to those acne-prone areas keeps any new blemishes from forming.  </li>
            <li> I also bought the Terminator to deal with the new bumps that came up.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Each time it got rid of a pimple, a new pimple would pop up.</li>
            <li> Illinois and New York have banned microbeads.  </li>
            <li> This is my new go to acne product.</li>
            <li> My skin tone also changed into a much darker and more dull color.  </li>
            <li> But anyway, the same thing happened to two huge whiteheads that I later got on my forehead.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s less expensive and it works just as good or in my opinion even better.</li>
            <li> I think this may work for some people, but be careful that it is strong and that goes for both the Clear Skin Formula and the Sensitive Skin Formula.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for a few years now, which has been the only effective product ever (over the counter or prescription products never helped rosacea acne.)  </li>
            <li> Definitely don&#x27;t use any kind of harsh scrubs or exfoliators - your skin needs to heal, not have irritants thrown at it.</li>
            <li> , I barely have large breakouts or breakouts at all.</li>
            <li> My skin has never been more clear, and it started working in less than a week!</li>
            <li> My face feels very soft after use.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive and finicky skin</li>
            <li> have VERY sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have a very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This product keeps my skin feeling extremely fresh all day long and seems to be having an antibacterial effect that prevents new breakouts during the day.</li>
            <li> I also put a very little on a zit in the morning but nothing more, just that.</li>
            <li> Her face looks so clear!</li>
            <li> It took me a week to get my face clear again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and my skin is completely clear!</li>
            <li> However, over the first week, I actually see my face clearing up!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried it again, my face was burning and red, but I thought to myself</li>
            <li> I had to go to work with this red blotchiness and have people comment on it (very embarrassing!).  </li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> You get the exact same amount as you would with Proactive for each step and you use it exactly the same way.</li>
            <li> It is better than Proactiv, me being a past user of proactiv.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have the initial \\&quot;break-out-alot\\&quot; issue when I first started using it.  </li>
            <li> I first came across a bottle left over in the shower at my gym.</li>
            <li> For once, I was pleasantly surprised!  </li>
            <li> I applied it all over my face the first night and the next day</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d imagine that range of reviews (from those who say it works to those who don&#x27;t) is due mostly to the vast variety of skin types out there.  </li>
            <li> Went another 3 days using the system and WOW!</li>
            <li> and i have pretty moderate acne break outs</li>
            <li> So I tried AcneFree, which I could buy locally and was not expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if AcneFree is the reason why my skin looks better, because it occurred to me that maybe my breakouts were just meant to stop occurring at this age or something.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews for products</li>
            <li> I paid just over $8 for this as an add on item, walmart sells the exact same product for about 20 bucks.</li>
            <li> I watched all the infomercials and decided to go with Murad&#x27;s Acne Complex Kit expecting the glowing, perfect skin that they promised within a few short weeks.  </li>
            <li> Early on, I found that the skin toner runs out very quickly and the high alcohol content sometimes stung and dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> Early on, I found that the skin toner runs out very quickly and the high alcohol content sometimes stung and dried out my skin.  </li>
            <li> I had mild to moderate acne through high school and college and Accutane finally got rid of it.  </li>
            <li> Well i have had enough there is no way in heck this stuff would take 4 weeks to deep clean</li>
            <li> Rinse first and apply lightly on dry skin and dab more on trouble spots.</li>
            <li> My skin feels healthy and the constant pain due to inflammation is completely gone.</li>
            <li> skincare has always left my skin blemish free for as long as I&#x27;ve used it.</li>
            <li> Well, after using it for about a month my skin has stayed exactly the same and completely clear of blemishes.      </li>
            <li> Wipe my face dry with a fresh paper towel&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> I def agree with the reviews that i have read that claim it makes your skin worse at first but then makes it better.</li>
            <li> My teen was encouraged to use it by the positive reviews and with knowing that he would just need to stick with it for awhile.</li>
            <li> my face was pretty much the same, but my face wasn&#x27;t as red, but i still had a bunch of pimples.</li>
            <li> Other reviewers that it can bleach towels and clothing are correct - this is true of all benzoyl peroxide preparations.  </li>
            <li> Purchased this for my teenage daughter who has mild to moderate acne and blackheads.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d found that when I had applied the toner to dry skin right after cleansing, my skin would wind up dehydrated or parched.</li>
            <li> I probably stopped using the product at that point, and then a week or two later, my skin had mostly healed completely from the havoc created over the previous months.  </li>
            <li> However, I will not be purchasing it again since my first experience with it was negative, and also, as stated originally, this product did not work as well as Proactiv in clearing up my acne.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY similar, and certainly cheaper, esp with Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> Made my skin look and feel smooth and helped with the dark spots too!</li>
            <li> Leaves me feeling clean and clear, and it works as long as I remember to use it religiously.</li>
            <li> (I am Black with a med complexion), and the appearance of post acne marks is significantly improved.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would like is maybe a little more grit in the  cleanser.</li>
            <li> Some even consider glycolic acid an anti-aging ingredient, because it brightens dull skin and aids in gentle exfoliation while keeping the pores free of debris.</li>

            <li> I had almost clear skin.</li>
            <li> I had been using the product for about a month and my skin was almost perfectly clear.</li>

            <li> After about a month of using it, my skin looked completely clear, something I had not seen in a couple of years.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t even begin to clear my skin</li>
            <li> if you have oily face,never use it.it wont work.lotion makes your face shiney.it doesnt clean black heads</li>
            <li> After 3 weeks of using it, my skin is clear.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got retinol and salicylic acid, which help keep my skin clear but don&#x27;t run the risk of bleaching out my sheets and pillowcases.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s got retinol and salicylic acid, which help keep my skin clear but don&#x27;t run the risk of bleaching out my sheets and pillowcases.  </li>
            <li> I say pretty well since it did clear my face some, but my face has not been totally clear in a long time.</li>
            <li> Keeps my skin clear</li>
            <li> my skin was this clear.</li>
            <li> and figured it would clear it up</li>
            <li> but i still want my skin to be clear.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin clear</li>
            <li> The t zone on her face had started to clear.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised in how ell it worked compared to proactive products and will save a bunch of money by switching.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SKIN, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> Alcohol is known to strip the skin of it&#x27;s natural lipids and pH balance.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural lipids.</li>
            <li> The choice of alcohol as the second and seventh ingredients in the University Medical toner to dilute the product and place glycolic acid as the eighth ingredient (UM) instead of the second ingredient (Proactiv) would explain the price differential as alcohol is a cheap ingredient, but it&#x27;s also an inferior ingredient.</li>

            <li> Well, the packaging does say that people with sensitive skin might not want to use this product, but how do you know if your skin is sensitive until you try it.  </li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t clear up his skin completely, but it did help.</li>
            <li> It will bleach any fabric it comes in direct contact</li>
            <li> I suffer from cystic adult acne.</li>
            <li> using it only at night really has made a difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for three days so far and it completely cleared up my existing acne.</li>
            <li> Since the red blotches are not on my whole face, I&#x27;m assuming either the toner or lotion is what my skin can&#x27;t handle.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even have particularly sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 16 year old girl and have been using this product for a year now.</li>
            <li> and my skin isn&#x27;t really sensitive</li>
            <li> So thats my background, and I&#x27;ve had acne since 6th grade so about when I was 11 years old.</li>
            <li> If Sensitive kit in AcneFree don&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll have to head over to Max Clarity or see my doc.</li>
            <li> I never realized how much bacteria is still left on the face after washing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got oily and sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Sensitive formula for nearly 2 weeks and have had immediate results.</li>
            <li> The cleanser really had no exfoliating beads or anything, it felt like putting soap on my face and afterwards when I used the toner, there was still A LOT of left over dirt on my face.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m surprised to see the price.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I would definately stay away from benzoyl peroxide if you have sensitive skin and use salicylic acid or natural applicants like diluted tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> and i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I only use the repair lotion on my T-zone, because my cheeks tend to be much drier than the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
            <li> If you still want to give it a try, use the Acnefree sensitive skin system instead.</li>
            <li> Even the old scars are going away...</li>
            <li> I would not order from Amazon.com again unless I completely understand that I am infact getting the product that I want.</li>
            <li> I ordered Acne Free thinking it would work on my grandchild who is having trouble with acne on her forehead and nose.  </li>
            <li> It looks like I need to pick up a package of the white or orange bottles (doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference to me</li>
            <li> I like the results so far.</li>
            <li> However it isn&#x27;t sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This product worked really well for me, and not only for break outs of acne.</li>
            <li> Acnefree has saved me money, works well with my skin type (somewhat oily), and offers a quality product.</li>
            <li> If a person is sensitive to Benzoyl Peroxide, you should not use this product.</li>
            <li> With all Benzoyl Peroxide products, it will irritate the skin of anybody sensitive to it.  </li>
            <li> After the toner has dried, apply step 3 with another cotton pad in a LIGHT layer.    </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d think that being this big of a company they would 1)-Have their stories straight; and 2)-KNOW</li>
            <li> Also, do not listen to the directions as far as the amounts to use.</li>
            <li> I am 16 years old, and ever since I started breaking out in pimples this year, I&#x27;ve started to feel so self concious.</li>
            <li> I tried a number of different types of face wash, but none of them seemed to work, so I resorted to AcneFree without much hope in its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have particularly sensitive skin, but I used AcneFree one time in the morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 and I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 12 years old.</li>
            <li> Pairing it with a very creamy moisturizer that you know would not break you out is enough to fix this issue.</li>
            <li> It only takes 5 minutes to do the whole routine, and the directions say to do it twice a day.</li>
            <li> This morning I almost couldn&#x27;t open my eyes because it was very puffy.</li>
            <li> If you have a SENSITIVE SKIN, don&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li> I have an 18 year old son who also uses Acnefree....</li>
            <li> Well, maybe your product was old or something.</li>
            <li> will say that I do NOT have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old and have moderate adult acne and very oily skin.</li>
            <li> It is far cheaper than Proactiv(which</li>
            <li> she has been using another seen on TV system for quite some time but still has frequent breakouts and oily skin.</li>
            <li> THough I agree that my lotion was gritty, which I didn&#x27;t like, and doesn&#x27;t feel very moist....</li>
            <li> So far AcneFree works for me.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter used this and proactive.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 year old</li>
            <li> I am a 35 year old woman who has never had a reaction to any product.  </li>
            <li> I do not have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I brought this for my kids so far it&#x27;s working well for them.</li>
            <li> I have never had a real acne problem, even during the teenage years.  </li>
            <li> I did notice results as early as 2 days.  </li>
            <li> He went from having baby soft skin to having &amp;#34;face demons/pimples&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I just this product on my 12 year old daughter who has been struggling with acne.  </li>
            <li> Her acne is almost cleared completely up</li>
            <li> I would still recommend this product to people who doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> A few days passed, and my pimples and blemishes became more red and irriated and my face itched.</li>
            <li> So we tried a few more different topicals and a spa treatment.</li>
            <li> If you are prone to dry skin, that would probably dry your skin out, but for me it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> After the first week though, all of my old flare-ups were drying out and I had no new pimples.</li>
            <li> I should note that with the Original system, I have found it necessary to apply a hydrating cream such as Cetaphil moisturizing cream after cleansing/prior to application of toner in order to offset the potentially dehydrating effects of the toner.</li>
            <li> No more breakouts for either one of us and our skin is very clear, smooth and no drying at all.</li>
            <li> The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because if you have dry skin it may dry it out even more, since my skin is oily</li>
            <li> For the first time, I can wear makeup without having it slide off my face by mid-day and there are no new break-outs.  </li>
            <li> I constantly read reviews before I spend my hard earned money on something, as I did before I bought this, but this is worth it, even at full price.</li>
            <li> Acnefree, at less than half the cost of proactive, is simply amazing.</li>
            <li> I got this because my Neutrogena face wash is getting less and less effective.</li>
            <li> I was reading a few of the more recent reviews and apparently this company has changed</li>
            <li> /&gt;During the first few weeks of using AcneFree, my regular acne disappeared right away.  </li>
            <li> My mysterious sickness went away the next day (after 2 weeks, the exact time I been using the product) and my linens were not bleaching themselves out anymore.  </li>
            <li> I never write reviews for products, but realized reviews are mainly what I use to gauge the effectiveness of a product, especially on amazon.com.</li>
            <li> It has been reduced and my skin is not half as oily as it was.</li>
            <li> This 3-step kit contains Benzoyl Peroxide though, which is the main ingredient in Proactiv and the only thing that seems to work for me</li>
            <li> I left my face wet which is important and applied the cleanser starting out without rubbing first couple of days and did not leave on long.</li>
            <li> Rinse and I applied toner lightly to dry skin and then a little more as time went by.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m extremely tempted to try that out since my skin perscription isn&#x27;t working right now and</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it  and haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts, and the red spots from my old acne are even fading without the fade cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months and haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts, and the red spots from my old acne are even fading without the fade cream.  </li>
            <li> He just started getting some acne and trouble spots on his face, so receiving this product was right on time!</li>
            <li> I usually pick at my acne even though you&#x27;re not supposed to, and Acne Free is healing up marks from picking, too.</li>
            <li> I apparently need to use benzoyl peroxide to stay clear, so my plan is to keep using it indefinitely.</li>
            <li> (My skin is combination skin (oily T zone normal face overall)</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s only $15 and twice the normal size (8oz of step 1 &amp; 2, 4 oz of step 3).  </li>
            <li> and I couldn&#x27;t get it back to normal for weeks.</li>
            <li> I have normal skin with a recent occurrence of acne after my pregnancy and have never had a reaction to any product like this.</li>
            <li> my face has a light red tint and itchy a little bit..is this normal for just starting it??</li>
            <li> , it will def dry my skin out, which is not fun when you can&#x27;t move your face easily without pain.</li>
            <li> I tried the lavender scrub and that helped calm it down *</li>
            <li> I understand that certain products work different on different people.  </li>
            <li> The only problem is that right after using it, my skin (especially my cheeks and my nose) gets really red.</li>
            <li> &quot; it&#x27;s usually minimal, and I layer on a little bit more of the lotion in that spot</li>
            <li> I increased rubbing a little more harder and longer over time.</li>
            <li> Also, this is such a minor complaint, but I always seem to end up with way more toner than the cleanser and the lotion!</li>
            <li> It might have saved me from a lot of facial scarring that I have to live with to this day.  </li>
            <li> new recent product that he is using now</li>
            <li> Would dry out my skin and be very painful/uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> clear skin ladies in three days, continued use of Acnefree twice daily, clear skin continues...</li>
            <li> On days when my face gets really oily the cleanser seems to just suck out the oil--without leaving my face TOO dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and suddenly developed mild/moderate acne on my jawline and chin earlier this year.</li>
            <li> I still have a few scars of course, but my skin is smooth, the bumps are gone, and I&#x27;ve only had a couple pimples sprout up, but</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used Proactive in years, but I am at least as pleased with this product now as I was with Proactive as a teen.</li>
            <li> This product could be such a cheap alternative to Proactiv, but they are blindly missing the boat.  </li>
            <li> I started having frequent acne breakouts in my thirties and early forties, and after using several products and monthly facials</li>
            <li> Ive had redness on my cheeks, nose and chin with mild break out for a few years.</li>
            <li> I have called to complain before since this different mix is not as effective or sometimes causes worse results</li>
            <li> I finally have clear skin again!</li>
            <li> I mean, I&#x27;m not saying that all of my acne are gone, but the fact is that my acne is definitely lessening for sure.</li>
            <li> I saw major results in a week.  </li>
            <li> Anytime my acne gets out of control, to the point that no other products help, this one never disappoints.</li>
            <li> the morning after using it for the first time she awoke to find that the breakout on her forehead was not as red and puffy as it had been...... 3 days later the breakout was actually going away.......</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t a major difference</li>
            <li> It makes your skin dry at first, like taught, so I only use the repair cream once a day before bed and the toner &amp; wash twice.</li>
            <li> or it could cause lifting of the skin just due to the  benzoyl peroxide and other strong ingredients it contains.</li>
            <li> After four days of using this product, nearly all of the small acne on my chin are gone, and the larger acne have diminished in size quite significantly.</li>
            <li> then I would feel a burning but this was easily avoided by just waiting a few min for my face to be completely dry.  </li>
            <li> (A few final words of advice: if you feel you need this product and you&#x27;re planning to spend the money to try it, you owe it to yourself to give it a good, long trial period during which you use it morning and night, and cut back on any other products you might be using (or cut them out altogether).</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with dry or sensitive skin, but I noticed they do make a kit for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always have the concern in the back of my mind that the products could contribute to breakouts or not keep my skin clear, but I&#x27;ve tried nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;Derm</li>
            <li> etc.. have all been shown in proper combination to help to clear pores, increase cell turnover and exfoliation, soothe, hydrate and have anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li> etc.. have all been shown in proper combination to help to clear pores, increase cell turnover and exfoliation, soothe, hydrate and have anti-aging benefits.</li>
            <li> My skin was going from clear to blotchy red almost overnight</li>
            <li> so I went out during my lunch break and picked up the regular AcneFree Clear Skin System.  </li>
            <li> My skin is now mostly clear with the occasional blemish that still pops up once in a while--</li>
            <li> I feel absolutely comfortable leaving the house with just a dusting of powder and a tiny bit of concealer on some scars (which are fading - though I&#x27;m not sure I can give credit to the AcneFree for that</li>
            <li> It clearly states on the box or bottles that it can bleach facial hair and clothes.</li>
            <li> In addition, it is simple to use, and the instructions are clear.  </li>
            <li> When my face remained clear, I went to just using the cleanser once daily in the shower.  </li>
            <li> Well after a week of using both my acne was completely gone and after 3 weeks all the blemishes and red spots were gone!</li>
            <li> only thing that had ever fixed my skin was the contraceptive pill, but as I stopped taking it 3 months ago, I wanted to find an alternative to fixing my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only wish is that they would include a moisturizer in the pack so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy the sensitive skin pack just to get one.</li>
            <li> and I barely recognize my face.</li>
            <li> /&gt;After only a week of use, my face is completely \\&quot;acnefree\\&quot;, my skin tone is brighter</li>
            <li> For the last six years I&#x27;ve battled adult cystic acne caused from an imbalance of hormones.</li>
            <li> I am 40 and started to get adult acne, I have oily skin inmy T-Zone only .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male who got adult acne at age 29.  </li>
            <li> i can say it is enough for young age.</li>
            <li> I can only speak from experience, but following this method will give you the most amount of effectiveness and the least amount of side effects.</li>
            <li> I started using AcneFree about six months ago to deal with a sudden onset of adult acne.  </li>
            <li> I have red hair and sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and never had a problem with acne until my mid 20&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li> So far it has only been two days</li>
            <li> I have literally tried everything, especially all natural home remedies; honey, turmeric, tomato, lemon juice, Apple cider vinegar, yogurt, egg whites, ice cubes, I can&#x27;t even remember what all I&#x27;ve rubbed on my face</li>
            <li> /&gt;By the way, for reference, I do consider my skin somewhat sensitive, have rosacea, and only use this product at night.</li>
            <li> O_O</li>
            <li> I have had moderate to severe acne since I was about 15 years old.</li>
            <li> I believe I used this as a teen myself, now 30 years old</li>
            <li> The first week my skin was really rough (only to the touch, you couldn&#x27;t tell by looking) which worried me, but after some research it turned out just to be my skin adjusting to the benzoil peroxide.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seems like most of the complaints about these products is that it made acne worse.</li>
            <li> I find the toner can be more irritating</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t make it ANY better at all, it made it WORSE.  </li>
            <li> I was going through a stressful time and was more broken out than I had ever been.</li>
            <li> Be forewarned that it will cause blemishes to get worse before they get better.</li>
            <li> I just think it is kind of scary the level of chemicals that I was putting on my face for it to bleach these fabrics.  </li>
            <li> A few more products, down the line I read the reviews and with the price</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne, nothing too bad, but I wanted to try something more than the usual acne washes I was using, and I decided on Acne Free because it was the cheapest \\&quot;skin</li>
            <li> I purchased Acne Free at a pharmacy and it ran me 4 dollars more so purchasing on line was less expensive than buying it locally.</li>
            <li> My skin starting breaking out pretty terribly, worse than it had in years, soon after I got pregnant.</li>
            <li> I have used ProActive for years and thought that this might be a great less expensive alternative.  </li>
            <li> the third day the skin was so dry and cracked it was very</li>
            <li> i mean afterall proactiv says not to buy cheap imitations..</li>
            <li> and I began to see results less than a week after my first application.</li>
            <li> the only problem is the first soln is used up slower than the other two.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews, but I was compelled to do so because I&#x27;ve seen tremendous results with this product.</li>
            <li> I have avoided this so far by switching towels, using the wash only in the shower, and using the lotion only at night with old T-shirts and white sheets.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use it twice a day because I feel like it&#x27;s a bit harsh on my skin, and I normally moisturise parts of my face straight after the 3 steps because I found it really dried out parts of my skin when I first started losing it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Alcohol is a cheap ingredient known to strip and dehydrate the skin and water down the potency of the other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Alcohol is a cheap ingredient known to strip and dehydrate the skin and water down the potency of the other ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and it seems to have worked really well for other people.</li>
            <li> It took two months of consistent use for me to achieve completely clear skin but from there on after, I might get a tiny pimple every 3 or 4 months that disappears within a few days.   </li>
            <li> The facial cleanser (Step 1) is a little more water-y than other generic Proactiv&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from the same store over and over and several times the wash and/or lotion will be a different texture, color, and consistency than it normally is.</li>
            <li> It has been only 5 days and my face is finally starting to return back to normal.  </li>
            <li> Not a SINGLE break out since.</li>
            <li> Several years later, I started getting occasional zits and very small bumps mostly on my forehead.  </li>
            <li> When I start using it twice a day regularly my skin gets a little tight, but I&#x27;ve tried other products that made my skin flake off in chunks or made my cheeks bright red.</li>
            <li> I decided to try something new, and a bit more expensive (only three dollars...but who&#x27;s counting?)</li>
            <li> I can completely see the difference when I travel and don&#x27;t take all of the steps - cheating by just taking Step 1 isn&#x27;t enough for a 5 day trip - but as soon as I get home, within 3 days, I&#x27;m back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> He is Asian, in his mid 20s&#x27;, who is suffering from severe adult acne all over his lower cheeks.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never really had acne my whole life up until the last couple of years.</li>
            <li> a tip, so you do not waste money paying EXTRA for the product and then EXTRA for shipping &amp; handling.</li>
            <li> and i started getting more and more acne and hated it</li>
            <li> The first week I had it, I saw little to no improvement.</li>
            <li> i noticed the black heads was gone and for the first week we both had some white head</li>
            <li> Not sure this is doing anything more or less than Proactive would.  </li>
            <li> Think about how long you&#x27;ve had acne, two to four weeks is not that look to wait for clear skin.</li>
            <li> but I was suffering from both regular acne and some very noticeable cystic and nodular acne that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get rid of through other means.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d cured acne before using natural products, but it took a long time.</li>
            <li> I reviewed the claims of the product with him and helped him through his first few time of using the product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;*At first this stuff dried out my lips and made them chap</li>
            <li> At first it seemed like it was clearing out my skin, but that was just for a few weeks.    </li>
            <li> so we&#x27;ll have to order a more expensive bottle of lotion online to make up for the loss absorbed by the cotton round.</li>
            <li> Acne Free system is the only thing that works on people with serious acne.</li>
            <li> I was depressed, I didn&#x27;t even wanted to go out anymore, and even when I did, I try not to make eye contact and just look down the whole time.     </li>
            <li> , my normal skin was starting to dry out which is why I switched to the regular.</li>
            <li> I must say though that the first step (Purifying Cleanser) stings/tingles a little bit, but it goes away after the next two steps.  </li>
            <li> This works well for the major problems but doesn&#x27;t clean up the real small bumps or blackheads.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product over proactive or other brands one might find in retail strores or online.</li>
            <li> Face is really dry after using it for a week, but my face is clear</li>
            <li> I was so desperate that I probably spent a small fortune trying pretty much every kind of acne \\&quot;cure\\</li>
            <li> then became pregnant in my late 20&#x27;s/30&#x27;s and still no skin problems.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After a couple of days the small bumps on forehead and nose began to clear but were immediately followed by large red bumps on cheeks.</li>
            <li> , I certainly seem to have less redness overall).</li>
            <li> I found that it does work better than ProActiv, and at (at least) half the cost.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re having trouble deciding between which treatment to get, I would certainly recommend the Severe Acne treatment over this one.</li>
            <li> a few large, deep acne spots on my chin and on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> I thought this product would be extremely helpful for getting rid of my acne due to the high amount of salicylic acid; however the result was the complete opposite.</li>
            <li> My face was swollen, eyelids swollen, bright red, burned and hurt really bad.  </li>
            <li> i generally have a difficult time finding things to talk about without it becoming an argument......</li>
            <li> The only things I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that even right after putting the lotion on my skin the texture felt a little... rough maybe?</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m not giving it 3 because it did work, but there&#x27;s one MAJOR trade off, dry skin, or acne?</li>
            <li> totally reccommend this product, as long as you don&#x27;t have dry or sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> And the other thing is that they don&#x27;t nearly give you enough toner, that stuff disappears like water.</li>
            <li> However, with the high price tag and my budget being tight, I was looking for a cheaper alternative that would perform just as well.</li>
            <li> The flare ups slowed down, and within 2 weeks, new break outs stopped appearing.</li>
            <li> These few complaints are minor in light of how great this system has been for my horrible hormonal and premenstrual breakout(s).</li>
            <li> There are other options in the AcneFree line, severe and sensitive.</li>
            <li> I would describe my skin as combination (dry in places and oily in others), large pores, very pale with some minor acne scarring/redness, not too sensitive, and with moderate acne (before using this product).  </li>
            <li> I never had more than 1-2 cysts/nodes at any time, but they would be very red and painful -- and every time one healed, a new one would develop in a different place.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m generally very wary of internet reviews, everyone always seems way too excited, but the reviews were mostly positive</li>
            <li> I usually run out of the cleanser first, then the lotion, and the toner a long time after.</li>
            <li> I am prone to deep pimples that last for a long time.</li>
            <li> The burning subsided after a few days, but then my skin started to get flaky mainly in the ares when I&#x27;d applied the bp lotion.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t work because in the real world my daughter like a lot of other teens are lazy and make their parents waste money on this stuff and don&#x27;t use it right.</li>
            <li> We can all live with a few zits.&lt;br /&gt;Second, develop a skin care routine that works for you and be religious about it!</li>
            <li> So I gave this a 3 star rating because it does the job and is average and is not too harsh for sensetive skin if you use it right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if you have a tween or young teen that has breakouts you might want to try a less aggressive product before trying this one.</li>
            <li> I read all the reviews I could find about it on the internet and had mixed feelings about trying it because they were equally positive and negative.</li>
            <li> I have used Proactive for a long time and it definitely works!  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I can&#x27;t start it until I get back from a month long study abroad trip in Europe.</li>
            <li> I had been using various products with salicylic acid for a long time, but it seems that my skin just doesn&#x27;t respond to it.</li>
            <li> I would stretch those three, pricey, bottles out for as long as possible but never dreamt of changing products until I spotted acnefree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it in a long time, and recently bought this kit again.</li>
            <li> I have begun to get really stressful(unbalance hormones) and developed some really extreme acne, from nodules(large hard pumps under skin) to pustules(an inflamed whitehead).</li>
            <li> I have always had clear skin, but noticed that recently I was getting a lot of little bumps on my forehead and chin.  </li>
            <li> However, if you do feel like this does dry your skin out a little too much, I highly recommend taking some organic oatmeal &amp; cornmeal (optional) and creating a face paste mask out of it twice a week.</li>
            <li> I have not had a new whitehead in few days.</li>
            <li> i started using proactiv and in less than a week my skin was clear.</li>
            <li> and in less than 8 weeks he was completely clear with no breakouts.  </li>
            <li> cause her skin was red and burning and severly dry.</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old with slightly oily skin.</li>
            <li> so I use it sparingly, especially in the winter when my skin is dry.   </li>
            <li> Over time, the cysts and nodes seemed to heal faster and appear less frequently, until one day, they were gone.  </li>
            <li> There is no outbreak after starting this, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin at all.</li>
            <li> it made my face dry and red</li>
            <li> I generally fall asleep with makeup on (all natural, mineral makeup) because I am too lazy to take it off</li>
            <li> I have tried different, cheaper, products with the same active ingredients, but I have not seen the same results.  </li>
            <li> And yes, definitely invest in a white towel and be careful about not getting it on your clothes -</li>
            <li> It has returned my skin to normal - which for me means just a few minor blemishes here and there.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to waste any more money on stuff that would make my skin worse and then just sit under my sink forever because I couldn&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> They both said my face is not so red &amp; there are no new pimples.</li>
            <li> It did seem to work for the acne, but try in a small, sensitive area for at least a week, first!</li>
            <li> I also go to bed very early everyday.....</li>
            <li> However, as I didn&#x27;t have a single zit, I changed to once daily.  </li>
            <li> The only bad thing is it makes your skin look a little bit oily, but you can take care of it with the clean and clear oil absorbing sheets.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t exactly mean that you have sensitive skin, but that you are sensitive to this medication.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, I thought that the price was a little much</li>
            <li> For the times when I fail to eat right, this will clear it up.</li>
            <li> but I was using some pretty serious stuff</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it about every other day, once a day, for the last two weeks</li>
            <li> It became very dry and red after use.</li>
            <li> It also does not dry out your skin like other brands do</li>
            <li> I went 48 hours washing, toning, and lotioning my face only twice instead of four times and all hell broke loose!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, there is a downfall: you have to use Acne Free RELIGOUSLY for it to work.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, my skin was not ACNE FREE until after  I visited my DERMATOLOGIST.</li>
            <li> I used Acne Free for 2, TWO, days and saw results that I had not seen in 3 months of using the expensive stuff.  </li>
            <li> I really recommend that you at least try it.</li>
            <li> The containers are very sanitary (the product comes out of a small hole rather than a wide opening).</li>
            <li> I do have moderately sensitive skin, therefore I can only use this product once a day, and I usually follow up with a noncomedogenic moisturizer to help alleviate some of the dryness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I researched products for a long time before purchasing this one.  </li>
            <li> If I skip a day or go too long without using it, I break out again, that&#x27;s how I know that it&#x27;s doing what it is supposed to be doing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll also note that it was harsh even for my young teen.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As long as I use this stuff twice per day I don&#x27;t have breakouts.</li>
            <li> It is a minor side effect, and cannot be seen under makeup.</li>
            <li> Also, if you look at the ingredient label you will find some minor differences in ingredients and percentages.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not giving it a 5 star because my skin is not completely cleared.  </li>
            <li> It isn&#x27;t like the product had direct contact, it had been washed off my face with water and dried.  </li>
            <li> I wish I had discovered it a long time ago.</li>
            <li> When I first started using AcneFree, my acne actually got a bit worse for 2-3 months.</li>
            <li> In the morning after cleansing and toning, I use Murad anti-aging acne treatment which contains salicylic acid which clears up the pimples that do not clear up with acnefree&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> When I do get a new pimple it is pretty painful and sensitive to the touch.</li>
            <li> I had suddenly broke out with at least a dozen new bumps in one concentrated area in one day</li>
            <li> The redness was starting to go away and the big bumps that hurt started to go down and dry up.</li>
            <li> Other states are following -- but, not fast enough.  </li>
            <li> at least it decreases oil on my face and less new pimple so far.</li>
            <li> I use the AcneFree lotion next, which does make my face feel tight and dry, so I follow up with Desert Essence daily moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I am pretty prone to getting the painful cystic pimples, especially around that time of the month, but thankfully I didn&#x27;t break out nearly as much as I did.</li>
            <li> It may be a little more expensive</li>
            <li> This order however was even more expensive!</li>
            <li> I tried Proactive and numerous other products.  </li>
            <li> It happened several times after and now their site says the reason is b/c they use two different factories and sometimes the settings are a little off.</li>
            <li> So, I use it twice a day until I feel I need to back off then once a day and even every other day sometimes.  </li>
            <li> And I always run out of the toner before the other two (the same thing happened with proactiv)</li>
            <li> Not exactly like proactiv- this formula left my skin SO dry.</li>
            <li> As for my pillow cases and the random shirt collar, its worth a little bleaching effect for this clear skin!</li>
            <li> the only bad thing about it is that it dries out my skin more than i would like</li>
            <li> and you don&#x27;t need a moisturizer when your cleanser and toner are natural(safe) and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.    </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and causes no irritation.</li>
            <li> it made my skin dry.   </li>
            <li> It dries your skin up (no peeling, just dry tightness)</li>
            <li> Pat dry with paper towel&lt;br /&gt;Step 4. Get a piece of cotton and wipe my face with the toner&lt;br /&gt;Step 5.</li>
            <li> The treatment lotion is chockful of Benzoyl Peroxide and will not make your skin feel dry.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like Proactive did</li>
            <li> (skin burns, dry skin, etc).</li>
            <li> My face was so dry.</li>
            <li> I do use additional moisturizers on the areas that tend to dry out on my face.</li>
            <li> but it also dried my face out to a point where it was uncomfortable causing more acne to pop up</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth the extra five or ten minutes at night and in the morning if I&#x27;m able to wake up everyday not feeling miserable about my skin.</li>
            <li> When I could feel my skin getting too dry</li>
            <li> Another thing, this WILL dry out your skin.</li>
            <li> after 4-5 days, my face started hurting because it was so dry.  </li>
            <li> Within a week I noticed it was leaving my skin extremely dry, but I continued doing it.</li>
            <li> I occasionaly get acne and this makes your face dry</li>
            <li> I used carrot seed oil to remove the dry skin and that worked within 2 days.</li>
            <li> Before using this product, all i had was a few tiny red bumps.   </li>
            <li> My only complaint about the product is the burning, redness and swelling it has caused to the sensitive skin underneath my eyes.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been using it for 2 weeks now, there are no new acne breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I have no new occurring pimples.</li>
            <li> No new acne, no greasy skin, no problem with my clothes being bleached.</li>
            <li> I had recently suffered some breakouts due to some new makeup and was having a hard time getting things under control -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve literally tried every skin cream you can get from a dermatologist, and each and every single one of them did nothing, or gave me an allergic reaction.</li>
            <li> I stock-up when I find it there because that is much cheaper than the usual $20/box for half of the size.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely oily so it has been hard to find a product that really works.</li>
            <li> but it has cleared up my skin and kept it clear with only the occasional (and I mean 1 tiny little zit every other month) outbreak.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried proactive before, it&#x27;s similar but more expensive and did not work as well (for me personally at least).</li>
            <li> Maybe it could work, but Benzoyl peroxide ruins my face, dries it out, makes me red, but does get rid of pimples.</li>
            <li> and I have acne scars that are bigger than the average freckle but aren&#x27;t like puddle size.</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have been suffering from break outs for the past 2-3 years.</li>
            <li> And proactiv is only average.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t start having problems with acne until my mid 20s and tried a number of products with no success.</li>
            <li> my skin did get worse at first</li>
            <li> So I spent the few extra bucks for the convenience of instant use.</li>
            <li> This product appeared to work at first but then made my skin even worse than before.</li>
            <li> and then all hell broke loose</li>
            <li> I soon learned there is a reason why it costs less - about the only thing this product did was dry out my skin and bleach my wash cloth.</li>
            <li> Get a piece of cotton and wipe it down my entire face with the toner or wherever the acne is.&lt;br /&gt;Step</li>
            <li> I cut down the use to night only, with spot treatments of Step 3.</li>
            <li> Used ACNEFREE as directed and my face has grown more and more red, burning growing worse by the hour, my face and eyes are swollen horribly.  </li>
            <li> My pimples had reduced in size and become less red.</li>
            <li> I tend to have a slightly oily T-Zone and moderate breakouts.</li>
            <li> My skin is smoother, black heads and white heads are gone</li>
            <li> Apparently, this product sucks the bacteria from deep in your skin to the surface so it can be removed.</li>
            <li> in less then three days my skin finally got under control.</li>
            <li> I found this 3 step system at Ross for like $8.99, half priced, so i was like it&#x27;s only $10</li>
            <li> I drove to my local store and paid less for it than Pharamapacks was charging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also religiously go to my derma every three weeks for the past ten years to have facials, extractions, and chemical peels.  </li>
            <li> May the combination of wet skin or dry helps.</li>
            <li> so I sought out other products with the same active ingredients as Proactiv.</li>
            <li> my eyelids felt very dry and almost felt like they were burning when I put on my make-up.   </li>
            <li> br /&gt;It made my skin very dry and break out because of it.</li>
            <li> She usually had several large painful pimples on her face and numerous large blackheads on her nose.  </li>
            <li> People who are sensitive to benzyl peroxide should probably stay away from this product and try something less harsh.</li>
            <li> My breakouts got progressively worse and my skin was really irritated and dry.</li>
            <li> I have tried more expensive products in the past and they only burned, dried out my skin and didnt not for my acne.</li>
            <li> My skin also got very dry and started to peel which was already expected from an acne product.</li>
            <li> putting a little extra dab of the lotion on it took care of it over night.</li>
            <li> It will take your skin a little while to get used to the continuous delivery benzoyl peroxide, but I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I will say that there is a downside, my face is a little red.</li>
            <li> The product doesn&#x27;t dry out her skin, like other products have.  </li>
            <li> This product goes back to the store for a refund, and I hope my face calms down!</li>
            <li> Oily skin&#x27;s propensity to not slough off correctly, leading to pore blockage, buildup, and inflammation, is a primary cause of acne, and this product stupidly ignores it completely.  </li>
            <li> I was shocked when my face was smooth and spotless!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After reading the label I realized that this contained active ingredients that were known to work, and which were also known to dry out one&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Sadly this product didn&#x27;t work for me--particularly now that it&#x27;s colder/dryer weather, my face feels completely parched and its level of breakouts are equal to what they were prior to beginning use.</li>
            <li> but after taking prescriptions for it for three months, I saw absolutely no difference in my appearance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ever spent.     </li>
            <li> I have been battling with acne for the last few months</li>
            <li> After a few weeks, my facial skin changed color into this reddish brown color.</li>
            <li> Be careful though with it- as it may bleach items.</li>
            <li> I never really cared to take care of myself</li>
            <li> I am the one that used the product on my grandchild, she is autistic and doesn&#x27;t understand how to do these things, I know that the product was used properly and twice a day as recommeded.                                         </li>
            <li> I switched from Proactiv to this product because I was curious after reading some of the reviews.</li>
            <li> I spent 3 months and over $60 on this stuff without results.  </li>
            <li> It is worth a try if everything else has failed you.  </li>
            <li> A big waste of money.</li>
            <li> and I was looking at reviews and a few people that seemed similar to me</li>
            <li> You can actually see dead skin cells coming off as the lotion is going on</li>
            <li> and I found when I didn&#x27;t do this, my cheeks felt rough and looked darker.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m forgetful</li>
            <li> I am definately looking forward to seeing what improvements come in the next few weeks.   </li>
            <li> son started doing this at the begining of the week and kept it up for the next few days.  </li>
            <li> be careful:  </li>
            <li> I just bought this a few days ago and my face wash is SLIGHTLY gritty and the lotion doesnt have a bit of grit in it.</li>
            <li> have hope for this product and if it clears up my skin then it will definately be money well spent.</li>
            <li> but be careful, It&#x27;ll stain your pillow case and towels.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set and expected it to take about 5 days to get delivered.</li>
            <li> the company rep couldn&#x27;t comment and the last number of the lot was missing..</li>
            <li> I spent thousands of dollars on expense department store&#x27;s brands like Clarins, Seshiedo, Dior, Clinics, Chanel, and Prescriptives.</li>
            <li> Child&#x27;s acne problem that has been quite an issue cleared up in only a few days.  </li>
            <li> few months later I found a neglected AcneFree cleanser and decided to use it.</li>
            <li> Came as expected</li>
            <li> Again wet face with cleanser.</li>
            <li> And now after a week and a half my skin is almost completely healed, with very little scaring.</li>
            <li> I mean holy wow, prepubescent type skin.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a serious acne problem, but a big \\&quot;i lean on my hand all day at work\\&quot; problem, and this stuff cleared up everything with no \\&quot;red face\\&quot;</li>
            <li> My skin got a little dry and rough, BUT my sister(who is a dermatologist) and brother both who used it said it is JUST your skin getting used to it.  </li>
            <li> box is a little scathed but as long as the stuff works</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;ve found myself applying a separate brand moisturizer an hour or so after using this brand&#x27;s repairing lotion because my face has become so tight and dry</li>
            <li> (I may have to cut it to every other day), but my skin became overly dry and tight because it cleanses so well.</li>
            <li> Before using AcneFree I ALWAYS had at least a zit or 2 - if not several - every single day.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> but the real problem is the blemishes that make my face look several different ugly colors.</li>
            <li> (see my other comments I&#x27;ve submitted).  </li>
            <li> My skin was extremely irritated after using it as well.</li>
            <li> Also, I&#x27;ve tried other products that caused my skin to peel.</li>
            <li> This product did not try my skin, did not cause rashes, or any other adverse effects.</li>
            <li> I would also like to note that after using this product my face did not have any sort of breakout due to pores purging out bacteria.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried proactiv along with other products and none of them worked well for me.    </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t tried to stop using it yet, so I&#x27;m not sure if the acne will come raging back or not as has been reported by a lot of Proactiv users that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not willing to take that chance yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> and it will be an endless cycle.</li>
            <li> The toner smells of alcohol, and the other two steps are benzoyl peroxide formulas.</li>
            <li> Proactiv is the ONLY thing that has worked for me in the past so since this brand swore their product was comparable (as it was cheaper)</li>
            <li> You would also have this problem with other over the counter medications containing this drug.    </li>
            <li> Change your pillow case every other night, trust me, it</li>
            <li> This never happened to any of the other products I used to treat acne.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if other people have this experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m writing this out of a true sense of compassion for everyone who suffers with acne.</li>
            <li> It says you should use it twice a day, but I know my son is not consistently using it twice a day.  </li>
            <li> This move was extremely stressful for me and started a downward spiral for my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use excessive amounts of the products, just enough to do the job....</li>
            <li> (brush my teath, etc) before using my olay or other brand of product</li>
            <li> So this time around, I tried everything (Clean&amp;Clear, Nuetrogena, Clearasil, and other name brand products).</li>
            <li> If you have acne and you think well this is probably just like all the other products,</li>
            <li> and I have one small pimple left on my forehead.</li>
            <li> it was just not pretty.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin which makes me prone to breaking out.</li>
            <li> Never got that result from any other acne treatment.</li>
            <li> After using this for one week, her pimples have disappeared and she now only has 3 or 4 small blackheads on her nose.  </li>
            <li> Be careful!</li>
            <li> pros soooooo outweigh the cons, and it&#x27;s extremely affordable!&lt;br</li>
            <li> Or the other side of the coin promoting when something does not work.</li>
            <li> Was not happy at all this was supposed to be new.</li>
            <li> Now that the dry cold air is here, I am have very itchy dry skin and under eye redness/irritation from the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to have some pimples no matter what I do, but after a few months of use, I&#x27;m only dealing with a few pimples at a time, instead of having them all over my cheeks and neck.</li>
            <li> The one slight drawback I have is that it did dry my skin out slightly, nothing that a lil moisturizer couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would definitely recommend this product for those of you like me who are tired of suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> When I do get pimples, they aren&#x27;t the huge painful ones but the smaller ones which usually disappear within a day or two.</li>
            <li> I only have a few little bumps left on my face, that are slowly disappearing.</li>
            <li> My husbands deep pores are now small with out the black heads.</li>
            <li> I have used both proactiv and acnefree and am here to tell you that acne free works equally well for me at half the price, without the annoying membership, and I don&#x27;t have to pay (or wait) for shipping.&lt;br</li>
            <li> after the month was up i noticed a little difference but not what i expected with all the hype about it.</li>
            <li> You have to careful to use a little bit.    </li>
            <li> I have a rash of unknown origin and with it a little,</li>
            <li> After three days of using this system, my face was so red and raw to the point where my skin began to peel off like I was a snake!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get results within 24 hours like a lot of other people, it&#x27;s now been two and a half weeks.</li>
            <li> The bottles were a big hard to squeeze, and I wished they all came with a pump so there goes one star.</li>
            <li> Just recently she began breaking out with small little bumps</li>
            <li> I have mild acne problem year round, and it only gets worst during that time of the month (that&#x27;s when I&#x27;d run out and try new products).</li>
            <li> I had huge, painful pimples all over my face.  </li>
            <li> I would get the crop of whiteheads all over my forehead and chin, along with huge and painful cysts on my cheeks and nose.</li>
            <li> I am shocked that Acne Free works for hormonal acne as well.</li>
            <li> A terrible breakout has cleared up within just two days of use, and the bright redness I have grown to loathe has been reduced drastically.</li>
            <li> I am not able to take hormones to clear it up anymore, so it got pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Last summer my boyfriend finally convinced me to try proactive because I was having a bad break out and felt completely hopeless.</li>
            <li> I have these reddish-brown unhealed dark spot cause by Bp( did my research)--I hope it isn&#x27;t permanent darkspots.    </li>
            <li> and the product helped get all the icky stuff that the cleansers and scrubs had been using to only mask my acne.</li>
            <li> I have a few big blemishes and small bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unfortunate because this system is so much cheaper than Proactiv, but it just does not work for me.</li>
            <li> It works as least as well as Proactiv at a third the price.  </li>
            <li> Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It may work for some, but for those with sensitive skin, it will do nothing but make their skin situation worse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had horrible acne since I was 12 and have never felt good about myself, and I&#x27;ve been bullied for my complexion often.</li>
            <li> For about the last five years, I&#x27;ve been wearing really thick foundation.  </li>
            <li> The breakouts I did have are much smaller and are slowly going away.  </li>
            <li> What it does is sucks the acne deep down in your skin to the surface so you can then wash it away when it comes up.  </li>
            <li> ever, it has been 3 days and AT LEAST half of my acne and blackheads are totally gone!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I went to swore up and down that it all I was suffering from was just a hormonal imbalance</li>
            <li> It may just work for you the way it did for me and other people!</li>
            <li> Usually toners dry out my skin, but this one doesn&#x27;t at all.  </li>
            <li> I am so grateful to have found thisproduct after a decade of daily self-consciousness about my skin, wondering if a new whitehead had emerged since I last checked, wiping oil from my forehead several times a day, desperately researching cures that all failed, and worrying every time I met a guy what he&#x27;d think when my foundation was off-</li>
            <li> Anyone who has suffered from redness, swelling and painful bumps will know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about--and to have a product that just works and eliminates all these problems in just a few days is simply a miracle.</li>
            <li> After a month and a half of using this product I still have some minor nodules and a few white heads, but worse of all</li>
            <li> When I do get the occasional blemish, they have been small with very little inflamation and go away within about 24-48 hours.</li>
            <li> I bought this since I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and still suffering from bad acne, and in the past I&#x27;ve used Proactiv and it&#x27;s cleared me right up.</li>
            <li> I will provide benefit of the doubt for now and provide a 3-4 star rating pending followup.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback you may have regarding using the kits on adult skin that doesn&#x27;t have bad breakouts, because the skin is managed in a way to keep it clear.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback you may have regarding using the kits on adult skin that doesn&#x27;t have bad breakouts, because the skin is managed in a way to keep it clear.</li>
            <li> I received it in less than a week.</li>
            <li> well... odd.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 14 &amp; a half now.</li>
            <li> Once a day is half of what&#x27;s recommended, but works for me.     </li>
            <li> You could be paying less than half the cost, you should give this a shot.</li>
            <li> My was much less greasy after using the product</li>
            <li> It even worked at getting rid of stubborn black heads that it seems like I&#x27;ve had forever.</li>
            <li> My sister has started using it as well and her acne cleared up in less than a week.</li>
            <li> My skin seems less oily.</li>
            <li> The redness fades after about a half hour</li>
            <li> She has stuck with the regime and has noticed less break outs and smoother skin.  </li>
            <li> recommend going for VitaClear which i tried before this product and is less expensive than ProActiv although it is a little more expensive than this.  </li>
            <li> Because of the daily stress I get pimples and because of the same stress I tend to pop them and open my skin really bad.</li>
            <li> I have been using Acne Free for about 7 weeks now and I am disappointed with the results.</li>
            <li> so not true.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned that squeezing zits only makes them worse and spreads bacteria to other parts of the face.&lt;br /&gt;Forth, oil control.</li>
            <li> The poor guy (a teen of course) had huge acne breakouts which made him feel so bad we have tried every product known to man with little to no results</li>
            <li> I went all throughout high school without having a single pimple or bump, but soon after graduation my face seemed to get worse and worse.</li>
            <li> You can control that by how hard you rub if at all and the grit gets rid of dry skin.</li>
            <li> --cool, I am sick of ordering it online</li>
            <li> It can be slightly time consuming to do all three steps everyday twice.</li>
            <li> My skin was just a little tight and burned a little.</li>
            <li> I still have a little bit of scaring, but otherwise the acne is gone.</li>
            <li> and i could see millions of little bumps all over my face.</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ll be buying it on Amazon now because it&#x27;s a little bit</li>
            <li> My skin may actually be a little sensitve for this product, but I just used another moisturizer along with the 3 step system.</li>
            <li> i get little breakouts here</li>
            <li> It felt like little beads stinging at my face.</li>
            <li> With other acne meds, I would put them on under my makeup and find that I usually had a whitehead by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It does burn your face a little</li>
            <li> but the little bonus treatment seems to work well for overnight treatment.  </li>
            <li> but i thought i would wait a little bit longer.</li>
            <li> I put a little in my palm and applied with my fingers.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a balance to be found there, because if I use this too much it will dry out my skin to the point of being painful.  </li>
            <li> The severe acne version of this is a little harsh, and dried out my skin, but this stuff does the job without the peeling.</li>
            <li> I have adult acne in the T-zone area and often get deep, painful pimples without this treatment.     </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it isn&#x27;t as clear as I&#x27;d like it to be...but improvement has been made.</li>
            <li> I like the time release formula which is touted to work round the clock.</li>
            <li> Then I tried that Green stuff they had on tv</li>
            <li> That stuff was too harsh for my sensetive skin.  </li>
            <li> then stopped working after a few years.  </li>
            <li> I got this a few months ago.</li>
            <li> These weren&#x27;t overnight cures, so don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gonna solve your problems in a few days.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Firstly, this product is quite harsh.</li>
            <li> My daughter had a lot of trouble with acne until using this product.</li>
            <li> , that went away after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So if you get white heads after using this, don&#x27;t think it is making it worse, the pimple is probably trying to fight the product.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t dried out either.</li>
            <li> I used a generous amount of the product everyday, twice a day.</li>
            <li> I was going to give this 3 stars because the cleanser and maybe the repair lotion too dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> I have tried everything except for Stridex, Proactiv, Max Clarity, and a few others like The Wave</li>
            <li> and I applied the stuff and noticed that after a few hours the bump was reducing in size.</li>
            <li> I used the stuff as directed, give or take a few hours off schedule sometimes, and it wasn&#x27;t doing anything.</li>
            <li> Then my acne started to get worse and my bumps got bigger and meaner</li>
            <li> I personally have not experienced this issue.</li>
            <li> I have moderately heavy acne on the sides of my face and sometimes my chin and forehead.  </li>
            <li> Been using once a day for a few days</li>
            <li> I hate Acne Free</li>
            <li> /&gt;Lotions heavy cream type soak into the dryness faster than you can put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter and I bought this a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> and I could feel a pimple forming underneath the skin, a cyst-like pimple--the worst kind you can get.</li>
            <li> The toner contains alcohol, which is too harsh for the skin (Proactiv has an alcohol-free toner)</li>
            <li> and I think it actually got worse.  </li>
            <li> The next morning, it was worse.  </li>
            <li> Out of nowhere, it seemed, my entire forehead and cheeks (just under my eyes) had broken out with what appeared to be the smallest whiteheads I&#x27;d ever seen (</li>
            <li> After a few days, problem solved.  </li>
            <li> Just a few months ago....you get the idea.  </li>
            <li> which) about once a year and use for a few days.  </li>
            <li> Alas, after only a couple of weeks usage, my skin started breaking out again.</li>
            <li> so I will advice u to not use it everyday as it says u should, but try using it three times a week or so</li>
            <li> And don&#x27;t follow their advice of putting the lotion on a cotton round.</li>
            <li> I saw results in a just a few days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve learned a lot in a few years about skin care</li>
            <li> This stuff totally dried my face out, even with the lotion, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I only used it for 4 days, and it made my skin worse than it began with.</li>
            <li> few notes on using the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I still use repair lotion on \\&quot;trouble</li>
            <li> (3) I still use repair lotion on \\&quot;trouble areas\\&quot; even though I don&#x27;t have any acne at this point.  </li>
            <li> A few months ago, I was thinking about doing ProActive</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t tell you how surprised I was to come across the formulation so randomly.</li>
            <li> I have a few notes about application.</li>
            <li> I was mortified because I leave in a few days and the flight is NINE hours.</li>
            <li> I a few years</li>
            <li> I used this product for a few weeks with basically no change in the condition of my skin</li>
            <li> but I have quite a few bottles of the repair lotion from both lines of the product.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t waste you money on anything else before you try what I&#x27;ve been using.    </li>
            <li> but recently I&#x27;ve noticed my acne getting worse</li>
            <li> I tried Proactiv in college and found it to be mostly a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a firm believer that skin care is not one-size-fits-all</li>
            <li> I literally could not open my mouth to eat a bite or cereal and it made my face 10x worse.</li>
            <li> I just bought this product a few days ago</li>
            <li> I didnt think anyone would be washing their face wearing their everyday clothes but since its a warning on the bottle</li>
            <li> it just completely dried my face out.  </li>
            <li> Noticed a difference within a few days.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all after using it everyday for 4 months...</li>
            <li> To the point of crying and needing to wash it off...</li>
            <li> (I had gone off of proactiv for a few months because of my hatred for their automatic shipping program and their policy of making you argue with an employee to cancel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have used a green towel too and it didn&#x27;t bleach that at all.  </li>
            <li> Proactiv never bleached any fabrics, so they must use something that isn&#x27;t as harsh.  </li>
            <li> Proactive did not work at all for me and dried my skin out to the point it was cracking and scaley.</li>
            <li> I remember using this product a few years ago when my mother had me use it.</li>
            <li> I appreciate all the reviews here because I can weed out between another company or hired firm trying to badmouth another.</li>
            <li> I found that it dried out my skin if I used it twice a day, so I switched to using it once and the dryness stopped.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my late 20s and never really had acne as a teenager, but a few years ago</li>
            <li> It treats acne just as well as, if not better, than Proactive at half the cost.</li>
            <li> Like the subject says--JUST TRY IT!  </li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv in the past but found this to work just as well at half the price.</li>
            <li> In just ONE day, half of my acne was gone!</li>
            <li> I am 31 years old, my skin isn&#x27;t horrible but I am African American, and when we get a blemish, the dark mark never goes away.  </li>
            <li> so I was a little skeptical about trying another product only to be let down.</li>
            <li> That means plain meat with vegetables steam or cooked in the oven.</li>
            <li> I will say one thing, the first week that i started to use the product, my face dried out really bad (even using the moisturizer).  </li>
            <li> but nothing seemed to tame this beast of acne on my face.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t mean decent or just cutting down the outbreaks a little.</li>
            <li> In the past week I have decided to keep a little bowl of salt by my sink</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a lot less expensive than systems such as Proactiv</li>
            <li> Well, this is definitely comparable to Proactiv, but is less expensive.</li>
            <li> I have had pretty bad acne since I was 14</li>
            <li> it was pretty bad.</li>
            <li> My acne has always been pretty bad</li>
            <li> My acne has been pretty bad for a while</li>
            <li> Nothing worked and I was getting pretty frustrated and broke.</li>
            <li> After months of using this product, big red acne was all over my face, and it just hurt so bad.    </li>
            <li> This was a total waste of my money - not to mention how self consious I was because it made my skin worse than it was before!</li>
            <li> You will probably be sorry if you do not use a moisturizer with this as Benzoyl Peroxide is very drying and irritating.  </li>
            <li> I have some photos of my cheeks in the past two weeks looking worse than they have in a long time</li>
            <li> Maybe I was impatient and didn&#x27;t use it long enough, but I got frustrated and wanted to try something else.</li>
            <li> About a week later my face started to peel, I mysteriously got sick, and my wash clothes and towels were getting \\&quot;bleach\\&quot; spots on them.  </li>
            <li> My daughter used this faithfully for four weeks with very little noticeable change in her forehead acne.</li>
            <li> One other thing I learned the hard way, don&#x27;t put acnefree on your eyes!</li>
            <li> I do not give bad comments usually, but this one really pissed me off    </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really have bad skin</li>
            <li> I was desperate to find something that would clear up my face.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I had ran out of Noxzema, which is a part of my usual skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> The night I used it, I noticed how soft my skin felt, but the morning after, my face itched like crazy.</li>
            <li> I thought eh what the heck, if it worked in the past it will work now.</li>
            <li> Was past it&#x27;s expiration date</li>
            <li> all in all it is a small price to pay for the clarity of my skin.</li>
            <li> Anyway, when I washed, I dispensed a small amount (dime sized), and massaged for about 40-60 seconds.</li>
            <li> I had looked at AcneFree in the past and decided not to get it, as then i didn&#x27;t have acne.  </li>
            <li> I usually break-out along my forehead, on and around my nose, and my chin.  </li>
            <li> I started getting lots of small acne on my chin and</li>
            <li> If proactive works or has worked for you in the past, I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So I have oily acne ridden skin and have for the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> I had maybe one compared to a usual handful, which is just... relieving.   </li>
            <li> I have tried Proactiv in the past, as well as Neutrogena stress control, Clinique products, bath and body works products, and I am a Mary Kay consultant</li>
            <li> So no more AcneFree for me</li>
            <li> not sure why he had the reaction he did,</li>
            <li> I got lazy and didn&#x27;t use it for a while</li>
            <li> I used to have acne on every square inch of my face, and now I have about 2 or 3 small pimples on my forehead that will probably be gone by tomorrow.</li>
            <li> In the past 6 months, I started breaking out</li>
            <li> and im not sure out that doesn&#x27;t cause acne in itself?</li>
            <li> I have noticed, however, that over the past week</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This past December, it stopped working.  </li>
            <li> Acnefree face wash poisons your water and food with plastic polyethylene microbeads that are too small for water treatment to filter out.  </li>
            <li> at 14, she knows all about taking selfies but usually filters them or piles on the makeup.</li>
            <li> no matter how small) between us, given us something to chat about and for this moment in time given us something that is ours.&lt;br</li>
            <li> tried as a cheaper alternative for ProActiv and was not satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if I will continue using this product.</li>
            <li> it leaves behind a nasty smell, and made my face break out more than it did before!</li>
            <li> The texture of the cleanser and lotion is very heavy.</li>
            <li> clearly those morons think we&#x27;re dumb enough to fall for that</li>
            <li> The high cost and bad business of ProActiv turned me off.</li>
            <li> I have exhausted over the counter and prescription topicals and anti biotics with no success.</li>
            <li> I find the product to feel very heavy and thick, even the renewing toner.</li>
            <li> Your skin takes 14 to 30 days to get used to a new process and it doesn&#x27;t change regardless of how bad you want it too.</li>
            <li> It started off with small pimples here and there, and progressively turned into very painful cystic acne on my chin, and around my smile lines.</li>
            <li> it is the worst thing I have ever used, doesent work, and made my face dry up and crack so much</li>
            <li> I had deep acne, way down in my pores and all these terrible red bubbles all over my cheeks.</li>
            <li> When I got the AcneFree cleaning system, it was hard to keep up because of the three step process every morning and night.</li>
            <li> He plays 2 sports that require him to wear a mask/helmet so breakouts are hard to avoid.</li>
            <li> even now, it&#x27;s hard to cover them up with makeup.</li>
            <li> And by the way to those of you with oily skin you will hardly notice the drying effect of this stuff.</li>
            <li> you work hard for your money and that&#x27;s $20 you could have had in your pocket if it doesn&#x27;t work...</li>
            <li> I no longer use the cleanser and toner because the product is so hard to find</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to tell what&#x27;s doing the clearing up.</li>
            <li> For the past 13 years I have tried every product under the sun hoping it would work, including Pro Active, but sadly nothing worked.</li>
            <li> At least for me, that was the options with this kit.</li>
            <li> but hey, at least it works.  </li>
            <li> Sucks.  </li>
            <li> Proactive didn&#x27;t help me, but at least it didn&#x27;t exacerbate the problem like</li>
            <li> This system may not work for everyone, but I encourage anyone battling acne to at least give it try.</li>
            <li> While I didn&#x27;t have any negative reactions as some did, I also didn&#x27;t see any improvement.</li>
            <li> When using the cleanser during Step 1, I massage it into my skin for at least 30 seconds before rinsing it off, so that it has time to penetrate the surface.  </li>
            <li> I did notice that a couple people complained of their skin drying out.</li>
            <li> I would reccommend that if you have an acne problem, at least try the acnefree products.</li>
            <li> He complained of itching and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I know he is using it  at least once a day</li>
            <li> I would consider at least moisturizing there after each use.</li>
            <li> My skin felt very raw afterwards as if it had been burned.</li>
            <li> and my acne returned slowly</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t my skin became worse all of my trouble spots swelled</li>
            <li> So, I tried AcneFree and after the second day using it only once a day I had a very bad allergy reaction that I needed to go to see a doctor.</li>
            <li> A couple months ago I got sick of paying so much money having to deal with late shipments and poor customer service.</li>
            <li> The hard, painful bumps that emerged in the past two weeks are totally gone.</li>
            <li> I used it one night, woke up in the morning, and my skin was UNBELIEVABLE!</li>
            <li> I mean no sugar or junk food.</li>
            <li> NOTHING has changed as i could usually see results using proactiv within 2 days!</li>
            <li> I used this and my skin suddenly began breaking out like mad.  </li>
            <li> of course mean it&#x27;s not going to work for anyone.</li>
            <li> My face was flaky dry, tight, and painful at times.</li>
            <li> Which is not good, for me at least.    </li>
            <li> If anything, my complexion was getting worse, not better.     </li>
            <li> I saw this product in WalMart and was very skeptical because it appeared to be a generic knock off of the ineffective Proactive.</li>
            <li> I tried this product as a less expensive alternative to the Proactiv system.</li>
            <li> As such, I found the repairing cream uncomfortable and difficult to apply (not to mention counterintuitive).</li>
            <li> finally I was going to order proactive as a last chance before I gave up the fight to rid my awful craters.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve never had serious acne.</li>
            <li> And consider seriously cutting down on the amount of makeup you wear, if you usually wear makeup.</li>
            <li> well i didnt have a bad acne problem growing up and in my teen years then i had kids</li>
            <li> The toner wasn&#x27;t too bad, it got rid of a lot of extra dirt</li>
            <li> However by the second night her skin was on fire and itched really bad.</li>
            <li> feel bad for not leaving a review three years ago earlier...</li>
            <li> I feel bad for not leaving a review three years ago earlier...</li>
            <li> It recently got so bad that I went to the dermo</li>
            <li> I have never had bad acne, but when I turned 30 I suddenly started to break out.</li>
            <li> AcneFree totally eliminated my bumps, redness and painful swellings.</li>
            <li> The packing was not good.</li>
            <li> I even had the really painful acne that are so deep it takes weeks for them to come to the surface!  </li>
            <li> The first two weeks were miserable.</li>
            <li> I was getting desperate a month and a half ago when I took a chance on this stuff.</li>
            <li> I was a ProActiv user before trying this product, but this is a lot less expensive and works just as well!</li>
            <li> In the last few years I started suffering terrible skin breakouts.</li>
            <li> It was a lot worse than it was before.</li>
            <li> It was the worse [...]</li>
            <li> I gained worse acne along my cheekbones and jawline</li>
            <li> I tried this for 2 1/2 months and it made my skin worse than it ever was.  </li>
            <li> tried that, it burned worse (even with cetaphil lotion).  </li>
            <li> After a day or two, I remember the problem areas looked considerably worse, like the product provoked the creation of additional, itsy bitsy whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> My skin didn&#x27;t break out overnight, but gradually it kept getting worse.</li>
            <li> I thought it was stress-related or my hair, but these pimples have gotten worse.</li>
            <li> Worse than it has ever been.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m felling horrible and my face was much prettier before.</li>
            <li> not happy</li>
            <li> and I break out even worse than before.</li>
            <li> but I think I got worse skin after using it.</li>
            <li> At least it wassn&#x27;t expensive.</li>
            <li> If you miss a couple treatments your face will break out worse than it ever has.</li>
            <li> but I got tired of ordering it online, etc.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m allergic to sulfur so proactive made my break outs worse.</li>
            <li> My skin was broken out because of sunscreen and junk food.</li>
            <li> They hid the expiration date with a label and the seal is broken</li>
            <li> As A teen(and even as an adult) I have also struggled with acne issues to I hated to see him dealing with this.</li>
            <li> It seemed like my acne got worse after using it.</li>
            <li> The only reason why I didn;t is because my breakouts aren;t THAT bad, but when I do break out I get a few cysts and they&#x27;re just awful, so I&#x27;ll see what the other kit will do.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t wanna start High school with nasty skin!!!</li>
            <li> but after a month and a half, I was still experiencing bad breakouts.  </li>
            <li> I used the system night and day (and although you&#x27;re not really supposed to, I spot treated the nasty pimples a few times a day with the Step 3 lotion.)</li>
            <li> Although I stopped using the toner simply because of how bad my skin was reacting to it but the cleanser and lotion still works wonders!</li>
            <li> That was also the problem, I was getting sick of paying the equivalent of a phone bill for a acne medication system monthly, so I sadly cancelled my order of proactive mostly due to price, as well as a feeling that I no longer needed it since my skin cleared up.</li>
            <li> In the last few years I started suffering terrible skin breakouts like crazy all the time.  </li>
            <li> I paid $30 for it a few months ago when I was having a really bad breakout and have never regretted it.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if using this failed because the product was poor, or that it failed because my skin eventually gets used a to a product and becomes ineffective.</li>
            <li> If I do get a pimple (and it&#x27;s usually from me being bad and not washing my face every once in a while), it goes away within a day after using the products.  </li>
            <li> My skin is not oily by any means, it tends to be combination or sensitive/acne-prone in that the wrong ingredients (mineral oil, lanolin, parabens, excess oils, non-comedogenic and pore-clogging ingredients) will make me break out, cause redness, chapping, dehydration and flaking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but kept with the program.  </li>
            <li> Was I regrettably wrong.      </li>
            <li> It appears that AcneFree has eliminated all the nasty skin bacteria that were causing my breakouts and redness, and it just hasn&#x27;t come back.</li>
            <li> I thought they would be interchangeable, but I was soooo wrong.</li>
            <li> , im on week 3 of having horrible acne on my cheeks and around my mouth, i have NEVER had acne like this in my entire life!</li>
            <li> I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Silly me</li>
            <li> and if it continues to fail, i am defintely gonna try proactiv..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s such a shame because Proactiv is overpriced and has awful customer service and an oppressive subscription program.  </li>
            <li> The cleanser is an awful gel-like formulation, with next to no exfoliation beads.  </li>
            <li> I had used Proactiv before; it worked but was expensive.  </li>
            <li> Or lame.  </li>
            <li> was too expensive for me</li>
            <li> and then I started to feel extremely uncomfortable with it.    </li>
            <li> I had became obsessed with looking for something like proactive that I could just go get, and not have to wait for it to deliver.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like complicated regimins and this fits my lifestyle.</li>
            <li> but it was too expensive.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t broken out in the longest time, and my skin feels and looks nicer than it&#x27;s ever felt!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too expensive</li>
            <li> I have always hated when that happened because for some reason that reflection brings out every big ugly bump under my skin.  </li>
            <li> I was broken out all over my cheeks and also had bumps all over my chin and painful acne around my jawline.    </li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s helped my confidence and my comfort (no more painful acne!).  </li>
            <li> I would put it on and in a half hour my face felt and was insanely greasy.</li>
            <li> it was just my skin getting used to the Bp(benzoyl peroxide) and I was desperate.</li>
            <li> and I was desperate.</li>
            <li> It was crazy.</li>
            <li> Disappointing.</li>
            <li> I could do some crazy chemical peel, and it not even be a thing afterwards.</li>
            <li> Well, I was wrong!</li>
            <li> i am 21 and dont have that bad of acne, i bought this however when i was breaking out like crazy</li>
            <li> To add, this product smells unpleasant and it gives you a burning feeling after using it.  </li>
            <li> Very Weird.  </li>
            <li> My skin wasn&#x27;t that bad before I started using this</li>
            <li> I gave this 2 1/2 months because all the reviews said it would \\&quot;draw\\&quot; out all the bad stuff and may take up to a month before some people see results.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not trying to bad mouth</li>
            <li> Definitly a bad buy for any amount of money.</li>
            <li> so I could save money but turns out this product i bad for senstive skin.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
            <li> it was flared up so bad.</li>
            <li> Maybe a bad batch...</li>
            <li> she said i had really bad acne.</li>
            <li> I was in bad shape with bad break outs and it hurt.</li>
            <li> and it was bad.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m shocked all the doctors I&#x27;ve seen about my skin</li>
            <li> After using the product for 2 months my face has broken out the worst it ever has.</li>
            <li> And since using it, I&#x27;ve never gotten one of those painful boil-type blemishes that I use to get.  </li>
            <li> It was so painful</li>
            <li> I was so shocked, embarrassed and didn&#x27;t know what to do...</li>
            <li> Ok..I have seen some stupid reviews like &#x27;OOOH my acne got worse!!</li>
            <li> About two years ago,I decided to just sick it up and pay for Proactiv.</li>
            <li> But I CAN recommend this product to anyone who is sick of paying a ton of $ on a skincare kit.</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t have REALLy bad skin, but I have really annoying pimples that come up a lot.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this is the worst acne treatment line that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> I bought AcneFree hoping it would be the answer to all my prayers, but was extremely disappointed afterwards.    </li>
            <li> I was really disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I was disappointed at some leaking.</li>
            <li> im really disappointed.</li>
            <li> Im going to the dermatologist soon :(</li>
            <li> They acted like I was stupid and said, put lotion on your face...</li>
            <li> stupid people..    </li>
            <li> When I started this product I was doubtful that it would make a difference in my skin, but my acne was out of control, so I just bought this stuff anyway.    </li>
            <li> It has been bad, very bad.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> When I got this, I was a bit skeptic because I&#x27;ve tried so many acne products that claims to work fast over the years, and yet I ended with no results. When I got the AcneFree cleaning system, it was hard to keep up because of the three step process every morning and night. The bottles were a big hard to squeeze, and I wished they all came with a pump so there goes one star. However, over the first week, I actually see my face clearing up! I mean, I&#x27;m not saying that all of my acne are gone, but the fact is that my acne is definitely lessening for sure. And I just want you reviewers out there to know that I got this product for free to try and review, but all opinions (AND RESULTS!!) are 100% my own :)</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 kits and both were opened and 1 was 1/3 gone. USED???!!!</li>
            <li> I received this product free from smiley and figured I might as well give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised in how ell it worked compared to proactive products and will save a bunch of money by switching. I am so glad I got the opportunity to try otherwise I probably wouldn&#x27;t have after trying tons of products before without success but it worked great.</li>
            <li> I received the AcneFree 24 Hour Acne Clearing System Kit free from Smiley360. This review is my own personal opinion based on the results I have seen through the use of my teenage son. Upon receiving the kit, I was initially worried that my 14 year old would not be able to keep up the 3-step system in order to see results. He began suffering from acne last year and though it bothers him, he hasn&#x27;t been the best at keeping routine to wash and take care of his skin. I reviewed the claims of the product with him and helped him through his first few time of using the product. He was impressed with the ease of use and didn&#x27;t seem to mind the 3-step system. He continued using it on his own and began seeing results. His acne cleared up and his skin has started to look much healthier than it did before he started using the product.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with the fast acting results and with the ease of use. I would recommend this product to others, especially to parents of teenagers. Don&#x27;t hesitate with the multi-step system! My teen was encouraged to use it by the positive reviews and with knowing that he would just need to stick with it for awhile.</li>
            <li> Saw an improvement in my skin within a couple days.</li>
            <li> Good price for such a good product. I received it in less than a week.</li>
            <li> DISCLAIMER: IF YOU HAVE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE SKIN, DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. I bought this product because I had ran out of Noxzema, which is a part of my usual skin care regimen. The night I used it, I noticed how soft my skin felt, but the morning after, my face itched like crazy. The days after that include breakouts, scabs, and everything else imaginable. I still have scars today and this occurred about two weeks ago. It may work for some, but for those with sensitive skin, it will do nothing but make their skin situation worse.</li>
            <li> This acne cleansing system is a great price! It&#x27;s a lot less expensive than systems such as Proactiv and it is a lot easier to find in stores.&lt;br /&gt;When using on a regular basis it really does help clear up your skin. The reason I gave this system 4 stars is because I don&#x27;t really care for the Repair Lotion (Step 3). It seems to make my face feel oily and greasy which will cause my face to breakout again.&lt;br /&gt;I do love the first 2 steps (oil-free purifying cleanser &amp; renewing toner) These two products really have helped my face clear up. I would defiantly buy the first 2 steps of this skin system again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure: I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> University Medical AF is a solid, effective, affordable 3 pc system and the price here is incredibly low. I comparable this kit in some ways to original Proactiv, but at a much lower price. I like the time release formula which is touted to work round the clock. When I consistently use this skincare kit, my skin always seems clear, but the toner can be a bit dehydrating if I don&#x27;t apply a noncomedogenic hydrating cream after cleansing and before toning.&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to check the date on the box to receive product with maximum efficacy.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a huge advocate of the Proactiv Original System, but reviewing University Medical 24 Hour ClearIng System as well since I&#x27;ve tried both and they seem to be similar.&lt;br /&gt;Proactiv skincare has always left my skin blemish free for as long as I&#x27;ve used it. Given my experience with skincare, benzoyl peroxide in a low dosage is the only product which seems to work for me long-term.&lt;br /&gt;The Proactiv \\&quot;gentle\\&quot;, salicylic acid based system proved ineffective for my skin. I should note that with the Original system, I have found it necessary to apply a hydrating cream such as Cetaphil moisturizing cream after cleansing/prior to application of toner in order to offset the potentially dehydrating effects of the toner. I&#x27;d found that when I had applied the toner to dry skin right after cleansing, my skin would wind up dehydrated or parched. This is the case even if I only use the system once per day in the evening. If I apply the system 2x day I have found that my skin gets especially dehydrated and flaky where makeup application would be a problem.&lt;br /&gt;As the years passed, I started to get interested in trying out skincare with anti-aging benefits. I&#x27;d always have the concern in the back of my mind that the products could contribute to breakouts or not keep my skin clear, but I&#x27;ve tried nevertheless.&lt;br /&gt;Derm Exclusive seemed to be neutral. I didn&#x27;t notice any unusual or timely breakouts from use of the product line, but Kardashian&#x27;s Perfect Skin cleanser always seemed to cause pimples on my skin anytime I&#x27;ve used it. I&#x27;m contributing it to their cleanser, although I suppose it could be the toner as well as this product was used some of the time when the cleanser had been used, but breakouts occurred even when their toner was not used.&lt;br /&gt;I ran out of Proactiv and Derm Exclusive cleansers so I had decided to try the Perfect Skin cleanser again, but much to my dismay, instant pimples the following morning!! Ugh. I therefore decided to purchase both University Medical Original 24 Hour Clearing System and the Sensitive Skin as an immediate measure since these are available at local pharmacies. I am considering applying the Original in the evening and the Sensitive formula during the AM, but I&#x27;m very much concerned about the amount of ALCOHOL that&#x27;s in the Renewing Toner of the Original System, listed as the second and seventh ingredient while glycolic acid is listed as the eighth. In the Proactiv toner, there&#x27;s no alcohol and glycolic acid is listed as the second ingredient. Alcohol is known to strip the skin of it&#x27;s natural lipids and pH balance. When you strip the skin you can cause the skin to fall out of balance where it overproduces oil to compensate for stripping it&#x27;s natural lipids. This can lead to more breakouts once you moisturize in order to offset the dryness and dehydration. Alcohol also dries the skin and emphasizes fine lines. I&#x27;m also concerned that stripping the skin with alcohol leads to dehydration, flaking and possible emphasis of fine lines since hydration and propr balance are especially important for mature skin. My skin is not oily by any means, it tends to be combination or sensitive/acne-prone in that the wrong ingredients (mineral oil, lanolin, parabens, excess oils, non-comedogenic and pore-clogging ingredients) will make me break out, cause redness, chapping, dehydration and flaking.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that Proactiv uses glycolic acid in it&#x27;s toner. Their toner was excellent for my skin. It would make it appear more clear, bright and even-toned. Some even consider glycolic acid an anti-aging ingredient, because it brightens dull skin and aids in gentle exfoliation while keeping the pores free of debris. The choice of alcohol as the second and seventh ingredients in the University Medical toner to dilute the product and place glycolic acid as the eighth ingredient (UM) instead of the second ingredient (Proactiv) would explain the price differential as alcohol is a cheap ingredient, but it&#x27;s also an inferior ingredient. I&#x27;m hoping that one of the representatives of University Medical will read this review and consider forwarding the comment to their Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) Dept. to consider an alcohol-free reformulation of the toner in the Original 3 pc. 24 Hour Clearing System.&lt;br /&gt;If you are experiencing dehydration, dryness, tightness, or flakiness of the skin, please consider sending University Medical Customer Service an email via their website explaining your side effects and expressing a desire in an alcohol-free based toner which instead includes well-received and regarded ingredients, such as salicylic, glycolic, AHA, fruit acids, glycerin, sodium PCA, aloe, rose, witch hazel, etc.. have all been shown in proper combination to help to clear pores, increase cell turnover and exfoliation, soothe, hydrate and have anti-aging benefits. Alcohol is a cheap ingredient known to strip and dehydrate the skin and water down the potency of the other ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep you posted on whether the University Medical products are effective as they&#x27;ve just been purchased. I will provide benefit of the doubt for now and provide a 3-4 star rating pending followup.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d appreciate any feedback you may have regarding using the kits on adult skin that doesn&#x27;t have bad breakouts, because the skin is managed in a way to keep it clear. The morning following application of Perfect Skin cleanser, my skin had tiny pimples on the cheeks and a hive type of blemish on my chin. Use of Proactiv original system (low dosages of benzoyl peroxide) seems to keep my skin clear. I&#x27;m hoping that University Medical will do the same, but I&#x27;ll have to consider how to properly offset the alcohol in the Renewing Toner. I&#x27;m awaiting a reply from the UM CS dept. as I&#x27;d emailed them via their website.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, and good luck, everyone.e it appear more clear, bright and even-toned.

            <li> Well, the packaging does say that people with sensitive skin might not want to use this product, but how do you know if your skin is sensitive until you try it.  My dermatologist says this product has a high content of benzoyl peroxide for an over-the-counter product.  I used it as instructed on the bottles for 3 days.  On the 4th day, I woke up looking like this (see picture).  I had to go to the dermotologist and pay $100 office visit copay and another $70 for a prescription lotion to make this go away.  It took over a week, but I am almost back to &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34;.  My recommendation is to try this product on your neck or something first to make sure you are not overly sensitive.  It is some strong stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristi W.&lt;br /&gt;Houston, TX</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own. My daughter tried this product and loves it! Her face looks so clear! She has more self confidence now and has been more outgoing I definitely recommend this product to anybody who is suffering from acne as this product is great for clearing up acne.</li>
            <li> I just started using acne free 3 step kit but I am having lil problem..my face has a light red tint and itchy a little bit..is this normal for just starting it??</li>
            <li> Worked fairly well for my 15 year-old son. He plays 2 sports that require him to wear a mask/helmet so breakouts are hard to avoid. This product didn&#x27;t clear up his skin completely, but it did help.</li>
            <li> So I had acne most of my teenage years and now I am 25 and still have some spots here and there but nothing like when I was a teenager.  First I tried the many of Oxy pads, clearasil cleansers, etc and nothing was working.  Then I tried that Green stuff they had on tv i forget what it was called but comes in bottles like this.  That stuff was too harsh for my sensetive skin.  Then I tried this and it worked pretty good for a while then stopped working after a few years.  I then stopped this and went back to just washing with acne cleansers in the shower and that worked for a while and then I found acne.org and got his regimen and that has been working for me ever since.  The stuff works great from that site and you can tell the difference.  It is kinda similar to this, but I figured I would try his method because it was working.  So I gave this a 3 star rating because it does the job and is average and is not too harsh for sensetive skin if you use it right.</li>
            <li> So, I don&#x27;t have REALLy bad skin, but I have really annoying pimples that come up a lot. I got this a few months ago. The smell isn&#x27;t too great, but it&#x27;s not disgusting or someone that will completely put you off. I used it one night, woke up in the morning, and my skin was UNBELIEVABLE! My pimples had reduced in size and become less red. Plus, my skin tone was more even. I must say though that the first step (Purifying Cleanser) stings/tingles a little bit, but it goes away after the next two steps.  Anyways, I used it again the night after, woke up, and they WERE ALL GONE. No joke.  Been using this ever since then, and I only get like a pimple a week.    DEFINITELY GET THIS PRODUCT. You WON&#x27;T regret it.</li>
            <li> In just three days, my acne has cleared up and my skin looks better than ever!  Another added benefit that I didn&#x27;t expect is that it keeps the oil at bay during the day.  For the first time, I can wear makeup without having it slide off my face by mid-day and there are no new break-outs.  I wish this product had been around 20 years ago when I was a teenager.  It might have saved me from a lot of facial scarring that I have to live with to this day.  It might not work for everyone, but for me it has been a miracle.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my daughter and she is having instant results.  A much better price than Proactiv!</li>
            <li> Bought this for my wife because of her cystic acne. She followed instructions to a T and also changes her pillow case regularly, uses products the company suggests to help the process (UV skin lotion, etc.), exercises, and takes a multivitamin to support her body. No change in acne what so ever after a month + some.</li>
            <li> Sadly this product didn&#x27;t work for me--particularly now that it&#x27;s colder/dryer weather, my face feels completely parched and its level of breakouts are equal to what they were prior to beginning use. However, a friend of mine uses this product and says it&#x27;s worked for her, so I guess it just depends on your skin!</li>
            <li> Pretty clear within 3 days.  Completely clear skin in 1 week.  Works awesome for adult acne.  The terminator I think is what really cleared my skin.</li>
            <li> I researched products for a long time before purchasing this one.  I was skeptical but kept with the program.  One month later my skin looks great.  I&#x27;ve never had clearer skin.  I still have a little bit of scaring, but otherwise the acne is gone. I also purchased a tube of the terminator.  WOW!  Blackheads were gone in 2 days and any blemish that begins to appear is gone within 12 hours.  Amazing stuff.  I highly recommend this product...but don&#x27;t give up on it.  Even if you have to buy a second system before noticing any change, keep with it.    I will say one thing, the first week that i started to use the product, my face dried out really bad (even using the moisturizer).  I ended up moving back to a daily use and that&#x27;s when it started working for me.      I&#x27;m a consumer just like you...I don&#x27;t work for this company and I&#x27;m not paid to post my opinion (see my other comments I&#x27;ve submitted).  I value what others write about products they&#x27;ve tested and hope that this helps you as you are researching products.</li>
            <li> In the last few years I started suffering terrible skin breakouts like crazy all the time.  My skin was going from clear to blotchy red almost overnight and it was soo greasy too.  The skin doctor I went to swore up and down that it all I was suffering from was just a hormonal imbalance and it would eventually pass but after taking prescriptions for it for three months, I saw absolutely no difference in my appearance. I began to stay inside all the time and also became very moody as well.  I was so desperate that I probably spent a small fortune trying pretty much every kind of acne \\&quot;cure\\&quot; I came across in the stores.  Then the doctor decided to give me another prescription but this time the stuff ended up doing nothing but making made my face even redder.  I started using Acnefree and had fairly good results. A friend of mine had been taking a herbal acne supplement called Clearzine and suggested I try it too. I was going to wait until I was finished with the Acnefree program but thought maybe combining both would provide better results. Well after a week of using both my acne was completely gone and after 3 weeks all the blemishes and red spots were gone! If you are thinking of trying Acnefree, pick up a bottle of Clearzine too and try them together. These weren&#x27;t overnight cures, so don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s gonna solve your problems in a few days.  But I really think this combo is worth a shot, I am very impressed with how well it worked for me. It also got rid of the greasy, oily feeling on my face as well.  I&#x27;m pretty convinced now that there are no miracle overnight acne cures but this product really seemed to work for me, I really liked how easy it was to use too.  I&#x27;ve tried proactive before, it&#x27;s similar but more expensive and did not work as well (for me personally at least). Anyway, like I said, I&#x27;m really impressed.</li>
            <li> Miracle in a bottle, it not only clears the acne but it makes your skin very smooth. Works real quick. I would say within a week you have glowing skin, yes a pimple here and there, but the amount that disappears is worth the use. I m not a makeup person, and people keep asking, do you have on powder, hell no i only use acnefree.</li>
            <li> I have had fairly moderate acne for about 5 years, and I&#x27;m 19 now. My acne was never terrible, but it was enough that it used to make me pretty self-conscious; I always had pimples on my chin and forehead.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that had ever fixed my skin was the contraceptive pill, but as I stopped taking it 3 months ago, I wanted to find an alternative to fixing my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, this product is quite harsh. It will bleach any fabric it comes in direct contact with.&lt;br /&gt;It has worked fairly well for me. I didn&#x27;t get results within 24 hours like a lot of other people, it&#x27;s now been two and a half weeks. I still get pimples but to a lesser degree. It hasn&#x27;t gotten rid of all of my pimples, but it&#x27;s cleared my skin up a fair bit which is fine with me.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t use it twice a day because I feel like it&#x27;s a bit harsh on my skin, and I normally moisturise parts of my face straight after the 3 steps because I found it really dried out parts of my skin when I first started losing it.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend it because it&#x27;s a decent price and it seems to have worked really well for other people. I&#x27;ll continue to use it as long as it continues to improve my skin, and I think it&#x27;s been more effective than any other skin treatment I&#x27;ve tried (which isn&#x27;t very many!).</li>
            <li> My daughter had a lot of trouble with acne until using this product. It doesn&#x27;t irritate her skin but keeps it looking great. The 3-step system really works.</li>
            <li> Age:23  Skin Type: brown skin, moderately oily in the summer.    When I was a teen(age:17), I used this product and it miraculously cleared up my acne and pimple with in two weeks with no dryness, redness, or burning like proactive, which I have also tried. Now that I am an adult(age:23) I have begun to get really stressful(unbalance hormones) and developed some really extreme acne, from nodules(large hard pumps under skin) to pustules(an inflamed whitehead). I thought eh what the heck, if it worked in the past it will work now. Was I regrettably wrong.      The first time I tried it again, my face was burning and red, but I thought to myself it was just my skin getting used to the Bp(benzoyl peroxide) and I was desperate. The burning subsided after a few days, but then my skin started to get flaky mainly in the ares when I&#x27;d applied the bp lotion. I was happy that it calmed down the bumps, but after a day, more bumps and whiteheads were appearing in the healed area due to irritation. I told myself it was the purging period. It was the longest purging period ever--3 weeks. I was depressed, I didn&#x27;t even wanted to go out anymore, and even when I did, I try not to make eye contact and just look down the whole time.     After a month and a half of using this product I still have some minor nodules and a few white heads, but worse of all I have these reddish-brown unhealed dark spot cause by Bp( did my research)--I hope it isn&#x27;t permanent darkspots.    My conclusion for this product is that the ingredients changed. I have compared the old regime to the new regime and the old regime feels more safe on the skin then the new ones. And Bp is toxic for your skin, specifically my skin.    Now I am trying to find a more natural alternative like tea tree oil cleanser,alcohol free toner, etc.. and you don&#x27;t need a moisturizer when your cleanser and toner are natural(safe) and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry.    Hope this review help and good luck with the battle against acne.</li>
            <li> I have used several acne products over the years.  Most of them don&#x27;t help much so I thought I would try this one.  After a few days, my face broke out more than ever.  I had huge, painful pimples all over my face.  It was a lot worse than it was before.</li>
            <li> It was horrible it came like if it was used the bottles were all faded . Wish I could get my money back!!</li>
            <li> well i didnt have a bad acne problem growing up and in my teen years then i had kids and i started getting more and more acne and hated it, it would not go away and i haven been trying EVERYTHING and nothing changed so i tried the free trial of proactive and it was a months worth of product. after the month was up i noticed a little difference but not what i expected with all the hype about it. so i really didnt want to spend any more money on it. i decided to try acne free and I LOVE IT!!!! it has cleared up most my acne and i have only been using it for a couple weeks. the only bad thing about it is that it dries out my skin more than i would like but i have a really good moisturizer to battle with that. but overall best one i have ever tried. i will continue to use it for my acne problems! GREAT PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m one of those people that has had acne for about 10 years now. woohoo. I took every antibiotic under the sun with the exception of Accutane(side effects are too risky.) Well, I was using proactiv for awhile and it was doing alright but was breaking the bank. Started using Acnefree and was getting the same results. Neither one completely cured my acne, but it&#x27;s good for people with some mild acne, not a cure all. It does help keep my face mostly clear. But again, don&#x27;t stop the regimen because your acne will come back. I&#x27;ve never had a problem with redness. I think it&#x27;s just a reaction some people have to the dosage of benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> I have had pretty bad acne since I was 14 (Im now 20). I never thought I would even make it just a little better. I tried this stuff and after 2 or 3 weeks I noticed a huge difference. I have acne, acne scars and huge pores that are really visible. This stuff made all 3 of those things go away. My skin is starting to look smooth instead of like it has holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit of advice for people who have just started using it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*At first this stuff dried out my lips and made them chap, that went away after a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I noticed that the next morning after using the 3-step stuff, I would get the white-head pimples, then by the end of the day they would go away. So if you get white heads after using this, don&#x27;t think it is making it worse, the pimple is probably trying to fight the product.</li>
            <li> I have been dealing with acne since I was 14, and I am now 27. For the past 13 years I have tried every product under the sun hoping it would work, including Pro Active, but sadly nothing worked. I finally found a product about 3 years ago that worked, but it was just recently discontinued. For the past couple of months I have tried a variety of different products that caused excessive dryness and my face to break out even more. I did a lot of research on AcneFree and read all the reviews and decided to give it a try. I have been using it for a month now and could not be happier with the results. I finally have clear skin again! I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I like Acne Free better than Proactiv. It&#x27;s less expensive and it works just as good or in my opinion even better. My only wish is that they would include a moisturizer in the pack so that I wouldn&#x27;t have to buy the sensitive skin pack just to get one.</li>
            <li> The only reason I purchased this product is because I saw it at Costco. Unfortunately, this is the worst acne treatment line that I&#x27;ve ever tried. The texture of the cleanser and lotion is very heavy. My skin was extremely irritated after using it as well. I suffer from cystic adult acne. This product made my skin break out more. It was the worse [...] I&#x27;ve ever spent.     Please stay away from Acne Free products.</li>
            <li> It keeps acne under control.  the only problem is the first soln is used up slower than the other two.</li>
            <li> Maybe the problem is that I only have acne in my chin area hence not severe enough.... After two applications my entired faced swelled! I noticed my face was itching and when I looked in the mirror there were thousands of tiny bumps everywhere! My T zone was especially bad. I would not recommend this product for moderate case. Maybe try the sentitive version, regards I am keeping it simple with Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser and drinking plenty of water.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I&#x27;m 57 and have suffered with skin breakouts on my face, chest, shoulders and back for decades. My diet is excellent and very healthy, and I&#x27;ve tried various vitamins and herbs with little success. AcneFree totally eliminated my bumps, redness and painful swellings. It only took about 5 days, with noticeable results in 2 days. I now use it every 2-3 days and my skin looks wonderful. I&#x27;m shocked all the doctors I&#x27;ve seen about my skin didn&#x27;t know about AcneFree and its incredible effectiveness. I went on a trip recently and didn&#x27;t use AcneFree for 10 days. All I got was a bump on the side of my nose, and now that I&#x27;m back using it, the bump is going away. My skin feels healthy and the constant pain due to inflammation is completely gone. Anyone who has suffered from redness, swelling and painful bumps will know exactly what I&#x27;m talking about--and to have a product that just works and eliminates all these problems in just a few days is simply a miracle. It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and causes no irritation. All I have is healthy skin that feels and looks smooth and blemish free. What&#x27;s not to love! I strongly recommend this product. I just wish they had a travel kit in 3 oz bottles so I can take it with me when I fly.&lt;br /&gt;--------&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (April 2011): More than 2 years later my skin is still marvelously clear. I rarely use the products (maybe once every 3-4 months) and my face stays wonderfully clear. It appears that AcneFree has eliminated all the nasty skin bacteria that were causing my breakouts and redness, and it just hasn&#x27;t come back. How I wish I&#x27;d known about this product 25 years ago!! It is gentle and produced no peeling or sensitivity whatsoever. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about it. I&#x27;m now 59 so I&#x27;m no kid, and AcneFree&#x27;s products are for everyone regardless of your age. As a longterm sufferer of skin breakouts, it&#x27;s really been a lifesaver. I&#x27;ve never had to replace my original AcneFree kit and still have lots left. I highly recommend this product to acne/rosacea sufferers of all ages.this product to acne/rosacea sufferers of all ages.</li>
            <li> AcneFree works better (for me) than Proactive and at half the cost.  But, I switched to AcneFree Severe about 12 months ago.  I went from having 3 pimples a week, to 3 pimples a MONTH.  Spend the $10 more and get severe.  It won&#x27;t burn your skin, and I don&#x27;t even wash twice a day, just once in the morning, and I don&#x27;t even use step 4 of sever at night.    For on the spot pimples you can see coming in before you go to bed, use AcneFree Terminator 10 - that is hit or miss, but it does work.</li>
            <li> i am 21 and dont have that bad of acne, i bought this however when i was breaking out like crazy and i figured this would be good to try (mainly cause it was cheap at the drugstore) i used it in the mornign AND night for about 3 days when i started to see my skin start looking ... well... odd. my face was shiny and i could see millions of little bumps all over my face. it was pretty bad. i stopped using it and my skin went back to its regular look and feel. NOW, i use this product ONLY at night, and it seems to be keeping my skin nice and clear. i think for me the BP ingredient was way too strong for my skin(i have pretty fair colored skin) but using it only at night really has made a difference. dont know if i will buy it again when i run out, i think i will try another system.</li>
            <li> I bought AcneFree a couple months ago when I ran out of my beloved Klear Action. I thought they would be interchangeable, but I was soooo wrong. It did work for a while, but then I suddenly started getting those deep cysts on my chin, something I hadn&#x27;t experienced in a couple of years on Klear Action, then next to my nose....even now, it&#x27;s hard to cover them up with makeup. I&#x27;m fed up -- I&#x27;m sure it works for some people, but I&#x27;m not one of them. Going back to KA.</li>
            <li> I got totally clear skin compared proactiv.  The only problem is lotion is drying the skin.You have to careful to use a little bit.    However this is the best over Proactiv,Klearactiv,Murad, and Neutrogena.</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne, nothing too bad, but I wanted to try something more than the usual acne washes I was using, and I decided on Acne Free because it was the cheapest \\&quot;skin system\\&quot; in the store at the time. I&#x27;ve had this product for three days so far and it completely cleared up my existing acne. I also don&#x27;t have any new pimples. I usually pick at my acne even though you&#x27;re not supposed to, and Acne Free is healing up marks from picking, too. My face feels smooth and I don&#x27;t need to put on foundation or concealer, which I usually do every day to cover up the redness - so I&#x27;m sure the lack of makeup is also helping my face stay clear. My skin isn&#x27;t dried out either. I will have to keep using the product to see if it keeps working, but so far, I love it and I would definitely recommend trying it out!</li>
            <li> We have tried this and it works!! We saw results in 2 days!  My daughter wanted to go to Prom. This was her first year so we wanted to make everything Great!! We started using the Acne Free and it cleared her up! She was so beautiful!!</li>
            <li> I have always had clear skin, but noticed that recently I was getting a lot of little bumps on my forehead and chin.  Regular benzoyl peroxide cream wasn&#x27;t helping, so I tried Acne Free.  I used this product for 2 1/2 days and was thrilled with it until this evening.  Yes, my acne is probably 85% gone, but my face has gotten red and swollen in patches.  I cleaned my whole face with the cleanser then used the toner and lotion just on my problem areas.  Since the red blotches are not on my whole face, I&#x27;m assuming either the toner or lotion is what my skin can&#x27;t handle.  I had to go to work with this red blotchiness and have people comment on it (very embarrassing!).  Now, it may work for some people, but it didn&#x27;t for me.  I don&#x27;t even have particularly sensitive skin.  This product goes back to the store for a refund, and I hope my face calms down!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 16 year old girl and have been using this product for a year now. I&#x27;ve had horrible acne since I was 12 and have never felt good about myself, and I&#x27;ve been bullied for my complexion often. I only use this product at night, not both morning and night as recommended on the package. When I first started using AcneFree, my acne actually got a bit worse for 2-3 months. I almost gave up but I decided that I might as well keep using it, as nothing else has ever worked. After 3 months my skin started getting significantly better, and I was noticing how much less acne I had every morning. After 4 months of using AcneFree, my skin is so much more clear. I feel much more confident about myself and people now compliment my much clearer complexion. After a year of use, my skin is still much better that it once was but I recently started using it both in the morning and at night because I can tell that the acne is attempting to act up again. If this change in routine can&#x27;t tame it, I might switch to AcneFree Severe Acne Treatment System for more powerful treatment. I just think my skin has gotten used to the normal AcneFree. I highly recommend this product as it has really changed my life for the better.</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old female, and I&#x27;ve never written a review for anything until now because I really value this product. I have been suffering from moderate-moderately severe acne since I was 11. I tried every over the counter product, masks, and even prescription products. I also tried pro-active, and I have seen several dermatologists, but I still experienced whiteheads, blackheads, and cysts. I bought this product one day b/c I noticed my roommate had it, and I was suffering a particularly awful acne breakout when I had over 30-40 cysts in one month. Immediately, I noticed a difference. The flare ups slowed down, and within 2 weeks, new break outs stopped appearing. Within 2 months, my forehead was completely clear, the first time in 10 years. It&#x27;s been over 4 months now, and my skin has not look this good since I was 10 years old. I no longer have cysts, and breakouts are basically non-existent. The product is also pretty good at reducing redness/hyper-pigmentation left by previous post-acne marks.   Also, I&#x27;ve tried other products that caused my skin to peel. This product did not try my skin, did not cause rashes, or any other adverse effects. I used a generous amount of the product everyday, twice a day. It&#x27;s wonderful, affordable, and really works.</li>
            <li> Was past it&#x27;s expiration date but I got a refund so no harm no foul.</li>
            <li> I was going to give this 3 stars because the cleanser and maybe the repair lotion too dried out my skin. Maybe it was everything, but definitely the purifying cleanser stripped all moisture from my face. My face was flaky dry, tight, and painful at times. It hurt, but I had no acne. I tried moisturizers, but maybe if I had bought a moisturizer that was more powerful and used it twice a day it would have brought my face back to normal. I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m tempted to try this out again since it worked before I just stopped cuz it made my skin dry.   I am using a prescription med. but it&#x27;s not working anymore I believe, I&#x27;m breaking out and have been ever since summer so that would be 3 seasons I had almost clear skin. The perscription didn&#x27;t get rid of all the acne, about 90-95 percent of it, which is good enough, right?     So that is why I&#x27;m tempted to use this again, it will def dry my skin out, which is not fun when you can&#x27;t move your face easily without pain. Maybe it could work, but Benzoyl peroxide ruins my face, dries it out, makes me red, but does get rid of pimples. Well Benzoyl peroxide isn&#x27;t for me, and AcneFree contains this in 2 or all 3 of the steps in the system! Which is not good, for me at least.    I heard about AcneFree sensitive kit for people with sensitive skin and can&#x27;t handle the original formula so I&#x27;m extremely tempted to try that out since my skin perscription isn&#x27;t working right now and school is gonna start and I don&#x27;t wanna start High school with nasty skin!!! So i&#x27;m willing to run over to walmart and try out the sensitive kit.     Overall I give this 4 stars because if it did not dry out my skin, this would have easily been 5 stars. But I&#x27;m not giving it 3 because it did work, but there&#x27;s one MAJOR trade off, dry skin, or acne? At least for me, that was the options with this kit. Still I loved it and you can love it too, if you skin can handle benzoyl peroxide then try this out. You&#x27;ll probably love it.    (My skin is combination skin (oily T zone normal face overall) and my skin isn&#x27;t really sensitive but when Benzoyl peroxide is in the picture, yes it is!! So thats my background, and I&#x27;ve had acne since 6th grade so about when I was 11 years old. I&#x27;m 14 &amp; a half now. and I have acne scars that are bigger than the average freckle but aren&#x27;t like puddle size. I have tried everything except for Stridex, Proactiv, Max Clarity, and a few others like The Wave but that is it.) If Sensitive kit in AcneFree don&#x27;t work, I&#x27;ll have to head over to Max Clarity or see my doc.</li>
            <li> This product works great!!!! My husband is on proactiv and it works fine too, it just costs more money. It seems like most of the complaints about these products is that it made acne worse. Okay what regement were you on before you started using this? Your skin takes 14 to 30 days to get used to a new process and it doesn&#x27;t change regardless of how bad you want it too. Think about how long you&#x27;ve had acne, two to four weeks is not that look to wait for clear skin. My skin wasn&#x27;t that bad before I started using this but I was using some pretty serious stuff and the product helped get all the icky stuff that the cleansers and scrubs had been using to only mask my acne. You have to try it for longer than two or three days to really see the results!!! I&#x27;m happier now than ever before.</li>
            <li> Yes, Acne Free does work wonders. It treats acne just as well as, if not better, than Proactive at half the cost. Unfortunately, there is a downfall: you have to use Acne Free RELIGOUSLY for it to work. I had been using the product for about a month and my skin was almost perfectly clear. I went 48 hours washing, toning, and lotioning my face only twice instead of four times and all hell broke loose! It took me a week to get my face clear again! Gahhh!    Overall, a great product; I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so time consuming. I guess you have to go the prescription cream route if you&#x27;re looking for something to just apply and go.</li>
            <li> I wish I had a before and after picture! I have been using this product for a week and I barely recognize my face. I have been battling with acne for the last few months and I think I have tried about five or six different products in that time and they&#x27;d work so so or not at all. I tried Acnefree several years ago with awesome results, but eventually got lazy with the three-step process, then I later tried the severe version which proved too much for my skin and broke me out even more. This recent use has been miraculous. I never realized how much bacteria is still left on the face after washing. My face feels very soft after use. Another thing about this product is that it DOES lighten the complexion, so you will definitely notice a brighter skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like bout the product is that even though I use all three items with each use, I run out at different intervals and I had to go to eBay to order more toner after just a week, but all in all it is a small price to pay for the clarity of my skin. I actually prefer to go out without makeup now and I can&#x27;t pass by a mirror without stopping and staring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After only a week of use, my face is completely \\&quot;acnefree\\&quot;, my skin tone is brighter (I am Black with a med complexion), and the appearance of post acne marks is significantly improved. I feel like people are looking at ME when I talk now and not my blemishes. I highly recommend Acnefree and plan to continue using it indefinitely.</li>
            <li> I have some acne on my skin and i have used a lot of products for my skin.  This one was the WORST product i have EVER used.    At first it seemed like it was clearing out my skin, but that was just for a few weeks.    First, the acne just got wilder.  Before using this product, all i had was a few tiny red bumps.   After months of using this product, big red acne was all over my face, and it just hurt so bad.    My skin tone also changed into a much darker and more dull color.  It was cleary noticeable.  I have an asian skin color that is sort of on a lighter side.  After a few weeks, my facial skin changed color into this reddish brown color. yuck.    To add, this product smells unpleasant and it gives you a burning feeling after using it.  This product is way too strong and all you will get it hurt and irritated skin.      The good thing is I changed to another product and found out it&#x27;s perfect for my skin type.  If you have a sensitive skin like me, I strongly recommend logona products for blemished skin.  It may be a little more expensive but hey, at least it works.  My skin has now fully recovered and the acne is almost gone.</li>
            <li> It did not work at all on my granddaughters acne.</li>
            <li> FACTS ABOUT THE USER:    African-American  i have cystic acne  VERY oily skin    Review:    When I started this product I was doubtful that it would make a difference in my skin, but my acne was out of control, so I just bought this stuff anyway.    At first this stuff was like a magic kit on face. When I started it using it I had this really big bump on the left side of my face and I applied the stuff and noticed that after a few hours the bump was reducing in size. By the next day it was practically gone, but instead of a huge bump I got a huge acne scar. I am using something to try to combat the scarring, but it hasn&#x27;t been that effective. But anyway, the same thing happened to two huge whiteheads that I later got on my forehead. I tried the product on the whiteheads and they were reduced in size by the end of the day. My face was starting to get smoother. I still had smaller bumps on my face, but they were nothing compared to the cyst that grace my face all the time.     After about three weeks I started to notice that I was getting more breakouts, but I wasn;t worried, because products like this are supposed to make you break out and then it will take it away. Well, I was wrong! I used the stuff as directed, give or take a few hours off schedule sometimes, and it wasn&#x27;t doing anything. Then my acne started to get worse and my bumps got bigger and meaner and I knew that my skin had once again gotten used to this product, so it became ineffective. So, my review is mixed I don&#x27;t know if using this failed because the product was poor, or that it failed because my skin eventually gets used a to a product and becomes ineffective. But part of me feels like if this were stronger medicine it would have had a better effect. I&#x27;m going to try the severe acne kit by this brand and see what happens. The only reason why I didn;t is because my breakouts aren;t THAT bad, but when I do break out I get a few cysts and they&#x27;re just awful, so I&#x27;ll see what the other kit will do.And by the way to those of you with oily skin you will hardly notice the drying effect of this stuff. I would put it on and in a half hour my face felt and was insanely greasy. Well, acnefree it was good while it lasted.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly amazed! I&#x27;ve had acne since I was about 15 and I&#x27;m almost 22. I&#x27;ve tried so many different products. About two years ago,I decided to just sick it up and pay for Proactiv. It helped calm and maintain my breakouts but never really cleared my skin to a comfortable state. A couple months ago I got sick of paying so much money having to deal with late shipments and poor customer service. So I decided to try a product I could get at the store and landed on this one. I&#x27;ve got oily and sensitive skin so I need something strong enough to fight the acne but gentle enough that my face doesn&#x27;t swell up like a balloon. THIS is that product. Wishing just two weeks,I saw amazing results and have never loved my skin more! Although I stopped using the toner simply because of how bad my skin was reacting to it but the cleanser and lotion still works wonders! The only time I break out is when I get my period and for a girl who has been constantly struggling for years,this is the best thing that could happen! I literally had convinced myself that I was never going to have good skin..but here I am!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this Sensitive formula for nearly 2 weeks and have had immediate results. No dryness has occured anywhere on my face. The spot treatment dries and clears up blemishes quickly. Be careful though with it- as it may bleach items. I personally have not experienced this issue. My face seems to be well moisturized after washing and spot treatment. I proceed with the moisturizer- and I have added balance. I would also like to note that after using this product my face did not have any sort of breakout due to pores purging out bacteria. I tend to have a slightly oily T-Zone and moderate breakouts. I experience most on jaw area from hormones or stress, etc. Occasionally I will experience one on my cheak. I would highly recommend this product as opposed to Proactive. Great price and great results!!!&lt;br /&gt;I like the fact that you do not have this on automatic order is you choose not to do so.</li>
            <li> I have moderately heavy acne on the sides of my face and sometimes my chin and forehead.  I&#x27;ve tried proactiv along with other products and none of them worked well for me.    I bought AcneFree hoping it would be the answer to all my prayers, but was extremely disappointed afterwards.    The cleanser really had no exfoliating beads or anything, it felt like putting soap on my face and afterwards when I used the toner, there was still A LOT of left over dirt on my face.  I&#x27;m a really good scrubber too, I rub, I lightly use my fingers, and I rub my cleansers in for quite a while, and I had never had this problem with other cleansers.    The toner wasn&#x27;t too bad, it got rid of a lot of extra dirt and I actually liked to use it three times a day, especially if I was sweating a lot.    The repair lotion didn&#x27;t seem to do much for me.  It gave my face a really greasy feeling and I actually broke out from it!  I had to stop using it.    I was really disappointed in this product.  I cleaned my face twice a day, never had any problems with dryness or peeling, I still had a lot of acne and a lot of oil build-up.    For the price however, it&#x27;s a sufficient product for those with mild acne (3-4 pimples a week).</li>
            <li> I have tried everything, from organic to prescriptions. Acne Free is the first system to work! In only 3 uses I am seeing results. I have a few big blemishes and small bumps all over my face. I am shocked that Acne Free works for hormonal acne as well. I actually look forward to using the steps, because I know it is working!</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with my order. The product came very quickly and was very inexpensive. I will shop from again.</li>
            <li> For the last six years I&#x27;ve battled adult cystic acne caused from an imbalance of hormones. My dermatologist prescribed Minocycline and Benzaclin which had no effect.  I must of tried every product and cleanser on the market.  I recently bought the Acne Free Clear Skin 3 Step Kit.  For the first time in six years, my skin is nearly acne free.  I have to admit, I didn&#x27;t have a lot of hope. I&#x27;ve tried so many treatments, including ProActive which didn&#x27;t work for me. This one started to work right away.  I&#x27;ve used it for about three weeks now.  The difference in my skin is amazing.  My acne is one of my biggest insecurities.  This product healed my skin and gave me back my self confidence.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it really keeps my acne under control. I just looked it up on amazon to see if I can get it cheaper than at the store but I&#x27;m surprised to see the price. You can get the 3 piece set at both Target and Walmart for about 15 dollars, even rite aid has it cheaper. Great product but not worth the extra money not to mention shipping charges.</li>
            <li> Was not happy at all this was supposed to be new. When I opened the package the two products that have expiration dates we&#x27;re expired and it looked liked someone tried rubbing it off which they didn&#x27;t do a good job at. When I purchase something new I expect new.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and I first ordered the AcneFree sensitive skin version. That did not work for me at all. Then I tried out this one and it made my skin inflamed in about 2 hours. I tried it on in the evening and by 8:00 pm my face looked like a blowfish; bright cherry red. My skin felt very raw afterwards as if it had been burned. I did not TOUCH these products even once after that experience.     My boyfriend has regular skin; not too dry, not too oily and still this product was able to damage his skin. He has no problems using benzoyl peroxide in other products but this one might be a bit too strong.     I don&#x27;t know how it has helped others but then again everyone is different.     I would definately stay away from benzoyl peroxide if you have sensitive skin and use salicylic acid or natural applicants like diluted tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> I bought this since I&#x27;m in my mid twenties and still suffering from bad acne, and in the past I&#x27;ve used Proactiv and it&#x27;s cleared me right up. Not having the money right then to buy Proactiv, I settled for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My face NEVER cleared up and, in fact, I broke out even more. I tried sticking to it for about a month just to see and it just never got better. I gained worse acne along my cheekbones and jawline, my pores got bigger, I&#x27;m pretty sure, and never cleared out, and every day there was a new giant pimple waiting to say hello in the mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stick to Proactiv or a similar brand you know and are confident in!</li>
            <li> This particular kit worked really well for me.  I&#x27;m 20 with mild/moderate acne and this actually worked better for me than the Proactiv that I tried!  It&#x27;s much cheaper and you don&#x27;t have to deal with autoship as well!</li>
            <li> I wish AcneFree had been around when I was a teenager! This system is fabulous! Since I still have acne and oily skin issues in my adulthood, I use AcneFree and I have no worries! My skin is clean and clear all the time. My only wish is that the cleanser would be a bit more exfoliating. Anyway, thank you AcneFree for such an amazing and affordable product and thank you Amazon for making it so simple to get!</li>
            <li> Application:&lt;br /&gt;After washing and using toner - face feels very stripped.&lt;br /&gt;After applying the \\&quot;repair\\&quot; lotion - face feels coated and wants to sweat.&lt;br /&gt;Face appears red and shiny all day since onset of treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of days the small bumps on forehead and nose began to clear but were immediately followed by large red bumps on cheeks. I&#x27;ve never had problems with acne on my cheeks until using this product. This product creates more problems than it fixes plus all of my clothes have bleach marks.</li>
            <li> Ive had redness on my cheeks, nose and chin with mild break out for a few years. I never really cared to take care of myself but my husband needed something for his face. Hes always had problems with pimples, that won&#x27;t pop if u tried. So we bought this and we both saw results. I saw mine within 12 hours of using it which was one treatment! and my husband was a day. When I look at my skin now I never realized it was lacking such a youthful glow. My husbands deep pores are now small with out the black heads. I personally love the way the whole treatment works, the wash isn&#x27;t slimy, it washes off real well. I use the cotton ball for the second step and even though I&#x27;m clean it still get dirt from my face and the lotion is very silky. I love it and i have sensitive skin. The clean and clear burned my face. I was worried this would too but I love it and I&#x27;ve told my sisters so they can have nice skin. They told me they can see a difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and suddenly developed mild/moderate acne on my jawline and chin earlier this year. I&#x27;d cured acne before using natural products, but it took a long time. Embarassed and wanting it gone quickly I took to the internet to find something else to try. I was turned off by Proativ&#x27;s program of reoccuring payments, so I kept searching. AcneFree seemed similar, and had a good price. I&#x27;m generally very wary of internet reviews, everyone always seems way too excited, but the reviews were mostly positive so I picked it up at a local drug store. (I&#x27;ll be buying it on Amazon now because it&#x27;s a little bit cheaper.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sort of scared of acne products after hearing of burning and peeling. But the transition was rather smooth. I peeled a little bit at first, but you kind of have to work the program to what fits best for you. I did it just at night for the first couple of weeks but when I switched to the twice a day regime I took out the toner and everything seemed to be ok. I&#x27;ve been using it a bit over a month and my skin looks great. I still have a few scars of course, but my skin is smooth, the bumps are gone, and I&#x27;ve only had a couple pimples sprout up, but putting a little extra dab of the lotion on it took care of it over night. It&#x27;s really rather amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried to stop using it yet, so I&#x27;m not sure if the acne will come raging back or not as has been reported by a lot of Proactiv users that I&#x27;ve seen. I&#x27;m not willing to take that chance yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled, it&#x27;s not going to give you perfect skin, but it most likely will help your acne, at least if it&#x27;s mild/moderate. I currently wash my face with Desert Essence Thoroughly Clean face wash, then wash with AcneFree&#x27;s face wash. I use the AcneFree lotion next, which does make my face feel tight and dry, so I follow up with Desert Essence daily moisturizer. I only use the AcneFree product on the portions of my face prone to acne to make it last longer. That is part of the reason I use another face wash first, plus you cannot use the acne wash on your eye area. The whole process works great for me. Good luck in finding your acne answer.</li>
            <li> Been using once a day for a few days and I see the difference in the amount of breakouts</li>
            <li> Good, but not as good as proactive. But still a good product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a little over 6 months and am thrilled that Amazon is carrying this for a price better than the \\&quot;big box store\\&quot;!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t follow the rules for the product (daily and nightly) but it has cleared up my skin and kept it clear with only the occasional (and I mean 1 tiny little zit every other month) outbreak. I can completely see the difference when I travel and don&#x27;t take all of the steps - cheating by just taking Step 1 isn&#x27;t enough for a 5 day trip - but as soon as I get home, within 3 days, I&#x27;m back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this and would completely recommend it to anyone! I have even tried the severe (all orange packaging) and found that it works brilliantly to jump start the process of clearing up your face - by about the end of the \\&quot;severe\\&quot; and using it daily (not nightly), my normal skin was starting to dry out which is why I switched to the regular.</li>
            <li> I bought this product and at first thought it was wonderful.  My face cleared up almost overnight.  About a week later my face started to peel, I mysteriously got sick, and my wash clothes and towels were getting \\&quot;bleach\\&quot; spots on them.  After 2 weeks, I decided to discontinue using the product because of the peeling on my face.  My mysterious sickness went away the next day (after 2 weeks, the exact time I been using the product) and my linens were not bleaching themselves out anymore.  I do not recommend that you use this product.</li>
            <li> Product worked great during warm moist months. Now that the dry cold air is here, I am have very itchy dry skin and under eye redness/irritation from the product.</li>
            <li> I tried this for 2 1/2 months and it made my skin worse than it ever was.  I started getting the great big puss filled ones, which I rarely got like that before.  I gave this 2 1/2 months because all the reviews said it would \\&quot;draw\\&quot; out all the bad stuff and may take up to a month before some people see results.  As soon as I stopped and started using my Mary Kay stuff again it then finally started clearing up.  This was a total waste of my money - not to mention how self consious I was because it made my skin worse than it was before!</li>
            <li> I am so fed up with this stuff... i am almost 30 and my face looks like a teenager. I was starting to notice i was getting more acne then i ever had in my life... im pretty certain it was stress related.   Before i started this i just used a simple apricot face wash and my face was always just fine id get one pimple here and there. Sooo After i had these stress pimples popping up i went to the store and grabbed this Acne Free. I have been using it faithfully morning and night for 3-4 weeks now, at first it seemed to be working and then all hell broke loose, im on week 3 of having horrible acne on my cheeks and around my mouth, i have NEVER had acne like this in my entire life! I want to cry. One pimple will clear up and start looking good and another 3 will pop up, I read some reviews and read that you will break out more in the beginning as it cleanses deep in your pores, so i stuck with it thinking ok once they clear out it will work. Well i have had enough there is no way in heck this stuff would take 4 weeks to deep clean, i think its just simply making me break out even more and it will be an endless cycle. I hate Acne Free it has my face looking worse then when i started using it!!!!</li>
            <li> Benzoyl Perx is a drying agent is found in all theee of the products in the clear skin system pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two days the skin looked better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the third day the skin was so dry and cracked it was very painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lotions heavy cream type soak into the dryness faster than you can put it on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are going to try olive oil to return the skin to healthy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have discontined the use of the product and will not purchase again. Nor recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;********************DO NOT BUY OR USE THIS PRODUCT.************************</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used ProActiv, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  I had mild to moderate acne through high school and college and Accutane finally got rid of it.  Several years later, I started getting occasional zits and very small bumps mostly on my forehead.  I thought I&#x27;d give AcneFree a try--it&#x27;s only $20 for goodness&#x27; sake!  I think it will work for some, but not for all.  Like the subject says--JUST TRY IT!  I tried using it twice a day, but it was overdrying.  So now I just use it in the morning and at night I use Neutrogena Foaming Facial Cleanser with makeup remover.  I only use the repair lotion on my T-zone, because my cheeks tend to be much drier than the rest of my face.  AFTER 3 DAYS, my skin totally cleared up.  It&#x27;s almost been 1 month of using it only in the morning and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  This really worked for me and I&#x27;m so glad it&#x27;s relatively cheap!  I say give it a try--obviously it works for some and not for others.  If it doesn&#x27;t work--go see a derm.  And then get Accutane:).</li>
            <li> I def agree with the reviews that i have read that claim it makes your skin worse at first but then makes it better. who ever said it suck all the acne causeing garbage to the surface then gets rid of it was right. my skin did get worse at first but after a few more days I have had and continue to have the best skin i have ever had. Keep using it. I love this product. it&#x27;s been a dumby proof way to improve my skin.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. The first week my skin was really rough (only to the touch, you couldn&#x27;t tell by looking) which worried me, but after some research it turned out just to be my skin adjusting to the benzoil peroxide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been 2 weeks and my skin is pretty much completely clear. I didn&#x27;t have a serious acne problem, but a big \\&quot;i lean on my hand all day at work\\&quot; problem, and this stuff cleared up everything with no \\&quot;red face\\&quot; like i&#x27;ve seen proactive do to lots of people.</li>
            <li> Wow! This actually works! At first nothing changed, for like the first 2 weeks. Then it started getting better and then it really cleared up my skin! It dries your skin up (no peeling, just dry tightness) so make sure you have an outside moisturizer to throw into your routine. I definitely recommend this product :)</li>
            <li> This product has always worked for me and it was at a great low price. Love it!</li>
            <li> I like this system. It keeps my skin clean and free of acne. The only thing i don&#x27;t like is the texture of the cleanser. It is not foaming. It feels more like a lotion; as if i am applying lotion to my face and then rinsing it off.</li>
            <li> Ii&#x27;m fifteen, and used this system exactly as directed (twice a day, morning and night). The toner smells of alcohol, and the other two steps are benzoyl peroxide formulas. Anyway, when I washed, I dispensed a small amount (dime sized), and massaged for about 40-60 seconds. A few days passed, and my pimples and blemishes became more red and irriated and my face itched. I returned it.    If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use this product. If you still want to give it a try, use the Acnefree sensitive skin system instead.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B00070QF20 AcneFree Clear Skin System, 3-Step Kit (Purifying Cleanser, Renewing Toner, Repair Lotion)]]    My daughter and I bought this a few weeks ago. I am 40 and started to get adult acne, I have oily skin inmy T-Zone only . My daughter is 14 and has mild acne but gets stress breakouts.  The first night we used it , it made our skin feel really clean. However by the second night her skin was on fire and itched really bad. My skin was just a little tight and burned a little. She stopped using on the third day cause her skin was red and burning and severly dry. I stopped on the fourth day for the same reasons. I think this may work for some people, but be careful that it is strong and that goes for both the Clear Skin Formula and the Sensitive Skin Formula. We switched to  The Clean and Clear Advantage System  for the last week and it has worked amazing. No more breakouts for either one of us and our skin is very clear, smooth and no drying at all. Highly reccomenet that product for all skin types.</li>
            <li> Acne Free system is the only thing that works on people with serious acne. I&#x27;ve been suffering from acne since the 8th grade. This is the only thing that can get rid of acne. If you do this twice a day you will have clean face. Free from acne. But you still need a cleanser, I recommend something your not allergic to. That will take some trial and error. Probably buy a hyperallergic cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is how I do this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning&lt;br /&gt;Step 1. I use the Acne Free Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Step 2. Wipe my face dry with a fresh paper towel&lt;br /&gt;Step 3. Get a piece of cotton and wipe it down my entire face with the toner or wherever the acne is.&lt;br /&gt;Step 4. Apply the lotion. Your done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night&lt;br /&gt;Step 1. Use a cleanser (not acne free)&lt;br /&gt;Step 2. Acne Free Cleanser&lt;br /&gt;Step 3. Pat dry with paper towel&lt;br /&gt;Step 4. Get a piece of cotton and wipe my face with the toner&lt;br /&gt;Step 5. Apply the lotion&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do a mask once a month. Use spot treatment cream if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Eat clean and exercise. By eating clean I mean no sugar or junk food. That means plain meat with vegetables steam or cooked in the oven. Pasta is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically, No FOODS with FLAVOR. Clean your shower towel once a week. Change you pillow case once a week. Clean your comforter covers once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After you follow this regiment your face should be ACNE FREE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the holy grail of a clean and clear complexion. Follow this regiment every day and you should have a clean face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will save you money from going to dermatologist (doesn&#x27;t work). This product works! Going to put pimple doctors out of business. ;)</li>
            <li> Good Stuff ..You just got to be consistent to see results</li>
            <li> Sucks.  Big time.  Do you want more break outs and a greasy face?  Use this product.  I could almost deal with the fact that none of the products smell particularly nice if they actually worked.  I have break outs where I never had break outs.  I&#x27;m going to try altering my diet; everything else out there seems like a rip off, and I can&#x27;t believe I fell for another one.  I thought I knew better by now.  I guess they call it Acne Free because it gives you just the right conditions for acne to run free all over your face.  I have never had such an increase in acne from a product claiming to treat it.  Proactive didn&#x27;t help me, but at least it didn&#x27;t exacerbate the problem like Acne Free does.  Curse you Acne Free!</li>
            <li> I bought this system yesterday at my local Walmart and let me tell you I am amazed!!!!! Because of the daily stress I get pimples and because of the same stress I tend to pop them and open my skin really bad. My husband is coming for Christmas since he is a soldier and we live apart and I wanted to look beautiful and acne free. My skin looks so much better after just one day of using this system!!! Even the old scars are going away... this product is such a confidence booster. I recommend it to everybody. My husband will be very happy.</li>
            <li> I ordered the free trial pack, and after one day, I woke up the next morning and allready see a difference.  I am 31 years old, my skin isn&#x27;t horrible but I am African American, and when we get a blemish, the dark mark never goes away.  After one day I allready see fading in the pimple,the pimple is starting to flatten, I am ordering the 10 ounce today!</li>
            <li> My skin starting breaking out pretty terribly, worse than it had in years, soon after I got pregnant. Once my dr. gave benzoyle peroxide the \\&quot;OK\\&quot;, I ordered this kit. It has returned my skin to normal - which for me means just a few minor blemishes here and there. I&#x27;m no longer embarrassed!    A downside to all benzoyle products is the bleaching of fabric. I have avoided this so far by switching towels, using the wash only in the shower, and using the lotion only at night with old T-shirts and white sheets. Once a day is half of what&#x27;s recommended, but works for me.     I haven&#x27;t used Proactive in years, but I am at least as pleased with this product now as I was with Proactive as a teen. It&#x27;s VERY similar, and certainly cheaper, esp with Subscribe &amp; Save.</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not good for sensitive skin. When I used it, I could smell bleach in it and it destroyed my complexion. Most of the pimples went away but when I used the so-called \\&quot;Repairing Lotion\\&quot;, it CAUSED more pimples. I put it on my cheek and it was red the next day and I could feel a pimple forming underneath the skin, a cyst-like pimple--the worst kind you can get. The toner contains alcohol, which is too harsh for the skin (Proactiv has an alcohol-free toner) and I got so fed up with it. I stopped using everything after a week because my skin couldn&#x27;t take it anymore. Be sure to test it on your skin before you use it!</li>
            <li> I am 25 years old with slightly oily skin. I have tried many products to clear up my mild to moderate acne.  This product has worked the best.  The benzoyl peroxide in the repair lotion is strong, so I use it once a day, (at night.) In the morning after cleansing and toning, I use Murad anti-aging acne treatment which contains salicylic acid which clears up the pimples that do not clear up with acnefree&#x27;s benzoyl peroxide.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. It burned my face and I had to stop using it, I gave it to my friend and she had the same problem. Unfortunately, my skin was not ACNE FREE until after  I visited my DERMATOLOGIST.</li>
            <li> This was not the item that I ordered. It took to 2 months for me to get my refund and I was charged twice for getting the product mailed. I would not order from Amazon.com again unless I completely understand that I am infact getting the product that I want.</li>
            <li> The packing was not good. I was disappointed at some leaking.</li>
            <li> My daughter began to use it and achieve good results in less than three weeks effectively as I remove the unwanted acne. I got the product right through smiley360 free.</li>
            <li> This product started working from the very beginning and I began to see results less than a week after my first application. I rarely get any acne now after using regularly.     My one suggestion would be to sell the purifying cleanser separately from the 3-part treatment, because I ran out of the cleanser quicker than the toner and moisturizer.     Overall, I solid product and will be buying again for sure!     4.5/5</li>
            <li> I ordered Acne Free thinking it would work on my grandchild who is having trouble with acne on her forehead and nose.  I started using it and I think it actually got worse.  So I ordered what I should have ordered to start with which was Proactive Solution and it is doing a much better job.  So I would not buy Acne Free again.  I am the one that used the product on my grandchild, she is autistic and doesn&#x27;t understand how to do these things, I know that the product was used properly and twice a day as recommeded.                                         Linda DeGrave</li>
            <li> Got this as a free sample from smiley360 and it works amazingly well and cleared up my face in just a matter of days. Made my skin look and feel smooth and helped with the dark spots too! Would recommend this is if you haven&#x27;t tried it!</li>
            <li> I got this for my son.  I decided to try it first.  I used it a total of three times.  The last time I used it was morning.  I got to work and my face was burning.  I noticed it was a bit red in the morning, but was thinking it was the heat from the shower.  I went to the bathroom, washed off my face.  It continued to burn and was red.  I decided not to use it again.  The next morning, it was worse.  It hurt, felt like a horrible sunburn.  My face was swollen, eyelids swollen, bright red, burned and hurt really bad.  I put cortizone on it.  Finally I called them.  They wanted my info to give to their insurance.  I asked if there was anything I could do to help with the burning, etc.  They acted like I was stupid and said, put lotion on your face...tried that, it burned worse (even with cetaphil lotion).  Finally, I decided to go to the doctor.  They said I had chemical burns on my face.  I had totally followed directions.  Wound up getting a steroid shot and said to continue with cortizone.  It has now been almost 4 days since I last used it and still burn and am red as a beet.      Do not recommend this at all![[ASIN:B00070QF20 AcneFree Clear Skin Treatments, 3-Step Kit- (Purifying Cleanser, Renewing Toner, Repair Lotion), 10 Ounces]]</li>
            <li> I have mild to moderate acne and I have tried many different products on my face. Proactive was one of them. Proactiv didn&#x27;t work for me. Maybe I was impatient and didn&#x27;t use it long enough, but I got frustrated and wanted to try something else. My cousin told me about Acne Free and I decided to try it. After using it for about a week I noticed some changes. The redness was starting to go away and the big bumps that hurt started to go down and dry up. My skin also got very dry and started to peel which was already expected from an acne product. My skin may actually be a little sensitve for this product, but I just used another moisturizer along with the 3 step system. After about a month of using it, my skin looked completely clear, something I had not seen in a couple of years. This system may not work for everyone, but I encourage anyone battling acne to at least give it try. You have nothing to lose but $20. I know- you work hard for your money and that&#x27;s $20 you could have had in your pocket if it doesn&#x27;t work... but what if it DOES work? You can have your beautiful skin and your confidence back. Just give it try. It just might work for you.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a male who got adult acne at age 29.  I never had any acne breakouts before, even as a teen (seldom got even the occasional zit).  Out of nowhere, it seemed, my entire forehead and cheeks (just under my eyes) had broken out with what appeared to be the smallest whiteheads I&#x27;d ever seen (hundreds).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of \\&quot;dealing\\&quot; with the problem, I finally determined it wouldn&#x27;t go away on its own.  I tried some products my Sephora-obsessed girlfriend recommended, including Murad and others, but the situation did not improve...at all.  What I began to notice was that these were all salicylic acid-based products (maybe one or two were sulpher-based).  After weeks of frustration, I began reading online about my options, and it quickly appeared that a benzoyl peroxide-based solution would be preferable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to my local Walgreens and came across the University Medical products, both this version and the severe version in the orange bottles.  I bought the white bottles, and gave them a whirl.  After a day or two, I remember the problem areas looked considerably worse, like the product provoked the creation of additional, itsy bitsy whiteheads.  Sucking gunk out of my pores???  Probably another day went by and the situation improved dramatically.  By the forth day, I couldn&#x27;t believe how much better my skin looked.  After a week, I was absolutely thrilled.  I probably stopped using the product at that point, and then a week or two later, my skin had mostly healed completely from the havoc created over the previous months.  The whiteheads came back almost a year later.  I tried the orange bottles (\\&quot;severe\\&quot; variety) with similar success.  After a few days, problem solved.  Just a few months ago....you get the idea.  It looks like I need to pick up a package of the white or orange bottles (doesn&#x27;t seem to make much difference to me which) about once a year and use for a few days.  I never remember following the directions well- I&#x27;d use the product once per day instead of twice, and never for the recommended duration (2 weeks???).  The last time I used this stuff I came the closest, since I applied the system once per day for probably 10-12 days.  I can&#x27;t possibly recommend the University Medical products enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel bad for not leaving a review three years ago earlier...of twice, and never for the recommended duration (2 weeks???).  The last time I used this stuff I came the closest, since I applied the system once per day for probably 10-12 days.  I can&#x27;t possibly recommend the University Medical products enough.    I feel bad for not leaving a review three years ago earlier...</li>
            <li> The product made a vast improvement for my skin for about a month.  I&#x27;m waiting to see if it will continue to help for a second month.  I like the results so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a 25 year old white male with very fair skin. However it isn&#x27;t sensitive skin. This product worked really well for me, and not only for break outs of acne. It may help you with several different conditions. Rosacea, acne, pimples etc. I paid $30 for it a few months ago when I was having a really bad breakout and have never regretted it. Give it a try, it will probably help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two years and love the results. This system works very well for my skin. I have adult acne in the T-zone area and often get deep, painful pimples without this treatment.     A couple of tips to make sure this works for you:  1. Be very consistent. You have to wash you face every morning and every night with the cleanser and use the lotion afterwards. I find the toner can be more irritating so I use it sparingly, especially in the winter when my skin is dry.   2. Give the product time to work. It took two months of consistent use for me to achieve completely clear skin but from there on after, I might get a tiny pimple every 3 or 4 months that disappears within a few days.   3. There will be irritation as your skin adjusts to the product. For me, it was worth the sacrifice to be pimple free. My skin adjusted within two weeks. If I start to feel irritation, I back off the toner.</li>
            <li> The facial cleanser (Step 1) is a little more water-y than other generic Proactiv&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used. Seems to work okay.</li>
            <li> I have mild acne that I have been dealing with for years - I&#x27;ve tried Proactiv as well as many other products so when I saw this I thought it might work and liked that it costs much less. I soon learned there is a reason why it costs less - about the only thing this product did was dry out my skin and bleach my wash cloth. It didn&#x27;t even begin to clear my skin and I&#x27;ve almost used all of each bottle. I will not be purchasing this again - go to Target or a similar store and get some of the bigger named cleasners, they will work just as well as this stuff.</li>
            <li> I got this product for my daughter but it was to strong for her skin. So I started to use it. It works and it has three easy steps.</li>
            <li> Product works well. It&#x27;s not as good as proactive but it does&lt;br /&gt;almost as well, and for the price it&#x27;s a better deal for me personally.&lt;br /&gt;I do not have any problems with it drying out my skin.</li>
            <li> I was in the cosmetic aisle at my local Shop Rite and I was looking through the skin care section because my skin has started to rebel.  I can usually use anything and still have perfect skin.  I had looked at AcneFree in the past and decided not to get it, as then i didn&#x27;t have acne.  This stuff is a miracle worker.  This is truly a dupe of Proactiv, but you can still use it if your skin isn&#x27;t super greasy (mine isn&#x27;t).  The cleanser doesn&#x27;t lather, which is okay but the amount of micro-beads packed in makes up for it.  It is constant amazing exfoliation, unlike other exfoliating cleansers.  The toner has witch hazel in it which is good for healing acne and acne scars.  The toner also has vitamins and minerals in it.  The treatment lotion is chockful of Benzoyl Peroxide and will not make your skin feel dry.  It made my skin feel really smooth.  I do this twice a day.  Since I got it at my Shop Rite, it came with a free Acne and Blackhead Terminator.  I love this stuff and the next thing I want to try is their Sulfur mask.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I switched over from Proactive to AcneFree. To me it seems likes the product works much better. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin dry like Proactive did and it&#x27;s so much cheaper too. I use to pay around $45 for Proactive where I now only pay $12 through the amazon subscribe and save option for AcneFree! You get the exact same amount as you would with Proactive for each step and you use it exactly the same way. Honestly, I don&#x27;t know how Proactive is still in business after AcneFree came out, it&#x27;s 1000x better and cheaper.</li>
            <li> I found this to be far more effective than Proactiv.  I did have to go to a dermatologist and get stronger medicine, but for OTC, best stuff I tried.</li>
            <li> In the last few years I started suffering terrible skin breakouts.I  want to say that after using it  I have already noticed that my skin is more calm and clean. It feels better and it actually looks better. it has cleared up most my acne and i have only been using it for a couple weeks. Since I&#x27;ve been using it  and haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts, and the red spots from my old acne are even fading without the fade cream. The best part is, I&#x27;m wearing way less make-up! &amp;#34;I received this as a  free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Best product for problem skin. Great price, super fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I was shopping in walmart and came across this after thinking about buying proactiv for about a month. I thoroughly thought before i put it in my cart on whether i should just buy the proactiv like i always do, but thought what the heck. My problem isn&#x27;t really acne i get little breakouts here and there but the real problem is the blemishes that make my face look several different ugly colors. Proactiv is the ONLY thing that has worked for me in the past so since this brand swore their product was comparable (as it was cheaper) i gave in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a week... NOTHING has changed as i could usually see results using proactiv within 2 days! I even used a brand new clean face exfoliator with the cleanser to see if that would do the trick.. Nothing. It just has not done nothing for my face at all and i think i&#x27;m breaking out even more to be honest. So i&#x27;m just gonna chalk it up and buy the proactiv and hopefully my face clears up some before thanksgiving! It was worth the try for $16 but it just didn&#x27;t do the trick. The cleanser didn&#x27;t have any type of exfolating microbeads in it as advertised either.</li>
            <li> has use it for a while. the result is fairy good. at least it decreases oil on my face and less new pimple so far. i think i&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
            <li> I bought the rosacea redness relief formula and that was the only  product that would keep my rosacea at bay if I used it daily! Please to the powers that be bring that formula back!!! This formula isn&#x27;t as effective on the rosacea! :(</li>
            <li> I purchased Acne Free at a pharmacy and it ran me 4 dollars more so purchasing on line was less expensive than buying it locally. additionally I must admit this product works as well as  Proactive, for me anyway and, at a fraction of the cost.  Thank you for making such a terrific product. Blemishes that begin to erupt just disappear after a day or two of applying Acne Free.</li>
            <li> I have dealt with super oily, very acne-prone skin for thirty years, and I honeslty didn&#x27;t expect the kind of great results that I have achieved with this product line.  These are the ONLY products I have ever used that have actually impacted the oiliness of my face.  I didn&#x27;t think anything could ever help control the oil on my forehead, but I literally don&#x27;t even get a shiny film on my face at all during the entire day when I use these products.  And not one blemish in the three weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.  That is quite a statement.  It will take your skin a little while to get used to the continuous delivery benzoyl peroxide, but I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past 7 years, it is the best product out there (in my opinion).  I have used Clearasil, Nutragena, Noxzema, and Oxy-Clean; none of those products even compare to the results that I have received with AcneFree.  The only down-side is that when I have skipped a day of using it, I had break-outs within a day or two of skipping it.  My acne has always been pretty bad (I am currently 25). I usually break-out along my forehead, on and around my nose, and my chin.  My skin is oily when I do not use this product. When I use it daily my face is clear and I get many compliments on my complexion.  Every now-and-then I will see this product at BJ&#x27;s (wholesale store), it&#x27;s only $15 and twice the normal size (8oz of step 1 &amp; 2, 4 oz of step 3).  I stock-up when I find it there because that is much cheaper than the usual $20/box for half of the size.  It is very important to use all three steps.  Sometimes when I was in a rush, I have only used the wash (step 1), and I later broke-out.  The 3-step formula works excellent if you use all three steps once a day (twice a day, morning and night, if it is REALLY bad).  The first time I purchased this product I started to notice results in 3 days, just as it was advertised.  Around day 6 or 7 I started getting compliments from my co-workers about how clear and bright my complexion was.  I have tried different, cheaper, products with the same active ingredients, but I have not seen the same results.  I do not usually write reviews; this is my first one. I hope this review has helped.  Try it, use it as directed (all three steps, very important, if you do not use all three as directed then the formula is not effective, again, very important). It is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> My complexion started going downhill when I moved to a new state...new water, new air... I started getting lots of small acne on my chin and a few large, deep acne spots on my chin and on my cheeks. I could wash my face 10 times a day and never see any visible results. If anything, my complexion was getting worse, not better.     Bought the Acnefree system on a whim on my last trip to Walmart. After four days of using this product, nearly all of the small acne on my chin are gone, and the larger acne have diminished in size quite significantly. Also, any redness caused by the acne has also disappeared, and my skin tone is even and healthy looking.    My only complaint about the product is the burning, redness and swelling it has caused to the sensitive skin underneath my eyes. To be fair though, the warning on the package clearly states to keep the product away from the eyes. I just need to do a better job, I suppose.    Fantastic product! Convenient and affordable to boot!</li>
            <li> I never write reviews for products, but realized reviews are mainly what I use to gauge the effectiveness of a product, especially on amazon.com. So I felt the need to review this product to provide some insight to prospective buyers. First off, I want to start by saying I used to use proactive twice a day. It worked wonders for my skin. I do not have severe acne, I do not even have moderate acne most of the time, so I would say I am somewhere between light-moderate acne level. Getting back to my story, I loved proactive. I know everyone doesn&#x27;t share my point of view here, but I think proactive is a quality product at a high price. But you really do get what you pay for with this product. That was also the problem, I was getting sick of paying the equivalent of a phone bill for a acne medication system monthly, so I sadly cancelled my order of proactive mostly due to price, as well as a feeling that I no longer needed it since my skin cleared up. I was wrong. My skin didn&#x27;t break out overnight, but gradually it kept getting worse. So I thought about renewing my order with proactive, but man this stuff is pricey! I looked up reviews of other treatments, and saw a brand \\&quot;exposed\\&quot; that received many good reviews. This order however was even more expensive! I am a guy out on his own paying his own bills and am on an extremely tight budget, I couldn&#x27;t justify spending $50,$40, even $30 a month on a skin product, even though I wish I had the money so I could. Then I saw acnefree at Walgreens. Before I buy anything, I review it extensively, to make sure I get the most for my money. There are mixed reviews on this product. When I saw acnefree claimed to work better than proactive, and reminding me of how well proactive worked for me, I had to give this stuff a try. So I went out and bought it for $20. I could have bought it cheaper, but my face was looking terrible and It was an emergency! So I spent the few extra bucks for the convenience of instant use. My experience with this product has been a very positive one. I use as recommended twice a day, all three steps. It reminds me of proactive, but for me, works even better. A terrible breakout has cleared up within just two days of use, and the bright redness I have grown to loathe has been reduced drastically. Acnefree, at less than half the cost of proactive, is simply amazing. It is a superb quality item at a price that simply cannot be beat. I couldn&#x27;t honestly say I recommend this to everyone because everyone&#x27;s skin is different. What works for some may not work for others. But I CAN recommend this product to anyone who is sick of paying a ton of $ on a skincare kit. You could be paying less than half the cost, you should give this a shot. If proactive works or has worked for you in the past, I recommend this product. If you have somewhat oily skin and light-moderate acne like I do, I suggest this product. So this is my honest review of a product that I am very happy with and wanted to share my experience with anyone that was looking at this product and was thinking about giving it a try. Acnefree has saved me money, works well with my skin type (somewhat oily), and offers a quality product. For these reasons, I gladly recommend this product to others in hopes it will give them the same results.</li>
            <li> i have been using this product for a month.if you dont have any skin problem it&#x27;s easy to clean normal face.but if you have oily face,never use it.it wont work.lotion makes your face shiney.it doesnt clean black heads deeply.but i can say it is enough for young age.</li>
            <li> I did not use the product on myself but on my boyfriend.  He had blood cyst pimples over his entire back for 15 years (since puberty).  He has tried many medications, topical and pill, but everything irritated him.  We did not want to spend the money on ProActiv, so a friend recommended this product.  He used the soap twice a day, and I applied the toner and lotion after each shower.  We did not see immediate, overly obvious results in a week.  The results came gradually but steadily.  After using the product for over two months nonstop, his back was almost completely acne free.  He went from having over 40 blood cysts that would infect and stain his shirts and the bed to having maybe 2 or 3 pimples at a time.  Even his mother was amazed with the results when she saw him after several months.  He said his skin did itch if he did not have the lotion applied properly on his skin.  A result of applying acid to your skin is that the skin dries out.  We had to make sure that he always had plenty of lotion applied to his skin.  After 6 months, we stopped using all three steps.  He now only uses the soap (purifying cleanser) once a day, and he has maybe 1 or 2 pimples at a time.  The solution doesn&#x27;t rid your body of acne permanently, but if you are consistent and dedicated, it will remove most of your acne.  We have been using this product for almost two years and are very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> Better and more gentle than Pro-Activ. Saw results in about a week. Try it and see what it does. The Toner doesn&#x27;t sting and its not sticky like most acne toners. Best buy for the price.</li>
            <li> I switched from Proactiv to this product because I was curious after reading some of the reviews. And I am really glad I gave it a try. My skin has gotten even better with fewer breakouts and more even texture.</li>
            <li> used to use this when they had organic ingredients (1st listed ingredient was aloe vera) and it worked! it made my face perfect. i never broke out again....until they changed the formula. now it&#x27;s nothing but chemicals and it&#x27;s made my skin break out terrible. so i quit using it. now i can&#x27;t find anything to clear it up perfectly. shame</li>
            <li> My daughter used this faithfully for four weeks with very little noticeable change in her forehead acne. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> great product... working wonderfully for me</li>
            <li> This product worked much better than I thought it would. I was a ProActiv user before trying this product, but this is a lot less expensive and works just as well!</li>
            <li> I started using Proactiv several years ago. I loved the way it cleared up my acne and made my skin feel, but didn&#x27;t love the high price tag that came with it. Upon the recommendation of a friend, I decided to try this Acnefree Clearing System. Alas, after only a couple of weeks usage, my skin started breaking out again. I decided to give it a little more time, but after using it for a full month, I was getting acne breakouts consistently. That&#x27;s when I decided to return to Proactiv. It&#x27;s unfortunate because this system is so much cheaper than Proactiv, but it just does not work for me. Maybe it has something to do with one&#x27;s skin, because I see where a number of people have had success with this product, while others, like myself, did not.</li>
            <li> I have been using acne free for about a year now and had fantastic results but it eventually plateaued at a certain point it gets a lot better and then it stops and doesnt get better than that, i am now taking something internal \\&quot; acne relief\\&quot; vitamins with acne free as well see how that goes &#x3D;) . Acne free does dry out your skin A LOT so it is good to use a moisturizer as a fourth step. People who are sensitive to benzyl peroxide should probably stay away from this product and try something less harsh.</li>
            <li> I just use the #3 repair lotion, and nothing I found is better.</li>
            <li> As a person who is in his mid-late 20&#x27;s who has struggled with acne for most of my life, I have some information that may be useful as I have researched and tried everything, including prescriptions.    If a person is sensitive to Benzoyl Peroxide, you should not use this product. With all Benzoyl Peroxide products, it will irritate the skin of anybody sensitive to it.  This doesn&#x27;t exactly mean that you have sensitive skin, but that you are sensitive to this medication.  You would also have this problem with other over the counter medications containing this drug.    Now to the good stuff.      Read and follow the instructions.  Step 1 is the cleanser, so massage it into your face and wash it off.  Step 2 is the toner, so apply it with a cotton PAD (not a BALL).  After the toner has dried, apply step 3 with another cotton pad in a LIGHT layer.    Now for the final step which is on the step 3 bottle as a recommendation.  I&#x27;d actually consider this a requirement.  USE AN SPF MOISTURIZER.  I use Neutrogena&#x27;s oil-free moisturizer with SPF-15.  This is going to greatly reduce any redness and dryness. You will probably be sorry if you do not use a moisturizer with this as Benzoyl Peroxide is very drying and irritating.  The step 3 lotion is not a moisturizer.    Again, read and follow the instructions and use a moisturizer.  I can only speak from experience, but following this method will give you the most amount of effectiveness and the least amount of side effects.</li>
            <li> Background:  I&#x27;m writing this review for my brother, since i ordered this for him to use.  He is Asian, in his mid 20s&#x27;, who is suffering from severe adult acne all over his lower cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Products that he&#x27;s tried, but did not work:&lt;br /&gt;Clearasil Daily Pore Cleansing Pad&lt;br /&gt;Clearasil Skin Perfecting Wash (This product actually worked for 6 months, but afterwards, he started breaking out once more).&lt;br /&gt;Acne Free Clear Skin System 3-step Kit (this did not work at all, it made him break out even more, this was after a week of using this product.  I&#x27;m not trying to bad mouth this product, this is just an individual review).&lt;br /&gt;Acne Free Severe Acne Treatment (this also did not work at all, even though the acid in this product was a higher percentage)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The new recent product that he is using now (Glytone Acne) is actually working.  He&#x27;s been using it for 2 weeks now, there are no new acne breakouts.  So far so good.  I believe you need a prescription for this.  If you haven&#x27;t tried this and everything else did not work for u, you might want to give this a try.  Good Luck!</li>
            <li> It works really well! The severe acne version of this is a little harsh, and dried out my skin, but this stuff does the job without the peeling. Just make sure if you&#x27;re stressed to use it twice a day, otherwise it&#x27;s fine to use it once per day.</li>
            <li> this actually works well and clears your face in 48 hours. But fact is that it gives too much redness and sometimes hurts on the skin so I will advice u to not use it everyday as it says u should, but try using it three times a week or so</li>
            <li> This item is not for me, but I always buy it for a family member. For years, I use to buy him Proactiv (which cost me $50 each system), but I wanted a cheaper alternative so I sought out other products with the same active ingredients as Proactiv. Well, this is definitely comparable to Proactiv, but is less expensive. He has been using it for years and it is a staple in his facial regimen.</li>
            <li> so, i wanted proactive but it&#x27;s pricey. so i started using Klear action - it was great! but they stopped selling it at the drug store, so i started getting acne free instead. and it relaly doesn&#x27;t work... klear action is much better</li>
            <li> I developed mild acne after deciding to go off of my regular birth control pill.  Never having acne before, this was devistating.  I watched all the infomercials and decided to go with Murad&#x27;s Acne Complex Kit expecting the glowing, perfect skin that they promised within a few short weeks.  I purchased the starter kit and I liked the smell of the products but after a month and a half, I was still experiencing bad breakouts.  I even had the really painful acne that are so deep it takes weeks for them to come to the surface!  I continued to use the second shipment of Murad because everything I read said that the purging cycle could take 4 or more weeks.  I spent 3 months and over $60 on this stuff without results.  Silly me, I was going to order more but I started reading reviews for my only alternative, Proactiv.  Now that stuff isn&#x27;t any cheaper in the long run but someone else mentioned Acne Free in their review and I figured that it was worth a try.  I found it at my local Walreens for $19.  Let me tell you, I used Acne Free for 2, TWO, days and saw results that I had not seen in 3 months of using the expensive stuff.  I can&#x27;t say enough about it.  I&#x27;m thrilled that something so easy to get would work so much better than any hyped up product.  Goes to show, don&#x27;t buy from T.V.</li>
            <li> I started using this product almost a year ago.  I have been very happy.  My skin is smoother, black heads and white heads are gone and I seldom have pimples ... something I used to get monthly!</li>
            <li> I understand that certain products work different on different people.  But this is the ONLY product that worked for me!  I tried Proactive and numerous other products.  This product cleared my skin and improved my skin tone/complexion.  It is worth a try if everything else has failed you.  It may just work for you the way it did for me and other people!</li>
            <li> I have purchased this from the same store over and over and several times the wash and/or lotion will be a different texture, color, and consistency than it normally is. I have called to complain before since this different mix is not as effective or sometimes causes worse results (skin burns, dry skin, etc). I was told they are constantly tweaking their product to see what people like best. I told them they need to do research studies then instead of changing an already released product every now and again. If it&#x27;s selling then obviously people like it. It happened several times after and now their site says the reason is b/c they use two different factories and sometimes the settings are a little off. You&#x27;d think that being this big of a company they would 1)-Have their stories straight; and 2)-KNOW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. Do they not have any kind of quality control at all? Understand the ONLY reason I use this product is b/c it does work and is readily available at most stores, but if Proactive were available at the same places for the same price or close to it I would switch in a heartbeat. It does work, but not without frustrations.     Also, do not listen to the directions as far as the amounts to use. It will take you a few times to understand how much wash, toner, and lotion to use so you use all 3 bottles equally. And don&#x27;t follow their advice of putting the lotion on a cotton round. That&#x27;s the smallest bottle in there and clearly those morons think we&#x27;re dumb enough to fall for that so we&#x27;ll have to order a more expensive bottle of lotion online to make up for the loss absorbed by the cotton round.</li>
            <li> Great results but a little harsh on the skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always taken excellent care of my skin, and had mild acne. When I started a new BC pill, my skin went haywire! Before giving up on the pill, I added AcneFree to my skin care regimen. I saw results in a just a few days. After 3 weeks of using it, my skin is clear. Yes, I still get some blackheads, but I can live with that. This is my 2nd time using AcneFree. The 1st time I didn&#x27;t have the same results. BUT!! I&#x27;ve learned a lot in a few years about skin care and I&#x27;d like to share.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, there is no miracle skin care product. Since everyone&#x27;s skin is different, you will see different results. If you find a product that clears most of your acne, then stick with it. We can all live with a few zits.&lt;br /&gt;Second, develop a skin care routine that works for you and be religious about it! It&#x27;s so important to wash your face, especially at night to rid it of the toxins you&#x27;ve collected from the day.&lt;br /&gt;Third, STOP PICKING YOUR SKIN! I&#x27;ve learned that squeezing zits only makes them worse and spreads bacteria to other parts of the face.&lt;br /&gt;Forth, oil control. The witch hazel in AcneFree doesn&#x27;t strip your skin of natural oils, which ultimately makes more oil!&lt;br /&gt;Added TIP: Change your pillow case every other night, trust me, it helps.&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck :)</li>
            <li> I tried this product as a less expensive alternative to the Proactiv system. I was very disappointed. The face wash was creamy and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling very clean, while the repairing lotion was gritty and had to be applied with a cotton ball. With the Proactiv system it&#x27;s the opposite - the face wash is gritty and the repairing lotion is smooth. I used this for 3-4 days. While I didn&#x27;t have any negative reactions as some did, I also didn&#x27;t see any improvement. I have always had much better results with the Proactiv System. Do your skin and yourself a favor -- buy the Proactiv (or Burt&#x27;s Bees) Acne System instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****UPDATE 5/1/2011****&lt;br /&gt;No, I am not in cahoots with Proactiv, nor was I when I wrote this review in 2006. Also, I did apply the cleanser, toner, and repairing cream in the correct order. In 2006, the product was formulated in such a way that the cleanser WAS NOT gritty but the repairing cream WAS gritty. As such, I found the repairing cream uncomfortable and difficult to apply (not to mention counterintuitive). I was reading a few of the more recent reviews and apparently this company has changed it&#x27;s formula to where the cleanser is now gritty and the repairing cream is not. This is a much needed improvement. However, I will not be purchasing it again since my first experience with it was negative, and also, as stated originally, this product did not work as well as Proactiv in clearing up my acne. This just was not the product for me! :)</li>
            <li> This kit did not work at all. I have a couple of pimples here and there and my skin was pretty clear. I used this and my skin suddenly began breaking out like mad.  I do not reccomend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This stuff totally dried my face out, even with the lotion, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was using proactive but eventually tried Acne Free because it&#x27;s much cheaper. After using the product for 2 months my face has broken out the worst it ever has. I get huge cyst like pimples. I&#x27;m switching back to proactive.</li>
            <li> I bought this product from a store and began to use it.  While it did nothing for my skin, I noticed it did a number on my clothes.  It ruined numerous shirts.  Definitly a bad buy for any amount of money.</li>
            <li> Face is really dry after using it for a week, but my face is clear</li>
            <li> Hi. I am 16 years old, and ever since I started breaking out in pimples this year, I&#x27;ve started to feel so self concious. And soo I read some testimonials on Acne Free, and I was started to feel hopeful, sooo i went and bought it at the local drug store (walgreens) i was almost hoping that after 3 days i would see a difference but i saw nothing, after 2 weeks my face was pretty much the same, but my face wasn&#x27;t as red, but i still had a bunch of pimples. it&#x27;s been 4 weeks maybe 5 im not quite sure, and ive gotten new pimples, some that have gone and some that have stayed. im really disappointed. i really thought that this was gonna be the one product that would work.i will still continue to use it for awhile and if it continues to fail, i am defintely gonna try proactiv..i mean afterall proactiv says not to buy cheap imitations..but i really hope that acne free will work, even if it&#x27;s taking forever for me to see RESULTS!!!</li>
            <li> I have used Proactive for a long time and it definitely works!  But when i saw AcneFree, i decided to try it.  Five mintues after using this product, my entire face became red and i felt like my face was burning!  I do not have sensitive skin and was very suprised when this happened. Still, i decided to continue to try it for 3 days.  3 days later, my acne hadn&#x27;t changed and my face had begun to peel!  Proactive has never done this, and in my opinion i think Proactive works much better!  If you have decided to switch from Proactive to AcneFree, DON&#x27;T!!  It isn&#x27;t worth it!  Just stick with Proactive!!</li>
            <li> Ok..I have seen some stupid reviews like &#x27;OOOH my acne got worse!! It must be the ACNE FREE product!!&#x27;.  It IS the acnefree product.  What it does is sucks the acne deep down in your skin to the surface so you can then wash it away when it comes up.  THAT&#x27;S ALL.  Gah..stupid people..    But this product is amazing.  My skin got a little dry and rough, BUT my sister(who is a dermatologist) and brother both who used it said it is JUST your skin getting used to it.  THAT&#x27;s IT.  Do NOT STOP USING IT.  It will work.  I saw major results in a week.  It is better than Proactiv, me being a past user of proactiv.</li>
            <li> I only used it for 4 days, and it made my skin worse than it began with. I have been having a lot of acne recently and I thought that this product would help me, but when I applied the cleanser to my face, it felt itchy, burning, and it did not feel smooth at all. It felt like little beads stinging at my face. The same is true with the lotion. After those 4 days, I started noticing my skin flaking off!!! My face was so dry. White stuff was hanging off my chin and cheeks. This never happened to any of the other products I used to treat acne. So, I had to buy extra moisturizing products just to fix this problem. A big waste of money.</li>
            <li> I started using AcneFree about six months ago to deal with a sudden onset of adult acne.  My breakouts were not \\&quot;severe\\&quot; but I was suffering from both regular acne and some very noticeable cystic and nodular acne that I couldn&#x27;t seem to get rid of through other means.  I never had more than 1-2 cysts/nodes at any time, but they would be very red and painful -- and every time one healed, a new one would develop in a different place.  I tried a number of different types of face wash, but none of them seemed to work, so I resorted to AcneFree without much hope in its effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first few weeks of using AcneFree, my regular acne disappeared right away.  However, it took a lot longer to get rid of the cystic and nodular acne - probably about four months or so.  During that time, I just kept following the steps as instructed, eventually making changes to the routine as noted below.  Over time, the cysts and nodes seemed to heal faster and appear less frequently, until one day, they were gone.  I&#x27;m glad to say that the product really works.  I have been acne free for about two months now.  Every so often I will see a red patch or irritation that looks like it might develop into a blemish, but those fade within a day or two without ever developing into pimples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first month of use, I did notice a lot of flakiness and what appeared to be sensitive, chemical burns on my neck (from the benzoyl peroxide).  Whenever that happened, I stopped using the product for a day or two, and moisturized religiously until my skin recovered.  As my skin got used to the product, those symptoms disappeared entirely.  I am not sure if I would recommend this product to people with sensitive skin, but if you can handle the benzoyl peroxide and you have stubborn acne, this is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes on using the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(1) When using the cleanser during Step 1, I massage it into my skin for at least 30 seconds before rinsing it off, so that it has time to penetrate the surface.  It&#x27;s especially important to hit the spots that you aren&#x27;t going to use repair lotion on, so those areas can some daily exposure to the benzoyl peroxide medication.  I noticed that when I didn&#x27;t do this, I would occasionally get acne where I didn&#x27;t expect it, since I wasn&#x27;t using the repair lotion on those areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(2) Early on, I found that the skin toner runs out very quickly and the high alcohol content sometimes stung and dried out my skin.  Now, I use Thayer&#x27;s Witch Hazel for Step 2 instead of the AcneFree toner.  Thayer&#x27;s is alcohol free, inexpensive right here on Amazon, and much gentler on my skin.  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(3) I still use repair lotion on \\&quot;trouble areas\\&quot; even though I don&#x27;t have any acne at this point.  I find that applying the lotion to those acne-prone areas keeps any new blemishes from forming.  Preventative care is much better than dealing with acne once it develops!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(4) At night, I skip Step 3 and instead use Neutrogena Anti-Blemish, Anti-Wrinkle cream.  It&#x27;s got retinol and salicylic acid, which help keep my skin clear but don&#x27;t run the risk of bleaching out my sheets and pillowcases.  It also gives my skin a break from the benzoyl peroxide, which I think has helped with my prior sensitivity to BP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** 12/30/2011 UPDATE:  It&#x27;s been about six months since my original review, and my skin is still smooth and completely acne-free.  This product really works wonders.  Not only does it keep the blemishes away, but the witch hazel keeps my face looking fresh and even colored.  Family and friends have even commented; even though I&#x27;ve never had much acne, they&#x27;ve noticed that my skin looks much smoother and more radiant than before.  I only wish that AcneFree also faded some reddish spots which stubbornly remain, but I may try their fading cream to see if that works.te the surface.

            <li> Excellent!!! A great way to shop... I recomended for everyone. You get what you want without moving from ypur home</li>
            <li> I used ProActiv for about 8 years. It worked great for me compared to what my skin was like beforehand. However, I still broke out during certain times of the month. The high cost and bad business of ProActiv turned me off. When I saw so many people say that AcneFree works better than ProActiv, I decided to give it a try. I found that it does work better than ProActiv, and at (at least) half the cost. I still get a pimple or two from time to time, but not the breakouts I used to get even while I was on ProActiv. When I do get pimples, they aren&#x27;t the huge painful ones but the smaller ones which usually disappear within a day or two. There is no reason for me to ever go back to ProActiv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 07/17/15: I don&#x27;t remember when I posted this review but I have been using this stuff as part of my daily routine for years now and it continues to work just as well. It is such a necessity for me. If I skip a day or go too long without using it, I break out again, that&#x27;s how I know that it&#x27;s doing what it is supposed to be doing. I&#x27;m so thrilled to see the price has gone down even further, I just wish this was available for Amazon subscribe! Also, this is such a minor complaint, but I always seem to end up with way more toner than the cleanser and the lotion! I usually run out of the cleanser first, then the lotion, and the toner a long time after. I don&#x27;t know if other people have this experience.</li>
            <li> I have always used clearasil face wash and face pads along with zapzyt, just b/c it always seemed to work the best out of everything else.  But I was still breaking out and my skin would get really oily.  I have very sensitive and finicky skin w/ moderate break-outs.  I&#x27;ve always wanted my skin to be blemish free, so I would try a bunch of different products and regimens.  Neutrogena, Clean &amp; Clear acne fighting kit, clearasil advanced, and a bunch more.  All of them would either result in A) Me breaking out WAY more (even though I would wait a few weeks in case my skin just needed to get use to the product), or B) Would dry out my skin and be very painful/uncomfortable.  A few months ago, I was thinking about doing ProActive and I was looking at reviews and a few people that seemed similar to me said that it didn&#x27;t work for them and some of them suggested AcneFree.  I didn&#x27;t want to waste any more money on stuff that would make my skin worse and then just sit under my sink forever because I couldn&#x27;t use it.  I looked at reviews for AcneFree and saw a lot of success stories for people with moderate-to-severe acne so I went out during my lunch break and picked up the regular AcneFree Clear Skin System.  It is AMAZING!  Usually toners dry out my skin, but this one doesn&#x27;t at all.  I only use the toner once a day though, instead of twice.  I didn&#x27;t have the initial \\&quot;break-out-alot\\&quot; issue when I first started using it.  I&#x27;ve noticed a HUGE difference.  If I do get a pimple (and it&#x27;s usually from me being bad and not washing my face every once in a while), it goes away within a day after using the products.  And since using it, I&#x27;ve never gotten one of those painful boil-type blemishes that I use to get.  The bottles look smaller but they last for a ~2months.  I&#x27;m really glad I found this, it&#x27;s helped my confidence and my comfort (no more painful acne!).  Just a tip for the ladies, I also found that it really helps to wipe your make-up off with non-scented baby wipes ormake-up remover wipes before washing your face.  I do think that different products work for different individuals, but this one worked for me.  I really recommend that you at least try it.</li>
            <li> Not as good, and it&#x27;s such a shame because Proactiv is overpriced and has awful customer service and an oppressive subscription program.  I believe AcneFree could easily do the job, but they miss the boat on an important element: exfoliation.  The cleanser is an awful gel-like formulation, with next to no exfoliation beads.  This is the biggest thing Proactiv does right, with the perfect amount of gentle exfoliation that actually removes skin cells gently and leaves the skin looking and feeling great.  Oily skin&#x27;s propensity to not slough off correctly, leading to pore blockage, buildup, and inflammation, is a primary cause of acne, and this product stupidly ignores it completely.  Benzoyl peroxide is somewhat harsh, but very effective, and is the key ingredient in both the AcneFree and Proactiv systems.  This product could be such a cheap alternative to Proactiv, but they are blindly missing the boat.  Is anybody home over there?????  Put some darn mild abrasives in your cleanser, would ya?</li>
            <li> I am writing to thank everyone who posted their experiences here. As an adult acne sufferer it is easy to become hopeless- even when you&#x27;re starting to see changes but they aren&#x27;t coming fast enough. In this case, I needed encouragement to be patient and wait for the changes that were in store. I&#x27;ve been using Acnefree every day for the last month. I first came across a bottle left over in the shower at my gym. I used it because it listed benzoyl peroxide which is the only acne med that works (trust me, I&#x27;ve used them ALL) and tea tree oil in the ingredients. I had recently started applying pure tea tree oil to my face and felt the combination would be ideal. I can&#x27;t tell you how surprised I was to come across the formulation so randomly. My was much less greasy after using the product so I bought the 3-step kit.    It did not work in three days to eliminate my acne but I could immediately appreciate an improvement in the feel of my skin. It felt cleaner and wasn&#x27;t greasy. That in itself was a miracle since in addition to spending hundreds of dollars on acne meds, I&#x27;ve probably laid out the same amount on blot sheets, mattifying lotions, etc. I did break out more in the first couple of weeks but, thanks to the words I read on this and other websites, I didn&#x27;t give up on the system. Apparently, this product sucks the bacteria from deep in your skin to the surface so it can be removed. I have some photos of my cheeks in the past two weeks looking worse than they have in a long time so I believe this is true.    Now, however, I can truly say that I&#x27;ve turned the corner. My face is smooth. The hard, painful bumps that emerged in the past two weeks are totally gone. Even though I am just using this kit and not the fade cream, the marks on my face are visibly lighter. I have not had a new whitehead in few days. The driness (which wasn&#x27;t excessive) over the past month has been totally worth it because it has revealed beautiful new skin. I am so grateful to have found thisproduct after a decade of daily self-consciousness about my skin, wondering if a new whitehead had emerged since I last checked, wiping oil from my forehead several times a day, desperately researching cures that all failed, and worrying every time I met a guy what he&#x27;d think when my foundation was off- finally, I&#x27;m free.    I have a few notes about application. I also bought the Terminator to deal with the new bumps that came up. It didn&#x27;t offer an instant fix but it probably helped and was cheap enough at Target that it wasn&#x27;t a burden to add to the regimen. I tried putting on tons of the product, as suggested on acne.org. That did not seem to make an appreciable difference. Acnefree works in its time, and I couldn&#x27;t accelerate it, but it did work. Also, I&#x27;ve seen people post here that they do not use a cotton swab to apply the repairing lotion. I switched to using one because it helps exfoliate the skin. You can actually see dead skin cells coming off as the lotion is going on and I found when I didn&#x27;t do this, my cheeks felt rough and looked darker. Lastly, I truly believe this product works all day as advertised. With other acne meds, I would put them on under my makeup and find that I usually had a whitehead by the end of the day. This product keeps my skin feeling extremely fresh all day long and seems to be having an antibacterial effect that prevents new breakouts during the day. My makeup also looks great when my skin is so clear and non-greasy.    I&#x27;m writing this out of a true sense of compassion for everyone who suffers with acne. Try this product. Stick with it because it will work eventually. And, as someone who has finally woken up with beautiful skin after trying desperately to achieve this for ten years, I can tell you it feels great.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how fast I saw results!  It sounds like some people are allergic, but I&#x27;m not, and I saw results, no joke, the very first time I used it!  For about the last five years, I&#x27;ve been wearing really thick foundation.  About a week after starting Acne-Free, I was putting my kids in the car and caught my reflection in my car&#x27;s tinted windows.  I have always hated when that happened because for some reason that reflection brings out every big ugly bump under my skin.  I was shocked when my face was smooth and spotless!  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost two months and haven&#x27;t had any new breakouts, and the red spots from my old acne are even fading without the fade cream.  The best part is, I&#x27;m wearing way less make-up!  I love it, It&#x27;s so so great!  But buy it at Walmart or Target.  It&#x27;s cheaper and you won&#x27;t pay shipping!  Good luck, I hope it works for you!</li>
            <li> Works!  Ordered this kit as an add-on item for under $10.  I had used Proactiv before; it worked but was expensive.  I really wasn&#x27;t expecting AcneFree to work, but for the price, it was worth a try.  For once, I was pleasantly surprised!  It works as least as well as Proactiv at a third the price.  I will definitely be ordering this again, and I will recommend it to friends.</li>
            <li> Only thing I&#x27;ve ever found that will control my acne if I use it daily.  There&#x27;s a balance to be found there, because if I use this too much it will dry out my skin to the point of being painful.  So, I use it twice a day until I feel I need to back off then once a day and even every other day sometimes.  If I continue to use it like I should (which I don&#x27;t) I stay AcneFree.  &amp;#60;&amp;#60;&amp;#60; So clever....  Or lame.  You pick.</li>
            <li> So I have oily acne ridden skin and have for the past 7 years. I have exhausted over the counter and prescription topicals and anti biotics with no success. I am actually set to start isotetrinoin soon because I&#x27;m 20 with a 14 year olds skin. Anyway, I can&#x27;t start it until I get back from a month long study abroad trip in Europe. A couple of days ago I got this HORRIBLE breakout...I&#x27;m talking every part of my face was covered in these painful protruding disgusting pimples. I was mortified because I leave in a few days and the flight is NINE hours. I had to purchase something that would keep my acne at bay. I was shopping in Ulta and came across this acne free kit and bought it because it had a free knock off clarisonic skin unit attached. I saw results over night. I am now on day two and I&#x27;m confident that my face will be cleared up before I go. AND it controls my oil!! It does burn your face a little so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for people with dry or sensitive skin, but I noticed they do make a kit for sensitive skin! I am SO happy I found this and may forego my accutane plans if it continues to work as it has been.</li>
            <li> Ok, tried this, got it at our local store.  I have red hair and sensitive skin.  THIS DOES WORK, BUT if u have sensitive skin only use once daily, or go with proactive its much better, wont hurt ur skin.  Its great, I saw results instantly from both, but proactive helped to fix the burns I recieved from the off brand.  I love my skin, I&#x27;m 36 and I dont look it anymore with the proactive solution, I look younger, got the younger guys checking me out.  Either way, proactive is better, but this stuff does work just dont use too much or only once daily instead of twice.</li>
            <li> Let me start off by saying I never really had acne growing into my teens, which I had considered myself pretty lucky with that as I was fortunate to only get a pimple here or there. However, over the last three years as I went into my twenties, I started get more and more breaks out on my face, mostly centered on my chin and on the side of my face near my cheekbones. I started using proactiv and while that seemed to work for a while, it seemed that over time it caused me to get more breakouts rather then helping them, right around the time they claimed to have changed the formula slightly. I don&#x27;t know what they did, but it just wasn&#x27;t working anymore and I think it was because of that.   Fast forward I a few years, I&#x27;ve been trying a bunch of different things. Burts Bees peach scrub, which I loved the way it moisturized, but caused me to still break out because it was too oily and left a film on my skin, though the toners were good but buying everything in conjunction was just a little to pricey. Neutragena exofiolant didn&#x27;t really work for me all that much, they made my skin soft and that was about it I tried the lavender scrub and that helped calm it down *some*, though the grapefruit one worked much better, it occasionally caused my face to peel. A few more products, down the line I read the reviews and with the price and I decided to give this a try.    I&#x27;ve only been using it about every other day, once a day, for the last two weeks (I&#x27;m forgetful so I do it when I can remember) and I&#x27;ve actually noticed a good improvement. It wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s a miracle worker, I still have bumps but I noticed that my face isn&#x27;t as red as it once was where the pimples are, and the overall texture is better. I am pretty prone to getting the painful cystic pimples, especially around that time of the month, but thankfully I didn&#x27;t break out nearly as much as I did. I had maybe one compared to a usual handful, which is just... relieving.   The only things I didn&#x27;t like was the fact that even right after putting the lotion on my skin the texture felt a little... rough maybe? Not completely dry but not baby butt smooth. It seems though that after letting it absorb it got better (because naturally the peroxide is drying because it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s job of killing the bacteria, but that&#x27;s with any facial cleanser that has it, nothing new). And the other thing is that they don&#x27;t nearly give you enough toner, that stuff disappears like water. Even my friends has the same problem so thankfully I know it&#x27;s not just me.   However, if you do feel like this does dry your skin out a little too much, I highly recommend taking some organic oatmeal &amp; cornmeal (optional) and creating a face paste mask out of it twice a week. It&#x27;s a more natural exfoliate that&#x27;s still gentle and it does make your face a touch softer without you know, putting more chemicals on your face. Though, don&#x27;t put this on in conjunction, as in right after using the system or before, it&#x27;s more like an afternoon thing between uses, otherwise it just kind of renders doing either kind of useless.  Hope this helps!</li>
            <li> I am 30 years old and have been suffering from break outs for the past 2-3 years. My skin is extremely oily so it has been hard to find a product that really works. I have tried Proactiv in the past, as well as Neutrogena stress control, Clinique products, bath and body works products, and I am a Mary Kay consultant so I have access to a ton of product that just didn&#x27;t work. I finally started shopping around and reading reviews when I came across this line of AcneFree products. All the reviews were very encouraging so I went out that evening and bought the 4 step kit for severe acne. I had suddenly broke out with at least a dozen new bumps in one concentrated area in one day, it was the worst I had ever broke out and I was desperate. I started the treatment that evening, which was a Friday, and by Sunday there was a noticable change. Today is Wednesday, it has only been 5 days since I started and I literally have 2 blemishes that are visible on my face. I am definately looking forward to seeing what improvements come in the next few weeks.   I did notice that a couple people complained of their skin drying out. It is still important to moisturize your skin, no matter if it&#x27;s oily. Go get an oil free moisturizer and apply it after your cleansing regimen. I use Mary Kay oil free moisturizer as well as MK oil free hydrating gel. Even though the MK acne products didnt work for me, there are still tons of amazing skin care products and these moisturizers make the skin feel amazing!  One other thing I learned the hard way, don&#x27;t put acnefree on your eyes! Most products tell you not to apply to the eye area. I always ignored that, most cleansers are gentle enough that it didnt matter either way for me. This is not the case with acnefree. I applied it all over my face the first night and the next day my eyelids felt very dry and almost felt like they were burning when I put on my make-up.   I would reccommend that if you have an acne problem, at least try the acnefree products. It&#x27;s worth a shot :)</li>
            <li> WE have tried everything nothing has worked when we was given this to try for free i figured it would be like everything else it wouldnt work and dry up our face...but it didn&#x27;t after just a couple days i noticed the black heads was gone and for the first week we both had some white head but they cleared up and i am just so amazed how well it has worked i have bought it again</li>
            <li> Cheaper and more easily available than ProActive, this product works great.  Can also be found at local drug and convenience stores.</li>
            <li> I am in my early 30&#x27;s and never had a problem with acne until my mid 20&#x27;s.  I had been using proactiv for quite some time (5 years or so) and it worked pretty well.  I say pretty well since it did clear my face some, but my face has not been totally clear in a long time. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Along comes AcneFree which is \\&quot;better\\&quot; than Proactiv since you can buy it locally and it contains more of the active ingredient--cool, I am sick of ordering it online and it is cheaper! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well, I guess you get what you pay for--I don&#x27;t consider myself to have particularly sensitive skin, but I used AcneFree one time in the morning.  So far so good--until 2 am the next morning when I broke out in hives all over my entire body.  So no more AcneFree for me, just wanted to give my experience for anyone who might be in the same situation.</li>
            <li> I love this product...I can&#x27;t live without it. It works so well, without drying out your skin. Before I starting using this product I had severe acne..And now I&#x27;ve been using it for three years. Not a SINGLE break out since. I love it...</li>
            <li> I am 24 and have mostly hormonal, moderately severe acne. I am prone to deep pimples that last for a long time. I am not able to take hormones to clear it up anymore, so it got pretty bad. I tried Proactiv, Burt&#x27;s Bees, Neutrogena, stuff from the dermatologist, etc. This is the first thing to make a difference. I&#x27;m going to have some pimples no matter what I do, but after a few months of use, I&#x27;m only dealing with a few pimples at a time, instead of having them all over my cheeks and neck. I never get pimples on my forehead or chin anymore. Also the blackheads on my nose are gone. So now I don&#x27;t even have what I would consider \\&quot;acne\\&quot; - just a couple red pimples to cover up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a 24-hour system, meaning that you only need it once a day. Some days I use it twice, but most days I don&#x27;t. If you are prone to dry skin, that would probably dry your skin out, but for me it&#x27;s fine. When I start using it twice a day regularly my skin gets a little tight, but I&#x27;ve tried other products that made my skin flake off in chunks or made my cheeks bright red. You don&#x27;t have to worry about that with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this as a last ditch effort. I know that not everything works for everyone, but having clearer skin is nice, so this might be worth a shot for you too.</li>
            <li> I have been using this brand for a few years now, which has been the only effective product ever (over the counter or prescription products never helped rosacea acne.)  But this product does.  However, the  product has now been repackaged and provides larger bottles which I do appreciate.  I wish the bottles could be bought individually as the toner lasts a lot longer than does the wash and lotion.  I highly recommend this product over proactive or other brands one might find in retail strores or online.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product, and it hurts! Though it is slightly better than Neutrogena Oil-Free when it comes to drying and peeling, my skin is still rough and dry and it hurts even more than Neutrogena. I don&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
            <li> This product burned my face completely off after the first use.  Will not be using it again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this skin care set for the broken-out-tried-everything skin of a friend of mine.  This order came promptly, well-packaged and is a good value.  I hope it helps my friend, who will get this for Christmas.</li>
            <li> I remembered getting hot spots and breaking out after using pro activ. I guess you have to condition your skin especially if it&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have always had very oily and acne prone skin throughout adolescence and even now at 24. I purchased acne free one week ago. The true reason I got it was because I was on a budget and proactive was too expensive for me so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try for $17. I am blown away! I have seen such a huge difference in just a week! The products leave your face soft and smooth. I have seen such a difference in my acne. It has been reduced and my skin is not half as oily as it was. The only reason it didn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because if you have dry skin it may dry it out even more, since my skin is oily I didn&#x27;t have that problem, but definitely something to think about. Also, if you wax your face at all (eyebrows, sideburns, lip) you need to stop using this product about a week before or it could cause lifting of the skin just due to the  benzoyl peroxide and other strong ingredients it contains. All in all I love this product and will be using it until further notice.</li>
            <li> Best acne product out there in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Product is comparable to other top acne treatments, without the high price tag. Excellent(active ingredient benzoyl-peroxide) for skins that may be allergic to salicylic acid found in may acne treatments.</li>
            <li> My acne has been pretty bad for a while and I was deciding between this and the Severe Acne treatment that AcneFree also puts out and chose the gentler sounding one. I used this product for a few weeks with basically no change in the condition of my skin so I decided to try the Severe Acne treatment and have been very satisfied with the results. So if you&#x27;re having trouble deciding between which treatment to get, I would certainly recommend the Severe Acne treatment over this one.</li>
            <li> My son has acne and I&#x27;ve tried several products before this one and really have not been impressed by many.  This one impressed me the least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My son started doing this at the begining of the week and kept it up for the next few days.  During that time, his face was burning and turned red.  Also, the pimples and surrounding skin seemed to swell up a bit.  He complained of itching and pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was worried because he doesn&#x27;t have terribly sensative skin.  I took him to our pediatrician *he&#x27;s 15 and she told me to immediately have him stop usuing this product and she gave him a shot of cortizone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why he had the reaction he did, but it didn&#x27;t make it ANY better at all, it made it WORSE.  I can not recommend this to any one.  I would not want to see anyone else&#x27;s child go through what mine did.  I&#x27;d try something else or consult my physician first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks - Amy</li>
            <li> I used this product for about two weeks and then I started to feel extremely uncomfortable with it.    I do not give bad comments usually, but this one really pissed me off    decided not to use it any more      I wish I read the comments here before I bought it from Costco</li>
            <li> Great product. Keeps my skin clear</li>
            <li> I first started using Acne Free almost 2 months ago. I started out using the sensitive version, which was good, but decided to use the original. It&#x27;s improved my skin so much. I&#x27;ve tried everything there is to try, so I&#x27;m happy that this works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from acne my whole life. I&#x27;m 34. It recently got so bad that I went to the dermo and he prescribed an oral antibiotic and several topicals. It didn&#x27;t work. So we tried a few more different topicals and a spa treatment. Didn&#x27;t work. Bought Acne Free and it worked like a charm!  in less then three days my skin finally got under control. And I saved a butt load of cash not spending money on all those prescriptions and copays. I got lazy and didn&#x27;t use it for a while and my acne returned slowly so I picked up another kit and pow! Acne gone. It&#x27;s simple...have stubborn acne? Use Acne Free</li>
            <li> My daughter is 14 and blessed with a porcelain complexion. Just recently she began breaking out with small little bumps and I (perhaps foolishly) picked up this kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the label I realized that this contained active ingredients that were known to work, and which were also known to dry out one&#x27;s skin. So I decided we&#x27;d proceed cautiously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Purifying cleanser 1 night and realized that with my old-mom-skin that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to use this every night. I let my daughter use the cleanser and ONLY the cleanser because I was trying to see which item was the most drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two nights passed and she was okay. The following evening she used the cleanser and the toner, and followed it up with a very light &#x27;regular&#x27; moisturizer. THE NEXT DAY I got a call from the school nurse. My teens face was red and irritated. (Why it waited for the middle of a fun school function, I don&#x27;t know.) But I needed to bring in an medicated lotion. After that she was fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY&lt;br /&gt;I thought that the lotion had a positive effect on my mom skin, but it&#x27;s too drying for me, at my advanced age, to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll also note that it was harsh even for my young teen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you have a tween or young teen that has breakouts you might want to try a less aggressive product before trying this one. Certainly advise them to proceed cautiously. Which is what I&#x27;d tell you. This product seems to work, but don&#x27;t over do it at first until you know how you react to the ingredients.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a while now and love it. I bought some for my niece and she loves it too. she was very impressed at how well it works for her skin. It keep us both pimple free!</li>
            <li> My daughter used this product for two weeks, twice a day. It did an awesome job. Her skin was free of acne within three days of using this product. One other thing that she really liked was that her skin felt soft, clean and healthy. The part i enjoyed was it set a skin routine for her that she still follows now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 and I&#x27;ve had acne since I was 12 years old. I&#x27;ve literally tried every skin cream you can get from a dermatologist, and each and every single one of them did nothing, or gave me an allergic reaction. I found this and I can&#x27;t remember the last time my skin was this clear. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and my skin is wonderful. I used to have acne on every square inch of my face, and now I have about 2 or 3 small pimples on my forehead that will probably be gone by tomorrow. There is no outbreak after starting this, and it doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin at all. The only bad thing is it makes your skin look a little bit oily, but you can take care of it with the clean and clear oil absorbing sheets. This has completely turned my life around, and its at a fair price. One kit lasts me about a month.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, if you use it correctly. I believe those that this did not work for perhaps used it not as directed, or just had skin this was not recommended for. There are other options in the AcneFree line, severe and sensitive. Depending on the severity and sensitivity of your skin, you probably shouldn&#x27;t have chose this product. In my experience using it for 3 days, as it promised, showed a great difference, clearing breakouts and preventing new ones. The only concern I have is how drying it is; the repair lotion has plenty of acne clearing effects but is definitely not as moisturizing as it sounds. Pairing it with a very creamy moisturizer that you know would not break you out is enough to fix this issue.</li>
            <li> be careful:  I checked the expiration date on the 3 ordered packets , the product expires in August 2015, in a month. Nothing was said in the description.</li>
            <li> I had an allergic reaction to this product after about a week of use.  I thought the irritation was from the drying out of my skin and a sunburn that I had at the same time, so I waited a week and tried it again, and now my face is burning, itching, red and swollen.  I am using an antihistamine and steroids to try to get rid of the reaction and return my face to normal.  It did seem to work for the acne, but try in a small, sensitive area for at least a week, first!</li>
            <li> I used to buy this stuff for 20$ dollars but it keeps getting more and more expensive. Its making me not want to buy it anymore... works good though</li>
            <li> Works great for me!  As long as I use this stuff twice per day I don&#x27;t have breakouts.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my teenage daughter who has mild to moderate acne and blackheads. In the first week of using this product there was a huge difference in her complexion. The acne cleared and the blackhead went away. She has used it consistently for weeks and her skin looks as smooth and soft as it did before she was a teenager. This product works as promised.</li>
            <li> I bought this system because I could not afford Proactiv, so I started it not expecting much. I was, however surprised by its quick effectiveness. I have been using this as directed for almost a week now, and I already see greater clarity. In fact, I started seeing results after about two uses. The toner is especially nice. It leaves me feeling very clean. I will say that there is a downside, my face is a little red. It is a minor side effect, and cannot be seen under makeup. This system is well worth its cost, and is not too much work. It only takes 5 minutes to do the whole routine, and the directions say to do it twice a day. The containers are very sanitary (the product comes out of a small hole rather than a wide opening). I do wish that it came with a moisturizer as well, as its benzol peroxide can be a bit drying. These few complaints are minor in light of how great this system has been for my horrible hormonal and premenstrual breakout(s). I will continue to use this system when I run out--and I&#x27;m not even considering Proactiv anymore. If you are looking to reduce your acne quickly, and are willing to follow the directions given, I have no doubts that this system will help you out; I recommend it with full confidence.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a year and a half now and am happy knowing that I&#x27;ve finally found something that works for me after dealing with acne since puberty (I&#x27;m now 27).  My skin is now mostly clear with the occasional blemish that still pops up once in a while-- but the little bonus treatment seems to work well for overnight treatment.  I use the system only once a day, at night.  Since using this product, I&#x27;ve been complemented on my complexion many times, something I never thought I&#x27;d hear!  I&#x27;d imagine that range of reviews (from those who say it works to those who don&#x27;t) is due mostly to the vast variety of skin types out there.  I would describe my skin as combination (dry in places and oily in others), large pores, very pale with some minor acne scarring/redness, not too sensitive, and with moderate acne (before using this product).  If this sounds like you I would suggest giving it a try.  I purchase at the warehouse stores and the price is pretty good.  Also- it seems to work better if you wash any makeup off your face before cleansing. I do use additional moisturizers on the areas that tend to dry out on my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 25, but I still have acne from stress and too many sweets, so I try to remember to use this stuff every day.  The 3 steps are quick and painless - it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all.  Leaves me feeling clean and clear, and it works as long as I remember to use it religiously.</li>
            <li> I have been using the product about 2 weeks and have yet to notice a difference. I find the product to feel very heavy and thick, even the renewing toner. After applying all 3 products as directed my face feels very oily. I already have oily skin an that is what makes me brake out, so this product actually caused my light acne to jump to medium.</li>
            <li> I started using Acne Free in Sept 2010. I can&#x27;t believe the difference continuously in my skin. With Pro Activ I had breakouts, and still had to wear makeup and the lotion made my skin oily. Acne free works so well and I don&#x27;t even wear makeup anymore, I barely have large breakouts or breakouts at all. My skin that was normally really oily isn&#x27;t anymore. I love this and it is so much cheaper than Pro Activ, it&#x27;s half the cost and works better. It still seems to last about the same as Pro Activ though. Maybe it won&#x27;t work for everyone but to someone who has tried most and tried Pro Activ I won&#x27;t go back. My skin is also so much healthier. I am so glad I took the chance and tried something that compares to Pro Activ, it never had a reverse effect where I broke out before it got better I just noticed it working and felt the difference almost immediately. So to all the people who are trying something and it doesn&#x27;t work. give this a try...it may be worth your while, and no expensive commercials or famous actors to stand by it either!!</li>
            <li> Great product, great price, quick delivery</li>
            <li> Broke my face out terribly...these product are too strong!</li>
            <li> I received a free AcneFree kit through Smiley360.  My son was using proactive prior to using AcneFree.  He has been using AcneFree for 3 weeks.  It says you should use it twice a day, but I know my son is not consistently using it twice a day.  I know he is using it  at least once a day and we still notice a big improvement in his skin.  I would highly recommend using AcneFree.</li>
            <li> Awful awful product! I thought this product would be extremely helpful for getting rid of my acne due to the high amount of salicylic acid; however the result was the complete opposite. Yes, it did get rid of my acne, my acne was gone in a matter of three days; however, with every application of the product, my face would tingle and burn so much and my skin would be so irritated and red. After three days of using this system, my face was so red and raw to the point where my skin began to peel off like I was a snake! It was like this system gave me an awful sunburn that I never asked for. Oh and I can&#x27;t forget to mention, the products smelled so strong, the scents of each one were nauseating. I would not recommend this product, but kudos to you if this helped your acne disappear! Such a miss with buying this product.</li>
            <li> In the past 6 months, I started breaking out like I did when I was a teen. I thought it was stress-related or my hair, but these pimples have gotten worse. My first try was AcneFree &amp; I am so lucky b/c it worked immediately. I have been using it for 5 days now. I saw my friend yesterday &amp; she noticed that my face cleared up. I just saw my cousin 2 days ago &amp; he noticed my face right away. They both said my face is not so red &amp; there are no new pimples. My face is smooth, clean &amp; at the rate AcneFree is working, I should look flawless in the next week or so. I have no new occurring pimples. No redness, no soreness.</li>
            <li> This has helped clear up my face tremendously!</li>
            <li> We received this full sized product for FREE from Smiley360 and tried it with my 13 year old son. He just started getting some acne and trouble spots on his face, so receiving this product was right on time! We started the 3 step system on the first night, all was well. 2nd night he said the lotion was giving him a burning feeling, so we got a damp cloth and blotted his face to take some off. His face just isn&#x27;t used to anything on it, I think. So, we tried it the next day and it was much better. Went another 3 days using the system and WOW! His face was totally clear and fresh looking. We love it! We took before and after pictures and it&#x27;s amazing to see the difference! I received this as a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own (and my son&#x27;s).</li>
            <li> This product would be great IF you have extremely oily skin? I tried it and i have pretty moderate acne break outs and figured it would clear it up and it did but it also dried my face out to a point where it was uncomfortable causing more acne to pop up so it was just a nightmare. The lotion is way way way too oily for any ones skin and im not sure out that doesn&#x27;t cause acne in itself? Definitely will not be buying this product any time soon.</li>
            <li> I started having frequent acne breakouts in my thirties and early forties, and after using several products and monthly facials I all but gave up hope of finding an effective treatment. While browsing the skin care aisle of a pharmacy one day three years ago, I came across Acnefree and decided to try it. Within days I was seeing a difference and after two weeks my skin was cleaner and clearer than it had been in years. I no longer use the cleanser and toner because the product is so hard to find but I have quite a few bottles of the repair lotion from both lines of the product. I rate it highly, and would recommend it for faults who are deling with acne problems. It worked/works for me!</li>
            <li> I had acne in all of my teenage years and I am now twenty.  Last summer my boyfriend finally convinced me to try proactive because I was having a bad break out and felt completely hopeless. I had used the prescriptions Differin gel and Prascion cleanser (smells horrible)but they just never worked for me. Anyways, the day after I tried Proactive I did notice and immediate difference but thought it was just coincidence.     After using the product for the entire summer and beginning of this fall, I realized I finally found something that worked. On the other hand, I thought that the price was a little much so I looked into alternatives and couldn&#x27;t find anything similar at the drugstore apart from Acnefree.     I didn&#x27;t really want to try Acnefree at first because my best friend told me that it \\&quot;sucks.\\&quot; Well, after using it for about a month my skin has stayed exactly the same and completely clear of blemishes.      The only thing that I&#x27;m not sold on with Acnefree is the texture of the facial cleanser. It is extremely smooth and does not exfoliate, unlike Proactiv. In the past week I have decided to keep a little bowl of salt by my sink and I just dip my fingers in it and rub it into the cleanser on my face. I think its more of a psychological thing but it just makes me feel good to have the roughness.     Also, if you look at the ingredient label you will find some minor differences in ingredients and percentages. I was worried about this at first but I really think that the main thing that you need is Benzoyl Peroxide. My skin has really responded well to it.      Overall: Thanks AcneFree! My skin is glowing :)</li>
            <li> First of all I&#x27;d like to say that I have never suffered from severe acne. Just the occasional pimple or two once or twice a month. Recently though I&#x27;ve been getting deep cystic acne around my chin and jaw line area. After being fed up with most supposed \\&quot;miracle products\\&quot; I made the decision to purchase this system. I started using the 3 step system right away and after only two uses of it (morning and night) I already noticed a big difference. Not only did it diminish what pimples I had, it helped to fade the acne marks that had remained on my skin from recent acne. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and my skin is completely clear! It even worked at getting rid of stubborn black heads that it seems like I&#x27;ve had forever. It is easy to use and honestly is a great bargain when you consider that other acne creams alone can cost close to $15. The one slight drawback I have is that it did dry my skin out slightly, nothing that a lil moisturizer couldn&#x27;t fix. I&#x27;ve reduced the 3 step application to once a day now and that seems to take of the dryness but it still works just as effectively! It even worked at evening out the skin on my cheeks and nose, it really does work, that is the bottom line.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!  I only had one or two pimples a week before using this product.  After I started using it, my skin got sooo bad!  Worse than it has ever been.  I got about 30 tiny pimples on my cheeks.</li>
            <li> After my 30s I begin to have acne, I never had it before. So, I tried AcneFree and after the second day using it only once a day I had a very bad allergy reaction that I needed to go to see a doctor. It&#x27;s 2 days without using it and my face is still red, burning, itching and puff. This morning I almost couldn&#x27;t open my eyes because it was very puffy. I&#x27;m felling horrible and my face was much prettier before. If you have a SENSITIVE SKIN, don&#x27;t try it.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like this. it leaves behind a nasty smell, and made my face break out more than it did before! not happy</li>
            <li> Go from pizza face to a human face in 2 days. Anytime my acne gets out of control, to the point that no other products help, this one never disappoints. The cleanser is a bit harsh on the skin, but the toner and lotion are amazing and indispensable .</li>
            <li> Okay, let me start this review with my full story. About 9 months ago I moved from Florida to Tennessee... This move was extremely stressful for me and started a downward spiral for my skin. I have never had acne before, not even through adolescence. And now at the age of 21, my face had turned into a pizza. It started off with small pimples here and there, and progressively turned into very painful cystic acne on my chin, and around my smile lines. Nothing would get these cysts to go away. I tried so many different things to get it plunder control... (calamine lotion, acne topical medicines, oral medicines, everything I could think of. ) finally I was going to order proactive as a last chance before I gave up the fight to rid my awful craters. I had became obsessed with looking for something like proactive that I could just go get, and not have to wait for it to deliver. This stuff sounded pretty promising. So to WalMart I went, and within the first 3 days my skin had showed so much improvement. And now after a week and a half my skin is almost completely healed, with very little scaring. I would recommend this product to anyone thats having skin problems. Very impressed.</li>
            <li> Good News: It works.&lt;br /&gt;Bad News: Your face becomes the Sahara Desert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Explanation: I purchased AcneFree after my usual regimen (Clean and Clear 3 Step) was no longer able to fight break outs. I went all throughout high school without having a single pimple or bump, but soon after graduation my face seemed to get worse and worse. Over the last two years I&#x27;ve tried various face washes, wipes, and ointments to try and put my break outs at bay. And for a while, nothing worked. The three step system from Clean and Clear (which is quite similar to this, but you have to buy the wash, toner, and moisturizer separately), was the first thing that seemed to make a dent in my face. Recently, however, my acne either leveled up, or the treatment just stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to try something new, and a bit more expensive (only three dollars...but who&#x27;s counting?) I came across this kit at walmart, and decided to give it a go. The first week I had it, I saw little to no improvement. I&#x27;m in the second week and my face has cleared substantially. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it isn&#x27;t as clear as I&#x27;d like it to be...but improvement has been made. I have noticed, however, that over the past week or so my face has been drying out. I don&#x27;t use excessive amounts of the products, just enough to do the job.... and I use it twice a day as suggested. But I&#x27;ve found myself applying a separate brand moisturizer an hour or so after using this brand&#x27;s repairing lotion because my face has become so tight and dry it&#x27;s unbearable.</li>
            <li> I have tried about 100 different products (including this one) to treat my acne...as well as going to 3 different dermatologists and nothing worked. I FINALLY found a product that has worked for me and I&#x27;ve been telling everyone about it. My sister has started using it as well and her acne cleared up in less than a week. It was crazy. I wouldn&#x27;t waste you money on anything else before you try what I&#x27;ve been using.    Just copy the link below into your browser and check out their website.  (I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to put a link in here?!?)    [...]</li>
            <li> I have never had bad acne, but when I turned 30 I suddenly started to break out. Very Weird.  Anyway, I tried this stuff and loved it, then my skin started to dry out and I thought i would have to stop using it.  I still used the face wash/toner every morning/evening, but stopped using the repair lotion in the morning and used my regular olay mouisterizer instead.  I stopped peeling immediately and still had fresh clean skin.  I do not recommend mixing the products right away though, after washing if I didn&#x27;t wait about 5 min (brush my teath, etc) before using my olay or other brand of product then I would feel a burning but this was easily avoided by just waiting a few min for my face to be completely dry.  Also, this product has peroxide in it, it WILL act as a bleach on clothing/washcloths etc.  I bought a stack of cheep washcloths just for me to use on my face.  Summery: This stuff works GREAT if you use precautions and common sense.</li>
            <li> I am in my mid 20s and have struggled with mild/moderate acne most of my life but recently I&#x27;ve noticed my acne getting worse (cystic acne, etc.). I was desperate to find something that would clear up my face. I tried Proactiv in college and found it to be mostly a waste of money. It didn&#x27;t really clear my face up any better than anything I could&#x27;ve bought over-the-counter. So this time around, I tried everything (Clean&amp;Clear, Nuetrogena, Clearasil, and other name brand products). I tried washing my face a million times a day as well as wearing no make-up. Nothing worked and I was getting pretty frustrated and broke. Then, I saw AcneFree for $20 in my local Rite Aid and thought I would give it a shot. When I got home I read all the reviews I could find about it on the internet and had mixed feelings about trying it because they were equally positive and negative. I started using it as directed and at first I didn&#x27;t see much of a change. After the first week though, all of my old flare-ups were drying out and I had no new pimples. By the second week, I had absolutely perfect skin. I am sooo happy to report I haven&#x27;t had a single pimple in a month now. A WHOLE MONTH!! Ever since I started using AcneFree, I forget if I even put make-up on or not because my skin is so perfect. This product works better than anything else. My one recommendation is that you need to give it time for it to work. When I first started using it, I almost gave up on it because I didn&#x27;t see immediate results. Now I am happy I waited it out because my skin has NEVER looked this good.</li>
            <li> Disappointing. It dries your skin out big time. Worse than proactiv but not as good. And proactiv is only average.</li>
            <li> I was getting desperate a month and a half ago when I took a chance on this stuff. I&#x27;m familiar with the acne.org regimen though I hadn&#x27;t been following it (stupid me!), so I especially liked the fact that this kit included a gentle benzoyl peroxide lotion.     I&#x27;m almost 30 and have oily skin. Before I started using this kit I was going through a stressful time and was more broken out than I had ever been. My forehead felt like Braille - I had bumps that refused to budge. I was broken out all over my cheeks and also had bumps all over my chin and painful acne around my jawline.    I had been using various products with salicylic acid for a long time, but it seems that my skin just doesn&#x27;t respond to it. I apparently need to use benzoyl peroxide to stay clear, so my plan is to keep using it indefinitely. I&#x27;m a firm believer that skin care is not one-size-fits-all and that you really need to experiment to find what&#x27;s right for you - but that also means giving a product a chance to work. That&#x27;s why even though I saw genuinely impressive results after two days of using the AcneFree kit, I held off writing this review until now.    More than a month out: Acne is close to zero. Almost no bumps. My skin seems less oily. And when something does \\&quot;pop up,\\&quot; it&#x27;s usually minimal, and I layer on a little bit more of the lotion in that spot and it goes away very quickly. I wouldn&#x27;t describe my skin as \\&quot;perfect,\\&quot; but \\&quot;perfect\\&quot; was never my goal - I just wanted it to get better. And it has, drastically. I feel absolutely comfortable leaving the house with just a dusting of powder and a tiny bit of concealer on some scars (which are fading - though I&#x27;m not sure I can give credit to the AcneFree for that, I certainly seem to have less redness overall). Before I bought this stuff I was constantly self-conscious about the state of my face and had days when I honestly dreaded leaving the house as a result. I am so happy that this product has allowed me to stop stressing about my skin.For me, using it regularly is key - I will occasionally just remove my makeup at night, but I almost always use the kit twice a day as directed and since it&#x27;s working beautifully, I don&#x27;t see the need to do otherwise. It&#x27;s worth the extra five or ten minutes at night and in the morning if I&#x27;m able to wake up everyday not feeling miserable about my skin. Even though I&#x27;ve been using plenty of product twice a day, I&#x27;m still on my first kit, which I bought in the beginning of July, and I really feel that the products included are worth the money.    I&#x27;m absolutely sure that it&#x27;s possible to get good results by diligently following a similar regimen made up of other products with benzoyl peroxide in them. But the AcneFree has worked beautifully for me, so as long as they keep making it, I plan to keep buying and using it!    (A few final words of advice: if you feel you need this product and you&#x27;re planning to spend the money to try it, you owe it to yourself to give it a good, long trial period during which you use it morning and night, and cut back on any other products you might be using (or cut them out altogether). Definitely don&#x27;t use any kind of harsh scrubs or exfoliators - your skin needs to heal, not have irritants thrown at it. And consider seriously cutting down on the amount of makeup you wear, if you usually wear makeup. And yes, definitely invest in a white towel and be careful about not getting it on your clothes - I didn&#x27;t have any problems along those lines, but that&#x27;s because I already knew that peroxide will bleach things, so I was prepared.)</li>
            <li> AcneFree!! More Like \\&quot;FreeAcne\\&quot;, because that&#x27;s what you get when you use this product! I was using proactiv before, which helped a lot, but then I saw this in store that said \\&quot;works better than proactiv\\&quot;(What a crock of poop),so I thought I&#x27;d save some money and give it a try! And boy was that a mistake! Don&#x27;t waste your money! I&#x27;m switching back to Proactiv because that actually worked!</li>
            <li> Acnefree works as good as regular proactiv an better than proactiv plus for a fraction of the  price.... I am 36 an I have had acne and been using proactiv since I was 21..... I am now using Acnefree and I am happy to say I am more than pleased with the results.... clear skin ladies in three days, continued use of Acnefree twice daily, clear skin continues... I have an 18 year old son who also uses Acnefree.... save money an hastle folks try it for the first time or switch to it for good an enjoy the results</li>
            <li> I have had practically severe acne for about 2 to 3 years now since adolescence and have tried everything from proactiv to clean and clear and home remedies and even a fast on nothing but apples for 3 days and absolutely nothing I did worked at all. I dont have acne like the kinda that is disforming or really large cysts or anything like that, I just have alot, mainly blackheads and whiteheads. I was ready to just throw in the towl and see a dermatologist thinking that if I didnt I would be stuck with this for the rest of my life, and my sister saw a dermatologist and had good results. but I was going through a local store and saw this on sale and it said better than proactiv and had a free acnefree terminator with it so I thought I would give it one last shot. I can honestly say that this is the most amazing product ever, it has been 3 days and AT LEAST half of my acne and blackheads are totally gone!!!!!!!!! If you have acne and you think well this is probably just like all the other products, trust me it is not!!!! and for the record never buy proactiv it is the worst thing I have ever used, doesent work, and made my face dry up and crack so much I literally could not open my mouth to eat a bite or cereal and it made my face 10x worse. I would buy this again in a heartbeat and totally will!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything for my skin... And nothing was working. So one day when I was at my local publix I picked up this product and decided to try it... So far it has only been two days and I can already see results. Hope it continues to go well.(:</li>
            <li> I have used Proactiv in the past but found this to work just as well at half the price. In addition I can buy this product when needed.</li>
            <li> Purchased this for my son, works great</li>
            <li> Since I have some acnes on my chin and neck I bought this product. Frankly I am not really sure how effective this is even though my acne situation is getting much better now..... cuz I am also using Vichy products (toner and lotion), AVENE. I also go to bed very early everyday..... I eat very healthily..... more vegetable and fruit...... drink more water...... All I want to say is, if you really want to make your acnes go away you gotta pay attention to your lifestyle. Make-up can not make it all gone......</li>
            <li> I am 30 and have had mild to moderate acne all of my life. Most of my breakouts are in the chin area. I have been using this system for 2 weeks and it seems to be clearing up my skin, but if you&#x27;re looking for a product that works quickly, this is not it. That being said, it is clearing up the acne, and my skin is looking better day by day. I used the system night and day (and although you&#x27;re not really supposed to, I spot treated the nasty pimples a few times a day with the Step 3 lotion.) My skin is pretty sensitive and I could feel the effects of drying a bit, mostly under my eyes, so I would consider at least moisturizing there after each use. When I could feel my skin getting too dry I cut down the use to night only, with spot treatments of Step 3. I did notice a reduction in pores on my nose as well. Be careful when touching clothing and towels, the peroxide can have a bleaching effect on fabrics. Overall a good system to use daily, for mild to moderate acne. I have actually tried Proactive and loved it, but for the price, I would use this again if it keeps my skin mostly clear. I would suggest this item for anyone to try at this price. I need to give it more time to see if it has any preventative qualities as well.</li>
            <li> This stuff did not work and it sucked it made my face dry and red dont bother buying it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 45 years old and found Acne-Free works GREAT for adult acne when used on a regular basis. Been using it for about a year and it&#x27;s nice to have attractive skin again. I don&#x27;t like complicated regimins and this fits my lifestyle. Quick and easy. &lt;br /&gt;I was going to use the original Proactiv but found this cheaper offshoot product and I&#x27;m glad I tried it!</li>
            <li> I just bought this product a few days ago but I wanted to address some of the complaints brought up in the reviews here.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do want to say that after using it for two days I have already noticed that my skin is more calm and clean. It feels better and it actually looks better. I am 30 years old and have been breaking out more now than when I was 16! I was going to order the Proactive stuff but frankly, dont have that kind of money right now. So when I saw this I decided to give it a shot. Like I said, its only been two days so I cant give a detailed review but from just the last two days I can tell you I have already noticed a difference in my skin. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Now..I want to address the issue of the product messing up clothes. It clearly states on the box or bottles that it can bleach facial hair and clothes. I didnt think anyone would be washing their face wearing their everyday clothes but since its a warning on the bottle and I am assuming everyone would read the instructions, directions, and warnings before using it then everyone should take the precautions to keep this from happening. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Secondly, the issue of the lotion being gritty and the face wash not. Well, maybe your product was old or something. I just bought this a few days ago and my face wash is SLIGHTLY gritty and the lotion doesnt have a bit of grit in it. It is very smooth and calming and refreshing. So I would make sure you didnt get a product that was out of date or something. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have VERY sensitive skin so I am always leary of products like this because more often than not they dry out my skin, turn it red and I break out even worse than before. I havent had a bit of drying, redness or anything else. No new acne, no greasy skin, no problem with my clothes being bleached. I am glad there is no foul smell to the products. Even the toner doesnt burn like some I have tried do. I have tried more expensive products in the past and they only burned, dried out my skin and didnt not for my acne. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have hope for this product and if it clears up my skin then it will definately be money well spent. I will keep everyone posted. LOL!</li>
            <li> I used this product instead of Proactive hoping it would work so I could save money but turns out this product i bad for senstive skin. Each time it got rid of a pimple, a new pimple would pop up. I didn&#x27;t really have bad skin but I think I got worse skin after using it. It would be called Free Ance instead of Ance Free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried neutrogena, proactive, and many other acne cleansers and they all seemed to make me break out more and made my skin oliy. Acne free has kept my face clean for over a year now and I love it. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin oily and gets rid of blackheads too. Love this product!</li>
            <li> Saw no results. At least it wassn&#x27;t expensive. But I&#x27;m not done with the product yet but I&#x27;ve been using it almost a month and nothing yet.</li>
            <li> I have used many facial cleansers over the years and the only one that really seemed to work and keep my skin fresh and clear was Proactiv. However, with the high price tag and my budget being tight, I was looking for a cheaper alternative that would perform just as well. Here it is folks for about 1/3 of the price! I was skeptical when I read the packaging that claimed this product was even better than Proactiv, and I didn&#x27;t see too many reviews from Proactiv users. This 3-step kit contains Benzoyl Peroxide though, which is the main ingredient in Proactiv and the only thing that seems to work for me so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. Although I wouldn&#x27;t say that it is necessarily better, this purchase is definitely worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Medicinally, this product is comparable to the Proactiv brand and really does the job. I had recently suffered some breakouts due to some new makeup and was having a hard time getting things under control - my face started clearing within days of using AcneFree. Be forewarned that it will cause blemishes to get worse before they get better. This product works deep in the pores and brings all of the dirt and oil to the surface, but rest assured, it will go away. One thing I do wish is that the cleanser had more grittiness to it to exfoliate the skin but it works so I really can&#x27;t complain. Another thing, this WILL dry out your skin. I was using this twice a day (I may have to cut it to every other day), but my skin became overly dry and tight because it cleanses so well. This has been easily remedied with a rich moisturizer (I found Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Lotion with SPF 15 for the day, and Garnier Moisture Rescue Refreshing Gel Cream for night use to work perfectly!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this product works, costs only $20, and can easily be obtained at your local convenience store. Just arm yourself with a good moisturizer and you&#x27;re on your way to beautiful skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this system for years. 3? 4? I can&#x27;t remember but suffice to say, I&#x27;ve applied this stuff to my face literally thousands of time. It can be slightly time consuming to do all three steps everyday twice. This is especially true if you wait a while for the toner (I tend to run out of that the quickest) to dry and set 100% before applying the lotion, which I find to be the best route. Also, I think my skin has become dependent on the daily exposure to this combination of ingredients. If I miss applications for over 2 days (say I&#x27;m traveling), my skin goes into crisis management mode and downhill real fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#x27;s the thing- This stuff is cheap and works. I would pay way more for this even if it took much longer. It&#x27;s completely worth it for my skin to be awesome. I don&#x27;t mean decent or just cutting down the outbreaks a little. I mean holy wow, prepubescent type skin. I have a horrible habit of picking at my skin (very attractive trait), and this stuff manages to heal the damage well and not leave marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I do NOT have sensitive skin. I could do some crazy chemical peel, and it not even be a thing afterwards. So this review comes from that skin-hardened-from-tons-of-other-treatments perspective.</li>
            <li> i actually saw this on the shelf at the store, and i just thought \\&quot;hey why not try this\\&quot;.  it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than proactiv and it claims that it&#x27;s been compared to proactiv.  i do have a mild acne problem, but there are days when my face just tends to break out. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;i think this product irritated my face rather than helping.  it just completely dried my face out.  after 4-5 days, my face started hurting because it was so dry.  but i thought i would wait a little bit longer. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;after a month or two, i couldnt take it anymore.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;It made my skin very dry and break out because of it. My floormate had the same reaction. We were both very disappointed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I recommend going for VitaClear which i tried before this product and is less expensive than ProActiv although it is a little more expensive than this.  &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I didn&#x27;t want to spend $40 on Proactiv, and this seemed as if it would work just as well. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few days and so far so good. The only problem is that right after using it, my skin (especially my cheeks and my nose) gets really red. The redness fades after about a half hour so it&#x27;s not too bad. Overall, I would definitely recommend this product for those of you like me who are tired of suffering from acne.</li>
            <li> I am a 2 1/2 year user of Proactiv.  This past December, it stopped working.  My forehead and chin starting breaking out.  I bought Acne Free on August 14, 2007. Today is August 22, I  can say my chin is smooth again and I have one small pimple left on my forehead. It will prolly be gone by the end of the week. I am no longer a Proactiv user. I remember when I 1st started using Proactiv I could only use it once a day because my face was so flaky.  I have not had this issue with Acne Free and I do use it twice a day.  I would like to see make up remover and other things from Acne Free.  I am a new happy user.</li>
            <li> i wouldnt say i have terrible acne(thankfully) but i still want my skin to be clear. everything ive tried worked OK. just not to where i wanted. when i started using Acne Free, within 2 or three days i had MORE pimples all over, my face was red..it was just not pretty. i started using proactiv and in less than a week my skin was clear. that doesnt of course mean it&#x27;s not going to work for anyone. it just did not work for me.</li>
            <li> I break out on my chin and forehead. I used this stuff to solve my problem..... It didn&#x27;t my skin became worse all of my trouble spots swelled and I started getting a rash and peeling skin from using this product for 3 days!</li>
            <li> $40 i normally only pay $20 at walmart and i just bought 2 for $10.99 each love the product but its way over priced here</li>
            <li> This may be the first review I&#x27;ve ever written, but this product has worked so well for me, I had to.  I&#x27;ve never really had acne my whole life up until the last couple of years. It has been bad, very bad. I thought for awhile I had rosacea bc it was flared up so bad. I had deep acne, way down in my pores and all these terrible red bubbles all over my cheeks. I have literally tried everything, especially all natural home remedies; honey, turmeric, tomato, lemon juice, Apple cider vinegar, yogurt, egg whites, ice cubes, I can&#x27;t even remember what all I&#x27;ve rubbed on my face lol but nothing seemed to tame this beast of acne on my face. I found this 3 step system at Ross for like $8.99, half priced, so i was like it&#x27;s only $10, I&#x27;ll try it. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about 3 weeks and omggg my face looks better than it has in a longggg time. I only have a few little bumps left on my face, that are slowly disappearing. Idk if this works for everyone but it has been a God send for me. The only reason I wrote this is bc I constantly read reviews before I spend my hard earned money on something, as I did before I bought this, but this is worth it, even at full price.</li>
            <li> Did not work for my teenager.</li>
            <li> This product appeared to work at first but then made my skin even worse than before. After this I switched right to proactiv and my skin is now Acnefree because of proavtic!!</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin which makes me prone to breaking out. I started using this product about year ago and it does a great job.  In the event that I do break out, this product helps expedite the recovery period.  I&#x27;ve used the Murad line for acne skin and found this product worked better for a fraction of the price!  Be sure to use white towels and cover your shirts when using this product as it will bleach your stuff!  While this make sense given the ingredients in this product, it took several ruined shirts and towels before I \\&quot;got\\&quot; it!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and works well if used twice a day. I ordered/paid for the Acne Free 3-piece kit from Pharmapacks on 8/14/12. Amazon contact me through email on 8/21/12 stating they had no shipping information. Pharamapacks informed me the next day that the item was out of stock, and would be shipped by the end of that week. I finally cancelled the order today, 9/1/12, as it had never been shipped and they had never contacted me again. They did offer me a discount coupon for my next order, which will never happen. I drove to my local store and paid less for it than Pharamapacks was charging.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Im going to the dermatologist soon :(</li>
            <li> It works. but be careful, It&#x27;ll stain your pillow case and towels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about two weeks. Skin is clearing up but I&#x27;m cleaning the inside too. It&#x27;s hard to tell what&#x27;s doing the clearing up.</li>
            <li> This product worked great. Started to see results in 3 days and after 2 weeks acne is no longer on my face. Never got that result from any other acne treatment. Great price too.</li>
            <li> We have been booby that the product the rest of the month Does it fit this thing I want financial returns immediately</li>
            <li> my child skin  cleard up thanks to ance free .she is happy wth this product the toner is great.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Noticed a difference within a few days.</li>
            <li> I ordered this set and expected it to take about 5 days to get delivered. 2-3 days after I ordered it, it arrived. I was VERY happy with how prompt the shipping was and that the product was as described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also happen to love this line... so much cheaper than Proactiv and just as good (if not better!) It works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I bought this in hope of it clearing up my moderate acne (I am 16) I did not notice a difference. I also hoped it would shrink my pores which it did not do. I did not think this product did anything to be honest. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all after using it everyday for 4 months... so i went to the derm. and got cream from him (hopefully that works). ALso i eat very healthy and take vitamins. Maybe it works for others but not for me...</li>
            <li> I guess it works for some and doesn&#x27;t for some people! It didn&#x27;t work with me.. i i i i</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t think stuff like this and proactive would work, but they do. I think it really depends on the person. Also, it must applied twice a day every day. If you miss a day here and then, you shouldn&#x27;t expect good results. You also have too keep in mind good acne prevention tips, like not touching your face and washing pillows often.&lt;br /&gt;but ya I found that proactive works really well but it was too expensive. This is prefect price, lasts me 5 months. ANd i use it every day twice a day. it works just as good or better than proactive</li>
            <li> I am 24 years old and have moderate adult acne and very oily skin. This works well for the major problems but doesn&#x27;t clean up the real small bumps or blackheads. It is far cheaper than Proactiv(which i used to use) and works almost as good or just as good. I have gone without using this product, just to see if I still need it, and a week after not using, my face breaks out horribly. I still get a few large zits (mostly just before my period). IN THIS PRODUCTS DEFENSE, I only use in the morning. I generally fall asleep with makeup on (all natural, mineral makeup) because I am too lazy to take it off (I am working on this). I have consistently been using this system for 18 months and in those 18 months I have noticed my skin has become oily. I am searching for a system specifically for oily skin.</li>
            <li> Works well. Not exactly like proactiv- this formula left my skin SO dry. Like sucked the moisture out of my skin and I couldn&#x27;t get it back to normal for weeks. But clears up acne!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 female and pretty healthy. So far I really like it. I have mild acne and sometimes it flares up from stress, drinking, etc. This stuff really does work. Hoepfully it continues to work. I saw results within a week. It makes your skin dry at first, like taught, so I only use the repair cream once a day before bed and the toner &amp; wash twice. It is working well for me. I&#x27;m on birth control, too...if that is of any use to the ladies.</li>
            <li> I have used the product for the last 4 years and it&#x27;s the only product that keeps my facial blemishes under control and my skin looking good.</li>
            <li> This kit work very well on my 13 yrs old son, highly recommend this product and seller.</li>
            <li> Love it and so much cheaper than proactiv. Really helps with my skin.  Would recommend it to everyone with problem skin.</li>
            <li> Used this product for 5 days...First 2 days were okay...3rd day bumps appeared on back..5th day bumps were red and irrated and the rash spread to neck and face...had to go to a dermatologist for steroid cream...I think it was the toner...Maybe a bad batch...the company rep couldn&#x27;t comment and the last number of the lot was missing..</li>
            <li> It burns my face soo bad! To the point of crying and needing to wash it off... this burns my face so bad!</li>
            <li> Great !!! I love it , It really works. I have tried may products and this is the only one that I have actually seen a noticeable improvement .</li>
            <li> Acnefree face wash poisons your water and food with plastic polyethylene microbeads that are too small for water treatment to filter out.  These plastic microbeads bond with algae and get eaten by fish.  There is no practical purpose for these microbeads given that using a cotton pad with their step 2 toner exfoliates better than microbeads.  Illinois and New York have banned microbeads.  Other states are following -- but, not fast enough.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microbeads  TELL THE MANUFACTURER TO TAKE OUT THE POISON PLASTIC BEADS FROM THEIR PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> my step-daughter and i generally have a difficult time finding things to talk about without it becoming an argument...... so when i got the chance to try Acne free for no cost, i thought it would be a good opportunity for her to try something new for her skin. at 14, she knows all about taking selfies but usually filters them or piles on the makeup. a funny thing happened though, acne free actually works, quite well! she has been using another seen on TV system for quite some time but still has frequent breakouts and oily skin. the morning after using it for the first time she awoke to find that the breakout on her forehead was not as red and puffy as it had been...... 3 days later the breakout was actually going away....... at day 7 she excitedly sent me a pic and was actually chatting with me about how surprised she was to see such a remarkable difference in her skin, breakouts clearing up, less oil and more of a natural glow. not only has this given her a self esteem boost and noticeably better skin, it&#x27;s opened up a line of communication (no matter how small) between us, given us something to chat about and for this moment in time given us something that is ours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> i bought this stuff trying to save a few bucks b/c it claims to be better than proactiv. after using proactiv for a month, then trying this stuff, acnefree doesn&#x27;t compare to proactiv. granted, this is better than a bar of soap, but it&#x27;s definately worth spending the extra $20 to get proactiv.</li>
            <li> Obviously I would have rather tried proactive, but money being short I tried this instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In two days, my skin was totally cleared up. In four, it felt better and looked better than it had in years. I have adult acne that just appeared when I got pregnant and doesn&#x27;t seem to want to go away, so this has been really helpful. THough I agree that my lotion was gritty, which I didn&#x27;t like, and doesn&#x27;t feel very moist.... my skin looks so much better I&#x27;m not going to complain about it. Yeah, it bleaches out my towel. So I got a towel to use just for that. No big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I totally reccommend this product, as long as you don&#x27;t have dry or sensitive skin. It&#x27;s awesome!</li>
            <li> I have not try Proactive. The thought of buying something from an infomercial just doesn&#x27;t sit well with me.  I, however, have tried many many products since my 20s till now (I&#x27;m 35). I spent thousands of dollars on expense department store&#x27;s brands like Clarins, Seshiedo, Dior, Clinics, Chanel, and Prescriptives. I&#x27;ve also religiously go to my derma every three weeks for the past ten years to have facials, extractions, and chemical peels.  I tried perscription cream, oitments, pads, you name it (even thought of laser).  I have mild acne problem year round, and it only gets worst during that time of the month (that&#x27;s when I&#x27;d run out and try new products). &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Three days ago I bought the Zeno.  I&#x27;m going to return it.  It did nothing to me accept thought it would burn me.  I also bought AcneFree and today I went back and bought another package to put in my gym bag.  Three days now, I&#x27;ve noticed my skin cleared up! I&#x27;m amazed.  I&#x27;m not giving it a 5 star because my skin is not completely cleared.  I&#x27;ll give it a try two more weeks and will update my rating if it improve.  So far AcneFree works for me.</li>
            <li> This series of products has cleared up my daughter&#x27;s pimples and significantly reduced her blackheads.  In addition, it is simple to use, and the instructions are clear.  She usually had several large painful pimples on her face and numerous large blackheads on her nose.  After using this for one week, her pimples have disappeared and she now only has 3 or 4 small blackheads on her nose.  This is real progress!</li>
            <li> I have used both proactiv and acnefree and am here to tell you that acne free works equally well for me at half the price, without the annoying membership, and I don&#x27;t have to pay (or wait) for shipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t start having problems with acne until my mid 20s and tried a number of products with no success. When I started using proactiv I was amazed at the clarity it gave my skin - for the first time in several years people were commenting on how great my skin looked and wanted to know what I was using. I would stretch those three, pricey, bottles out for as long as possible but never dreamt of changing products until I spotted acnefree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must admit I was hesitant to try acnefree as I really do believe that you (usually) get what you pay for and thought it was too good to be true. Imagine my shock when my skin looked fantastic again (I had gone off of proactiv for a few months because of my hatred for their automatic shipping program and their policy of making you argue with an employee to cancel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, the third step is a bit gritty - but it does the job. And I always run out of the toner before the other two (the same thing happened with proactiv) but I just use witch hazel in it&#x27;s place. The bottom line is that my skin looks incredible, for half the price and none of the frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, for reference, I do consider my skin somewhat sensitive, have rosacea, and only use this product at night. I don&#x27;t wash my face in the morning - just rinse with warm then cold water. I had moderate acne before I started to use acnefree (nothing cystic) and do find it necessary to use a moisturizer after the third step.</li>
            <li> My 13 year old daughter used this and proactive. It won&#x27;t work because in the real world my daughter like a lot of other teens are lazy and make their parents waste money on this stuff and don&#x27;t use it right. These kind of products are for people who stay consistant and aren&#x27;t lazy. If you miss a couple treatments your face will break out worse than it ever has. She now uses a treatment kind of like the one on acne.org, it works good for her. Just remember to be consistant if you buy this, I heard it works great.</li>
            <li> I have tried Proactiv and it works great but I got tired of ordering it online, etc.  So I tried AcneFree, which I could buy locally and was not expensive.  It definitely cleared up my skin, but I couldn&#x27;t figure out how my pillowcases and towels were getting huge bleach spots on them.  I know there is a warning on the side of the box for this, but I never thought I could wash my face and go to bed about an hour later and it still bleach my pillowcase.  My sheets and towels are brown, so it must be something with those dyes and this product.  I have used a green towel too and it didn&#x27;t bleach that at all.  I just think it is kind of scary the level of chemicals that I was putting on my face for it to bleach these fabrics.  It isn&#x27;t like the product had direct contact, it had been washed off my face with water and dried.  Proactiv never bleached any fabrics, so they must use something that isn&#x27;t as harsh.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product mainly because it can ruin your linens and it just can&#x27;t be good for your skin if it is that harsh.</li>
            <li> I began using Acnefree over 3 years ago.  I have tried all sorts of treatments including many prescription medications and even antibiotics.  However, Acnefree is better than all of them.  It does take time to work - any new treatment for Acne takes 6 weeks to become fully effective.  That is because the best way to treat acne is prevent it, not try and clear it up.  It is important to use Acnefree when your skin is clear as a preventative measure to prevent blocked oil glands.    I started using the 3 step process twice daily, for many months.  However, as I didn&#x27;t have a single zit, I changed to once daily.  When my face remained clear, I went to just using the cleanser once daily in the shower.  I still use the lotion when my skin is dry, but the cleanser alone keeps me free.    Remember, not everything works for everybody.  But as a mild benzoyl peroxide product, this one is great.  Other reviewers that it can bleach towels and clothing are correct - this is true of all benzoyl peroxide preparations.  I just use it in the shower, and haven&#x27;t had any problems.    Give it a try!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  Just like ProActive, but honestly, I think better.  Child&#x27;s acne problem that has been quite an issue cleared up in only a few days.  She has stuck with the regime and has noticed less break outs and smoother skin.  Gentle and pleasant aroma.  Not gritty.  Very good price for the product.  It is a winner also.  I bought this product because she told me about it, I am glad word of mouth is still the way we share good news.</li>
            <li> This product really irritated my daughter&#x27;s skin. It became very dry and red after use. I received this product free to try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 19 year old and I&#x27;ve never had serious acne. The worst I&#x27;ve had is three or four pimples at a time. I had been getting them mostly on my cheeks, and I wanted something that would get rid of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, the first time I used AcneFree, I did it exactly as they told us to. First I cleansed my face, then I used the toner and then I used the moisturizer. Within a week I noticed it was leaving my skin extremely dry, but I continued doing it. Within two weeks my skin started PEELING, so I stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few months later I found a neglected AcneFree cleanser and decided to use it. The cleanser&#x27;s great! On days when my face gets really oily the cleanser seems to just suck out the oil--without leaving my face TOO dry. I skip the toner these days, and I use a combination of the cleanser and the moisturizer. However, instead of using the  moisturizer all over my face as I had done before, I now only use it on my cheeks, where pimples are likely to strike. Works like a charm! The moisturizer is heavily drying so you don&#x27;t want too much of that on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t broken out in the longest time, and my skin feels and looks nicer than it&#x27;s ever felt! I&#x27;m not sure if AcneFree is the reason why my skin looks better, because it occurred to me that maybe my breakouts were just meant to stop occurring at this age or something. BUT, I will continue to use AcneFree just in case.</li>
            <li> ABSO love it works really really fast. I also use it on my inner thighs and back and its the only thing (especially the lotion) that has EVER worked on my inner thighs. I get it there every month during the &amp;#34;cycle&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> Good sale. Product was as advertised, I haven&#x27;t used it at this time so this isn&#x27;t overly appropriate. Thank you.</li>
            <li> received package successfully! bottles are in great condition and are operational! box is a little scathed but as long as the stuff works im satisfied! lol</li>
            <li> tried as a cheaper alternative for ProActiv and was not satisfied. Wish it had more of a gritty texture for exfoliating. I wash my face at the end of a shower and it stained my shower curtain where my hand touches it to open.</li>
            <li> The only thing worth it from this kit is the acne lotion.  Shipping was fast, and package was nice.</li>
            <li> I used it 3 days ago and now I&#x27;m sitting here waiting to go to my doctor appointment.  Used ACNEFREE as directed and my face has grown more and more red, burning growing worse by the hour, my face and eyes are swollen horribly.  I would take acne over this experience!  I&#x27;m in pain.  I&#x27;m fearing the damage that I&#x27;ve done to my skin by trying this product.  DON\\&quot;T USE this product. I am a 35 year old woman who has never had a reaction to any product.  I do not have sensitive skin.  I have used ProActive for years and thought that this might be a great less expensive alternative.  Be careful!</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t find a better price anywhere</li>
            <li> We tried this product for my teenage daughter.  She loves how it works, and we&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement of her skin since using Acne Free.  The product doesn&#x27;t dry out her skin, like other products have.  I would recommend this to anyone who has acne problems.  A great product and a great value!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Disclaimer:  I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for over 5 years; it made a huge difference from the first time I used it to this day!!! Proactive did not work at all for me and dried my skin out to the point it was cracking and scaley. It was so painful I stopped using Proactive within a week. I would get the crop of whiteheads all over my forehead and chin, along with huge and painful cysts on my cheeks and nose. I tried prescription face wash, topical creams, and oral antibiotics, but none of it worked. I saw this product in WalMart and was very skeptical because it appeared to be a generic knock off of the ineffective Proactive. However, since the price was so low, I figured I would give it a try. My skin is smooth and silky now with only a rare blemish every once in a blue moon, and that is more hormonal from monthly menses. My makeup applies better, my acne scars have faded, no peeling, and no painful dryness. If I don&#x27;t use this product for even one day, my face breaks out again. I don&#x27;t know what they put in this stuff but it works for me! My only caution warning is that the face wash and lotion will bleach your towels/linens so beware; I specifically use a white towel just for my face after cleansing. As for my pillow cases and the random shirt collar, its worth a little bleaching effect for this clear skin!</li>
            <li> As I write this, my face is one huge, swollen, itchy, red welt. I look deformed and am in a great deal of pain. I have normal skin with a recent occurrence of acne after my pregnancy and have never had a reaction to any product like this. I used the cleanser, toner and lotion last night and woke up feeling like I was punched in the face. Very unpleasant. Beware of the harshness of this product.</li>
            <li> expiry date until August, so low price.&lt;br /&gt;I started to use in April and a month or two came to naught rash on the chest and back, the skin was cleaned and I&#x27;m not afraid to go at the beach in a swimwear. I have a rash of unknown origin and with it a little, that copes.&lt;br /&gt;This kit helped. But only clothes after these funds in the area of application on the body, fade when washed and ends quickly tonic. And all I recommend to try this is an acceptable price :)</li>
            <li> So cheap as compared to stores. I love this face wash. It keeps my skin clear</li>
            <li> At first I wasn&#x27;t sure about this product because all other products had the same reviews. I tried it and it worked. It took  about a month to work. I occasionaly get acne and this makes your face dry but its the best thing right now.</li>
            <li> I remember using this product a few years ago when my mother had me use it. I haven&#x27;t used it in a long time, and recently bought this kit again. I am 15 with oily skin and terrible acne. I got this because my Neutrogena face wash is getting less and less effective. Needless to say, I&#x27;m happy with the transition! In just ONE day, half of my acne was gone! O_O Great product, just as good as I remember.</li>
            <li> This is a great product, it really works. Just use it following the directions and in about a month you will start to see the results.</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying that I don&#x27;t usually take the time to write reviews, but I was compelled to do so because I&#x27;ve seen tremendous results with this product. I have had moderate to severe acne since I was about 15 years old. I am now 24, and after 9 years of wasting money on dermatologist visits, prescription face washes, antibiotics, Proactive, Clinique&#x27;s acne solutions, etc., I have finally found THE ONE! I have never had a product that worked so well and so quickly. My skin has never been more clear, and it started working in less than a week! I do have moderately sensitive skin, therefore I can only use this product once a day, and I usually follow up with a noncomedogenic moisturizer to help alleviate some of the dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few more tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to be in the sun, WEAR SUNSCREEN! This stuff will make your face burn very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure you never miss a day. I haven&#x27;t done so, but based on the many reviews I&#x27;ve read, your skin will bounce right back to square one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros soooooo outweigh the cons, and it&#x27;s extremely affordable!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m one happy acne free girl!!!</li>
            <li> Good product for the price. Came as expected</li>
            <li> Quick delivery , great product. I have cleared up within one day! Yes!!!!</li>
            <li> struggled with cystic acne for years. not a bad product really effective! worth the money</li>
            <li> This was a great product except that i had to stop using it because it made my skin so dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> I brought this for my kids so far it&#x27;s working well for them.</li>
            <li> I usually do not write reviews for products but I love to read reviews prior to buying.  So I hope this can be helpful for others that are struggling with acne.  I have never had a real acne problem, even during the teenage years.  I had beautiful skin throughout my 20&#x27;s then became pregnant in my late 20&#x27;s/30&#x27;s and still no skin problems.  Then I was finally done being pregnant and breastfeeding then \\&quot;BAM\\&quot; I started having teenage skin problems!  I was so shocked, embarrassed and didn&#x27;t know what to do...I tried just regular face cleaner, clinique, spot treatment of benzyol peroxide and nothing helped it.  I thought it was all hormone related and was just doomed.I started reading reviews of many different products so I thought I would give Acne free a chance.  It has been only 5 days and my face is finally starting to return back to normal.  The breakouts I did have are much smaller and are slowly going away.  I did notice results as early as 2 days.  I can tell it is drying so I use all 3 products on my \\&quot;problem areas\\&quot; and use my regular lotion on the rest of my skin.  Very inexpensive, I paid $20, its worth giving it a try!</li>
            <li> Awful on my face!! Made my face hurt it was so harse...returned it!! Neutrogena much better!! Not worth the money.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best I have ever tried for clear skin. The toner is amazing</li>
            <li> my mom bought this for me bc she said i had really bad acne. in the first week it didnt work but overtime like three weeks my face started to clear up &amp; i didnt even notice until my friend said my face looked clearer. i guess just give it some time?</li>
            <li> I also have very sensitive skin. From reading reviews here I had a idea on what to do. I started out once a day before bed. I left my face wet which is important and applied the cleanser starting out without rubbing first couple of days and did not leave on long. I increased rubbing a little more harder and longer over time. Rinse and I applied toner lightly to dry skin and then a little more as time went by. I put a little in my palm and applied with my fingers. Works better. Same with repair lotion. Rinse first and apply lightly on dry skin and dab more on trouble spots. May the combination of wet skin or dry helps. I also put a very little on a zit in the morning but nothing more, just that. Very noticeably results in two days and cleared up in a week. I&#x27;m staying with once a day. I was in bad shape with bad break outs and it hurt. This works. The only thing I would like is maybe a little more grit in the  cleanser. You can control that by how hard you rub if at all and the grit gets rid of dry skin. Again wet face with cleanser. For reference I used Pro**** and it did not work at all. Klear Action worked better but is discontinued. That I would give 5+ stars. I appreciate all the reviews here because I can weed out between another company or hired firm trying to badmouth another. Or the other side of the coin promoting when something does not work. I only use Amazon reviews not the internet for everything I purchase, here or not.</li>
            <li> Serves the purpose. Will order agin when needed.</li>
            <li> This skin system really worked well for me. I found that it dried out my skin if I used it twice a day, so I switched to using it once and the dryness stopped. It&#x27;s much cheaper than proactive and works well. I also found that I went through the renewing toner much faster than the cleanser and wash.</li>
            <li> I paid just over $8 for this as an add on item, walmart sells the exact same product for about 20 bucks.I believe I used this as a teen myself, now 30 years old I purchased it for my tween. It works very well just as good as proactive. Would purchase again.</li>
            <li> You can buy this MUCH cheaper at Target, CVS, or Kmart.You can spend between $20-24 depending on which store you buy it at. This price on AMAZON is more than what I pay for AcneFree Severe which is much stronger, includes 4 bottles, and costs more at any store you buy it (between $21.89-31. However, for this exact product you can pay $21.89 for at Target. Kmart sells it for $20. CVS sells this product for $19-24 depending on promotional sales.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a tip, so you do not waste money paying EXTRA for the product and then EXTRA for shipping &amp; handling.</li>
            <li> Expire of medicine to close, I bought 8 for 8 mounths, but expire on medicines 08/2015 I don&#x27;t know what to do????</li>
            <li> I have been using Acne Free for about 7 weeks now and I am disappointed with the results. I have suffered with Acne since my teen years and even saw a dermatologist for over a year. My complexion got a lot better and then started to decline about 2 years ago when I stopped using birth control. I started using over the counter treatments to no avail. I saw all the great reviews about Acne Free and decided to give it a try. The first two weeks were miserable. My breakouts got progressively worse and my skin was really irritated and dry. I limited the use to once a day and got a good moisturizer, which helped with the dryness. I read on this website to give the medicine a good 4-6 weeks, so I stuck in there. I have not seen a decline in the breakouts. When I do get a new pimple it is pretty painful and sensitive to the touch. The marks from old pimples have not faded and are pretty noticeable. I am not sure if I will continue using this product. Results will always vary from person to person so I am glad I did not get my hopes up. This product has not worked for me. Unfortunately I might have to make another trip to the dermatologist and spend more money than I’d like.</li>
            <li> We received this for free to sample and it is amazing! My skin is clear and looks really healthy! It also does not dry out your skin like other brands do, I highly recommend it to any one with acne problems I also love how affordable it is.</li>
            <li> I received this product free for the purpose of reviewing it. First I have to say that I have tried proactive and it contains sulfur. I&#x27;m allergic to sulfur so proactive made my break outs worse. I tried this product after coming home from vacation. My skin was broken out because of sunscreen and junk food. It cleared my surface acne in three days. However, for the deeper bumps I don&#x27;t think this would work. It&#x27;s very drying. I used carrot seed oil to remove the dry skin and that worked within 2 days. Honestly the best thing for clear skin is a good diet and drinking water. For the times when I fail to eat right, this will clear it up. Thanks AcneFree</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get to try AcneFree 24 hour acne clearing system from Smiley360. It is dermatologist recommended. It continuously treats all stages of acne 24 hours a day which means a lot. Use twice daily for your skin to stay clear and it is a easy 3 step program. It has a oil free purifying cleanser, renewing toner and repair lotion and comes in a very attractive packaging with easy instructions. Visible results in 1-3 days. I would give this product a 5 and I don&#x27;t mind leaving my house worrying about how my skin looks. This is the best product hands down that I have used and I have used my fair share of acne products. This is my new go to acne product.</li>
            <li> the product was expired in 2014 , this is an abuse and theft.They hid the expiration date with a label and the seal is broken</li>
            <li> I got to try this for free from Smiley 360 for my son.  The poor guy (a teen of course) had huge acne breakouts which made him feel so bad we have tried every product known to man with little to no results so I was a little skeptical about trying another product only to be let down. This is really simple to do in 3 simple steps Step 1: Wash your face with Oil-free Purifying Cleanser.•Step 2: After cleansing, apply Renewing Toner.&lt;br /&gt;•Step 3: Before you go out or go to sleep, apply Repair Lotion. and in less than 8 weeks he was completely clear with no breakouts.  He is so happy and his confidence is coming back .  I am so thrilled we just love this product.  &amp;#34;I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100% my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleased as punch to have the opportunity for my son to try this product. He just turned 13 in December and I have really started to notice a change in his skin. He went from having baby soft skin to having &amp;#34;face demons/pimples&amp;#34;. As A teen(and even as an adult) I have also struggled with acne issues to I hated to see him dealing with this. The system is straight forward and very easy to use. These photos are just a span of 2 weeks and you can see what a difference it made on his face. It is gentle yet effective and does a wonderful job.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free from smiley360 and the review is based on my opinion only.  I just this product on my 12 year old daughter who has been struggling with acne.  We have tried many protried with little results.  After getting this my daughter washed her face before bed and in the morning I had already noticed a difference.  The t zone on her face had started to clear.  It&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t a major difference but it was noticeable. She has continued to use the product with great results.  Her acne is almost cleared completely up and she is really happy. This product is amazing and the price is great.</li>
            <li> Not sure this is doing anything more or less than Proactive would.  2 months for my daughter using it and no improvement.  I guess we will have to just spend the $ and get Proactive to see if there is really any difference between the products.</li>
            <li> I received AcneFree 3 step products as a free sample from Smiley360. After using it for the first week, I quickly noticed the difference....my acne went away. On the second week, my skin started drying off and it was leaving a burning sensation and redness on my cheeks. I have a very sensitive skin so  that explains why. I would still recommend this product to people who doesn&#x27;t have a sensitive skin. I like that it&#x27;s very effective, affordable , and can be found in any store.</li>
            <li> I love Proactic but it&#x27;s too expensive so i tried this because it&#x27;s supposed to be just as effective...so not true. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a month and my face hasn&#x27;t cleared up at all. I keep getting pimples and my face stays oily. I guess I&#x27;ll stick to the price of Proactiv to achieve the results I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
            <li> bought it for a friend who had acne. She loves it! it cleans all the bumps out!</li>
            <li> My name&#x27;s Grace and I am a teenager who deals with Moderate acne. I have struggled with acne since I was 13 and have tried multiple products and some have worked. I used a prescription that was given to me for two years and then my face began to be burned by the product I was using so I knew I had to get something else for my acne. My friend recommended this too me and said it worked great for her. For me, it did not. I have oily skin, especially in the T-zone of my face and I used this acne system for about three days and all it did was made my face very shiny and oily and it was bad. It seemed like my acne got worse after using it. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for oily skin people but maybe I&#x27;m just an oddball. But this product did not work for me but if you don&#x27;t have oily skin I would give it shot, what do you have to lose.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T BUY THIS PRODUCT ONLINE. It&#x27;s around $20 at RiteAid, Walgreens, Target etc. I&#x27;ve been using this system for about 3 months now, and I love it. I wish I had discovered it a long time ago. I&#x27;m in my late 20s and never really had acne as a teenager, but a few years ago I started breaking out. Before using AcneFree I ALWAYS had at least a zit or 2 - if not several - every single day. Since I started using it I&#x27;ve had probably 5-7 zits TOTAL. When I do get the occasional blemish, they have been small with very little inflamation and go away within about 24-48 hours.</li>
