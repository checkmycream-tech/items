            <li>I&#x27;m sure most people use it in cooking, for that I can&#x27;t vouch.</li>
            <li>I love this grape seed oil.&lt;br</li>

            <li>I once was a massage therapist and Grapeseed oil was always my favorite massage oil.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am pleased with the oil itself.</li>
            <li>Love the way it makes skin</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I have an arsenal of oils I use, olive, coconut, pomegranate, rosehip seed oil, shea, but I think this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li>There are so many uses for Grapeseed oil</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>The grape seed oil I was using prior to this was not the best quality, and I do feel/see difference using this brand.</li>
            <li>Love this oil for washing my face.  </li>
            <li>I have bought it many, many times.  </li>
            <li>I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li>love this oil.</li>
            <li>i thought it helped to even my skin tone and my face glows more..</li>
            <li>It is just the right consistency and gives the optimum level of moisture without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I just started using this oil for the oil cleansing method and so far so good!</li>
            <li>(coconut oil can clog pores more easily than this can).</li>
            <li>More importantly, my skin looks better when I use this.</li>
            <li>Great on my natural hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Grapeseed is mildly astringent in nature and helps to tighten and tone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Grapeseed contains proanthocyanidins, which are very potent antioxidants, that help in diminishing the sun&#x27;s damaging effects and lessen free radical damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Grapeseed is mildly astringent in nature and helps to tighten and tone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Grapeseed contains proanthocyanidins, which are very potent antioxidants, that help in diminishing the sun&#x27;s damaging effects and lessen free radical damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This product being Hexane Free was very important to me.</li>
            <li>does not absorb as quickly as coconut oil and leaves the skin the perfect amount of oily (which I love) while still penetratig deep</li>
            <li>The price was very good as well, cheaper than my local store.  </li>
            <li>I do self facial massage with this oil, and it is very good quality.  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li>So far its great</li>
            <li>This oil appears to be good quality, and is very competitively priced.  </li>
            <li>I ordered grapeseed and received sweet almond!</li>
            <li>I love grape seed oil as it is a great carrier oil for essential oils and does not clog pores or upset acne and absorbs so well into skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&amp;#34;The flavonoid &#x27;oligomeric procyanidin&#x27;, found in grape seed oil is an incredibly strong antioxidant, about 50 times stronger than antioxidants like, vitamin C and E.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend for BEAUTIFUL SKIN.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite oil for the face as it does not cause break outs, it absorbs easily and quickly and does not leave you feeling oily.</li>
            <li>Perfect for sealing in moisture without making my hair greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li>Many go rancid quickly and smell funky.</li>
            <li>But I quickly fixed that by putting another top on it that I had; I love the oil!</li>
            <li>It absorbs great, has no scent to interfere with the scents of EOs, and the fact that it is cold-pressed and hexane free are all big deal breakers.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>Great product I use this as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li>I apply it to my face, neck and hair and it makes everything feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li>Great carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
            <li>My skin felt smooth &amp; I didn&#x27;t have any oil stains on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>So, this compound can provide protection against cellular and tissue damage caused by free radicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The 3 stars is only because the smell wasn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li>Works great as a carrier oil for mixing with essential oils</li>
            <li>Great for my skin and hair especially during winter time.</li>
            <li>Good for my sensitive skin that is prone to acne &amp; rosacea.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re trying to go natural, this is a good oil.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>use it now has skin moisturizer, alternating with coconut oil, but Grapeseed oil absorbs much more quickly and does not harden (in the container) in cool weather like coconut oil, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Great for all over body treatments and all natural, no weird unpronounceable ingredients.  </li>
            <li>love that it is very gentle.</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and it a great carrier oil for essential oils.  </li>
            <li>I have used this specific brand of grapeseed oil (hexane free) for over 3 months and have found it to be the best suited for oily combination skin with adult cystic acne.  </li>
            <li>Fortunately the bottle was still mostly full.</li>
            <li>I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Works great on my dry ends.</li>
            <li>The feel of Grapeseed is very close to Jojoba, goes and good, and you can really feel the lubrication and nurturing your skin and hair are getting.</li>
            <li>but my feet feel nice and soft!  </li>
            <li>I liked the product, my skin was super soft and smooth afterwords.</li>
            <li>This grapeseed oil is great for chapped or rough hands and skin.  </li>
            <li>Fabulous yet economical product.</li>
            <li>Nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>This is fresh and light without any fragrance.  </li>
            <li>Ordered 100% Grapeseed Oil and received Sweet Almond oil instead.  </li>
            <li>I guess I&#x27;ll use the Sweet Almond instead.  </li>
            <li>Also good for keeping my hair and scalp moisturized (especially my ends).</li>
            <li>/&gt;Though the original intention for the oil has been tossed out, it has proved to be useful.</li>
            <li>Great to mix with other oils as well.</li>
            <li>it helps tremendously on my rosacea.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I hadn&#x27;t bought anything that could have gotten ruined.</li>
            <li>I like that the scenct DOES NOT cover up what you add it to  EVEN SOMETHING AS MILD AS BABY</li>
            <li>This product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it as a carrier oil for several weeks now and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li>Easy to order and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>quickly and was priced right.  </li>
            <li>Odorless, light and pure.</li>
            <li>This product is 100% pure and HEXANE FREE.</li>
            <li>But if you take a dime sized amount of this and tousle it through your damp (like 2 minutes out of the shower damp) hair, it will smooth frizz really well.</li>
            <li>My elbows and feet are smooth which is unusual for me.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say the same for my face, but I am thrilled with how the skin on my neck has responded.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, the oil is worth it.  </li>
            <li>I hope my next package is more secure.</li>
            <li>and it still feels baby soft and luscious and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy:)</li>
            <li>so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that I absolutely love this oil.  </li>
            <li>after I did  facial mask and my skin felt and looked so nice.  </li>
            <li>I do like to use this as a &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; when I&#x27;ve freshly washed my hair and want that fresh out of the shop shine.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li>I use it right out of the shower and my skin</li>
            <li>The price was right for the quality though.  </li>
            <li>Price is right.</li>
            <li>and I would recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s looking for a light oil would recommend it highly</li>
            <li>I love the bottle it&#x27;s packaged in because it has the flip lid so that you have more control over dispensing the oil and less risk of wasting it.</li>
            <li>fabulous and pure product  arrived fast and well packaged</li>
            <li>Large amount for the price!  </li>
            <li>Absorbs quickly and makes skin feel super soft!  </li>
            <li>I have a prime membership so of course I has very fast shipping.</li>
            <li>This product seemed very much like the grapeseed oils I have bought before</li>
            <li>Started using on my face, very gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li>Bottle was wrapped in plastic, but the top wasn&#x27;t on securely and leaked onto other products in the box.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a huge difference in my skin!</li>
            <li>I suspect that my face wrinkles will improve dramatically when I retire ;)</li>
            <li>also use it as a body facial moisturizer and love it.  </li>
            <li>The price was reasonable and the grapeseed oil smelled fresh.</li>
            <li>Please make sure that it is  intact next time.  </li>
            <li>It was my first time using this brand</li>
            <li>It is a large bottle and the price was right.</li>
            <li>It does exactly what is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li>Actually relieves the crepey looking skin under the arms and the top of the thigh.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>It feels silky and has no weird smell.</li>
            <li>Fights free radicals which helps to keep pores clear and prevents breakouts</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using it consistently as an all-over body lotion for about 4 months, and my skin has never been so soft, smooth, and radiant.  </li>
            <li>Ok, so this oil is the blue ribbon baby for me, one I will not be without.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time trying Grape seed Oil for my hair.</li>
            <li>Came exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>i thought i didnt like it at first</li>
            <li>#34;simplify, you are doing too much to your skin!&amp;#34;  She was right.</li>
            <li>My skin is very smooth and soft and my hair hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li>They need to check their quality control dept. or person responsible for making sure the caps and seals are on the product properly.</li>
            <li>I use it for the OCM, pretty much as described.</li>
            <li>The seal was off the bottle and stuck inside the top of the loose cap.</li>
            <li>so when it shipped the top had come loose so some of the oil had spilled out of the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Although the bottle did leak a little in shipping, the oil is great and mixes well with essential</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s great for protective or low manipulation styles since it is a tad bit heavy.</li>
            <li>Its very moisturizing, does not have a greasy feel and to put the icing on the cake</li>
            <li>Only concern is that it seemed like the cap wasn&#x27;t secure so it leaked a bit.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Best price and quality for cold pressed grape seed oil.</li>
            <li>Very healing on skin</li>
            <li>In an attempt to go more natural with skincare I have tried many different oils (jojoba, sweet almond, apricot, tamanu, seabuckthorn, argan, wheatgerm, and an array of essential oils too long to list,...) - you name it</li>
            <li>However, I really think it&#x27;s overpriced for what it is; grapeseed oil is grapeseed oil,</li>
            <li>/&gt;I was very apprehensive with the idea of applying oil to my already pore-clogged skin.</li>
            <li>Goes into skin very well.</li>
            <li>The grape seed seems to last a bit longer and has a light gape scent.</li>
            <li>I believe at the time of my purchase this was the only grape seed oil that was hexane free.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Really helps with dryness.</li>
            <li>Just a dab does your whole face without leaving it greasy or oily.</li>
            <li>and I feel really fooled into thinking I had to do that.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>and my hair look and feel much healthier.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Much greener than the picture.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s better at moisturizing than my lotion, but I can say that it doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of unknown chemicals.  </li>
            <li>It works really well to make your hair sleeker and lower the amount of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>great procuct would give 5 stars but bottle was broken and lost about 3 ounces of product</li>
            <li>looks and feels so much better not as rough as it used to be.</li>
            <li>You clean you face with two different kinds of oil.</li>
            <li>It took me a long time to find a product on Amazon.com that was hexane free.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen improvement in dry patches, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and it&#x27;s light weight.</li>
            <li>I store this in the fridge to keep it lasting longer as I&#x27;ve read and heard that grapeseed oil turns rancid rather quickly.  </li>
            <li>I use this mostly with essential oils - either carrier oil in capsule or for topical skin application.  </li>
            <li>The amount is decent for the price</li>
            <li>Product is high quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.........</li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>As other reviewers have commented on its light and fast absorption - this product will not clog your pores while doing tons of goodness to your skin.  </li>
            <li>So pure and clear.</li>
            <li>Just a little in my palm and dab lightly throughout and viola!</li>
            <li>No false advertising about natural.</li>
            <li>Great oil to extend the life of expensive lotions</li>
            <li>They&#x27;ve really earned my brand loyalty thus far.</li>
            <li>she says it really makes it soft</li>
            <li>It is rich in linoleic acid levels, which is an essential fatty acid that is quite important for the skin and cell membranes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is rich in linoleic acid levels, which is an essential fatty acid that is quite important for the skin and cell membranes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>new to oil buying .do</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive skinned.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin, rosacea &amp; eczema</li>
            <li>I also have dry hair and will wipe my oiled hands through my hair lightly when it is wet, right before styling.</li>
            <li>My skin is toner and the area around my mouth seems like it has less fine lines.  </li>
            <li>This is the answer to my wishes for mature skin!  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re planning on using it as a daily moisturizer, then make sure you only use a tiny bit.</li>
            <li>I started using grapeseed oil in place of other personal lubricants because of online recommendations, and I found that it works better than those products sold in the drugstore.  </li>
            <li>The dead-ends of my hair are nearly nonexistent!  </li>
            <li>so I use it full strength sometimes and other times, I combine it with a lotion....</li>
            <li>It was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>Smells great because it has such a faint scent.  </li>
            <li>Truly natural product.  </li>
            <li>I do have to say, that my face skin, is soft, and the wrinkles are diminishing somewhat.  </li>
            <li>This is a very inexpensive way to get all the benefits of those pricey products and have the same results.</li>
            <li>so I did some research on grapeseed oil and had no idea of the natural qualities in it..</li>
            <li>No complaints so far.</li>
            <li>I had no idea it was going to be so professional.</li>
            <li>I use it on my body and my natural hair.</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and moisturized and so it my skin.</li>
            <li>this  wow</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like the sent it leaves, but is natural obviously.&lt;br</li>
            <li>use straight and mixed with sugar for scrub,&lt;br /&gt;and added to lotions.</li>
            <li>I use it in my hair as well and makes it so soft.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The Beauty Aura grapeseed oil performs as well as the others, and the low cost prevents worry of using it too much or too often.</li>
            <li>No break outs so far.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy, absorbs well, my skin glows, it moisturizes well</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. .</li>
            <li>Removes make up like a dream and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li>This is our main oil for skin and hair outside of Jojoba which costs too much for daily use.  </li>
            <li>I use this mainly as a carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
            <li>The next morning my skin looked smooth, clear, and the little bit of redness I had was gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li>we have a higher tendencies of allergies - and after using this oil to moisturized my skin after washing (sometimes 3 or 4 times daily) has made my skin less irritated and feels so much better than the last 12 months of using other oils.  </li>
            <li>I bought it to mix with some other oil for my dry scalp and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li>I mix it with other natural oils as a hot oil treatment for my hair.</li>
            <li>Overall, this is the best massage oil base that I have used so far.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve soaked in the bath tub with some of this and tea tree oil to hydrate my skin and calm down some eczema</li>
            <li>Trying to use essential oils vs expensive facial moisturizers, after a friends recommendation-  and so far loving this!</li>
            <li>This make&#x27;s my hair soft and is good for cooking chicken as well.</li>
            <li>Since it was an ineffective treatment, it is now being used as a general skin oil on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I recommended this to my neighbor and sisters, and so far have only heard from my neighbor and she loves it!  </li>
            <li>I use this on my face at night and the difference in texture is already apparent.  </li>
            <li>but you have to use it for a little while you wont get results right away..</li>
            <li>A tiny amount goes a very long way making this large bottle a terrific value.  </li>
            <li>You could get a bigger bottle for less money at the grocery store and it would have the same exact effect.</li>
            <li>I am using it in my natural hair regimen and mixing it with Natural Shae butter and other essential oils.  </li>
            <li>It has no odor and is not heavy as long as you only use just a couple of drops.</li>
            <li>oil from grapeseed reduces LDL (bad Cholesterol) and increases HDL (good cholesterol), which in turn helps in keeping your arteries</li>

            <li> I think I just found my skins new best friend</li>

            <li> Very good price for a high quality oil.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, pretty great as a face moisturizer for summer</li>

            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> Excellent quality, I use 5-6 drops to use as a facial moisturizer at night.</li>
            <li> I used it in combination with jojoba oil and rosewater and glycerin spray, and after 1 day could already tell my skin was more moisturized, softer, brighter.</li>
            <li> My conclusion is that it is safe to use on problem skin.</li>
            <li> Will be buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love the Grapeseed oil.  </li>

            <li> i use it for massage and clients love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for massage and mix with essential oils.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure most people use it in cooking, for that I can&#x27;t vouch.</li>
            <li> I love this grape seed oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use it in many of my DIY skin care products.</li>
            <li> because I would like for it to be more economical.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the lightness and versatility of this oil.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love using this as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> I once was a massage therapist and Grapeseed oil was always my favorite massage oil.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am pleased with the oil itself.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes skin</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I have an arsenal of oils I use, olive, coconut, pomegranate, rosehip seed oil, shea, but I think this is my favorite.  </li>
            <li> There are so many uses for Grapeseed oil</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> The grape seed oil I was using prior to this was not the best quality, and I do feel/see difference using this brand.</li>
            <li> Love this oil for washing my face.  </li>
            <li> I have bought it many, many times.  </li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel.</li>
            <li> love this oil.</li>
            <li> i thought it helped to even my skin tone and my face glows more..</li>
            <li> It is just the right consistency and gives the optimum level of moisture without feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I just started using this oil for the oil cleansing method and so far so good!</li>
            <li> (coconut oil can clog pores more easily than this can).</li>
            <li> More importantly, my skin looks better when I use this.</li>
            <li> Great on my natural hair!</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grapeseed is mildly astringent in nature and helps to tighten and tone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Grapeseed contains proanthocyanidins, which are very potent antioxidants, that help in diminishing the sun&#x27;s damaging effects and lessen free radical damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grapeseed is mildly astringent in nature and helps to tighten and tone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Grapeseed contains proanthocyanidins, which are very potent antioxidants, that help in diminishing the sun&#x27;s damaging effects and lessen free radical damage.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This product being Hexane Free was very important to me.</li>
            <li> does not absorb as quickly as coconut oil and leaves the skin the perfect amount of oily (which I love) while still penetratig deep</li>
            <li> The price was very good as well, cheaper than my local store.  </li>
            <li> I do self facial massage with this oil, and it is very good quality.  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m happy with it so far.  </li>
            <li> So far its great</li>
            <li> This oil appears to be good quality, and is very competitively priced.  </li>
            <li> I ordered grapeseed and received sweet almond!</li>
            <li> I love grape seed oil as it is a great carrier oil for essential oils and does not clog pores or upset acne and absorbs so well into skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&amp;#34;The flavonoid &#x27;oligomeric procyanidin&#x27;, found in grape seed oil is an incredibly strong antioxidant, about 50 times stronger than antioxidants like, vitamin C and E.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend for BEAUTIFUL SKIN.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite oil for the face as it does not cause break outs, it absorbs easily and quickly and does not leave you feeling oily.</li>
            <li> Perfect for sealing in moisture without making my hair greasy or weighed down.</li>
            <li> Many go rancid quickly and smell funky.</li>
            <li> But I quickly fixed that by putting another top on it that I had; I love the oil!</li>
            <li> It absorbs great, has no scent to interfere with the scents of EOs, and the fact that it is cold-pressed and hexane free are all big deal breakers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> Great product I use this as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my face, neck and hair and it makes everything feel smooth and silky.  </li>
            <li> Great carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
            <li> My skin felt smooth &amp; I didn&#x27;t have any oil stains on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> So, this compound can provide protection against cellular and tissue damage caused by free radicals.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 3 stars is only because the smell wasn&#x27;t great</li>
            <li> Works great as a carrier oil for mixing with essential oils</li>
            <li> Great for my skin and hair especially during winter time.</li>
            <li> Good for my sensitive skin that is prone to acne &amp; rosacea.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re trying to go natural, this is a good oil.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> use it now has skin moisturizer, alternating with coconut oil, but Grapeseed oil absorbs much more quickly and does not harden (in the container) in cool weather like coconut oil, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Great for all over body treatments and all natural, no weird unpronounceable ingredients.  </li>
            <li> love that it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and it a great carrier oil for essential oils.  </li>
            <li> I have used this specific brand of grapeseed oil (hexane free) for over 3 months and have found it to be the best suited for oily combination skin with adult cystic acne.  </li>
            <li> Fortunately the bottle was still mostly full.</li>
            <li> I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great on my dry ends.</li>
            <li> The feel of Grapeseed is very close to Jojoba, goes and good, and you can really feel the lubrication and nurturing your skin and hair are getting.</li>
            <li> but my feet feel nice and soft!  </li>
            <li> I liked the product, my skin was super soft and smooth afterwords.</li>
            <li> This grapeseed oil is great for chapped or rough hands and skin.  </li>
            <li> Fabulous yet economical product.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.  </li>
            <li> This is fresh and light without any fragrance.  </li>
            <li> Ordered 100% Grapeseed Oil and received Sweet Almond oil instead.  </li>
            <li> I guess I&#x27;ll use the Sweet Almond instead.  </li>
            <li> Also good for keeping my hair and scalp moisturized (especially my ends).</li>
            <li> /&gt;Though the original intention for the oil has been tossed out, it has proved to be useful.</li>
            <li> Great to mix with other oils as well.</li>
            <li> it helps tremendously on my rosacea.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I hadn&#x27;t bought anything that could have gotten ruined.</li>
            <li> I like that the scenct DOES NOT cover up what you add it to  EVEN SOMETHING AS MILD AS BABY</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as a carrier oil for several weeks now and am very pleased.  </li>
            <li> Easy to order and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> quickly and was priced right.  </li>
            <li> Odorless, light and pure.</li>
            <li> This product is 100% pure and HEXANE FREE.</li>
            <li> But if you take a dime sized amount of this and tousle it through your damp (like 2 minutes out of the shower damp) hair, it will smooth frizz really well.</li>
            <li> My elbows and feet are smooth which is unusual for me.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say the same for my face, but I am thrilled with how the skin on my neck has responded.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, the oil is worth it.  </li>
            <li> I hope my next package is more secure.</li>
            <li> and it still feels baby soft and luscious and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy:)</li>
            <li> so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that I absolutely love this oil.  </li>
            <li> after I did  facial mask and my skin felt and looked so nice.  </li>
            <li> I do like to use this as a &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; when I&#x27;ve freshly washed my hair and want that fresh out of the shop shine.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I use it right out of the shower and my skin</li>
            <li> The price was right for the quality though.  </li>
            <li> Price is right.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s looking for a light oil would recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I love the bottle it&#x27;s packaged in because it has the flip lid so that you have more control over dispensing the oil and less risk of wasting it.</li>
            <li> fabulous and pure product  arrived fast and well packaged</li>
            <li> Large amount for the price!  </li>
            <li> Absorbs quickly and makes skin feel super soft!  </li>
            <li> I have a prime membership so of course I has very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product seemed very much like the grapeseed oils I have bought before</li>
            <li> Started using on my face, very gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
            <li> Bottle was wrapped in plastic, but the top wasn&#x27;t on securely and leaked onto other products in the box.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a huge difference in my skin!</li>
            <li> I suspect that my face wrinkles will improve dramatically when I retire ;)</li>
            <li> also use it as a body facial moisturizer and love it.  </li>
            <li> The price was reasonable and the grapeseed oil smelled fresh.</li>
            <li> Please make sure that it is  intact next time.  </li>
            <li> It was my first time using this brand</li>
            <li> It is a large bottle and the price was right.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what is supposed to do.  </li>
            <li> Actually relieves the crepey looking skin under the arms and the top of the thigh.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> It feels silky and has no weird smell.</li>
            <li> Fights free radicals which helps to keep pores clear and prevents breakouts</li>
            <li> Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using it consistently as an all-over body lotion for about 4 months, and my skin has never been so soft, smooth, and radiant.  </li>
            <li> Ok, so this oil is the blue ribbon baby for me, one I will not be without.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time trying Grape seed Oil for my hair.</li>
            <li> Came exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> i thought i didnt like it at first</li>
            <li> #34;simplify, you are doing too much to your skin!&amp;#34;  She was right.</li>
            <li> My skin is very smooth and soft and my hair hydrated and soft.</li>
            <li> They need to check their quality control dept. or person responsible for making sure the caps and seals are on the product properly.</li>
            <li> I use it for the OCM, pretty much as described.</li>
            <li> The seal was off the bottle and stuck inside the top of the loose cap.</li>
            <li> so when it shipped the top had come loose so some of the oil had spilled out of the bottle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Although the bottle did leak a little in shipping, the oil is great and mixes well with essential</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s great for protective or low manipulation styles since it is a tad bit heavy.</li>
            <li> Its very moisturizing, does not have a greasy feel and to put the icing on the cake</li>
            <li> Only concern is that it seemed like the cap wasn&#x27;t secure so it leaked a bit.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Best price and quality for cold pressed grape seed oil.</li>
            <li> Very healing on skin</li>
            <li> In an attempt to go more natural with skincare I have tried many different oils (jojoba, sweet almond, apricot, tamanu, seabuckthorn, argan, wheatgerm, and an array of essential oils too long to list,...) - you name it</li>
            <li> However, I really think it&#x27;s overpriced for what it is; grapeseed oil is grapeseed oil,</li>
            <li> /&gt;I was very apprehensive with the idea of applying oil to my already pore-clogged skin.</li>
            <li> Goes into skin very well.</li>
            <li> The grape seed seems to last a bit longer and has a light gape scent.</li>
            <li> I believe at the time of my purchase this was the only grape seed oil that was hexane free.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Really helps with dryness.</li>
            <li> Just a dab does your whole face without leaving it greasy or oily.</li>
            <li> and I feel really fooled into thinking I had to do that.  </li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> and my hair look and feel much healthier.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Much greener than the picture.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s better at moisturizing than my lotion, but I can say that it doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of unknown chemicals.  </li>
            <li> It works really well to make your hair sleeker and lower the amount of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> great procuct would give 5 stars but bottle was broken and lost about 3 ounces of product</li>
            <li> looks and feels so much better not as rough as it used to be.</li>
            <li> You clean you face with two different kinds of oil.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to find a product on Amazon.com that was hexane free.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen improvement in dry patches, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and it&#x27;s light weight.</li>
            <li> I store this in the fridge to keep it lasting longer as I&#x27;ve read and heard that grapeseed oil turns rancid rather quickly.  </li>
            <li> I use this mostly with essential oils - either carrier oil in capsule or for topical skin application.  </li>
            <li> The amount is decent for the price</li>
            <li> Product is high quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.........</li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have commented on its light and fast absorption - this product will not clog your pores while doing tons of goodness to your skin.  </li>
            <li> So pure and clear.</li>
            <li> Just a little in my palm and dab lightly throughout and viola!</li>
            <li> No false advertising about natural.</li>
            <li> Great oil to extend the life of expensive lotions</li>
            <li> They&#x27;ve really earned my brand loyalty thus far.</li>
            <li> she says it really makes it soft</li>
            <li> It is rich in linoleic acid levels, which is an essential fatty acid that is quite important for the skin and cell membranes.&lt;br</li>

            <li> new to oil buying .do</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive skinned.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin, rosacea &amp; eczema</li>
            <li> I also have dry hair and will wipe my oiled hands through my hair lightly when it is wet, right before styling.</li>
            <li> My skin is toner and the area around my mouth seems like it has less fine lines.  </li>
            <li> This is the answer to my wishes for mature skin!  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re planning on using it as a daily moisturizer, then make sure you only use a tiny bit.</li>
            <li> I started using grapeseed oil in place of other personal lubricants because of online recommendations, and I found that it works better than those products sold in the drugstore.  </li>
            <li> The dead-ends of my hair are nearly nonexistent!  </li>
            <li> so I use it full strength sometimes and other times, I combine it with a lotion....</li>
            <li> It was a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> Smells great because it has such a faint scent.  </li>
            <li> Truly natural product.  </li>
            <li> I do have to say, that my face skin, is soft, and the wrinkles are diminishing somewhat.  </li>
            <li> This is a very inexpensive way to get all the benefits of those pricey products and have the same results.</li>
            <li> so I did some research on grapeseed oil and had no idea of the natural qualities in it..</li>
            <li> No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> I had no idea it was going to be so professional.</li>
            <li> I use it on my body and my natural hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and moisturized and so it my skin.</li>
            <li> this  wow</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the sent it leaves, but is natural obviously.&lt;br</li>
            <li> use straight and mixed with sugar for scrub,&lt;br /&gt;and added to lotions.</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair as well and makes it so soft.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The Beauty Aura grapeseed oil performs as well as the others, and the low cost prevents worry of using it too much or too often.</li>
            <li> No break outs so far.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy, absorbs well, my skin glows, it moisturizes well</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. .</li>
            <li> Removes make up like a dream and leaves my skin so soft.  </li>
            <li> This is our main oil for skin and hair outside of Jojoba which costs too much for daily use.  </li>
            <li> I use this mainly as a carrier oil for essential oils.</li>
            <li> The next morning my skin looked smooth, clear, and the little bit of redness I had was gone.&lt;br</li>
            <li> we have a higher tendencies of allergies - and after using this oil to moisturized my skin after washing (sometimes 3 or 4 times daily) has made my skin less irritated and feels so much better than the last 12 months of using other oils.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to mix with some other oil for my dry scalp and it seems to work fine.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other natural oils as a hot oil treatment for my hair.</li>
            <li> Overall, this is the best massage oil base that I have used so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve soaked in the bath tub with some of this and tea tree oil to hydrate my skin and calm down some eczema</li>
            <li> Trying to use essential oils vs expensive facial moisturizers, after a friends recommendation-  and so far loving this!</li>
            <li> This make&#x27;s my hair soft and is good for cooking chicken as well.</li>
            <li> Since it was an ineffective treatment, it is now being used as a general skin oil on my legs and arms.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I recommended this to my neighbor and sisters, and so far have only heard from my neighbor and she loves it!  </li>
            <li> I use this on my face at night and the difference in texture is already apparent.  </li>
            <li> but you have to use it for a little while you wont get results right away..</li>
            <li> A tiny amount goes a very long way making this large bottle a terrific value.  </li>
            <li> You could get a bigger bottle for less money at the grocery store and it would have the same exact effect.</li>
            <li> I am using it in my natural hair regimen and mixing it with Natural Shae butter and other essential oils.  </li>
            <li> It has no odor and is not heavy as long as you only use just a couple of drops.</li>
            <li> oil from grapeseed reduces LDL (bad Cholesterol) and increases HDL (good cholesterol), which in turn helps in keeping your arteries</li>

            <li> Will last a long third but will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> These fatty acids benefit us by forestalling any heart diseases and influence the biological properties in our body.&lt;br /&gt;Grape seed oil contains high levels of Vitamin E, which is a fat-soluble antioxidant.</li>

            <li> Put a little on a cotton ball and remove makeup, smooth on legs, arms and dry areas after shower and put a couple of drops in your hair conditioner or put a little on flyaway hairs and dry ends.</li>
            <li> I heard that grapeseed oil is a natural option to help reduce dark circles under the eyes.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use a lot of it if my hair was flat ironed</li>
            <li> Especially if you blow dry afterwards.</li>
            <li> I use daily with other carrier and essential oils.</li>
            <li> it is hard to tell if a product is really working.</li>
            <li> Will be curious to see if the oil cleansing method actually works...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t discover it long ago.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my long, scraggly beard.</li>
            <li> 16.oz will last awhile because a little definitely goes along way.</li>
            <li> Though I have so much left over of other oils ...</li>
            <li> I have tried several other oils like castor and almond.</li>
            <li> my other oils my hair is holding up well and flourishing under my daily torture.  </li>
            <li> Furthermore, it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I use this on my body for my dry skin</li>
            <li> I have sparse eyelashes and dry itchy eyes</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> My skin is dry and that was what I wanted it for</li>
            <li> I do use it on my face at night sometimes, but I have dry skin and can get away with that.</li>
            <li> so my skin won&#x27;t dry out so much.&lt;br /&gt;Great</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my skin is so dry that I often itch.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 64 and so far have very few wrinkles (not even crow&#x27;s feet)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been using expensive, ridiculous skin regimens for several years, with a lot more steps than this</li>
            <li> It is cold pressed which isn&#x27;t always easy to find.</li>
            <li> The red is gone, my eyes are itching less and my lashes are growing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Helps prevent both when used in combo with African black soap for wash &amp; wonder cloth &amp; thayer&#x27;s witch hazel with aloe then this for moisture.</li>
            <li> Extremely lightweight, nourishes my hair extremely well, mix it in with my deep conditioner or hair mask.</li>
            <li> It will last a very long time, and don&#x27;t forget to rub it into your hands with a little VANICREAM before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> been using this oil to mix my essential oils and also to add a little to my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> So tired of spending money on products that only work on 35 year old skin!  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m very limited on products I can use.  </li>
            <li> I add a little essential oil of my patient&#x27;s choice and it works well as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> It is very thick, very hydrating, and feels so luxurious when using it for massage.</li>
            <li> I have mixed a few already</li>
            <li> works as expected.</li>
            <li> I expected that its consistency would be close to argan oil, but it is not.</li>
            <li> This was purchased, along with a few other oils, in order to make a concoction for moderate acne that had sprouted up on my face.</li>
            <li> It takes forever to dissipate and will make you look like an oily mess, or like you are perpetually sweating.</li>
            <li> A little can go a long way, and I still blot myself with a towel after.</li>
            <li> Everyone&#x27;s been complimenting me on my skin which was a little strange.  </li>
            <li> Product had leaked out all over the other items it was shipped with.</li>
            <li> I am sold - will not use any other oils for my skincare.  </li>
            <li> Have not seen any benefits other than that though.</li>
            <li> I was swayed by the other reviewers who pointed out the importance of this product being hexane-free.  </li>
            <li> No leaking or other problems here.</li>
            <li> I will have to find other uses for it in order to use up the bottle.</li>
            <li> Like any other carrier oil</li>
            <li> My product leaked out all over the inside of the box and the other items I had purchased.</li>
            <li> oil from grapeseed helps the immune system and increases the blood circulation as well.&lt;br /&gt;After any surgery or an injury, the oil reduces the swelling faster than any other medicines.&lt;br /&gt;Flavonoids found in grape seed oil work to inflect cell-signaling pathways.</li>

            <li> found that trying to condition hair with an excessive amount of product, even hours before a shower, does next to nothing once you&#x27;ve shampooed.</li>
            <li> Mixing it with shea butter and other lotions</li>
            <li> She made a conditioner out of it she uses every other day</li>
            <li> Based on early results I will not be going back to expensive moisturizers</li>
            <li> However hexane is very dangerous and is used by most companies in the extraction process.</li>
            <li> During these winter months my skin has been really dry lately and I needed some extra moisture that has been missing from summer</li>
            <li> The little metal piece holding the bottle closed somehow popped off into the cap and it was leaking everywhere.</li>
            <li> Whenever I get a rub down this is my go-to as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually when I apply oils within a couple hours my skin is dry like I never applied anything</li>
            <li> I have oily skin and my skin is noticeably less oily since using this product.  </li>
            <li> And sometimes even when I apply no oil at all, my skin doesn&#x27;t get ashy at all (I&#x27;m black).  </li>
            <li> I also mix it with a little cocoa butter lotion for my body.</li>
            <li> i just put a little on my skin for a glow</li>
            <li> It looks like there is 1/8-1/4 C of oil missing from the bottle.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice any change and chose to forgo the agitation of, and seemingly unnecessary, mixing and such in search of another solution for my bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Added a few drops of lavender oil.</li>
            <li> I mix a few drops in the palm of my hand with my AM moisturizer to boost my moisturizer during the day and under my sunscreen and foundation.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Grape seed oil contains linoleic acid, which is a polyunsaturated fatty acid that can prove beneficial for people having diabetes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Omega-3, Omega-6, and Omega-9 are the fatty acids found in this oil.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Omega-3, Omega-6, and Omega-9 are the fatty acids found in this oil.</li>
            <li> My only problem was the packaging, it came broken.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i use it everyday in the morning</li>
            <li> No strong scent.</li>
            <li> It was annoying to clean it all up.</li>
            <li> Messy for massages!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought cheaper (machine-pressed) grapeseed oil in the past, and I can tell the difference.  </li>
            <li> I usually use almond oil, and thought I would give this a try.</li>
            <li> I also put a small amount on before my face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Some of it spilled all over my other product that came in the same box as this:(</li>
            <li> It is runny and hard to put on face.</li>
            <li> Dull hair?</li>
            <li> I do not have any negative comments about the product.</li>
            <li> It is the least &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; of oils that I&#x27;ve used over the years.</li>
            <li> I have thick hair and it sort of matted it and the texture creeped me out</li>
            <li> No more pricey stuff!</li>
            <li> This made my face breakout big time, but that&#x27;s just my bad luck.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s tough to find.</li>
            <li> it did not make acne any worse.  </li>
            <li> bottle was broken and leaked all over the box</li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say it was miraculous in preventing my stretch marks along my posterior &amp; behind my legs...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grape seed oil can help strengthen and repair damaged or broken capillaries and blood vessels.</li>
            <li> We have been using this as a base with the aromatic essential oils.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed some product was lost, it has made a mess, and has leaked over the other products in the box.  </li>
            <li> It smells faintly like a mix of vegetable oil and olive oil, though.  </li>
            <li> Silly.</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy this.  </li>
            <li> It has a faint odor.  </li>
            <li> The smell is organic: not wonderful, but also not off-putting.</li>
            <li> And I appreciate that it&#x27;s cold pressed and hexane-free.</li>
            <li> Stinks, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s expired because of the smell...</li>
            <li> Forget expensive wrinkle serums!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bad to pour it into another bottle because it leaks everytime you use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Grape seed oil can boost the health of the heart and the cardiovascular system by lowering the level of bad LDL cholesterol.</li>
            <li> In addition, two studies showed that taking grapeseed extract and chromium, helped in lowering the bad cholesterol levels.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unhappy with this product!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Grapeseed oil isn&#x27;t terribly viscous.  </li>
            <li> But the bottle it comes in leaks horribly.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> everything is great with the exception of the dispenser cap.</li>
            <li> Works great in our body scrub recipe. Perfect. Shipping a couple weeks but that was an Amazon issue not a seller issue. Product is high quality.</li>
            <li> Warning: This is way more greasy then others have indicated! Messy for massages! Unhappy with this product!</li>
            <li> I use this product for hair and skin and it does wonders! I mix it with other natural oils as a hot oil treatment for my hair. I also mix it with a little cocoa butter lotion for my body. My skin is very smooth and soft and my hair hydrated and soft. I will purchase this brand from now on!</li>
            <li> No false advertising about natural. Truly natural product.  Smells great because it has such a faint scent.  I am very sensitive skinned.  No problems with these. Great Size.. no sample bottle.  Will last a long third but will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> i use this for cooking. really a great price.</li>
            <li> Great for giving or getting a massage.  Good viscosity, absorbs well.  I add a little essential oil of my patient&#x27;s choice and it works well as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> I mix this with Castor Oil, and let it soak in while I sleep. The &#x27;cut here&#x27; line on my neck has almost vanished.  I can&#x27;t say the same for my face, but I am thrilled with how the skin on my neck has responded.  I do have to say, that my face skin, is soft, and the wrinkles are diminishing somewhat.  I suspect that my face wrinkles will improve dramatically when I retire ;)</li>
            <li> Great oil to extend the life of expensive lotions</li>
            <li> Good oil but the container leaked a LOT in my bag and I hadn&#x27;t unwrapped it from it&#x27;s packaging.</li>
            <li> Great stuff, works great.</li>
            <li> Came just like the picture. Can&#x27;t wait to put it to use!</li>
            <li> great price for great product</li>
            <li> It is the best eye make up remover I have ever used.  My eyelashes love it, too!!!  They have stopped breaking off at the ends and are growing in thicker.  It makes a great skin moisturizer, a hair glosser, I&#x27;ve even used it as a night cream on my face in a pinch!  My mom uses it as a cooking oil.  My husband and I have even used it in the bedroom.  Because it&#x27;s non-comedogenic it&#x27;s safe to use on any skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product.  I used grapeseed oil years ago, because it came in a manicure pack - I really liked it.  It absorbs well, and there&#x27;s no oily feel afterwards. I bought this product as a base for essential oils and it works great with them too.  Another reviewer mentioned that it being hexane free is a superior feature also, I haven&#x27;t researched that yet, but it sounds great to me too.</li>
            <li> Not oily. No strong scent. I use daily with other carrier and essential oils.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried this product yet as I just opened the package.  The box it was shipped in is soaked with this grape seed oil.  It has leaked everywhere even though the bottle it was in a plastic bag.  It looks like there is 1/8-1/4 C of oil missing from the bottle.  Very disappointed some product was lost, it has made a mess, and has leaked over the other products in the box.  Hopefully, the oil is worth it.  I don&#x27;t know if I will order it again from the same company, unless they can promise quality control and a discount for my lost product on this order.  Good luck.</li>
            <li> This is our main oil for skin and hair outside of Jojoba which costs too much for daily use.  The feel of Grapeseed is very close to Jojoba, goes and good, and you can really feel the lubrication and nurturing your skin and hair are getting.</li>
            <li> A great oil I use as my body oil. It is just the right consistency and gives the optimum level of moisture without feeling greasy. It also doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all or clog pores. Its perfect.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.  It was delivered promptly and is of good quality.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil! Its very moisturizing, does not have a greasy feel and to put the icing on the cake the packing was great. No oil spilled into my bag or was cracked open when I received it. Beauty Aura continue to do what you&#x27;re and PLEASE DON&#x27;T CHANGE THE FORMULA</li>
            <li> My package arrived on time and I cant wait to experiment with it! Only concern is that it seemed like the cap wasn&#x27;t secure so it leaked a bit. I hope my next package is more secure.</li>
            <li> Great oil! Light and just as described!</li>
            <li> I just started using this oil for the oil cleansing method and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Product had leaked out all over the other items it was shipped with. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product!  I use this as a moisturizer in the shower.  I have oily skin and my skin is noticeably less oily since using this product.  Also, it is a great makeup remover, much better than what I was using before.  Even takes off waterproof mascara.  Highly recommend for those with oily skin.</li>
            <li> great!  will buy again</li>
            <li> .It takes just a couple of drops of the oil to moisture the face. It has no odor and is not heavy as long as you only use just a couple of drops. This is a very inexpensive way to get all the benefits of those pricey products and have the same results.</li>
            <li> Love this product. 16.oz will last awhile because a little definitely goes along way.</li>
            <li> I use this mainly as a carrier oil for essential oils. However, I have found myself using this a lot to replace coconut oil when making homemade health products (coconut oil can clog pores more easily than this can). It absorbs great, has no scent to interfere with the scents of EOs, and the fact that it is cold-pressed and hexane free are all big deal breakers. Kudos, will buy again!</li>
            <li> Great product ordered twice about an ounce leaked in shipping box out both times even though it seems sealed</li>
            <li> Although the bottle did leak a little in shipping, the oil is great and mixes well with essential oils.&lt;br /&gt;Product is very light weight on the skin and leaves it silky smooth!</li>
            <li> During these winter months my skin has been really dry lately and I needed some extra moisture that has been missing from summer so I did some research on grapeseed oil and had no idea of the natural qualities in it..So I received my purchase today and used it. I can tell you that this oil is great!! Usually when I apply oils within a couple hours my skin is dry like I never applied anything but I&#x27;m rubbing my skin now and it still feels baby soft and luscious and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy:) I think I just found my skins new best friend It also states that its great for hair care so I will be adding this to my haircare regimen as well:)</li>
            <li> Came enclosed and double wrapped in plastic.  No leaking out into box.  Large amount for the price!  Absorbs quickly and makes skin feel super soft!  Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this oil!! Excellent quality and large size! I&#x27;ve been using it on my face every night and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a huge difference in my skin! It is a lot smoother and more even. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing again as soon as I start running out!</li>
            <li> does what it suppose to do</li>
            <li> I love this stuff,  im a repeat buyer! I use it every day,  it helps tremendously on my rosacea.  I rub it on my face and use a warm wash cloth to remove the excess.  It&#x27;s ahhhmazing!</li>
            <li> Best price and quality for cold pressed grape seed oil. Very healing on skin</li>
            <li> In an attempt to go more natural with skincare I have tried many different oils (jojoba, sweet almond, apricot, tamanu, seabuckthorn, argan, wheatgerm, and an array of essential oils too long to list,...) - you name it and I probably have it in the crisper bin in my fridge.  I have used this specific brand of grapeseed oil (hexane free) for over 3 months and have found it to be the best suited for oily combination skin with adult cystic acne.  As other reviewers have commented on its light and fast absorption - this product will not clog your pores while doing tons of goodness to your skin.  It actually calmed my skin of irritants in the environment I personally feel.  I know living in the Northwest we have a higher tendencies of allergies - and after using this oil to moisturized my skin after washing (sometimes 3 or 4 times daily) has made my skin less irritated and feels so much better than the last 12 months of using other oils.  I am sold - will not use any other oils for my skincare.  Though I have so much left over of other oils ... I will likely mix those up and use as a body moisturizer ...and will use this Grapeseed oil specifically for my facial care.</li>
            <li> Brought my hair back to life coloring</li>
            <li> I use this on my body for my dry skin and I also use it on my hair. It works great.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel amazing.  Used it on my grandbaby&#x27;s diaper rash and it vanished almost immediately.  Soaks into your skin within minutes.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it with essential oils for nightly moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Like it mixed with my lotion</li>
            <li> I bought this Grapeseed Oil to use for a carrier for my Essential oils. So far it has worked perfect. I have mixed a few already and I will definetly be purchasing from this seller again. I have a prime membership so of course I has very fast shipping.</li>
            <li> The dispenser works well, doesn&#x27;t drip everywhere.  Grapeseed oil isn&#x27;t terribly viscous.  It smells faintly like a mix of vegetable oil and olive oil, though.  Otherwise, pretty great as a face moisturizer for summer - I use it to control oil.</li>
            <li> This grapeseed oil is great for chapped or rough hands and skin.  A tiny amount goes a very long way making this large bottle a terrific value.  I don&#x27;t recommend putting it in your hair as some do.  I have thick hair and it sort of matted it and the texture creeped me out so I had to wash it out.  Awesome otherwise.</li>
            <li> Love it! Plan to buy again as soon as this one runs out!</li>
            <li> Excellent quality, I use 5-6 drops to use as a facial moisturizer at night. I&#x27;ve seen improvement in dry patches, it doesn&#x27;t make me break out, and it&#x27;s light weight. I&#x27;ve also used a bit as eye makeup remover and it works great.</li>
            <li> I love this oil!  I have sparse eyelashes and dry itchy eyes that are red in the outer corners.  Oh my! How this is helping.  The red is gone, my eyes are itching less and my lashes are growing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a body facial moisturizer and love it.  My skin is toner and the area around my mouth seems like it has less fine lines.  I use it right out of the shower and my skin glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe I have just discovered this.  I will never be without it now!</li>
            <li> Fabulous yet economical product.</li>
            <li> This is some great lubricant.</li>
            <li> Nice and good price. I use it on my face and neck at night or add it to my regular facial lotion. Good sized bottle for this use.</li>
            <li> This made my face breakout big time, but that&#x27;s just my bad luck. However, I really think it&#x27;s overpriced for what it is; grapeseed oil is grapeseed oil, no? You could get a bigger bottle for less money at the grocery store and it would have the same exact effect. Just putting &amp;#34;face&amp;#34; on the bottle doesn&#x27;t change the composition.</li>
            <li> I bought this along with Almond Oil and Jojoba Oil.  I have not used it yet but I&#x27;m happy with it so far.  It smells good, was packaged well and received quickly.  No complaints so far.</li>
            <li> Can already feel the difference on my skin. I used it in combination with jojoba oil and rosewater and glycerin spray, and after 1 day could already tell my skin was more moisturized, softer, brighter.</li>
            <li> been using this oil to mix my essential oils and also to add a little to my dry hair.  love that it is very gentle.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, excellent product, great price.</li>
            <li> Nice and soft.  Have not seen any benefits other than that though.</li>
            <li> Love this oil!  It absorbs quickly and it a great carrier oil for essential oils.  Doesn&#x27;t leave a film or stain linens either.</li>
            <li> This was purchased, along with a few other oils, in order to make a concoction for moderate acne that had sprouted up on my face. I didn&#x27;t notice any change and chose to forgo the agitation of, and seemingly unnecessary, mixing and such in search of another solution for my bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very apprehensive with the idea of applying oil to my already pore-clogged skin. I like that it did not make acne any worse.  My conclusion is that it is safe to use on problem skin. Since it was an ineffective treatment, it is now being used as a general skin oil on my legs and arms. Whenever I get a rub down this is my go-to as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the original intention for the oil has been tossed out, it has proved to be useful.</li>
            <li> This works amazing. I had no idea it was going to be so professional. Will be buying more as gifts.</li>
            <li> Love the Grapeseed oil.  I use it after tanning and it adds moisture to my skin and makes it silky and it hydrates.</li>
            <li> the best grapeseed oil that i ever had</li>
            <li> Grapeseed oil is very good for skin care including protection (not as a sun screen however), smells nice with natural ingredients.  I have dry skin so I use it full strength sometimes and other times, I combine it with a lotion....</li>
            <li> Good for my sensitive skin that is prone to acne &amp; rosacea. Helps prevent both when used in combo with African black soap for wash &amp; wonder cloth &amp; thayer&#x27;s witch hazel with aloe then this for moisture.</li>
            <li> Excellent quality grapeseed oil. Goes into skin very well. I&#x27;d order again from this seller. Highest quality I used. Calms the skin.</li>
            <li> I was swayed by the other reviewers who pointed out the importance of this product being hexane-free.  I&#x27;ve been using it as a moisturizer on my face and it makes my skin feel wonderful!</li>
            <li> No leaking or other problems here. So far, so good. Will be curious to see if the oil cleansing method actually works...</li>
            <li> Very happy with my purchase. The price was reasonable and the grapeseed oil smelled fresh. Love the feel on my hair and skin. It is as good as the &amp;#34;Now&amp;#34; brands.</li>
            <li> Great! I love this stuff. Wonderful for your skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my body and my natural hair. I love it. My hair is soft and moisturized and so it my skin. In the winter I&#x27;ll order more. It&#x27;s so light but I can tell it&#x27;s coating well.... Highly recommended.........</li>
            <li> works as expected. great for massages</li>
            <li> Great product I use this as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> The capsule of the bottle of the oil was open. Please make sure that it is  intact next time.  I will try to buy it again.</li>
            <li> These are always an iffy purchase because sometimes the oils go rancid. This is fresh and light without any fragrance.  I&#x27;ve used it as a carrier oil for several weeks now and am very pleased.  The price was very good as well, cheaper than my local store.  I also bought the almond oil from this brand.</li>
            <li> This product seemed very much like the grapeseed oils I have bought before so I don&#x27;t have any complaints on this brand. It was my first time using this brand and it worked well in both my body and hair product mixes that I made up for me and my mother.</li>
            <li> Very beautiful product. I definitely recommend this oil.</li>
            <li> I store this in the fridge to keep it lasting longer as I&#x27;ve read and heard that grapeseed oil turns rancid rather quickly.  I use this mostly with essential oils - either carrier oil in capsule or for topical skin application.  Sometimes I use it on my feet just as a moisturizer.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Ordered 100% Grapeseed Oil and received Sweet Almond oil instead.  Bottle had also leaked some.  Was going to make a homemade magnesium lotion with it.  I guess I&#x27;ll use the Sweet Almond instead.  They&#x27;re both good oils.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, put it in my smoothies, also use it on my skin as the best lotion I have ever used.  I also put it in my hair conditioner.  Simply a great product.</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil for beards.</li>
            <li> great product that i use in my home made lotions and creams</li>
            <li> I know nothing about grapeseed oil. I bought it to mix with some other oil for my dry scalp and it seems to work fine. It is a large bottle and the price was right. I will have to find other uses for it in order to use up the bottle.</li>
            <li> quickly and was priced right.  However, I was concerned that the bottle was leaking a bit around the foil seal.  I suggest that somebody at Beauty Aura should check their quality control.</li>
            <li> Some of it spilled all over my other product that came in the same box as this:(</li>
            <li> I liked the product, my skin was super soft and smooth afterwords. But my only concern is that the bottle did not have the expiration date on it.</li>
            <li> Bottle was wrapped in plastic, but the top wasn&#x27;t on securely and leaked onto other products in the box. If they would have tightened the lid, all would have been well. Silly.</li>
            <li> I ordered grapeseed and received sweet almond! I use both in my practice so not a big deal. The bottle leaked during shipping, though, so I lost a bit of product.</li>
            <li> I have tried several other oils like castor and almond. Many go rancid quickly and smell funky. The grape seed seems to last a bit longer and has a light gape scent. I use it as a lotion, massage oil and as a mixture with dr bronners almond soap as a pre-shave mixture.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using grapeseed oil as a moisturizer for years now and this is my favorite of any of the brands I&#x27;ve tried. Packaged and shipped well. Very good price for a high quality oil. I&#x27;ve had some others go rancid, but never this one. And I appreciate that it&#x27;s cold pressed and hexane-free. That&#x27;s tough to find. Beauty Aura&#x27;s jojoba oil is very nice as well. They&#x27;ve really earned my brand loyalty thus far.</li>
            <li> It is runny and hard to put on face. I expected that its consistency would be close to argan oil, but it is not. It feels greasy.</li>
            <li> This product being Hexane Free was very important to me. It took me a long time to find a product on Amazon.com that was hexane free. I believe at the time of my purchase this was the only grape seed oil that was hexane free. I love grape seed oil as it is a great carrier oil for essential oils and does not clog pores or upset acne and absorbs so well into skin. However hexane is very dangerous and is used by most companies in the extraction process. This is a great product and is working well with my oils. And to top it off I feel 100% safe using it. Nothing could be better. So glad I found this product and can use it.</li>
            <li> Excellent oil and excellent price &amp; speed of delivery!</li>
            <li> bottle was broken and leaked all over the box</li>
            <li> Has no expiration date. Stinks, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s expired because of the smell...</li>
            <li> I love this product.  It does exactly what is supposed to do.  I apply it to my face, neck and hair and it makes everything feel smooth and silky.  Thanks.</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this oil. Use it in skillet and dressing. Can&#x27;t always get to the store for Avacados so this replaces when I cannot.&lt;br /&gt;Eat Avacado daily with lots of vegies and have lost 30 lbs. Healthy _ book_ The PH Miracle .</li>
            <li> Love this grapeseed oil...I have used it in the oil cleaning method. If you don&#x27;t know what that is you can google it. You clean you face with two different kinds of oil. This one works great with castor oil for this cleaning method.</li>
            <li> Great for all over body treatments and all natural, no weird unpronounceable ingredients.  Put a little on a cotton ball and remove makeup, smooth on legs, arms and dry areas after shower and put a couple of drops in your hair conditioner or put a little on flyaway hairs and dry ends. Odorless, light and pure. Best care product I use - and so affordable!</li>
            <li> Great product! I use it for makeup remover, skin cleanser, scalp conditioner, lotion. Could not be more pleased. Easy to order and super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Great carrier oil for essential oils. I use it with sage, and rosemary essential oil on my hair and scalp. Really helps with dryness.</li>
            <li> Very Satisfied!! I use it for my skin and hair.</li>
            <li> Use all the time.  Never disappoints.</li>
            <li> So far its great, I&#x27;ve only had it for a week. It is a bit oily though. A little can go a long way, and I still blot myself with a towel after.</li>
            <li> The oil itself is great. But the bottle it comes in leaks horribly. When I received it, it had leaked all inside the packaging. Fortunately the bottle was still mostly full. I&#x27;ve bad to pour it into another bottle because it leaks everytime you use it. Other than that, it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> This stuff works great as part of my face wash.</li>
            <li> just received  it was a good price</li>
            <li> fabulous and pure product  arrived fast and well packaged</li>
            <li> Very happy with the purchase, very large bottle.  Quite satisfied!  Would tell my friends to buy it.  Works great on the face.</li>
            <li> I love this oil! Extremely lightweight, nourishes my hair extremely well, mix it in with my deep conditioner or hair mask. I could go on for days I love it!!</li>
            <li> Actually relieves the crepey looking skin under the arms and the top of the thigh.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Great Product! Recommended!!</li>
            <li> Clogs the pores and I do not recommend for face</li>
            <li> Bottle showed up cracked.</li>
            <li> Grape seed grape seed  grape seed oil this  wow oil never used it before but not I&#x27;m gonna use it rest of life in shah Allah I love it yes yes yes I will buy it again  my hair loves it , I would say to others just give a try u will love it just like I did .</li>
            <li> Like any other carrier oil</li>
            <li> Added a few drops of lavender oil. Use it every ight on arms and legs, smells wonderful and skin is soft</li>
            <li> Trying to use essential oils vs expensive facial moisturizers, after a friends recommendation-  and so far loving this! Just a dab does your whole face without leaving it greasy or oily. This also has some toner qualities. Based on early results I will not be going back to expensive moisturizers</li>
            <li> This oil does help preparing the skin for a close shave. I don&#x27;t like the sent it leaves, but is natural obviously.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good product</li>
            <li> I do not have any negative comments about the product. I&#x27;ve only just finished using my 1st bottle. The oil feels good on my skin. It does not have an overpowering smell to it. My skin felt smooth &amp; I didn&#x27;t have any oil stains on my clothing.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say it was miraculous in preventing my stretch marks along my posterior &amp; behind my legs...maybe I need to have continuos use of it, I don&#x27;t know. And again with just having used 1 bottle it is hard to tell if a product is really working. I will continue though to use it update my review.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it in my lotions, body butters and salves.</li>
            <li> Very nice.  I&#x27;ve bought cheaper (machine-pressed) grapeseed oil in the past, and I can tell the difference.  This has a very smooth, silky texture.  I&#x27;ve used it to moisturize my face and in my face scrub and I can feel the difference.</li>
            <li> new to oil buying .do like and seems to do what I want it for. use straight and mixed with sugar for scrub,&lt;br /&gt;and added to lotions. mascara removal too.</li>
            <li> This is the most amazing and surprising skin care I have ever used.  I just washed my face, put on my TruSkin Naturals vitamin c serum, and about 4 drops of this grapeseed oil.  It sank in as though this is what my skin had been waiting for!  It was not oily after about 10 seconds, and all I had left to do was dab on my eye cream.  The next morning my skin looked smooth, clear, and the little bit of redness I had was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, I&#x27;ve been using the vitamin c serum for about 2 months, but this grapeseed oil is the icing on the cake.  I&#x27;d been using expensive, ridiculous skin regimens for several years, with a lot more steps than this and I feel really fooled into thinking I had to do that.  I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beauty Aura Grapeseed oil gets 5 stars because it is amazingly affordable, has a perfect &amp;#34;drop at a time&amp;#34; lid and it works so well it IS my moisturizer.  I don&#x27;t need anything else with it.  I&#x27;ll see what happens this winter when my skin gets dryer, but I&#x27;m not giving this up.  You won&#x27;t be sorry if you buy this.  It will last a very long time, and don&#x27;t forget to rub it into your hands with a little VANICREAM before going to bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended this to my neighbor and sisters, and so far have only heard from my neighbor and she loves it!  I&#x27;m 64 and so far have very few wrinkles (not even crow&#x27;s feet) and my dermatologist recommended this oil to me.  She said &amp;#34;simplify, you are doing too much to your skin!&amp;#34;  She was right.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Great quality! Thank you</li>
            <li> IT WAS GREAT, MY WIFE LOVES IT. IT IS PERFECT FOR HER NATURAL HAIR.</li>
            <li> This Grapeseed oil is awesome. It makes my skin glow and my hair look and feel much healthier. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Much greener than the picture.</li>
            <li> Great product fast delivery</li>
            <li> Seems to be a great product and it does it&#x27;s job (moisturizing hair). The downside is that it did leak when it was shipped... The design of the bottle should be improved to minimize leaking.</li>
            <li> This said it was good for removing eye makeup. It stung my eyes and they were irritated for about 3 days.  It has a faint odor.  It is greasy.  It was a huge waste of money. My skin is dry and that was what I wanted it for but nope not for me.</li>
            <li> oil is great. i use it for massage and clients love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for massage and mix with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Great on the skin and made my hands a lot smoother. Just what I i was looking for.</li>
            <li> Very good quality grapeseed oil. I use it to make a pre shaving oil. Gives me a BBS shave. I&#x27;m sure most people use it in cooking, for that I can&#x27;t vouch.</li>
            <li> Absorbs easily--no greasy feel. Great for softening the skin.</li>
            <li> Received my oil. The seal was off the bottle and stuck inside the top of the loose cap. My product leaked out all over the inside of the box and the other items I had purchased. Had a bottle in this box of apricot oil from this same seller and it did the same. They need to check their quality control dept. or person responsible for making sure the caps and seals are on the product properly. This is wasting the customers money for the product they paid for. Gave 3 stars because of the leaking bottle and not the quality of the product.</li>
            <li> I use it for the OCM, pretty much as described.</li>
            <li> Started using on my face, very gentle and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. I use it in my hair as well and makes it so soft. Best price for quanitity. Will be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This grapeseed oil has a great consistency. It is very thick, very hydrating, and feels so luxurious when using it for massage. The smell is organic: not wonderful, but also not off-putting. I would recommend mixing it with an oil with a more pleasant scent. Overall, this is the best massage oil base that I have used so far.</li>
            <li> Smells rancid...spread it on my body after a shower and had to take another shower.  Will be returning.</li>
            <li> I like the oil. I didn&#x27;t like the packaging. It opened. In the bag. Oil was on the bottom of the box. Luckily I hadn&#x27;t bought anything that could have gotten ruined. The little metal piece holding the bottle closed somehow popped off into the cap and it was leaking everywhere. It was annoying to clean it all up.</li>
            <li> Great price for great product.  Leaves my skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this grape seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;it goes on a lot and not greasy feeling at all. I use it in many of my DIY skin care products. The only reason it gets four stars -is because I would like for it to be more economical.&lt;br /&gt;(can&#x27;t blame a girl for trying!) Lol</li>
            <li> Great seller but am not seeing the results.</li>
            <li> its so so.... my daughter use it for her hair she says it really makes it soft, i use it as a make up remover/ moistuirzer. I would prob get this again. The amount is decent for the price</li>
            <li> Love the lightness and versatility of this oil.  I&#x27;m a very big organic oil use for hair and skin.  The price was also good--will order again in the future.</li>
            <li> Terrific carrier oil for using with essential oils. It is cold pressed which isn&#x27;t always easy to find.</li>
            <li> This oil replaces my body lotion.  I put it on my skin and it stays moisturized.  I can&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s better at moisturizing than my lotion, but I can say that it doesn&#x27;t contain a bunch of unknown chemicals.  If you&#x27;re trying to go natural, this is a good oil.  I&#x27;ve tried it on my hair but it made my hair a bit greasy, so I&#x27;m just going to stick to using it on my skin.</li>
            <li> Forget expensive wrinkle serums!  This does the trick and then some.  I&#x27;ve been using this oil as a moisturizer for about 2-3 months now and it&#x27;s awesome.  It also leaves your skin with a nice glow.  Furthermore, it lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> This is a heavier oil than others I use, such as Jojoba. I love it. I slather it all over while still shower damp and my skin looks great. I do use it on my face at night sometimes, but I have dry skin and can get away with that. I also have dry hair and will wipe my oiled hands through my hair lightly when it is wet, right before styling. I love this product. It feels silky and has no weird smell. More importantly, my skin looks better when I use this.</li>
            <li> The results are immediate!  So tired of spending money on products that only work on 35 year old skin!  This is the answer to my wishes for mature skin!  I use this on my face at night and the difference in texture is already apparent.  It is a bit oily but I wash my hair in the morning anyway and it says good for hair too!  I mix a few drops in the palm of my hand with my AM moisturizer to boost my moisturizer during the day and under my sunscreen and foundation.  Great product!  Will order again!</li>
            <li> I have APL relaxed hair and this has been working great in my braid outs. Also good for keeping my hair and scalp moisturized (especially my ends). I wouldn&#x27;t use a lot of it if my hair was flat ironed but it&#x27;s great for protective or low manipulation styles since it is a tad bit heavy. It&#x27;s heavier than coconut oil but lighter than castor and olive oil.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite oil for the face as it does not cause break outs, it absorbs easily and quickly and does not leave you feeling oily. The price is excellent. This product is 100% pure and HEXANE FREE. I bought this because I read it would help with my rosacea and it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grapeseed oil contains;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polyphenols (antioxidents) – Fights free radicals which helps to keep pores clear and prevents breakouts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linoleic acid (CLA) – Boosts the activity of skin cells and provides proteins which help provide elasticity to the skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) - Boosts the growth of cells and blood vessels, aids skin repair; helps to provide skin with strength, firmness and protect from UV rays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grape seed oil also contains vitamin E which is an excellent skin moisturiser which helps to lock moisture into the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From http://www.seedguides.info/grapeseed-oil/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;The flavonoid &#x27;oligomeric procyanidin&#x27;, found in grape seed oil is an incredibly strong antioxidant, about 50 times stronger than antioxidants like, vitamin C and E. So, this compound can provide protection against cellular and tissue damage caused by free radicals.&lt;br /&gt;Grape seed oil can boost the health of the heart and the cardiovascular system by lowering the level of bad LDL cholesterol.

These fatty acids benefit us by forestalling any heart diseases and influence the biological properties in our body.&lt;br /&gt;Grape seed oil contains high levels of Vitamin E, which is a fat-soluble antioxidant. It aids in preventing any cell membrane related injuries.&lt;br /&gt;The oil from grapeseed helps the immune system and increases the blood circulation as well.&lt;br /&gt;After any surgery or an injury, the oil reduces the swelling faster than any other medicines.&lt;br /&gt;Flavonoids found in grape seed oil work to inflect cell-signaling pathways.

            <li> Works great. Love using this as a carrier oil.</li>
            <li> This product works amazingly at smoothing hair and moisturizing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that trying to condition hair with an excessive amount of product, even hours before a shower, does next to nothing once you&#x27;ve shampooed. But if you take a dime sized amount of this and tousle it through your damp (like 2 minutes out of the shower damp) hair, it will smooth frizz really well. Especially if you blow dry afterwards. If you are a guy like me, and want to make your haircut last longer, then use this. It works really well to make your hair sleeker and lower the amount of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it to moisturize skin before I get in the shower. I put a quarter sized amount on my palm and then rub it in all over my face about 10 - 15 minutes before showering. Makes my skin feel soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re planning on using it as a daily moisturizer, then make sure you only use a tiny bit. It takes forever to dissipate and will make you look like an oily mess, or like you are perpetually sweating.</li>
            <li> This is one of the best quality of Grapeseed oils I have used. I once was a massage therapist and Grapeseed oil was always my favorite massage oil. It is the least &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34; of oils that I&#x27;ve used over the years. So clients didn&#x27;t have to be a concerned about getting oils on their clothing, or have a lot of oil on their skin that they felt they had to shower off afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it now has skin moisturizer, alternating with coconut oil, but Grapeseed oil absorbs much more quickly and does not harden (in the container) in cool weather like coconut oil, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this brand again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light and I would recommend it to anyone that&#x27;s looking for a light oil would recommend it highly</li>
            <li> I started using grapeseed oil in place of other personal lubricants because of online recommendations, and I found that it works better than those products sold in the drugstore.  The Beauty Aura grapeseed oil performs as well as the others, and the low cost prevents worry of using it too much or too often.</li>
            <li> This oil appears to be good quality, and is very competitively priced.  Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using it consistently as an all-over body lotion for about 4 months, and my skin has never been so soft, smooth, and radiant.  Everyone&#x27;s been complimenting me on my skin which was a little strange.  My elbows and feet are smooth which is unusual for me.  And sometimes even when I apply no oil at all, my skin doesn&#x27;t get ashy at all (I&#x27;m black).  Would definitely recommend for BEAUTIFUL SKIN.</li>
            <li> I love it. So pure and clear. I use it for my skin and my hair. No more pricey stuff!</li>
            <li> great product and price</li>
            <li> Bottle was placed in box too big for it so when it shipped the top had come loose so some of the oil had spilled out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with the oil itself. Mixing it with shea butter and other lotions so my skin won&#x27;t dry out so much.&lt;br /&gt;Great product for massages without all the &#x27;girlie&#x27; smells.</li>
            <li> Love the way it makes skin&lt;br /&gt; feel feel. I like that the scenct DOES NOT cover up what you add it to  EVEN SOMETHING AS MILD AS BABY LOY&lt;br /&gt;LOTION.</li>
            <li> My skin has started glowing since I started using this instead of lotion.</li>
            <li> great product and great price</li>
            <li> I bought this for skin care purposes.  Lightweight oil that absorbs well into the skin - similar to jojoba in that respect.  I heard that grapeseed oil is a natural option to help reduce dark circles under the eyes.  I&#x27;m still testing that theory and it may be too soon to tell.  The price was right for the quality though.  Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Great product! Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my face for about three weeks and I love it. Does not leave my face greasy  and my skin has nice glow. No break outs so far. Will order again.</li>
            <li> so I guess I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised that I absolutely love this oil.  I have an arsenal of oils I use, olive, coconut, pomegranate, rosehip seed oil, shea, but I think this is my favorite.  I have been using it right of the shower for a week now, and this oil seems to be perfect for my skin.  It&#x27;s not heavy, absorbs well, my skin glows, it moisturizes well, I&#x27;m soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom. . it&#x27;s great.  I used it yesterday after I did  facial mask and my skin felt and looked so nice.  Ok, so this oil is the blue ribbon baby for me, one I will not be without.  I love this brand too--believe what you read here, this is super-fantastic oil!</li>
            <li> Great oil for my hair. Great to mix with other oils as well. Nice size bottle. Price is right. Like it.</li>
            <li> We have been using this as a base with the aromatic essential oils. It is terrific. Next time we plan to order a larger quantity!</li>
            <li> Product leaked everywhere in bag  bottle was placed in and box it was shipped in! It appears safety seal  was not sealed well when shipped!!</li>
            <li> This make&#x27;s my hair soft and is good for cooking chicken as well.</li>
            <li> There are so many uses for Grapeseed oil I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t discover it long ago.  I love the bottle it&#x27;s packaged in because it has the flip lid so that you have more control over dispensing the oil and less risk of wasting it. I have very sensitive skin, rosacea &amp; eczema so I&#x27;m very limited on products I can use.  This is great.  I&#x27;ve soaked in the bath tub with some of this and tea tree oil to hydrate my skin and calm down some eczema break outs. I also slather it on my feet and then put socks on before going to bed (I end up taking the socks off during the night lol) but my feet feel nice and soft!  It says this is good for your scalp too and I often get break outs around my hair line and the back of my scalp so when I do I will be trying this on my scalp.  I will recommend this product to everyone!</li>
            <li> Going to make flea repellant spray this summer with this</li>
            <li> Safety seal on product was not intact, and the oil leaked all over the inside of the bag it was sent in.</li>
            <li> Great for moisturizing skin and hair. Highly recommend</li>
            <li> This was my first time trying Grape seed Oil for my hair. It&#x27;s great and I plan to keep using it. Perfect for sealing in moisture without making my hair greasy or weighed down. Very light weight.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. I usually use almond oil, and thought I would give this a try. It has a nice feel and soaks in quickly!</li>
            <li> Came exactly as advertised. The 3 stars is only because the smell wasn&#x27;t great but it works great in my homemade conditioner.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on damp hair to seal in moisture. I also use it to remove eye makeup after reading some reviews here. Staple in my arsenal of products</li>
            <li> Love this Grapeseed Oil!  I use it on my skin to moisturize and tone.  I also place a couple drops in my hands and massage into the ends of my hair after showering.  The dead-ends of my hair are nearly nonexistent!  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Worked exactly as i needed, feels great on the skin</li>
            <li> So this stuff is great...its not too oily.  I am using it in my natural hair regimen and mixing it with Natural Shae butter and other essential oils.  I am not disappointed.</li>
            <li> My wife loves this stuff for her hair. She made a conditioner out of it she uses every other day and she loves it.</li>
            <li> Great on my natural hair!</li>
            <li> great procuct would give 5 stars but bottle was broken and lost about 3 ounces of product</li>
            <li> Great product!! Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Works great on my dry ends. I also put a small amount on before my face moisturizer.</li>
            <li> Great product for face!!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this product. It is a great deal for a great product.</li>
            <li> This product arrived quickly. I purchased this because my skin is so dry that I often itch. So far it works great! I apply this all over my skin before drying off from the shower. It works great, because my skin stays moisturized for the rest of the day.</li>
            <li> Inexpensive and works wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> I use this oil as a carrier oil for my essential oils.</li>
            <li> I do self facial massage with this oil, and it is very good quality.  It makes my skin happy. The grape seed oil I was using prior to this was not the best quality, and I do feel/see difference using this brand.</li>
            <li> Love this oil for washing my face.  I have bought it many, many times.  Removes make up like a dream and leaves my skin so soft.  Great product.</li>
            <li> So far so good. Nothing too impressive. In the future I will buy organic.</li>
            <li> Works great as a carrier oil for mixing with essential oils</li>
            <li> I love the way it makes my skin feel. Ive been using it to massage my honey and his back looks and feels so much better not as rough as it used to be.</li>
            <li> Dull hair? This stuff adds a shine. I use this before after and in between shampoos.  I put heat on my hair daily (I have a short hair cut), between this and my other oils my hair is holding up well and flourishing under my daily torture.  I do like to use this as a &amp;#34;finish&amp;#34; when I&#x27;ve freshly washed my hair and want that fresh out of the shop shine.  Just a little in my palm and dab lightly throughout and viola! It&#x27;s good for your skin as well great to mix in with my lotions after a shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use on my long, scraggly beard. Works good without scent.</li>
            <li> love this oil. moisturizes and can be used from head to toe. does not absorb as quickly as coconut oil and leaves the skin the perfect amount of oily (which I love) while still penetratig deep so that if I oil up before bed I don&#x27;t have to lotion up in the morning.</li>
            <li> Great Stuff. Will order again</li>
            <li> My only problem was the packaging, it came broken. But I quickly fixed that by putting another top on it that I had; I love the oil!</li>
            <li> Great product. I use this for my homemade hair products. It gives my hair life to the fullest</li>
            <li> i thought it helped to even my skin tone and my face glows more..but you have to use it for a little while you wont get results right away.. i thought i didnt like it at first but it just takes a while to start noticing changes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i use it everyday in the morning i just put a little on my skin for a glow and i put it on at night as well so i feel like i have in on all the time.</li>
            <li> Great for my skin and hair especially during winter time.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with product</li>
            <li> Love it...works great as a make up primer 😉</li>
            <li> Nice oil &amp; nicely priced. Very good product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this as one of the base oils in my beard oil, and it works great.</li>
            <li> The product is very nice and came in a timely manner</li>
    </ol>
