            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>This works quickly and my skin has never looked better. !</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t expecting much to be honest with this but decided to try it based on my success with Skinceuticals&#x27; line of products.</li>
            <li>My dermatologist recommends this whole line and it has really been great for my skin.</li>
            <li>It does help with light acne even though I will still get a blemish every now &amp; then.</li>
            <li>Fabulous --  transforms your skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 30 and my skin is fair and sensitive.</li>
            <li>Been using for two weeks (in conjunction with SkinCeuticals LHA cleanser) and saw immediate, significant improvement to my oily, congested, acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>i must say, i see some amazing results so far with my acne.  </li>
            <li>If you are using it in cool weather just put some drop in the T area.</li>
            <li>This dries the areas quickly and causes my skin to peel.</li>
            <li>I love this product because it helps minimize pores &amp; with production of new skin.  </li>
            <li>Been using for years and it keeps your skin looking fresh.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s gone!!but if you use this product as u are directed to ra Dom pimples rarely flare</li>
            <li>I have the dreaded 30 year old acne and tend to breakout more during my cycle.</li>
            <li>product is pricy but it is worth every penny if you have acne prone skin.  </li>
            <li>First, I apply a vitamin c serum &amp; then the blemish &amp; age defense.</li>
            <li>I use this serum only 1 week twice a day-at the morning and at the evening after cleansing, but my skin looks better already.</li>
            <li>cost is high, but is even higher in Brazil.</li>
            <li>My skin is much smoother, clearer, and brighter now.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>and I really like the product.</li>
            <li>It really has made a difference in the condition of my skin.</li>
            <li>I am 38 and most other products I try just don&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>Yes, it might tingle a little the first time you use, make sure</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
            <li>It really helps to keep my adult acne away.  </li>
            <li>A couple drops of this serum has really helped keep my adult acne at bay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It keeps my skin clear!</li>
            <li>I only need about 4-5 drops of product for my entire face (applied to my freshly washed face before bed), so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived securely packaged and in all original manufacturer packaging in pristine condition.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a huge bottle too and will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It exfoliates the dull skin to give me a healthy glow.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so clear now.</li>
            <li>I used to use the Lush grease lightening tree tea cleanser gel as my acne</li>
            <li>I use about 2-3 drops only in the chin region right after I wash my face and prior to my serum.</li>
            <li>I recommend it to everyone my age and younger or older.</li>
            <li>And whats even better is that i get fewer and smaller pimples (no more cystic)!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>I have had people ask what makeup I use to achieve such nice results, but really it is just removing the dead skin everyday.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product when i saw some awesome reviews and thought I&#x27;d try it since I was breaking out like crazy for the past year and decided that the natural way was just not working out for me anymore.  </li>
            <li>I have only used this product twice as part of my skin care regimen and so far it feels</li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> cost is high, but is even higher in Brazil. sister in law will&lt;br /&gt;be glad to have and use it</li>
            <li> I was using the Jan Marini bio-clear and then my doctor introduced me to this product.  LOVE, LOVE it.</li>
            <li> Awesome product! Zit appears put product on and zit is gone or minimal the next day. Can&#x27;t beat that for zit begone.</li>
            <li> like it alot. It&#x27;s helped my skin.</li>
            <li> This is the only product that has worked for my daughters acne!  We love it</li>
            <li> Been using for years and it keeps your skin looking fresh. It exfoliates without burning.</li>
            <li> Did not notice anything.</li>
            <li> This works amazing. If a pimple ever Does come up  just keep reapplying during day and it&#x27;s gone!!but if you use this product as u are directed to ra Dom pimples rarely flare up.the only downside is the product line is a bit expensive.....but it really is a good buy.</li>
            <li> Awesome product.  Been using for two weeks (in conjunction with SkinCeuticals LHA cleanser) and saw immediate, significant improvement to my oily, congested, acne prone skin.  My skin is much smoother, clearer, and brighter now.  I only need about 4-5 drops of product for my entire face (applied to my freshly washed face before bed), so a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived securely packaged and in all original manufacturer packaging in pristine condition.  Would definitely purchase this product from this seller again.</li>
            <li> I love this product because it helps minimize pores &amp; with production of new skin.  My completions is looking great!</li>
            <li> It works great! It drys everything up and you can work up to using it to three times a day!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product.  It really helps to keep my adult acne away.  Doesn&#x27;t over dry.  A little bit goes a long way.  I only use 2 drops a day.  A bottle lasts a long time.  Its a great addition to any beauty regiment for those of us that are still dealing with acne as adults.</li>
            <li> OMG I am in love with this product! My face it&#x27;s so clear now. I still have some acne but every day is getting better and better.</li>
            <li> Everything worked out great !</li>
            <li> I have used this product since it was introduced. First, I apply a vitamin c serum &amp; then the blemish &amp; age defense. I find that I must use both products and in that order to achieve the results I want. I tried going without it, but I keep coming back. Using this product makes my skin look radiant. It exfoliates the dull skin to give me a healthy glow. I have had people ask what makeup I use to achieve such nice results, but really it is just removing the dead skin everyday. It does help with light acne even though I will still get a blemish every now &amp; then.</li>
            <li> So even into our fifties, some of us still have oily skin and breakouts--much to our dismay... After trying my daughters acne treatments which dried out my skin, I tried this, and it works like a charm.  It took about a week four the existing breakout to clear up, but after setting up a regime, my skin cleared and calmed down.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 weeks and I haven&#x27;t seen a big difference in my blemished yet. I&#x27;ll give it another month</li>
            <li> This stuff is miracle in a bottle for acne sufferers!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use this serum only 1 week twice a day-at the morning and at the evening after cleansing, but my skin looks better already.</li>
            <li> Works great ! Apply it eery night followed by the face lotion an you will see better skin before you know it!</li>
            <li> This plus the OST vitamin c serum helped my whiteheads and blackheads.</li>
            <li> This is some of the best oil for my combination acne prone skin. I am 38 and most other products I try just don&#x27;t work. This worked great in quickly clearing my skin without drying it out.</li>
            <li> this was recommended by my dermatologist. it suits my skin and does a great job keeping my breakouts at bay.</li>
            <li> It works and that is what matters</li>
            <li> Quick shipping, good product, happy customer.</li>
            <li> If you have a stubborn acne that just won&#x27;t go away- use this.  A little drying; so be careful not to use too much</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the line of products.  This causes dryness also.  I used the obagi line prior to this and like it better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many product for breakouts, but this one is wonderful! It keeps the breakouts under control, and doesn&#x27;t cause my skin to dry to the point of flaking.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my skin clear! Thank you SkinCeuticals.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff if you are like me and got acne in your 30&#x27;s. Doesn&#x27;t dry you out and helps with the blackheads too!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for several years.</li>
            <li> The product couldn&#x27;t work any blemishes gone over night in most cases.</li>
            <li> A couple drops of this serum has really helped keep my adult acne at bay. Over the past couple of years, I have started getting blemishes around my chin area and this has worked wonders. I rarely even get 1 blemish now if I am good about using this. I use about 2-3 drops only in the chin region right after I wash my face and prior to my serum. My dermatologist recommends this whole line and it has really been great for my skin. It&#x27;s a huge bottle too and will last a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: The remainder of my bottle spilled about a week ago :&#x27;( . After not using this product since then I&#x27;ve already had a few spots pop up. I reordered last night! I&#x27;m 30 and my skin is fair and sensitive. I use it it once a day (at night) and have started using on most of my face, except for my cheeks and under eye area. Be careful with traveling with this product. The rubber dropper broke off in my cosmetics bag so from now on I&#x27;ll put it in it&#x27;s own zipper pocket.</li>
            <li> I love this product!  I recommend it to everyone my age and younger or older. It is fabulous for menopause acne! The delivery time exceeded my expectations. I will Amazon in the future for reordering these products.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended and I really like the product. Arrived on time.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I use it once a day. help me with blemish. If you are using it in cool weather just put some drop in the T area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure it works. I&#x27;m still using it, waiting to see the final results. I notice some improvement but it&#x27;s slow.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive but my dermatologist recommended it for my oily skin and it seems to work, fortunately a drop goes along ways!</li>
            <li> It really has made a difference in the condition of my skin. I get less acne and when I do get it, it heals faster and looks better than without the product.</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t expecting much to be honest with this but decided to try it based on my success with Skinceuticals&#x27; line of products. This definitely did the tricks for me. I&#x27;m in my 30 &#x27; s with oily acne prone skin. This definitely kept my acne at bay where I do get the occasional one or two but they&#x27;re not cystic and are usually gone by the following day. While the directions say you can apply this one to three times daily, I apply it twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase again when bottle is finished.</li>
            <li> This product is honestly a miracle. I have spent years unsuccessfully trying to find something that works for acne. This works quickly and my skin has never looked better. !</li>
            <li> I have only used this product twice as part of my skin care regimen and so far it feels great.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a perfect way to keep my seborrheic dermatitis (eczema type) under control because of the salicylic acid content in it, keeping my skin oil free.&lt;br /&gt;I use a drop or two only and distribute it on my face prior to my daily moisturizer. Yes, it might tingle a little the first time you use, make sure don&#x27;t overdo it, remember anything containing acid you must be careful.&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks firmer and the redness from the eczema around my nose is gone, finally!</li>
            <li> I love this product. It works and I always keep it in stock.</li>
            <li> Today, I found that the liquid in the bottle had eaten away at the plastic dropper grip and there were bits of plastic floating around in my face medicine.  Yuck!</li>
            <li> Yes.  I love it !!  Fabulous --  transforms your skin.  Reduces pours. Helps prevent blemishes.  Gives skin a great  look -- feel.  And a great base if applying make-up</li>
            <li> Great product when you have a problematic skin that tends to breakout.  It helps to keep oily skin under control whithout drying it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and it works.....but a bit pricey.  I can get the same results from paulas choice products at a lower price</li>
            <li> Great results! I have the dreaded 30 year old acne and tend to breakout more during my cycle. This dries the areas quickly and causes my skin to peel. I use this in the evenings to spot treat problem areas. I have tried other products and this is the only product that has provided results!</li>
            <li> Amazing product!  Highly recommended.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out skin and helps minimize wrinkles.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product when i saw some awesome reviews and thought I&#x27;d try it since I was breaking out like crazy for the past year and decided that the natural way was just not working out for me anymore.  I used to use the Lush grease lightening tree tea cleanser gel as my acne topical but it was just not strong enough to combat my acne so i decided to purchase this product as my last resort as Ive literally tried 100+ products and pills and nothing else has been helpful from keeping my acne at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I have now been using this for about 3 weeks or so morning and night time i must say, i see some amazing results so far with my acne.  It has dried up my flair ups both small pimples and cystic acne but does not dry out your face at all.  It also lightened the hyper pigmentation that was left from my previous breakouts.  And whats even better is that i get fewer and smaller pimples (no more cystic)!&lt;br /&gt;This product is pricy but it is worth every penny if you have acne prone skin.  I highly recommend this to everyone.</li>
