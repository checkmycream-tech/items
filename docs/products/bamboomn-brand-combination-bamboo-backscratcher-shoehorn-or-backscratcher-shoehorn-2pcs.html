    <ol>
            <li>These things are priceless when you get an itch you can&#x27;t scratch.  </li>
            <li>All in all, very happy with this product!</li>
            <li>Give it a try &amp; see why it now has two perfect reviews!!!</li>
            <li>I also ordered two with a tie loop so I can hang it at my cubicle at work (best.</li>
            <li>These work perfectly and allow him to take care of it himself.  </li>
            <li>Ideal length, sturdy and works well.  </li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>great combo-</li>
            <li>For the price, getting two is a great deal.  </li>
            <li>was soon after I ordered them great service  </li>
            <li>Does a good job.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Really good.</li>
            <li>and i have been very pleased with them ever since they come in which</li>
            <li>one end which is nice....</li>
            <li>The product is nice and does what it is meant to do.</li>
            <li>This thing is really handy in a lot of ways.  </li>
            <li>Love it.  </li>
            <li>br /&gt;back scratcher that I love</li>
            <li>So I was really glad to find these.</li>
            <li>but it could have more curve in the &amp;#34;horn&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The fingers need to be more defined and sharper.</li>
            <li>i was well pleased</li>
            <li>The product is well finished, but we have noticed more that one splinter - hence the 4 stars.</li>
            <li>It is a very useful two in one product and bamboo is certainly better than plastic.  </li>
            <li>The other end is a shoe horn which i use when I put on my dress shoes, works great!</li>
            <li>These back scratchers are great plus they help with putting on your shoes.&lt;br /&gt;No more bending.  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy and nice.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They work PERFECTLY as a shoe-horn - the length means no bending down to use it, and it helps the shoes slip right</li>
            <li>My old favorite, beautifully finished, bamboo back scratcher was lost in moving</li>
            <li>Good value for back scratcher.</li>
            <li>I finally got wise and ordered a set for myself.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, funny to have one.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>The bamboo back scratcher is the perfect length to reach everywhere on my back with ease.  </li>
            <li>Reaches everywhere on the back and quality is more than OK for the price.</li>
            <li>After checking out the reviews and comparing similar back scratchers, I felt that this would be the best choice.</li>
            <li>Nice and long for easy use standing.</li>
            <li>it is to bend down and put his shoes on and this works great, and it&#x27;s nice that it is a two in one product for scratching your back.</li>
            <li>think it should be a little bended, but it works, and its great it works also as shoehorn.</li>
            <li>This was one of the best gifts I have bought myself in a long, long time.  </li>
            <li>so that I can have one in every room that I most commonly frequent in our house.  </li>
            <li>it would be worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love the backscratcher part (and obviously people&#x27;s personal taste in backscrathers may vary for reasons which, from my point of view, are best left discreetly unmentioned here)</li>
            <li>Function wins over form here.</li>
            <li>Well worth the money.</li>
            <li>Mine is smooth and decently finished.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made out of solid bamboo, so it&#x27;s very strong</li>
            <li>But if you can get past the oddity that might be implied here (and I can, no problem), what you&#x27;re left with is a great little tool We&#x27;ve had our about a year now, and both have held up perfectly, and that&#x27;s saying a lot as they&#x27;ve both</li>
            <li>They were shipped very fast.</li>
            <li>I am actually buying two more</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you will find a better Back Scratcher than this one.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m hoping this saves my heels from the scraping plastic inserted into the back of most sneakers.</li>
            <li>As for the back scratcher - I would describe it more as a &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; than a &amp;#34;scratcher&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>When I first saw them I thought &amp;#34;</li>
            <li>Also they are long enough for me to reach all of the areas on my back (feels great!).  </li>
            <li>Very sturdy.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap solid scratcher.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve not needed the shoehorn part specifically, but I can say, this is one fantastic back scratcher.</li>
            <li>but when I opened it, it did not scratch very well.</li>
            <li>These bamboo backscratchers are very durable.</li>
            <li>It is so thick, a good scratch is not achieved.</li>
            <li>I bought these because I really needed a shoe-horn for a certain pair of new shoes I have....</li>
            <li>It  is not bad enough to be a deal breaker for us.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off looking for something with a sharper scratch and at a less curved angle.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more of a back rubber than a back scratcher.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>It would have been worth it, even it was just for one back scratcher  </li>
            <li>These back scratchers will have to be completely sanded to be useful.  </li>
            <li>the back-scratcher part is an unexpected bonus....aaaaahhhhhh!</li>
            <li>just what I expected and received quickly</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had a decent back-scratcher for ages this ones brings back memories of me fighting my father for the one we used to have.</li>
            <li>My hubby gets itchy places on his back occasionally and I can&#x27;t seem to get to the exact spot he needs.  </li>
            <li>I once had a long handled plastic shoehorn which was very convenient</li>
            <li>However, the shoehorn, while functional, is really not great since it isn&#x27;t very curved, nor quite as smooth as a metal or plastic one.</li>
            <li>No more having to use the corner of walls to hit just the right spot that is itchy!</li>
            <li>However, the quality is okay not great.  </li>
            <li>The older he gets the harder</li>
            <li>I ordered this either for my wife and I or as a gift if you look at the rating we gave it that will tell you if we liked it or not, if it is special we will add a little comment same if it is bad.</li>
            <li>price is right just a little short for a long shoehorn.</li>
            <li>I find it hard to use as I have to put my arm way behind my head to get the proper angle on it, and for some reason, the scratching surface just doesn&#x27;t do that good a job for me.</li>

            <li> These cost very little and provide so much joy to anyone who ever suffers from an itch that they cannot reach.</li>
            <li> The extra long handle allows me to put on my shoes myself.  </li>
            <li> The bent section is to curved and long to slip under garment.  </li>
            <li> I have mobility issues and dry skin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m honestly shocked it has so many 5 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> and I was hoping to get something at least near to that,</li>
            <li> oh look at this cheap crap &amp;#34; but I was pleasantly surprised at</li>
            <li> I wore out the other one I had.  </li>
            <li> Based on that and the other reviews, I got these.     </li>
            <li> As some of the other reviewers have mentioned there is a chance of a splinter or two.</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; that do the scratching are so dull that it&#x27;s entirely unsatisfying.  </li>
            <li> Couldn&#x27;t be happier, and the only complaint was not having a hook or loop to hang it.  </li>
            <li> I like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to bend down to use it.</li>
            <li> The bamboo is roughly varnished and small pieces of the bamboo is splintering underneath the varnish.  </li>
            <li> But telling me how many word I need to use is STUPID !!</li>
            <li> If I didn&#x27;t hate dealing with repackaging and shipping, I&#x27;d definitely send this back.</li>
            <li> Something about the angle of the scratcher combined with the dullness of the edges makes this a bad back scratcher.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than having an itch that you cannot scratch!  </li>
            <li> For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll get a horrible splinter in my back if I use them.</li>
            <li> and this keeps me from going crazy.  </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love it.  Works great.  Nice and long for easy use standing.</li>
            <li> Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At last a back scratcher that works&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We all need one of these and they come&lt;br /&gt;two in the box and there is a shoe horn&lt;br /&gt;on one end which is nice....it was the&lt;br /&gt;back scratcher that I love</li>
            <li> These are shedding bamboo and I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;ll get a horrible splinter in my back if I use them. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> The item arrived on time and as advertised. Works well.</li>
            <li> These things are priceless when you get an itch you can&#x27;t scratch.  I have mobility issues and dry skin and this keeps me from going crazy.  I wore out the other one I had.  It was not made as well as this.</li>
            <li> There is nothing worse than having an itch that you cannot scratch!  This was one of the best gifts I have bought myself in a long, long time.  I am actually buying two more so that I can have one in every room that I most commonly frequent in our house.  This is a product that you might not use but once in a blue moon, but when your back itches... YOU WANT RELIEF AND YOU WANT IT IMMEDIATELY!  The bamboo back scratcher is the perfect length to reach everywhere on my back with ease.  These cost very little and provide so much joy to anyone who ever suffers from an itch that they cannot reach. No more having to use the corner of walls to hit just the right spot that is itchy! (Imagine a grizzly bear using a pine tree to scratch his back... that&#x27;s the same movement and grace that I would show.)  All in all, very happy with this product!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you will find a better Back Scratcher than this one. I kept one and gave one to my son.  His wife said she didn&#x27;t like them but now he says she takes it away from him to use it.  Very sturdy. Does a good job.</li>
            <li> A friend had a back scratcher that looked like these and that works well. Based on that and the other reviews, I got these.     I find it hard to use as I have to put my arm way behind my head to get the proper angle on it, and for some reason, the scratching surface just doesn&#x27;t do that good a job for me.</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mom &amp; she loves them. It would have been worth it, even it was just for one back scratcher  it would be worth the price. So the fact it came with two was a bonus. I would highly recommend this product. Give it a try &amp; see why it now has two perfect reviews!!!</li>
            <li> just what I expected and received quickly</li>
            <li> I once had a long handled plastic shoehorn which was very convenient and though it was not designed for it, the handle worked well as a makeshift backscrather. great combo- and I need both daily. So I was really glad to find these. I don&#x27;t know why some folks have splintery ones and some not? Mine is smooth and decently finished. I love the backscratcher part (and obviously people&#x27;s personal taste in backscrathers may vary for reasons which, from my point of view, are best left discreetly unmentioned here) However, the shoehorn, while functional, is really not great since it isn&#x27;t very curved, nor quite as smooth as a metal or plastic one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made out of solid bamboo, so it&#x27;s very strong and you get two of them per order.  Also they are long enough for me to reach all of the areas on my back (feels great!).  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a cheap solid scratcher.</li>
            <li> So, I got two different types of back scratchers. I ordered two with the shoehorn for at home as I have a giant issue with not untying my shoes and I&#x27;m hoping this saves my heels from the scraping plastic inserted into the back of most sneakers. I also ordered two with a tie loop so I can hang it at my cubicle at work (best. idea. ever.). I&#x27;ve not needed the shoehorn part specifically, but I can say, this is one fantastic back scratcher.</li>
            <li> The shoehorn part works well but it could have more curve in the &amp;#34;horn&amp;#34; part.  As for the back scratcher - I would describe it more as a &amp;#34;rubber&amp;#34; than a &amp;#34;scratcher&amp;#34;.  The fingers need to be more defined and sharper.</li>
            <li> The product was just what I wanted.  Would definitely recommend to others.  For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong. By all means, order one today.</li>
            <li> Very sturdy and nice.  Like the shoe horn, it serves double duty!</li>
            <li> Function wins over form here. A combination back-scratcher and shoe horn just sounds dorky. But if you can get past the oddity that might be implied here (and I can, no problem), what you&#x27;re left with is a great little tool We&#x27;ve had our about a year now, and both have held up perfectly, and that&#x27;s saying a lot as they&#x27;ve both (we keep on upstairs, and one downstairs, for convenience) had lots of use, too. Recommended.</li>
            <li> It is a very useful two in one product and bamboo is certainly better than plastic.  For the price, getting two is a great deal.  However, the quality is okay not great.  The bamboo is roughly varnished and small pieces of the bamboo is splintering underneath the varnish.  Does not impede use, but does make you worry about getting splinters.</li>
            <li> yeah i have a back scratcher again i have been looking for some and i just happened on these so i ordered them  and i have been very pleased with them ever since they come in which was soon after I ordered them great service  i was well pleased</li>
            <li> Ideal length, sturdy and works well.  The combination back scratcher shoe horn definitely met and exceeded my expectations.  Well worth the money.</li>
            <li> price is right just a little short for a long shoehorn. I haven&#x27;t had a decent back-scratcher for ages this ones brings back memories of me fighting my father for the one we used to have.</li>
            <li> My hubby gets itchy places on his back occasionally and I can&#x27;t seem to get to the exact spot he needs.  These work perfectly and allow him to take care of it himself.  He loves them!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband and he uses it every day. The older he gets the harder it is to bend down and put his shoes on and this works great, and it&#x27;s nice that it is a two in one product for scratching your back. Plus we got two so one lives in the camper.</li>
            <li> One each for me and my wife. Reaches everywhere on the back and quality is more than OK for the price. Good value for back scratcher.</li>
            <li> I used these on a daily basis!  They are backscratchers and do just that.  The other end is a shoe horn which i use when I put on my dress shoes, works great!</li>
            <li> These back scratchers will have to be completely sanded to be useful.  Every surface is covered with slivers.  My old favorite, beautifully finished, bamboo back scratcher was lost in moving and I was hoping to get something at least near to that, but there is no comparison here.  Oh well, I&#x27;ve been wondering what to do with my evenings and now I know.</li>
            <li> The product is nice and does what it is meant to do. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned there is a chance of a splinter or two. The product is well finished, but we have noticed more that one splinter - hence the 4 stars. It  is not bad enough to be a deal breaker for us.</li>
            <li> I bought these because I really needed a shoe-horn for a certain pair of new shoes I have....and because the price was right!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work PERFECTLY as a shoe-horn - the length means no bending down to use it, and it helps the shoes slip right on!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the back-scratcher part is an unexpected bonus....aaaaahhhhhh!</li>
            <li> When I first saw them I thought &amp;#34; oh look at this cheap crap &amp;#34; but I was pleasantly surprised at how well they worked!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really good.</li>
            <li> These back scratchers are great plus they help with putting on your shoes.&lt;br /&gt;No more bending.  They were shipped very fast.</li>
            <li> After checking out the reviews and comparing similar back scratchers, I felt that this would be the best choice. I received the product on time but when I opened it, it did not scratch very well. Something about the angle of the scratcher combined with the dullness of the edges makes this a bad back scratcher. You&#x27;re better off looking for something with a sharper scratch and at a less curved angle.</li>
            <li> I recently had a hip replacement.  The extra long handle allows me to put on my shoes myself.  And the back scratcher is deligtful.  I even used the scratcher part to pick up things off the floor and help me dress.</li>
            <li> Scratches a back and helps put shoes on- an all around tool.  Now if it could only cook breakfast.</li>
            <li> Delivered on time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> My mom &amp; dad have had these in our home for years.  I finally got wise and ordered a set for myself.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier, and the only complaint was not having a hook or loop to hang it.  I solved that by gluing a neodymium magnet on the back.  Now it stays on the side of the fridge out of the way.</li>
            <li> I ordered this either for my wife and I or as a gift if you look at the rating we gave it that will tell you if we liked it or not, if it is special we will add a little comment same if it is bad. But telling me how many word I need to use is STUPID !!</li>
            <li> These bamboo backscratchers are very durable. They will basically last forever. Buy one of these and keep one at work and one at home and it will change your life.</li>
            <li> The bent section is to curved and long to slip under garment.  It is so thick, a good scratch is not achieved. I will take a file and carve on it to suit me.</li>
            <li> It works fine, funny to have one.&lt;br /&gt;I think it should be a little bended, but it works, and its great it works also as shoehorn.</li>
            <li> This thing is really handy in a lot of ways.  I like the fact that you don&#x27;t have to bend down to use it. But the back scratcher part could be a tad sharper. Frank</li>
            <li> The &amp;#34;fingers&amp;#34; that do the scratching are so dull that it&#x27;s entirely unsatisfying.  It&#x27;s more of a back rubber than a back scratcher.  I&#x27;m honestly shocked it has so many 5 star reviews.  If I didn&#x27;t hate dealing with repackaging and shipping, I&#x27;d definitely send this back.</li>
