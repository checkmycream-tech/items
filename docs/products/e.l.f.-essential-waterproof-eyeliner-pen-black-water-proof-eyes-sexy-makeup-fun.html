            <li>It goes on perfectly.</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully!</li>
            <li>that, it is perfect for trips when you run out or forget your eyeliner at home or people who just want to give eyeliner pens a try to see how they like them.</li>
            <li>It was very good liner</li>
            <li>Very good seller.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with this eyeliner and purchased it for a dollar at 7-Eleven!</li>
            <li>It works great till it dries out.</li>
            <li>Lol...</li>
            <li>This was an accidental buy but was happy to receive it nonetheless, until I tried to use it.</li>
            <li>It works great</li>
            <li>but otherwise it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>This gel felt tip is a great addition to my collection.</li>
            <li>Elf has great products for a good price.</li>
            <li>Good for on the go when I don&#x27;t have my creme eyeliner with me.</li>
            <li>Loved it.</li>
            <li>I use the good one for weekends.</li>
            <li>Either way, happy I can get it, no matter the seller. :)</li>
            <li>This is the best eyeliner there is because it stays put, it&#x27;s easy to take off, and comes in really awesome vibrant colors.</li>
            <li>but it lasted me a good 4 months , the tip is kind aggravating but I used it as a fill in so drawing my wings on wasnt a option.</li>
            <li>but if you close it and leave it for a while, it magically restores itself!</li>
            <li>On top of all this, it&#x27;s not waterproof!</li>
            <li>This is absolutely my favorite eyeliner of all time!</li>
            <li>but this makes it so easy to apply and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li>I love elf products because they are inexpensive and good quality.</li>
            <li>the idea is so good, and application so easy, that I&#x27;ll buy another couple.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to work with, so beginners will have no problem.</li>
            <li>So easy to use and apply and it stays in place and doesn&#x27;t smudge!</li>
            <li>This product is great for around the first 10 applications.</li>
            <li>so you can get a very precise line.</li>
            <li>Love this, works like a marker and stayed on all day in the salt water and FL sun</li>
            <li>They sell it at Target for $2, which is a better deal, but Target was out of it for a while</li>
            <li>if you like these products and want to save some cash, then walk to target :]</li>
            <li>I love the eyeliner from elf .</li>
            <li>I love it .</li>
            <li>I have used it many times.</li>
            <li>and I made sure not to apply pressure whatsoever</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this eye liner.</li>
            <li>ok.</li>
            <li>Wasn&#x27;t able to use because it never dispensed an even amount of liner.</li>
            <li>Love this .</li>
            <li>Switched to the Smashbox eyeliner pen and love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for awhile now, and I&#x27;m in love.</li>
            <li>If you plan on using an eyeliner pen long-term, in the long-run you would be better off purchasing a higher-quality and more reliable eyeliner pen.</li>
            <li>Even though this is cheaper than most, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li>Maybeline New York eye is also cheap and it&#x27;s incredible</li>
            <li>This came sooner than planned and looks pretty good.</li>
            <li>When I first received it, it was good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never been good at putting on makeup, but Elf&#x27;s eyeliner is so easy that I can actually do it pretty darn easily.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is, in essence, a glorified, dried-up marker - not even a sharpie - more like the cheap markers that come with the coloring pages at Walgreens or the dollar stores.</li>
            <li>It writes a lot more like a cheap felt tip marker for crafts than an eyeliner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Not easy to apply.</li>
            <li>It is easy to apply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>And easy to use</li>
            <li>Not waterproof and smudges easy too</li>
            <li>And the applicator is easy to apply to self however because of the color and lightness of it</li>
            <li>Easy to use and fine tip</li>
            <li>Just heard good things about the new one and wanted to try it.</li>
            <li>It also has very VERY litlle pigmentation and smears very easily.</li>
            <li>this also isnt waterproof and it just feels like a cheap marker.</li>
            <li>you want cheap eyeliner</li>
            <li>It goes on super smooth and is easy to create a perfect straight line on your upper lid and bottom!</li>
            <li>okay first, the tip breaks easy.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty okay.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s pretty okay.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite eyeliner ever--I have tried so many different kinds, but this stays on all day and is not difficult to remove, as many water proof makeup products are.  : )</li>
            <li>I love how it didnt smear it went on smooth, i have to buy another one because i lost my old one ughhh!!!</li>
            <li>Better than any of the high priced lines!</li>
            <li>Dries out quickly....</li>
            <li>I liked the width of the pen, and how it drew a nice line, but there&#x27;s hardly any eye liner in there.  </li>
            <li>Right after receiving this I tried to test it.</li>
            <li>I wear eyeliner alone as my only eye makeup daily, and I am happy with this product.</li>
            <li>Even though it wasn&#x27;t very much if I would of known how it worked</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t last or leave a smooth, clean line.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s precise, applies well, and actually leaves a clean line, don&#x27;t get this product.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re buying this for yourself, I beg of you to consider higher quality makeup.</li>
            <li>Yes, this product causes irritation - it made me QUITE irritable the first time I used</li>
            <li>Recommend for top lid use only...</li>
            <li>i would say that there are different and better things to get.</li>
            <li>the tip was gold the first day</li>
            <li>Worked well for the first 2 days I had it.</li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply if you steady your elbow, draw the line the highest you want it to go towards your brow and then fill in anything elbow that line that shows your normal skin color.  </li>
            <li>but most definitely was not waterproof eyeliner.</li>
            <li>It came pretty fast within 1 or 2 days.</li>
            <li>looks really pretty to top your lashes with a black line and then top it with a colored line just above it.</li>
            <li>The eyeliner pen was great at first, but now the tip is not doing so great, and the lines are dull and I have to press hard or go over it multiple times in order to get a darker line.</li>
            <li>Very translucent color, does not apply well.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>It is water proof and stayed the whole day.</li>
            <li>Elf&#x27;s design makes for a much shorter product life compared to brands like Shu Uemura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Even when it had eyeliner in it the pen tugged on my eye too much.</li>
            <li>definitely precision precise.</li>
            <li>Which doesn&#x27;t really make a difference but just saying</li>
            <li>not worth it, brought one from target and worked better.</li>
            <li>This product would be great for people just getting used to an eyeliner pen or people who don&#x27;t want to buy expensive makeup.</li>
            <li>I have tried the one i received before which is normally sold at Walmart for 1.00.</li>
            <li>you guessed it, dried up marker. :)</li>
            <li>This eyeliner is ok for everyday.</li>
            <li>I would like this more if it hadnt dried out</li>
            <li>The rest of the brand is pretty decent, being really low budget makeup.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without this eyeliner.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These are so completely waterproof!  </li>
            <li>I have tried using liquid eyeliner before and always end up with a huge mess and it all over my face and in my eye</li>
            <li>/&gt;It goes on so smoothly and the tip is super thin</li>
            <li>It can be a bit hard to get off sometimes, but I still love it.</li>
            <li>I use Loreal, which is offered at the same places this brand is, and it&#x27;s much better.&lt;br /&gt;Their</li>
            <li>But for the price, I was very, very pleasantly surprised and I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li>The whole pen was white.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if the product is old or just defective.  </li>
            <li>Almost more like a gray than black, and is very watered down.</li>
            <li>It was not black and not waterproof, as well as not as pictured.</li>
            <li>I will get it to throw in my gym bag or purse as a back up, but will pay a little more for another one that will last longer.</li>
            <li>A lot of people said it dried out quickly, but mine never has.</li>
            <li>This pen dried out too quickly.</li>
            <li>Mostly because it&#x27;s not easy to apply dried up ink from a cheap marker tip, to your (slightly moist) eye lid area!&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll go on for the first eye, but it starts to run out on the other.</li>
            <li>its light and dry quickly not useful</li>
            <li>My only issue is that there&#x27;s something going on with the cap because no matter how many time you seal it tightly, it will open, the cap will come off and dry out</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s barely any liquid in there.</li>
            <li>My NYC eyeliner has a thin line but is a lot better.</li>
            <li>It is very pointed and sharp and it hurts when i try it</li>
            <li>I wish the black was a little darker, and I would prefer a bit more staying power; I do have to reapply this product in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li>Hours after applying the eyeliner and noticing it was smudging I toughed it with a tiny bit of water, not even soapy water, regular old water and</li>
            <li>When I first opened it out of the package, the applicator tip was already bent at the top, which made applying a neat, even line nearly impossible.</li>
            <li>the color of the outside was white not black</li>

            <li> This eyeliner is ok for everyday.</li>
            <li> I would like this more if it hadnt dried out</li>
            <li> The rest of the brand is pretty decent, being really low budget makeup.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this eyeliner.</li>
            <li> /&gt;These are so completely waterproof!  </li>
            <li> I have tried using liquid eyeliner before and always end up with a huge mess and it all over my face and in my eye</li>
            <li> /&gt;It goes on so smoothly and the tip is super thin</li>
            <li> It can be a bit hard to get off sometimes, but I still love it.</li>
            <li> I use Loreal, which is offered at the same places this brand is, and it&#x27;s much better.&lt;br /&gt;Their</li>
            <li> But for the price, I was very, very pleasantly surprised and I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> The whole pen was white.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if the product is old or just defective.  </li>
            <li> Almost more like a gray than black, and is very watered down.</li>
            <li> It was not black and not waterproof, as well as not as pictured.</li>
            <li> I will get it to throw in my gym bag or purse as a back up, but will pay a little more for another one that will last longer.</li>
            <li> A lot of people said it dried out quickly, but mine never has.</li>
            <li> This pen dried out too quickly.</li>
            <li> Mostly because it&#x27;s not easy to apply dried up ink from a cheap marker tip, to your (slightly moist) eye lid area!&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll go on for the first eye, but it starts to run out on the other.</li>
            <li> its light and dry quickly not useful</li>
            <li> My only issue is that there&#x27;s something going on with the cap because no matter how many time you seal it tightly, it will open, the cap will come off and dry out</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s barely any liquid in there.</li>
            <li> My NYC eyeliner has a thin line but is a lot better.</li>
            <li> It is very pointed and sharp and it hurts when i try it</li>
            <li> I wish the black was a little darker, and I would prefer a bit more staying power; I do have to reapply this product in the middle of the day.</li>
            <li> Hours after applying the eyeliner and noticing it was smudging I toughed it with a tiny bit of water, not even soapy water, regular old water and</li>
            <li> When I first opened it out of the package, the applicator tip was already bent at the top, which made applying a neat, even line nearly impossible.</li>
            <li> the color of the outside was white not black</li>
            <li> I  also usually go over it again after my mascara dried because it&#x27;s easier to what your missed right up next to your lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I held it at different angles and applied pressure, it was simply empty.</li>
            <li> Goes on almost grey</li>
            <li> I was kind of disappointed that i received something that seems different than i was expecting.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very black, and completely waterproof.</li>
            <li> and it was bone dry.</li>
            <li> After one week product started to dry out</li>
            <li> you put it on, let it dry before using an eyelash curler or it smears off.  </li>
            <li> Went back to get it again and only came in a black pen !</li>
            <li> Then it seemed dried out and took several strokes to show even a pale gray color, certainly not black.  </li>
            <li> Does not work well if you want a solid black line.</li>
            <li> I have never really had a problem with any of their cosmetics.</li>
            <li> This does not last but a few times.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
            <li> I have 3 different colors and none if dried out.  </li>
            <li> The product would hardly even come out of the tip, and after a few tries, it completely stopped working</li>
            <li> I regret buying this eye liner , very dry , not easy to apply .</li>
            <li> Shaking and storing upside down did not help.</li>
            <li> I store it with the tip facing down, so that&#x27;s probably why.</li>
            <li> It even doesn&#x27;t have the dark black color it should have.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner i received is in a black tubing and not what i was expecting..</li>
            <li> The color isn&#x27;t that black which i can&#x27;t tell if its the product its self or if it had to do with me buying it from amazon.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before but in brown, couldn&#x27;t find it in black so ordered it here.</li>
            <li> and I got black.</li>
            <li> The tip is a little flimsy</li>
            <li> Little to no colour comes out when you apply it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d be miffed if I hadn&#x27;t gotten it on sale for like $1.86.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;marker&#x27; tip actually retreats into the pen itself when you press with any pressure whatsoever, which is awkward and you have to then pull it back out and</li>
            <li> It is literally just a dried up marker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Seems dried out.</li>
            <li> But then it compleatly dried out after 2 days with the cap on.</li>
            <li> Its already dried out already...</li>
            <li> Did not get done with one eye before pen dried up.</li>
            <li> I used it a few times and it was out.  </li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s dried out.</li>
            <li> however dried out quickly :(</li>
            <li> threw it away right when it came did nothing to my eyes:(</li>
            <li> It was dried out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why others are having</li>
            <li> Usually elf products are a hit or miss</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not able to achieve any type of dramatic, dark eye liner with this pen.</li>
            <li> Hardly any disguising it.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to put on my bottom eyelid</li>
            <li> No matter how hard I push it still won&#x27;t come out.  </li>
            <li> but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to draw on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to get the eyeliner to come out of the dispenser.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pure crap.</li>
            <li> I put it on in the morning and get home late in the evening</li>
            <li> No more raccoon eyes!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s dried!!!</li>
            <li> The brush/tip is thin.</li>
            <li> it is dry i can&#x27;t use it :(</li>
            <li> Awful product stopped working in less than a week just dried up out of nowhere</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you are going to be disappointed and will have to replace your elf pen every few weeks.</li>
            <li> WTF?</li>
            <li> Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> I have tried every brand out there, even the very expensive 30-40 dollars price and had never obtained the results that you&#x27;ll get with this brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely disappointed.</li>
            <li> A very bad choice .</li>
            <li> I have ordered a lot of e.l.f product and this is the worst.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed!</li>
            <li> Horrible, definetly not water proof.</li>
            <li> hate it!</li>
            <li> This eyeliner was terrible.</li>
            <li> This is one of the worst Amazon purchases I&#x27;ve made.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The rest of the brand is pretty decent, being really low budget makeup. I would only buy it for middle school plays, though.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re buying this for yourself, I beg of you to consider higher quality makeup. I use Loreal, which is offered at the same places this brand is, and it&#x27;s much better.&lt;br /&gt;Their eyeliner is outright a felt tip marker. Hardly any disguising it. Colors come on as they look.</li>
            <li> It was very good liner</li>
            <li> The eyeliner i received is in a black tubing and not what i was expecting.. I have tried the one i received before which is normally sold at Walmart for 1.00. Just heard good things about the new one and wanted to try it. I was kind of disappointed that i received something that seems different than i was expecting.</li>
            <li> The item in the picture is not the same item that i got. this also isnt waterproof and it just feels like a cheap marker.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and fine tip</li>
            <li> the color of the outside was white not black</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, it&#x27;s dried!!!</li>
            <li> Love this, works like a marker and stayed on all day in the salt water and FL sun</li>
            <li> I used this twice and it didn&#x27;t work anymore.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never been good at putting on makeup, but Elf&#x27;s eyeliner is so easy that I can actually do it pretty darn easily. They sell it at Target for $2, which is a better deal, but Target was out of it for a while so I purchased it from here. Either way, happy I can get it, no matter the seller. :)</li>
            <li> I have ordered a lot of e.l.f product and this is the worst. I have never really had a problem with any of their cosmetics. Right after receiving this I tried to test it. The tip broke and no eyeliner came out whatsoever. I held it at different angles and applied pressure, it was simply empty. I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> really good, it&#x27;s just like a stilla eyeliner!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Yes, this product causes irritation - it made me QUITE irritable the first time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, this is not a liquid eyeliner pen. There is no liquid eyeliner in it whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, in essence, a glorified, dried-up marker - not even a sharpie - more like the cheap markers that come with the coloring pages at Walgreens or the dollar stores. I&#x27;m not knocking E.L.F. but this is quite sub-par. I&#x27;d be miffed if I hadn&#x27;t gotten it on sale for like $1.86.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;marker&#x27; tip actually retreats into the pen itself when you press with any pressure whatsoever, which is awkward and you have to then pull it back out and just hope it doesnt keep happening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not easy to apply. Mostly because it&#x27;s not easy to apply dried up ink from a cheap marker tip, to your (slightly moist) eye lid area!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was not able to achieve any type of dramatic, dark eye liner with this pen. It looked like i had tried to put it on with a ... you guessed it, dried up marker. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You shake the pen and hear nothing, because there is nothing in there to be mixed by the shaking. It is literally just a dried up marker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is, however, just as waterproof as a dying Sharpie.</li>
            <li> Yeah, these E.L.F products work great! BUT if you go to your local target, you can find these products for a buck or 2.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this eyeliner for $2 at my local target.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so if you like these products and want to save some cash, then walk to target :]</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t leave cap off or anything.  Just second time to use and it was bone dry.</li>
            <li> Do NOT use if you have watery eyes. Recommend for top lid use only...</li>
            <li> Let me just begin by saying that for the price, everyone who wears eyeliner needs to buy this product. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on so smoothly and the tip is super thin so you can get a very precise line. I wear eyeliner alone as my only eye makeup daily, and I am happy with this product. I wish the black was a little darker, and I would prefer a bit more staying power; I do have to reapply this product in the middle of the day. But for the price, I was very, very pleasantly surprised and I will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> okay first, the tip breaks easy. It doesn&#x27;t last or leave a smooth, clean line. Very translucent color, does not apply well. Isn&#x27;t even that waterproof! It definitely comes off in the water. It you want cheap eyeliner that&#x27;s precise, applies well, and actually leaves a clean line, don&#x27;t get this product. It doesn&#x27;t do its job. Maybeline New York eye is also cheap and it&#x27;s incredible I wish I just bought that again!</li>
            <li> The pen works great for outlining the makeup for Starchild, The Cat, The Demon and Space Ace!  We don&#x27;t go on stage without it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Very good seller. I love the eyeliner from elf . Its waterproof its to take it off . I do recommend this to everyone . I love it . I have used it many times.</li>
            <li> It is easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t stay on long.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s running out after maybe 20 applications.&lt;br /&gt;But the idea is so good, and application so easy, that I&#x27;ll buy another couple.</li>
            <li> Seems dried out. Does not work well if you want a solid black line.</li>
            <li> Was awesome! And easy to use however dried out quickly :(</li>
            <li> Good for on the go when I don&#x27;t have my creme eyeliner with me. This came sooner than planned and looks pretty good.</li>
            <li> I regret buying this eye liner , very dry , not easy to apply . It even doesn&#x27;t have the dark black color it should have. A very bad choice .</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to put on my bottom eyelid it feels like it run out after I used it for the second time</li>
            <li> Not waterproof and smudges easy too</li>
            <li> It came pretty fast within 1 or 2 days. The color isn&#x27;t that black which i can&#x27;t tell if its the product its self or if it had to do with me buying it from amazon. It is water proof and stayed the whole day. And the applicator is easy to apply to self however because of the color and lightness of it i would say that there are different and better things to get.</li>
            <li> its light and dry quickly not useful</li>
            <li> Awful product stopped working in less than a week just dried up out of nowhere the tip was gold the first day and I made sure not to apply pressure whatsoever you get what you pay for don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> I started using this when I bought one in Kmart. Just wanted to try it. Loved it. The whole pen was white. It lasted months without drying out. Went back to get it again and only came in a black pen ! This does not last but a few times.&lt;br /&gt;Wish they hadn&#x27;t changed it.  Maybe they want you to buy it every two weeks. It works great till it dries out.</li>
            <li> I love elf products because they are inexpensive and good quality. The eyeliner pen was great at first, but now the tip is not doing so great, and the lines are dull and I have to press hard or go over it multiple times in order to get a darker line. This product would be great for people just getting used to an eyeliner pen or people who don&#x27;t want to buy expensive makeup. I wouldn&#x27;t mind getting this again.</li>
            <li> Worked well for the first 2 days I had it. It was water proof. But then it compleatly dried out after 2 days with the cap on.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this eye liner. I have tried every brand out there, even the very expensive 30-40 dollars price and had never obtained the results that you&#x27;ll get with this brand. I put it on in the morning and get home late in the evening and there is no smudges AT ALL! No more raccoon eyes! Awesome product....highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this product at Wal-Mart. It&#x27;s pure crap. There&#x27;s barely any liquid in there. It&#x27;ll go on for the first eye, but it starts to run out on the other. I shook it and the liquid splatterd all over my bed..</li>
            <li> The eyeliner tip broke after no time at all. I only used it once. I am very disappointed! I like E.l.F.&#x27;s products just not this one.</li>
            <li> It says it waterproof, but it fades off within seconds if you apply it to your waterline. WTF?</li>
            <li> I like this! It&#x27;s very easy to work with, so beginners will have no problem. The brush/tip is thin. I like! The only thing I would question about this eyeliner is the title. It just... ok. Haha!</li>
            <li> Dries out quickly.... not worth it, brought one from target and worked better. After one week product started to dry out</li>
            <li> Wasn&#x27;t able to use because it never dispensed an even amount of liner. Really disappointing.</li>
            <li> Love this . We are in the middle of heat wave. The tempatue was 110 yesterday today 107 . No running at all . This is now my official go to eyeliner for the spring and summer</li>
            <li> it is dry i can&#x27;t use it :(</li>
            <li> Even though it wasn&#x27;t very much if I would of known how it worked i wouldn&#x27;t of bought it.  It is like taking a stick and trying to get the liner out of it.  No matter how hard I push it still won&#x27;t come out.  It is very pointed and sharp and it hurts when i try it so I won&#x27;t use it.</li>
            <li> This is the best eyeliner I have ever used. It goes on perfectly. Better than any of the high priced lines!</li>
            <li> Its already dried out already... Only had it for a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> I wish I could give this 0 stars. Did not get done with one eye before pen dried up. Shaking and storing upside down did not help. Switched to the Smashbox eyeliner pen and love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this eyeliner for awhile now, and I&#x27;m in love. It&#x27;s very black, and completely waterproof. It can be a bit hard to get off sometimes, but I still love it. A lot of people said it dried out quickly, but mine never has. I store it with the tip facing down, so that&#x27;s probably why.</li>
            <li> I have tried using liquid eyeliner before and always end up with a huge mess and it all over my face and in my eye but this makes it so easy to apply and it&#x27;s great. It doesn&#x27;t smear and it doesn&#x27;t run into my eyes when I am applying it.</li>
            <li> Horrible, definetly not water proof. The product would hardly even come out of the tip, and after a few tries, it completely stopped working</li>
            <li> I love how it didnt smear it went on smooth, i have to buy another one because i lost my old one ughhh!!!</li>
            <li> hate it! threw it away right when it came did nothing to my eyes:(</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this product before but in brown, couldn&#x27;t find it in black so ordered it here. The applicator is felt-tipped and is different than what I have.  When I first opened it out of the package, the applicator tip was already bent at the top, which made applying a neat, even line nearly impossible. Then it seemed dried out and took several strokes to show even a pale gray color, certainly not black.  I don&#x27;t know if the product is old or just defective.  Won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner is ok for everyday.I use the good one for weekends.It does the job and the price is  right.&lt;br /&gt;Drumcat</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully! My only issue is that there&#x27;s something going on with the cap because no matter how many time you seal it tightly, it will open, the cap will come off and dry out but if you close it and leave it for a while, it magically restores itself! Lol... It does though..</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s pretty okay. not waterproof. comes off after wearing it all day. it&#x27;s pretty okay.</li>
            <li> When I received it, it was already out of the product. This was an accidental buy but was happy to receive it nonetheless, until I tried to use it. Definitely will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> It was dried out! Unusable😐</li>
            <li> It works great but sometimes it&#x27;s hard to draw on. The tip is a little flimsy but otherwise it&#x27;s great. I&#x27;d recommend getting it!</li>
            <li> When I first received it, it was good.  I liked the width of the pen, and how it drew a nice line, but there&#x27;s hardly any eye liner in there.  I used it a few times and it was out.  I will get it to throw in my gym bag or purse as a back up, but will pay a little more for another one that will last longer.</li>
            <li> I bought this about 2 months ago, store it laying on its side, in the drawer of an acrylic cabinet.  I have 3 different colors and none if dried out.  I&#x27;m not sure why others are having issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are so completely waterproof!  I suddenly had to go into the hospital and came home 3 days later.  I still had this eyeliner on because the face soap and water they gave me did not take it off.  I use Mary Kay eye makeup remover and it comes off just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you put it on, let it dry before using an eyelash curler or it smears off.  It&#x27;s easy to apply if you steady your elbow, draw the line the highest you want it to go towards your brow and then fill in anything elbow that line that shows your normal skin color.  I  also usually go over it again after my mascara dried because it&#x27;s easier to what your missed right up next to your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks really pretty to top your lashes with a black line and then top it with a colored line just above it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without this eyeliner. I&#x27;m 27, I&#x27;ve gone through probably 100 different eyeliners from Chanel to NYC. This is the best eyeliner there is because it stays put, it&#x27;s easy to take off, and comes in really awesome vibrant colors. Winged liner is a breeze with this pen.</li>
            <li> Elf has great products for a good price. This gel felt tip is a great addition to my collection.</li>
            <li> This eyeliner was terrible. It runs and bleeds into the creases in your skin. It&#x27;s hard to get the eyeliner to come out of the dispenser. The felt tip bends and frays after just one use. On top of all this, it&#x27;s not waterproof! Spend your money elsewhere...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not waterproof...</li>
            <li> I would like this more if it hadnt dried out but it lasted me a good 4 months , the tip is kind aggravating but I used it as a fill in so drawing my wings on wasnt a option. Usually elf products are a hit or miss but this one I give 4 stars</li>
            <li> So easy to use and apply and it stays in place and doesn&#x27;t smudge!</li>
            <li> This product is great for around the first 10 applications. After that, it leaves a fainter and fainter line until gradually all of the product is gone. It lasted me around 3 weeks. Elf eyeliner pens contain a foam cartridge instead of the replaceable liquid ink cartridges used by more expensive brands. Elf&#x27;s design makes for a much shorter product life compared to brands like Shu Uemura.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that, it is perfect for trips when you run out or forget your eyeliner at home or people who just want to give eyeliner pens a try to see how they like them. If you plan on using an eyeliner pen long-term, in the long-run you would be better off purchasing a higher-quality and more reliable eyeliner pen. Otherwise, you are going to be disappointed and will have to replace your elf pen every few weeks.</li>
            <li> The eyeliner I received was NOT what was pictured. It also has very VERY litlle pigmentation and smears very easily. Not anywhere close to waterproof. Little to no colour comes out when you apply it. Almost more like a gray than black, and is very watered down. It writes a lot more like a cheap felt tip marker for crafts than an eyeliner. It was not black and not waterproof, as well as not as pictured.</li>
            <li> This pen dried out too quickly. Even when it had eyeliner in it the pen tugged on my eye too much. My NYC eyeliner has a thin line but is a lot better. Even though this is cheaper than most, you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> Not how i thought it would be like.....</li>
            <li> This is absolutely my favorite eyeliner of all time! It goes on super smooth and is easy to create a perfect straight line on your upper lid and bottom! definitely precision precise. I am very pleased with this eyeliner and purchased it for a dollar at 7-Eleven! Will buy again and again.</li>
            <li> Seems like it&#x27;s dried out. Goes on almost grey and I got black.</li>
            <li> Doesnt look like the  photo, the one I got was in a white tube. Which doesn&#x27;t really make a difference but just saying</li>
            <li> This is my favorite eyeliner ever--I have tried so many different kinds, but this stays on all day and is not difficult to remove, as many water proof makeup products are.  : )</li>
            <li> The product pictured it not the product that I received. I received a white pen that said waterproof eyeliner but most definitely was not waterproof eyeliner. I&#x27;m extremely disappointed. Any touch caused smudges. Hours after applying the eyeliner and noticing it was smudging I toughed it with a tiny bit of water, not even soapy water, regular old water and it smeared everywhere. This is one of the worst Amazon purchases I&#x27;ve made. I will never purchase cosmetic products from this site again.</li>
