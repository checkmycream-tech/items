            <li>Was great love it!</li>
            <li>this is not as good as TRUblend whipped foundation that I used for years.</li>

            <li>I love this foundation!  </li>
            <li>Makes my skin look smooth and great.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to blend and covers nicely.</li>

            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this foundation.  </li>
            <li>My granddaughters favorite.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love how this covers and that it matches my skin so well.</li>
            <li>I put it on with a duo fiber brush and it&#x27;s on, with flawless coverage, in less than a minute .</li>
            <li>The foundation itself is smooth, creamy and goes on light as air.  </li>
            <li>comfortable on skin.</li>
            <li>Feels light and airy..</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and I don&#x27;t need to wear powder over it because it gives a powdery finish anyways.</li>
            <li>My teenager just loves this product as it covers so smoothly &amp; evenly</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth and feels clean, not greasy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Cover Girl&#x27;s tag line in the 1970&#x27;s was \\&quot;clean makeup\\&quot; and they keep their promise.</li>
            <li>Love it and it was fast</li>
            <li>Feels like nothing on my skin but gives medium to full coverage.</li>
            <li>but it does not do the full job.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected, good price, quick delivery!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light and covers really well!</li>
            <li>The jar&#x27;s small size and light weight make it perfect to carry around for touch-ups or those mornings when you&#x27;re too busy to do your makeup before you head out the door.  </li>
            <li>I need to apply a light bronzer over this to make it look natural.</li>
            <li>I really like the look this makeup gives me when it is fresh...</li>
            <li>The product made my skin very cakey</li>
            <li>, I cant really complain.</li>
            <li>I am definitely going to order more when I get low on this one.</li>
            <li>It looks a little too dark in the jar, but blends out very nicely on the skin.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, after a few hours my face is very shiny and I end up putting a light powder on over this.</li>
            <li>I have a foundation exactly like this just a different color</li>
            <li>Gives that soft natural look.</li>
            <li>It could be because I have naturally oily skin</li>
            <li>/&gt;This also does not make me break out like a lot of other products do and it matches my skin tone really well even when I go from pasty white to tan</li>

            <li> Bad formula, has a cherry scent (not good), very pale and has deep pink under tones, looks cakey, makes your skin dry and irritated...</li>
            <li> This is the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon!</li>

    <ol>
            <li> After CoverGirl changed all their foundation products - it is the only one I would consider using.....this is not as good as TRUblend whipped foundation that I used for years.</li>
            <li> The product made my skin very cakey but when I bought it in store it was very good.. So idk what&#x27;s up with this product.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected, good price, quick delivery!!</li>
            <li> Awesome stuff!  Makes my skin look smooth and great.  Nice coverage!</li>
            <li> I was in panic when they pulled it out from the stores but found it on Amazon. Very happy.</li>
            <li> Love it and it was fast</li>
            <li> I could not find the Creamy Beige 350 in my area...therefore the order.  I am trying it as a concealer as I mix it with different moisturizers.  Works wonders for my sister and I want it to do the same for me...but...the testing is continuing.</li>
            <li> I use several different foundations because my skin tone changes several times during the year.  Cover Girl Whipped Creme Foundation is one of my favorites, and I keep a jar in my purse at all times.  The jar&#x27;s small size and light weight make it perfect to carry around for touch-ups or those mornings when you&#x27;re too busy to do your makeup before you head out the door.  The foundation itself is smooth, creamy and goes on light as air.  It never cakes or becomes greasy throughout the day, and feels marvelous on my skin, just like a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cover Girl&#x27;s tag line in the 1970&#x27;s was \\&quot;clean makeup\\&quot; and they keep their promise. You never feel oily or have that \\&quot;mask\\&quot; sensation while you&#x27;re wearing this foundation.  It comes in a variety of shades, perfect for any skin tone, and you&#x27;ll be pleased at both its price and performance.  A little goes a long way with this product, so don&#x27;t be put off by the small size of the jar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear the Creamy Beige most often.  Looks great for spring and winter skin!</li>
            <li> I love this foundation!  It goes on smooth and feels clean, not greasy.</li>
            <li> This is the worst purchase I have ever made on Amazon! Don&#x27;t buy it! Bad formula, has a cherry scent (not good), very pale and has deep pink under tones, looks cakey, makes your skin dry and irritated...</li>
            <li> I like it. comfortable on skin.</li>
            <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s my 5th time buying it. I put it on with a duo fiber brush and it&#x27;s on, with flawless coverage, in less than a minute . sometimes I will buff it in with a dry brush in case there are any brush marks from my application. Feels like nothing on my skin but gives medium to full coverage. I put it on with my finger under my eyes for fuller coverage and set that with a tiny bit of powder. it stays a bit moist so under eye it needs a bit of setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great tone matches my skin. I have a darker shade to mix in when I tan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been searching the stores for this but the must not make it any longer. It&#x27;s light and covers really well!</li>
            <li> Left me looking white should of got another color</li>
            <li> Goes on lighter than it looks. I need to apply a light bronzer over this to make it look natural. It smells good though and I like the consistency. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> It looks a little too dark in the jar, but blends out very nicely on the skin. It is very easy to blend and covers nicely. Gives that soft natural look. Feels light and airy.. Love this foundation.  I am definitely going to order more when I get low on this one.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS FOUNDATION !!!!!  goes on &amp; stays on all day for me</li>
            <li> My granddaughters favorite.</li>
            <li> I have used it before and knew what to expect. I am pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love how this covers and that it matches my skin so well. It goes on smooth and I don&#x27;t need to wear powder over it because it gives a powdery finish anyways.</li>
            <li> My teenager just loves this product as it covers so smoothly &amp; evenly yet she says it seems as if her face can &#x27;still breathe&#x27;!</li>
            <li> I really like the look this makeup gives me when it is fresh...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, after a few hours my face is very shiny and I end up putting a light powder on over this. It could be because I have naturally oily skin though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also does not make me break out like a lot of other products do and it matches my skin tone really well even when I go from pasty white to tan lol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I like this and I will continue to buy it as my foundation.</li>
            <li> Was great love it! Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I have a foundation exactly like this just a different color and it works great. its lighter then this one but goes on darker then this foundation I just bought. I like this but it does not do the full job. Kind of disappointed but for the price, I cant really complain. Still a good product though.</li>
