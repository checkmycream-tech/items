            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>Perfect for what I purchased for.</li>
            <li>If so, they would be great for backpacking.</li>
            <li>great item buy it</li>
            <li>The sprayer works great.</li>
            <li>Totally happy with these.</li>
            <li>The pumps do a good job of delivering the oil mixtures, but have not used it for water based solutions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;That said, for anything requiring a light misting, these would be great.</li>
            <li>They tend to be leaky, I&#x27;m not quite sure if it&#x27;s because of the carrier oils used.  </li>
            <li>stuff was way more than I used on a week&#x27;s trip.</li>
            <li>Cheap and will not be able to use.</li>
            <li>cute, tiny, great for travel.</li>
            <li>the bottle seams cheap</li>
            <li>far so good, update to follow...</li>
            <li>properly packaged, and all of the bottles are in good condition.</li>
            <li>Adequate.</li>
            <li>The containers were not only handy</li>
            <li>I did have to trim the lengths of the spray tube, however; they were mostly too long to fit in the bottle.</li>
            <li>Extremely happy with the quality of these small pumps sprayers.</li>
            <li>Have not yet tested on more viscous products such as hand creams and sun screens.</li>
            <li>Just be aware.</li>
            <li>I cut them to fit better instead of having to jam them in each time I refilled the small bottles.</li>
            <li>Wanted a way to split up large containers of lotions, sunscreens, etc</li>
            <li>Also the straws that extend from the lids had to be cut to fit the smaller bottles.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, the Item was just as described.</li>
            <li>I flew on one of those airlines that really penalizes you if you go over the weight limit.</li>
            <li>Working very well.</li>
            <li>Turns out you use so little of most things – even 10mL of my hair spritz</li>
            <li>Cheaply made, but thast is to be expected at the price.</li>
            <li>Have only used one (of the smallest size) so far, but it was just what I needed to always have some bug spray around when I need it without adding much weight to my purse or facepainting kit.</li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t entirely unexpected, given the size of the bottle (thus the pump distance and the volume of the tube).</li>

            <li> Very small.</li>
            <li> Can also be used to divide large volumes, instead of buying the travel sizes of after shave, hand sanitizer, insect repellent,</li>

            <li> Purchased this set of 9 spray pump plastic bottles to make my solutions of tea tree oil and citronella. The pumps do a good job of delivering the oil mixtures, but have not used it for water based solutions. Have not yet tested on more viscous products such as hand creams and sun screens. Can also be used to divide large volumes, instead of buying the travel sizes of after shave, hand sanitizer, insect repellent, ect.&lt;br /&gt;So far so good, update to follow...</li>
            <li> Needed a little bottle to hold glass cleaner for my &amp;#34;readers&amp;#34; in my purse.  I keep this with a few tissues and I&#x27;m set to go!  Perfect!</li>
            <li> Have only used one (of the smallest size) so far, but it was just what I needed to always have some bug spray around when I need it without adding much weight to my purse or facepainting kit.</li>
            <li> The volume of output on each pump is quite low. This isn&#x27;t entirely unexpected, given the size of the bottle (thus the pump distance and the volume of the tube). However, it was still lower than I expected and thus not good for what I wanted them for. Thus the minus start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, for anything requiring a light misting, these would be great. The pump action seems to be reliable and the cap stays on firmly. I&#x27;m curious as to whether these would hold deet without dissolving the plastic (something deet can do to many/most plastics). If so, they would be great for backpacking.</li>
            <li> They all leaked.  Threw them out.</li>
            <li> Bluecell White Color Set of 9 (10/20/30)ml Spray Pump Portable...cute, tiny, great for travel. used to store perfume. great item buy it</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t be more disappointed.  Cheap and will not be able to use.</li>
            <li> We are using the bottles for eos.  They tend to be leaky, I&#x27;m not quite sure if it&#x27;s because of the carrier oils used.  The sprayer works great.</li>
            <li> These are VERY small. Just be aware.</li>
            <li> the straws were very long and were wound up inside the bottles. I cut them to fit better instead of having to jam them in each time I refilled the small bottles. the bottle seams cheap and I think i&#x27;ll convert to glass only.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with the quality of these small pumps sprayers. I&#x27;m ordering them again.</li>
            <li> Very small. Much smaller than expected. Also the straws that extend from the lids had to be cut to fit the smaller bottles. Do not recommend.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, the Item was just as described.</li>
            <li> Totally happy with these. I got them for travel. Turns out you use so little of most things – even 10mL of my hair spritz stuff was way more than I used on a week&#x27;s trip. I did have to trim the lengths of the spray tube, however; they were mostly too long to fit in the bottle.</li>
            <li> Adequate. Cheaply made, but thast is to be expected at the price. The straw inside is very long and needs to be trimmed to function. Came on time. properly packaged, and all of the bottles are in good condition. I would repurchase.</li>
            <li> I purchased these containers so that I could pack lighter for a trip. I flew on one of those airlines that really penalizes you if you go over the weight limit. The containers were not only handy but the spray functions also worked well.</li>
            <li> Perfect for what I purchased for. Wanted a way to split up large containers of lotions, sunscreens, etc so we did not have to buy smaller tubes and could use one tube before it expired. Working very well.</li>
