            <li>Thanks,also, for great price/and delivery!</li>
            <li>This is great for getting a neat polished look on the go.</li>
            <li>Great for a mani on the go.</li>
            <li>I was really happy when I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had good luck with this product.</li>
            <li>GOOD PRODUCT....</li>
            <li>I loved the glaze, and I&#x27;m using it and have had good results recommended, also the order arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li>As others have also said, this product is more of a strengthener than a whitener.  </li>
            <li>This product, like many others that supposedly whiten nails, did nothing to help the appearance of my nails or to make them stronger.  </li>
            <li>or if you are using acetone, it comes off more easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I almost always use Sally Hansen nail polish and SH Diamond top coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>I love this polish.</li>
            <li>This product gives my nails a nice natural shine and makes them look clean and bright.</li>
            <li>Cutex whitener is a far superior product - if you&#x27;re able to find some in stock anywhere it is the nail whitener I would recommend.</li>
            <li>This wasn&#x27;t that cheap.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use and dries quick.</li>
            <li>Super bummer.</li>
            <li>I do like the product VERY much!</li>
            <li>This product is nice for shine but doesn&#x27;t make your nails look white.</li>
            <li>It is called a &#x27;Nail Whitener&#x27;, but basically it seems to just do what a clear top coat nail polish would do.</li>
            <li>I had purchased this item at a local retail store and found that I liked the results.</li>
            <li>When I use this product, the whites on my nails become really a pronounced white-not as good as a french manicure, but, still a real improvement.</li>
            <li>Follow with a light pink over the whole nail and then apply a top coat.</li>
            <li>It does not whiten, it just seals in the yellow and adds more of</li>
            <li>I bought this product in the retail market and loved it but could not easily find it again.  </li>
            <li>NOT LIKING IT MUCH</li>
            <li>I used to love this product, one of my favorites, but the bottles I received through amazon have a tint of yellow when spread on the nails, they should be clear.  </li>
            <li>I have used this for years and it does give nails a lighter more even appearance and gives me the look I want when used with a couple other products.</li>
            <li>I wasted it a lot more money on this since I bought it at the drug store instead of Amazon.</li>
            <li>I always lightly buff my nails to remove any discoloration, use the white pencil underneath my tips and clean them really well prior to applying the whitening polish since it does peel and chip easier than some other polishes.</li>
            <li>From my understanding, if you apply this product to your tips only, dry, and then apply white polish, it will make the white really bright.</li>
            <li>I put on one coat of Insta-Brite and then wait maybe less than a minute and put on my regular nail polish, two coats and then Sally Hansen Diamond top coat.</li>
            <li>When I applied this I noticed that instead of being clear it had a yellowish tint</li>
            <li>I believe they are old, or perhaps expired.  </li>
            <li>Wow, I now see all the reviews about this not working.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how many negative reviews it received.  </li>
            <li>It is also the best base coat.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s usually about when I would be replacing it with a fresh coat anyways.</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t automatically turn nails white, but it does protect them from dark polish and prevents them from turning dark from that polish.</li>
            <li> Basically I spent 45.</li>
            <li> This product did not perform as expected.</li>
            <li> ; your nail polish off, but I have intermittent severe eczema on my hands and nail polish remover hurts when it&#x27;s acting up, so I can safely peel off my polish when I can&#x27;t use acetone due to the plastic like base</li>
            <li> Once your smile line is clean, apply another thin layer of the base coat.</li>
            <li> only complaint is that it is hard to find.</li>
            <li> Waste of money....</li>
            <li> When I went back to purchase it again, I was unable to find it any where.</li>
            <li> I do think it makes the nails a bit brittle, but that is hard to tell as my nails often get brittle in the winter months.</li>
            <li> Must have been really old or just a bad product.</li>
            <li> so it made my nails look worse.</li>
            <li> Have any of you applied this as a base coat and then applied white polish to your tips?</li>
            <li> I bought it because I have been finding it difficult to find Cutex Whitener lateley.  </li>
            <li> However, with everyone giving this product bad reviews, I&#x27;m wondering...</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This was awful- threw it away.</li>

            <li> As others have also said, this product is more of a strengthener than a whitener.  I bought it because I have been finding it difficult to find Cutex Whitener lateley.  Cutex whitener is a far superior product - if you&#x27;re able to find some in stock anywhere it is the nail whitener I would recommend.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews before I purchase this. And this in like a nail hardner, not a whiter. This product is nice for shine but doesn&#x27;t make your nails look white. This wasn&#x27;t that cheap. I will continue to buy Sally Hansen products but as for nail whiteners, this didnot do what it stated.      I wouldnot recommemd this product to someone who want a nail whitener                                                                 M. Morris</li>
            <li> It is called a &#x27;Nail Whitener&#x27;, but basically it seems to just do what a clear top coat nail polish would do. Nails are shiny but not any whiter.</li>
            <li> This was awful- threw it away. Not only did it not whiten my nails, it turned them yellow!  Must have been really old or just a bad product.</li>
            <li> NOT WOW.. THEY ADDED BLUE TO TAKE THE YELLOW EFFECT OUT NOT REALLY TAKING CARE OF THE ISSUE.. NOT LIKING IT MUCH</li>
            <li> I used to love this product, one of my favorites, but the bottles I received through amazon have a tint of yellow when spread on the nails, they should be clear.  I believe they are old, or perhaps expired.  I also found out they are a discontinued product.  Basically I spent 45. on delivery for nothing.  Very disappointed.  disapointment</li>
            <li> When I applied this I noticed that instead of being clear it had a yellowish tint so it made my nails look worse. I wasted it a lot more money on this since I bought it at the drug store instead of Amazon.</li>
            <li> I have used this for years and it does give nails a lighter more even appearance and gives me the look I want when used with a couple other products. I always lightly buff my nails to remove any discoloration, use the white pencil underneath my tips and clean them really well prior to applying the whitening polish since it does peel and chip easier than some other polishes. Also, apply two coats which makes a big difference compared to just one. It does start to discolor within a week or so  but it&#x27;s usually about when I would be replacing it with a fresh coat anyways. Overall my only complaint is the durability.</li>
            <li> This is great for getting a neat polished look on the go. It is easy to use and dries quick. Great for a mani on the go.</li>
            <li> This product, like many others that supposedly whiten nails, did nothing to help the appearance of my nails or to make them stronger.  If you&#x27;re searching for a product that will make yellowed nails look whiter, this is not the product for you.</li>
            <li> thank you I received it today is July 10th</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had good luck with this product. It doesn&#x27;t automatically turn nails white, but it does protect them from dark polish and prevents them from turning dark from that polish. It is also the best base coat. One of the reasons I like it is that it not only puts up a barrier between your nail and the polish, but it is allows the polish to come off in one piece or if you are using acetone, it comes off more easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not had any problems with it drying. I put on one coat of Insta-Brite and then wait maybe less than a minute and put on my regular nail polish, two coats and then Sally Hansen Diamond top coat. I almost always use Sally Hansen nail polish and SH Diamond top coat. Then either spray of brushed on polish hardener. This product also helps my nail polish last longer. When using Insta-Brite I can get 4-5 days from a manicure, when without this product it starts chipping the same day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you are not supposed to &amp;#34;peel&amp;#34; your nail polish off, but I have intermittent severe eczema on my hands and nail polish remover hurts when it&#x27;s acting up, so I can safely peel off my polish when I can&#x27;t use acetone due to the plastic like base this product sets up under my nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is hard to find. I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I had purchased this item at a local retail store and found that I liked the results. When I went back to purchase it again, I was unable to find it any where. I was really happy when I found it on Amazon. This product gives my nails a nice natural shine and makes them look clean and bright. I will purchase this item again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product in the retail market and loved it but could not easily find it again.  So, I went online.  I was surprised how many negative reviews it received.  I do not regularly use nail polish so my nails are not yellowed.  When I use this product, the whites on my nails become really a pronounced white-not as good as a french manicure, but, still a real improvement. I do think it makes the nails a bit brittle, but that is hard to tell as my nails often get brittle in the winter months.</li>
            <li> This product did not perform as expected.My nails did not show any improvement and i always put an undercoat before applying my nail polish.</li>
            <li> I have not yet tried this product, nor have I read the label or instructions for it. However, with everyone giving this product bad reviews, I&#x27;m wondering... Have any of you applied this as a base coat and then applied white polish to your tips? From my understanding, if you apply this product to your tips only, dry, and then apply white polish, it will make the white really bright. Once your smile line is clean, apply another thin layer of the base coat. Dry. Follow with a light pink over the whole nail and then apply a top coat.</li>
            <li> GOOD PRODUCT....All of my nails were whiter...except for 2 not as white as others! I do like the product VERY much! Thanks,also, for great price/and delivery! M.J.</li>
            <li> Wow, I now see all the reviews about this not working.  Should have read those prior to purchase.  How can  a yellow tinted product whiten nails?!  It does not whiten, it just seals in the yellow and adds more of it&#x27;s own.</li>
            <li> I love this polish. My nails tend to yellow and this product makes them white as snow. I would recommend it to everyone that has this problem.</li>
            <li> Did not brighten nails as advertised.</li>
            <li> I loved the glaze, and I&#x27;m using it and have had good results recommended, also the order arrived on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
            <li> Waste of money.... Super bummer.</li>
