            <li>I am very happy with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It works perfectly for me!</li>
            <li>Great service!</li>
            <li>Derm flex holding is wonderful!!</li>
            <li>Perfect.</li>
            <li>This hairspray is the best product I&#x27;ve found for styling.</li>
            <li>Works best if sprayed on hair and combed through before styling.</li>
            <li>This product is great!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s probably too soon to be sure,but I think it&#x27;s probably a very good product.</li>
            <li>I like everything about this product--provides great texture and body, organic ingredients, but I can&#x27;t get by the smell.</li>
            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>This is a great hairspray.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would select 3.5 stars if I could, because it does help keep things together fairly well for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; formula.</li>
            <li>Good hold.  </li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;To be fair</li>
            <li>and I loved it</li>
            <li>The spraying mechanism is particularly good.  </li>
            <li>I am still going to get the hairspray, but honestly, my hair has a ton of body and its good for my hair, not sticky or gummy..  </li>
            <li>Arrived very quickly and always a great product.</li>
            <li>like some kind of cleaning product.&lt;br /&gt;we</li>
            <li>It does a nice job and keeps my hair healthy on top of it.</li>
            <li>It has a very light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It would be better if:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>it had more &#x27;staying power&#x27; ...</li>
            <li>I like it okay,</li>
            <li>Of course this is the cheaper place I have been able to find it.</li>
            <li>It gives my hair more body without being noticeable.</li>
            <li>Holds really well and has a great smell.</li>
            <li>Love it</li>
            <li>Love, Love their shampoo/conditioner.</li>
            <li>love the way it spritzes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The sprayer on my last Andalou wasn&#x27;t very good</li>
            <li>This is a light spray, but holds well and does not have an overwhelming scent.</li>
            <li>I love that its organic and gluten free.</li>
            <li>Easy to comb through.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is not even usable, the perfumy smell is so strong.</li>
            <li>This is a very light hold hairspray, the scent is mild</li>
            <li>My hair is fine and I run my hands through it all day</li>
            <li>Adds light body to fine</li>
            <li>I have switched to Andalou Naturals Hair Spray (also available on Amazon).</li>
            <li>arrived on time and enjoy the product</li>
            <li>So far, so good</li>
            <li>Just using the sprayer top stunk up my whole bottle of Andalou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit 8-19-14</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for, a light hairspray that isn&#x27;t sticky or make my hair super crunchy.</li>
            <li>Adds great body when brushed out at the end of the day and my hair is soft.</li>
            <li>I want to add that DermOrganics does have other good products.</li>
            <li>You only need a small amount and should hold the bottle fair  from your head to get a nice mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Clean non-chemical ingredients, which is why I went looking for a new hairspray in the first place.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is different although still ok.  </li>
            <li>First, I have to say that this is not what I thought it was.</li>
            <li>Perfect for for my very thin hair</li>
            <li>Even though kit is a natural fragrance it is far too strong and doesn&#x27;t go away.</li>
            <li>Really like this and like the fact that there&#x27;s no alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Used</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way and it smells great, too.</li>
            <li>like most other hair products form this company however, not this</li>
            <li>and they said the smell isn&#x27;t lasting, but I don&#x27;t find that to be true.</li>
            <li>all the soap smells mingling together and it is not subtle.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to use a tiny tiny amount, that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed.</li>
            <li>* the added texture it gives my normally slippery hair&lt;</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really great for a few hours, but perhaps because I live by the ocean, it&#x27;s really not enough to keep the curls that just spent 45 minutes burning into my hair.  </li>
            <li>Their Argan Oil will leave your hair soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>If you have been buying this product just know that this particular product has a much different scent than the original and its not good!</li>
            <li>I have long, layered, black hair, and I got a few more compliments about my hair when I just started using this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend and I have thick pin straight hair</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used it on my dry hair when I use my flat iron.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Really like this and like the fact that there&#x27;s no alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;Used it to scrunch my curls as well and it held.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* the added texture it gives my normally slippery hair&lt;br /&gt;* the nozzle on the bottle - sprays very evenly and predictably for a non-aerosol pump&lt;br /&gt;* the supposed organic nature of the formula&lt;br /&gt;* no flakes or dryness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be better if:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* it had more &#x27;staying power&#x27; ... it&#x27;s really great for a few hours, but perhaps because I live by the ocean, it&#x27;s really not enough to keep the curls that just spent 45 minutes burning into my hair.  They have gone limp by lunchtime.  Maybe my hair is just too thick/heavy for this formula, or maybe I applied it too thickly?  I&#x27;ll keep experimenting, but have had same results for a few weeks now.&lt;br /&gt;* the smell (sorry, &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;) was a bit more subtle.  I like it okay, but my husband was fumigated out of the room while I was using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would select 3.5 stars if I could, because it does help keep things together fairly well for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; formula. I&#x27;ll keep experimenting with it to see how I can make it work for me.</li>
            <li> This is a light spray, but holds well and does not have an overwhelming scent. This is a well balanced product and sufficient for everyday use.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend loves this hairspray. It doesn&#x27;t leave his hair hard or with residue. It gives him just enough hold in his hair that he&#x27;s looking for so he doesn&#x27;t look like a greasehead. Of course this is the cheaper place I have been able to find it. Doesn&#x27;t hurt that it&#x27;s prime!</li>
            <li> Easy to comb through.  Doesn&#x27;t dry out hair. Keeps style.</li>
            <li> Good hold.  Doesn&#x27;t last if you brush your hair.</li>
            <li> I have a very short pixie-ish hairstyle, so I spray it in after I&#x27;ve toweled dried my hair, style and let it finish drying.  After that, I use it occasionally in between washes to hold the style, as well.  It works perfectly for me!</li>
            <li> Great service! Derm flex holding is wonderful!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this line of hair products for years. Recently I have noticed that they are changing the scent of their products.  The conditioner is different although still ok.  The sculpting spray I just bought is now different and smells pretty bad.  Like a laundromat with all the soap smells mingling together and it is not subtle.  Even my husband commented on how awful it smells.  I just noticed that this one says &amp;#34;unisex&amp;#34; on bottle.  Are there two different sculpting products now??  One unisex another not?  Anyway, its going back and I will try to order one that doesn&#x27;t say unisex on the bottle.  If you have been buying this product just know that this particular product has a much different scent than the original and its not good!</li>
            <li> I like everything about this product--provides great texture and body, organic ingredients, but I can&#x27;t get by the smell. Even though kit is a natural fragrance it is far too strong and doesn&#x27;t go away. Before purchasing it I asked that of other buyers and they said the smell isn&#x27;t lasting, but I don&#x27;t find that to be true. I hope they&#x27;ll come out with a product with softer smell or fragrance-free. I&#x27;d buy it in an instant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit 8-14-14&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not even usable, the perfumy smell is so strong. I have switched to Andalou Naturals Hair Spray (also available on Amazon). I adore it. Clean non-chemical ingredients, which is why I went looking for a new hairspray in the first place. It has a very light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t stay. Adds great body when brushed out at the end of the day and my hair is soft. You only need a small amount and should hold the bottle fair  from your head to get a nice mist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sprayer on my last Andalou wasn&#x27;t very good so I replaced it with the one from DermOrganics. What a mistake. Just using the sprayer top stunk up my whole bottle of Andalou.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit 8-19-14&lt;br /&gt;To be fair I want to add that DermOrganics does have other good products. Their Argan Oil will leave your hair soft and shiny. Be sure to use a tiny tiny amount, that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed. I also like their moisturizers, both facial and body.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for, a light hairspray that isn&#x27;t sticky or make my hair super crunchy. I spray it onto damp hair then use the blowdryer to style.</li>
            <li> Perfect. My hairdresser gave me a bottle as a gift and I loved it so I bought this bottle ... a little goes a long way and it smells great, too.</li>
            <li> My wife loves it. she was on the market of sculpting spray and she discovered this product and now  she use it every day</li>
            <li> arrived on time and enjoy the product</li>
            <li> Works great. Not sticky or heavy. Can comb through after use.</li>
            <li> My salon stopped carrying this product.  The spraying mechanism is particularly good.  It holds my hear without a sticky wet look.</li>
            <li> This is a great hairspray. My hair is fine and I run my hands through it all day so I don&#x27;t want anything gunky or stiff. This hairspray is the best product I&#x27;ve found for styling. I use it on the roots and tips when my hair is wet before blow drying. It gives my hair more body without being noticeable. It does a nice job and keeps my hair healthy on top of it.</li>
            <li> This is a very light hold hairspray, the scent is mild</li>
            <li> Execellent, all-natural product. Works best if sprayed on hair and combed through before styling. Adds light body to fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;Non-sticky, does not make hair brittle.</li>
            <li> Perfect for for my very thin hair</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for almost one year. I like that it doesn&#x27;t leave my hair too hard and adds shine to it. I have long, layered, black hair, and I got a few more compliments about my hair when I just started using this product.</li>
            <li> It does what it says and it has no alcohol in it. Just don&#x27;t spray to&lt;br /&gt;close to your hair or it will be to hard.</li>
            <li> This product is great! Holds really well and has a great smell. Its not sticky at all. I love that its organic and gluten free. I highly recommend and I have thick pin straight hair</li>
            <li> I am still going to get the hairspray, but honestly, my hair has a ton of body and its good for my hair, not sticky or gummy..  Love it</li>
            <li> Love, Love their shampoo/conditioner. Just started using hair spray....my hair is a bit longer....&lt;br /&gt;I love the way it spritzes. So far, so good</li>
            <li> This stuff may work as described but it has a funky smell /odor.. like some kind of cleaning product.&lt;br /&gt;we like most other hair products form this company however, not this</li>

            <li> First, I have to say that this is not what I thought it was. I thought this was hair spray without alcohol; that&#x27;s what I was looking for. But this is Sculpting Spray Gel. So far, I&#x27;ve used it on my dry hair when I use my flat iron. It&#x27;s probably too soon to be sure,but I think it&#x27;s probably a very good product.</li>
            <li> Arrived very quickly and always a great product. xx x x x x x x x x x x x</li>
