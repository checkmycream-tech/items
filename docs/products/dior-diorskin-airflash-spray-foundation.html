    <ol>
            <li>My sister has their spray foundation and it is also excellent!  </li>
            <li>It looks awesome on too!  </li>
            <li>Makes my face look flawless!  </li>
            <li>I reached up to blend it and immediately realized that it was the perfect consistency.</li>
            <li>And, best of all, none of it was bulky.</li>
            <li>I was so impressed that I immediately dropped it in my basket and headed for the counter.</li>
            <li>It gives the perfect amount of glow without looking oily.</li>
            <li>Since I got it from Sephora I am going to try to exchange it for the DiorSkin Icone Photo Perfect Creme and let you know how it works for me.</li>
            <li>When I take pictures, I seemingly have flawless skin.</li>
            <li>This is the best foundation ever!</li>
            <li>But it is so wonderful that you WILL buy another bottle.</li>
            <li>It just makes your skin look flawless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    </li>
            <li>My wedding pictures came out so beautiful that I have used this product every day since!</li>
            <li>It was amazing!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightweight, has great coverage and evens out skintone PERFECTLY.</li>
            <li>The $60 price tag is nothing compared to all the compliments you&#x27;ll get on your beautiful skin.</li>
            <li>It blended perfectly with my skin and gave me a nice dewy look.  </li>
            <li>Oh my gosh, this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I am so happy this product exists.</li>
            <li>So this product might not be as great for coverage and skin balancing for peopel with darker complexions.     </li>
            <li>This really is an amazing product!  </li>
            <li>It is easy to apply and has a flawless finish.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;$60!\\&quot; my head screamed, \\&quot;Let&#x27;s see how good</li>
            <li>(just looks like you have good skin, by minimizing pores and covering up blotchy skin).    </li>
            <li>The DiorSkin AirFlash is very easy to apply, and gives a light matte finish that wonderfully evens out skin tone.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-You can apply many coats!</li>
            <li>It was that morning when I had my first encounter with this wonderful foundation.  </li>
            <li>i splurged on this one just out of curiosity and i fell in love with it!</li>
            <li>I bought this at sephora and really liked it.</li>
            <li>I really liked the AirFlash because it honestly does not look as if you&#x27;re wearing makeup.  </li>
            <li>Have a sponge handy to take care of the spray that gets onto your hair line and eye lashes/brows -</li>
            <li>The coverage is awesome; however, it doesn&#x27;t make you look like you&#x27;re wearing a mask, and it really lets your skin breathe.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to apply honestly.</li>
            <li>It gave each of us a flawless finish that still looked very natural.  </li>
            <li>My makeup was simply flawless, and I looked really fabulous thanks to the airbrush effect of this foundation!</li>
            <li>get SPF coverage with this foundation which I feel is more important than just a foundation that just makes you look good, I recommend SMASHBOX HALO hydrating powder (Find it on eBay or QVC.com).</li>
            <li>To get SPF coverage with this foundation which I feel is more important than just a foundation that just makes you look good, I recommend SMASHBOX HALO hydrating powder (Find it on eBay or QVC.com).</li>
            <li>Instead, I had the dewy, soft, healthy, and perfectly even skin I&#x27;ve always dreamed about.</li>
            <li>I have tried many drug store brands of spray foundation and they are all \\&quot;wet\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>This does not come off of people&#x27;s shirts, no matter how many coats you</li>
            <li>you are paying more for the name, but there is nothing out there like this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try to copy, I just took out most of the stories.</li>
            <li>Hope you all find this helpful :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE this foundation.  </li>
            <li>Again LOVE, LOVE LOVE and if this does not give you that COSMO LOOK we all admire</li>
            <li>It seemed that, finally, I had found my perfect foundation, and that was Benefit brand.</li>
            <li>The sensation that I felt was interesting.</li>
            <li>And, the color was perfect on my superpale skin -- I felt like the product was made especially for me.</li>
            <li>I love it, and even though its 60 bucks, I wouldnt give it up for anythign in the world.</li>
            <li>I am not purchasing this product again because I don&#x27;t want to be making a special trip to the mall every month just to buy more!  </li>
            <li>With this spray, it&#x27;s pretty much fool-proof in achieving the perfect look.  </li>
            <li>The amazing look that it gave me was worth way more than $60.</li>
            <li>For my skin, and everyone is different, I find the best coverage I have is when applied with a good makeup brush (I highly recommend Boots to buy this.)</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to trying this product after reading the rave reviews and having tried a couple of other Dior beauty products that were top-notch quality.</li>
            <li>And yet others were too liquidy and easy to overuse.</li>
            <li>It easily covered ZitZilla on my cheek, so I took arisk and sprayed it all over the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li>The foundation felt really cool and refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li>Anyway, one day, my mother suggested that I use this new spray foundation she got from Dior, and I laughed and said \\&quot;a spray foundation?</li>
            <li>This foundation is my absolute favorite of all time!  </li>
            <li>days I&#x27;m in a huge rush 2.</li>
            <li>Because this is almost like airbrushing, the foundation is SO light.</li>
            <li>tried to read and cover everything the others said in their reviews if it was relevant.</li>
            <li>I love this product, and it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>, I would just do a light mist over my nose and cheek area.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so light, yet covers so well.  </li>
            <li>Some were so light that they didn&#x27;t even cover my imperfections.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li>This spray goes on evenly, it&#x27;s light weight and does not feel like I&#x27;m wearing a foundation</li>
            <li>That was my fault in technical artistry - lol.  </li>
            <li>With foundation, you can really tell when you buy cheaper products, the great quality of this product really shows.  </li>
            <li>Thank you so much!!!    </li>
            <li>I bought this make up at Neiman Marcus excited to try it</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li>and if you use it to cover acne, your acne has to be light to mild</li>
            <li>Plus, she has had hers for nearly 2 months and applies way more than I would!</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re in doubt, buy this product -- you most certainly won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going out at night with friends or special occasions and don&#x27;t want to worry at all about my makeup.</li>
            <li>Depending on how much coverage you need and where, you can spray more, say, on your T-zone.</li>
            <li>It really doesn&#x27;t get any  better than that.  </li>
            <li>I mean, you could fix that by not wearing make up, but you wouldn&#x27;t be unless you looked flawless already!</li>
            <li>and I would rather pay for something a tad more pricey and have excellent results than buy 1/2 of this and get mediocre results.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s especially great when I get a short call to step outside, and I don&#x27;t have to tell my friends,</li>
            <li>I would always keep it on hand for emergencies (when you want to look flawless, a first date or special date, when you&#x27;re running late,</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t apply lotion or cream with SPF before your AirFlash, please find a powder with one in it!(when you want to look flawless, a first date or special date, when you&#x27;re running late,</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have perfect skin, but this make up, by far, makes my skin look the most flawless, whereas other make up had the danger of accentuating my problem areas on my skin simply because I don&#x27;t have the professional artistry to conceal them properly.    </li>
            <li>It is SO EASY and FAST to apply</li>
            <li>I have a helpful hint for those who say this wonderful make up does not last very long.</li>
            <li>This really is worth it.</li>
            <li>This was fun to experiment with, but I think I will stick with the mineral make-up.</li>
            <li>I bought this foundation for my wedding, and although I had a make-up artist, I really wanted to make sure the products she was going to use were high quality products.</li>
            <li>If you get your right color it just blends in with your skintone.</li>
            <li>I put it on today and same result, quick and fabulous!  </li>
            <li>Everything about this product is amazing except for the price and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li>five or more I think for most people is not true.</li>
            <li>The first can I got, I hadn&#x27;t mastered the air spray technique yet, so I went through it quickly, and didn&#x27;t get a good result (unevenly sprayed).  </li>
            <li>this was half the price, I would give it 5 stars, it&#x27;s really a great product, but for a can mostly filled with compressed air, I have a hard time shelling out that kind of cash.</li>
            <li>Well, it&#x27;s been an easy road so far with this foundation.</li>
            <li>a quick rub pretty much takes care of that.</li>
            <li>This has a very fast application with light-medium coverage.</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product, after having it applied at the makeup counter in John Lewis.  </li>
            <li>I was aprehensive at first because it is costly.  </li>
            <li>Well, after the first time I used it</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d post a picture if I could ;-)</li>
            <li>I can still remember that fateful Saturday afternoon at the department store when I finally found the cure for the bright red acne scars under my nose and on my chin.</li>
            <li>Besides that it actually really does give your face a natural looking smooth glow.    </li>
            <li>she HIGHLY recommend spraying on your hand and applying with a foundation brush, it makes the product last a lot longer and gives a more even application.  </li>
            <li>There is no visible \\&quot;line\\&quot; where the make-up ends and your real skin color begins.</li>
            <li>It really does feel like you aren&#x27;t wearing any make up-</li>
            <li>Once applied, it&#x27;s very lightweight-</li>
            <li>Out of curiosity, yet still hesitant because of my prior experience with Dior foundations (they are not oil free)</li>
            <li>really is!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>I think my skin absolutely needs a cream foundation.</li>
            <li>You really don&#x27;t even need to touch up unless its been something like 10 hours since you&#x27;ve applied.</li>
            <li>or else it wont cover it very well.  </li>
            <li>Now, I enjoy the fact that it takes 3 second vs 3 minutes to do my foundation.  </li>
            <li>(I accidentaly sprayed it in my hair and in the air) and what I did manage to get on my face, it did not cover much.  </li>
            <li>Also, the color really seems to adjust to your skin tone.</li>
            <li>The product goes much further using a brush, and gives a lovely even and natural looking coverage.  </li>
            <li>She wanted each of us to try it and unfortunately for her, we all liked it so much we couldn&#x27;t go back to using our own make up.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t mind the price because I was intending on only using it for special occasions or when I thought I might get my picture taken, not for every day use (I have to have an SPF for every day foundation.)</li>
            <li>\\&quot;I need 30 min to get ready\\&quot; instead of, \\&quot;I&#x27;m can leave my house in 5 minutes\\&quot;, with most of those 5 minutes being used on other things beside make up time!    </li>
            <li>It hides my moderate breakouts and mild acne</li>
            <li>One last thing - I personally think that it&#x27;s more hygenic and improved my skin condition over-all.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Spray  your face once and let it settle, then spray a little on a sponge or brush (or your fingertips as they say in the instructions) and apply the AirFlash to where you need more of it.</li>
            <li>WOW!!</li>
            <li>It looks so, so natural!!    </li>
            <li>Some of my pores are huge, which makes my face look red, I have some acne now and then, and this is the only product that I have found that really covers it up.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re considering buying it for $60, you obviously need it and this is worth the money.</li>
            <li>I also bought the powder foundation for more of an everyday use</li>
            <li>Even though it looked like it when on very smooth (and I checked it in artificial and natural light before going out) by the end of the evening it looked very blotchy on my skin!!</li>
            <li>I would apply one very light misting a day yet ran out in a little over three weeks!  </li>
            <li>You&#x27;d have to replace the sponge about every time you buy a new can of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Once I visited Sephora and saw how much bigger the can was supposed to be, I was more careful to check the correct content weight before purchasing it.  </li>
            <li>I also love Dior Capture Totale foundation, but this is even more expensive than the Airflash, but goes on like a dream !</li>
            <li>Okay, I agree it&#x27;s a bit costly, and I also agree that it does not last as long as other make ups, but I consider it a reasonable exchange for all the positives it offers.  </li>
            <li>If you spray it directly onto your face, you should do it w/o any clothes on (or else</li>
            <li>I have been wearing foundation since I was thirteen years old.</li>
            <li>but using this foundation conceals nearly all of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve stretched its use out to probably 2.5+ months from using sparingly over after the first 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Use sparingly, and just sponge your face to conserve some - I&#x27;ve made the mistake of over-using it unneccessarily, and now my spray lasts twice as long as my first can.    </li>
            <li>But, alas, every foundation seemed to cause some kind of problem.  </li>
            <li>I would switch it up and use it about twice a week and another Dior foundation the other days to make it go further, but if you can afford the $60, just use it as your primary.  </li>
            <li>BUT if you aren&#x27;t rich you can&#x27;t use it for everyday application.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know what the other girls are doing, but for me a little goes a long way, and like I said before, it&#x27;s not heavy and gives you a natural-not-tacky kind of look...</li>
            <li>It would last all work day for me, then when I came home if I was going out afterwards I&#x27;d obviously touch up a little bit, but for the most part it does seem to last longer than 3 hours as one reviewer mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>To apply, spray a circular amount on a few different places on your face, and then blend with clean fingertips.</li>
            <li>Obviously if you have severe acne it wont cover everything up because nothing can cover it completely.</li>
            <li>It was heavy enough to cover my imperfections, yet light enough to not give me that \\&quot;masked\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the only foundation I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li>DO NOT USE BARE MINERALS</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t spray directly on face, put it on the back of your hand and then apply</li>
            <li>i usually put it on right out of the shower</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I am not purchasing this product again because I don&#x27;t want to be making a special trip to the mall every month just to buy more!  </li>
            <li> With this spray, it&#x27;s pretty much fool-proof in achieving the perfect look.  </li>
            <li> The amazing look that it gave me was worth way more than $60.</li>
            <li> For my skin, and everyone is different, I find the best coverage I have is when applied with a good makeup brush (I highly recommend Boots to buy this.)</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this product after reading the rave reviews and having tried a couple of other Dior beauty products that were top-notch quality.</li>
            <li> And yet others were too liquidy and easy to overuse.</li>
            <li> It easily covered ZitZilla on my cheek, so I took arisk and sprayed it all over the rest of my face.  </li>
            <li> The foundation felt really cool and refreshing on my skin.</li>
            <li> Anyway, one day, my mother suggested that I use this new spray foundation she got from Dior, and I laughed and said \\&quot;a spray foundation?</li>
            <li> This foundation is my absolute favorite of all time!  </li>
            <li> days I&#x27;m in a huge rush 2.</li>
            <li> Because this is almost like airbrushing, the foundation is SO light.</li>
            <li> tried to read and cover everything the others said in their reviews if it was relevant.</li>
            <li> I love this product, and it is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> , I would just do a light mist over my nose and cheek area.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so light, yet covers so well.  </li>
            <li> Some were so light that they didn&#x27;t even cover my imperfections.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s so light</li>
            <li> This spray goes on evenly, it&#x27;s light weight and does not feel like I&#x27;m wearing a foundation</li>
            <li> That was my fault in technical artistry - lol.  </li>
            <li> With foundation, you can really tell when you buy cheaper products, the great quality of this product really shows.  </li>
            <li> Thank you so much!!!    </li>
            <li> I bought this make up at Neiman Marcus excited to try it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth every penny!</li>
            <li> and if you use it to cover acne, your acne has to be light to mild</li>
            <li> Plus, she has had hers for nearly 2 months and applies way more than I would!</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re in doubt, buy this product -- you most certainly won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going out at night with friends or special occasions and don&#x27;t want to worry at all about my makeup.</li>
            <li> Depending on how much coverage you need and where, you can spray more, say, on your T-zone.</li>
            <li> It really doesn&#x27;t get any  better than that.  </li>
            <li> I mean, you could fix that by not wearing make up, but you wouldn&#x27;t be unless you looked flawless already!</li>
            <li> and I would rather pay for something a tad more pricey and have excellent results than buy 1/2 of this and get mediocre results.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s especially great when I get a short call to step outside, and I don&#x27;t have to tell my friends,</li>
            <li> I would always keep it on hand for emergencies (when you want to look flawless, a first date or special date, when you&#x27;re running late,</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t apply lotion or cream with SPF before your AirFlash, please find a powder with one in it!(when you want to look flawless, a first date or special date, when you&#x27;re running late,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have perfect skin, but this make up, by far, makes my skin look the most flawless, whereas other make up had the danger of accentuating my problem areas on my skin simply because I don&#x27;t have the professional artistry to conceal them properly.    </li>
            <li> It is SO EASY and FAST to apply</li>
            <li> I have a helpful hint for those who say this wonderful make up does not last very long.</li>
            <li> This really is worth it.</li>
            <li> This was fun to experiment with, but I think I will stick with the mineral make-up.</li>
            <li> I bought this foundation for my wedding, and although I had a make-up artist, I really wanted to make sure the products she was going to use were high quality products.</li>
            <li> If you get your right color it just blends in with your skintone.</li>
            <li> I put it on today and same result, quick and fabulous!  </li>
            <li> Everything about this product is amazing except for the price and how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> five or more I think for most people is not true.</li>
            <li> The first can I got, I hadn&#x27;t mastered the air spray technique yet, so I went through it quickly, and didn&#x27;t get a good result (unevenly sprayed).  </li>
            <li> this was half the price, I would give it 5 stars, it&#x27;s really a great product, but for a can mostly filled with compressed air, I have a hard time shelling out that kind of cash.</li>
            <li> Well, it&#x27;s been an easy road so far with this foundation.</li>
            <li> a quick rub pretty much takes care of that.</li>
            <li> This has a very fast application with light-medium coverage.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product, after having it applied at the makeup counter in John Lewis.  </li>
            <li> I was aprehensive at first because it is costly.  </li>
            <li> Well, after the first time I used it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d post a picture if I could ;-)</li>
            <li> I can still remember that fateful Saturday afternoon at the department store when I finally found the cure for the bright red acne scars under my nose and on my chin.</li>
            <li> Besides that it actually really does give your face a natural looking smooth glow.    </li>
            <li> she HIGHLY recommend spraying on your hand and applying with a foundation brush, it makes the product last a lot longer and gives a more even application.  </li>
            <li> There is no visible \\&quot;line\\&quot; where the make-up ends and your real skin color begins.</li>
            <li> It really does feel like you aren&#x27;t wearing any make up-</li>
            <li> Once applied, it&#x27;s very lightweight-</li>
            <li> Out of curiosity, yet still hesitant because of my prior experience with Dior foundations (they are not oil free)</li>
            <li> really is!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> I think my skin absolutely needs a cream foundation.</li>
            <li> You really don&#x27;t even need to touch up unless its been something like 10 hours since you&#x27;ve applied.</li>
            <li> or else it wont cover it very well.  </li>
            <li> Now, I enjoy the fact that it takes 3 second vs 3 minutes to do my foundation.  </li>
            <li> (I accidentaly sprayed it in my hair and in the air) and what I did manage to get on my face, it did not cover much.  </li>
            <li> Also, the color really seems to adjust to your skin tone.</li>
            <li> The product goes much further using a brush, and gives a lovely even and natural looking coverage.  </li>
            <li> She wanted each of us to try it and unfortunately for her, we all liked it so much we couldn&#x27;t go back to using our own make up.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t mind the price because I was intending on only using it for special occasions or when I thought I might get my picture taken, not for every day use (I have to have an SPF for every day foundation.)</li>
            <li> \\&quot;I need 30 min to get ready\\&quot; instead of, \\&quot;I&#x27;m can leave my house in 5 minutes\\&quot;, with most of those 5 minutes being used on other things beside make up time!    </li>
            <li> It hides my moderate breakouts and mild acne</li>
            <li> One last thing - I personally think that it&#x27;s more hygenic and improved my skin condition over-all.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Spray  your face once and let it settle, then spray a little on a sponge or brush (or your fingertips as they say in the instructions) and apply the AirFlash to where you need more of it.</li>
            <li> WOW!!</li>
            <li> It looks so, so natural!!    </li>
            <li> Some of my pores are huge, which makes my face look red, I have some acne now and then, and this is the only product that I have found that really covers it up.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re considering buying it for $60, you obviously need it and this is worth the money.</li>
            <li> I also bought the powder foundation for more of an everyday use</li>
            <li> Even though it looked like it when on very smooth (and I checked it in artificial and natural light before going out) by the end of the evening it looked very blotchy on my skin!!</li>
            <li> I would apply one very light misting a day yet ran out in a little over three weeks!  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;d have to replace the sponge about every time you buy a new can of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once I visited Sephora and saw how much bigger the can was supposed to be, I was more careful to check the correct content weight before purchasing it.  </li>
            <li> I also love Dior Capture Totale foundation, but this is even more expensive than the Airflash, but goes on like a dream !</li>
            <li> Okay, I agree it&#x27;s a bit costly, and I also agree that it does not last as long as other make ups, but I consider it a reasonable exchange for all the positives it offers.  </li>
            <li> If you spray it directly onto your face, you should do it w/o any clothes on (or else</li>
            <li> I have been wearing foundation since I was thirteen years old.</li>
            <li> but using this foundation conceals nearly all of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve stretched its use out to probably 2.5+ months from using sparingly over after the first 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Use sparingly, and just sponge your face to conserve some - I&#x27;ve made the mistake of over-using it unneccessarily, and now my spray lasts twice as long as my first can.    </li>
            <li> But, alas, every foundation seemed to cause some kind of problem.  </li>
            <li> I would switch it up and use it about twice a week and another Dior foundation the other days to make it go further, but if you can afford the $60, just use it as your primary.  </li>
            <li> BUT if you aren&#x27;t rich you can&#x27;t use it for everyday application.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what the other girls are doing, but for me a little goes a long way, and like I said before, it&#x27;s not heavy and gives you a natural-not-tacky kind of look...</li>
            <li> It would last all work day for me, then when I came home if I was going out afterwards I&#x27;d obviously touch up a little bit, but for the most part it does seem to last longer than 3 hours as one reviewer mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> To apply, spray a circular amount on a few different places on your face, and then blend with clean fingertips.</li>
            <li> Obviously if you have severe acne it wont cover everything up because nothing can cover it completely.</li>
            <li> It was heavy enough to cover my imperfections, yet light enough to not give me that \\&quot;masked\\&quot; look.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the only foundation I&#x27;ve tried so far</li>
            <li> DO NOT USE BARE MINERALS</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t spray directly on face, put it on the back of your hand and then apply</li>
            <li> i usually put it on right out of the shower</li>
            <li> Not much is needed, HOWEVER, there&#x27;s barely any product in the can.  </li>
            <li> You have to get new foundation every month or so anyway if you go out everyday</li>
            <li> The make up never comes in contact with my fingers or sponge that can cross contaminate the makeup, because there is no opening where the bacteria can get in like other traditional make ups containers.      </li>
            <li> I expect my foundation (especially when used very sparingly) to last for at least 2 months!  </li>
            <li> Others were so heavy that they made me look completely plastic and overdone.</li>
            <li> it took a while for me to get the hang of putting it on, but I swear to you, a few weeks after I started wearing this, my skin CLEARED UP COMPLETELY.</li>
            <li> I have oily skin, so trying to find a foundation that will work ok withous hassle seems next to impossible.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-It lasts long!</li>
            <li> I was using this product daily for about 3 weeks when i noticed it was getting a little low</li>
            <li> On the contrary of other reviews, this product can last a lot longer than 3 weeks...</li>
            <li> This does go on dry, it&#x27;s almost as if you&#x27;re applying spray powder.</li>
            <li> I used it off and on for about a month, perhaps 15 applications in my estimation, and the can was bone dry after that.  </li>
            <li> I DO NOT recommend this product if you have dry skin as I do.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s why it only lasted for such few usage.</li>
            <li> the container is about the same size as your average perfume bottle.</li>
            <li> so it really is no</li>
            <li> probably waste a lot when you spray it onto your face because you do it back and forth horizontally.</li>
            <li> Not really - but you get what you pay for</li>
            <li> I always seemed to end up looking like a pale-skinned, distant brunette cousin of Barbie.  </li>
            <li> If you use this product everyday it will probably last you one month.</li>
            <li> If that doesn&#x27;t work either I&#x27;m just going back to my old foundation which really wasn&#x27;t bad, it just made my skin a little whiter than I preferred in pictures because of the SPF content.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t give the wimpy coverage of other foundations I&#x27;ve tried that also feel weightless.</li>
            <li> I will never go back to ordinary foundations.</li>
            <li> You can spray down your neck-wherever you need it</li>
            <li> I have never had this problem with other high quality, but less expensive foundations.</li>
            <li> IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN!!!!</li>
            <li> even bare minerals (which made my acne worse.</li>
            <li> There is another option which is to spray a little onto a plate and dab a sponge or brush into it and apply it that way.</li>
            <li> There are a few cons, but after buying it once I would definately buy it again.</li>
            <li> Here are a few things I feel somebody considering buying this</li>
            <li> /&gt;-I have uneven skin tone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not an everyday makeup person, but I do use it occassionally and this bottle has lasted me just about 10 months.  </li>
            <li> They were always heavy and oily.  </li>
            <li> It took a few minutes</li>
            <li> whereas when I wear the liquid/cream foundation, I&#x27;m warned that I look tired, or that my jawline is not blended well enough!  </li>
            <li> I have pale skin</li>
            <li> However, it still does not provide the same coverage as a less expensive, well known mineral make-up I use.</li>
            <li> The only down side is, it&#x27;s very expensive for how little use you get out of it</li>
            <li> However while shopping at Dillards this past weekend I discovered this product at the Dior counter.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive and that makes it last about 2 months instead of 1-1.5 months.</li>
            <li> [ so i bought a different (but still expensive $40 foundation) -</li>
            <li> I spray a small amount on a sponge wedge and dab it on all over , then with the sponge work it all over my face.</li>
            <li> saying that I have VERY pale ivory skin.</li>
            <li> It was hard to apply</li>
            <li> But if one of the shades matches you well and you have a little to cover, go for it!!       </li>
            <li> I think the reason for the spray can if your not supposed to spray it on your face is because the foundation is a very thin liquid and it would be messy in a typical container.</li>
            <li> You do not need to reapply all day and it does not (at least for me) run off your face, and I have combination skin.</li>
            <li> At least try it once.</li>
            <li> It does work-the review that says it&#x27;s hard to apply is false, you just have to learn how.</li>
            <li> color chart not accurate at all!!!</li>
            <li> One morning, while I was applying my secret weapon, I was distracted by a flyaway hair that had seemed to escape my hairspray.</li>
            <li> When you have terrible acne, your moral is low, you feel bad about yourself...</li>
            <li> i was shocked at how dark it was -</li>
            <li> and, thinking it was fake tanner, picked it up.</li>
            <li> I would at least try it if you&#x27;re sick of your face looking like you tried to cover your acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.  </li>
            <li> and I was horribly disappointed.</li>
            <li> one of the worst things about wearing make up is the fear of it coming off on somebody&#x27;s shoulder when you hug them!</li>
            <li> and it was awful.</li>
            <li> I had terrible terrible acne for about 2 years before this.</li>
            <li> its awful.</li>
            <li> Cleared my skin, got me to leave the house instead of staying on at night worrying about how terrible my acne was.</li>
            <li> days that i have some horrible blemishes on my face</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This really is an amazing product!  It blended perfectly with my skin and gave me a nice dewy look.  I would apply one very light misting a day yet ran out in a little over three weeks!  B/c it is an aresol can I couldn&#x27;t tell that it was almost gone.  I went to visit a friend in Dallas and ran out in the middle of the trip...what a nightmare!  I am not purchasing this product again because I don&#x27;t want to be making a special trip to the mall every month just to buy more!  I expect my foundation (especially when used very sparingly) to last for at least 2 months!  I am now switching to ERA Cosmetics.  My sister has their spray foundation and it is also excellent!  Plus, she has had hers for nearly 2 months and applies way more than I would!</li>
            <li> Oh my gosh, this is a great product. There are a few cons, but after buying it once I would definately buy it again. Here are a few things I feel somebody considering buying this should know-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-I have uneven skin tone. Some of my pores are huge, which makes my face look red, I have some acne now and then, and this is the only product that I have found that really covers it up. Obviously if you have severe acne it wont cover everything up because nothing can cover it completely. I would at least try it if you&#x27;re sick of your face looking like you tried to cover your acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t have to apply powder foundation after this!** Because this is almost like airbrushing, the foundation is SO light. I have tried many drug store brands of spray foundation and they are all \\&quot;wet\\&quot;. This does go on dry, it&#x27;s almost as if you&#x27;re applying spray powder. You do not need to reapply all day and it does not (at least for me) run off your face, and I have combination skin. I actually have to remove it with a wash cloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It blends in with your neck. There is no visible \\&quot;line\\&quot; where the make-up ends and your real skin color begins. If you get your right color it just blends in with your skintone. You can spray down your neck-wherever you need it and you can&#x27;t tell you have make up on, it&#x27;s not \\&quot;cakey\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-For me one of the worst things about wearing make up is the fear of it coming off on somebody&#x27;s shoulder when you hug them! I mean, you could fix that by not wearing make up, but you wouldn&#x27;t be unless you looked flawless already! This does not come off of people&#x27;s shirts, no matter how many coats you apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You can apply many coats! Depending on how much coverage you need and where, you can spray more, say, on your T-zone. Spray  your face once and let it settle, then spray a little on a sponge or brush (or your fingertips as they say in the instructions) and apply the AirFlash to where you need more of it. Obviously if you&#x27;d apply 4+ coats it&#x27;s going to start looking like you&#x27;ve got make up on, but 1-2 coats looks perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-It lasts long! It would last all work day for me, then when I came home if I was going out afterwards I&#x27;d obviously touch up a little bit, but for the most part it does seem to last longer than 3 hours as one reviewer mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Yes you are paying more for the name, but there is nothing out there like this. You could splurge and get an airbrush machine, but you still have to buy refills for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-There is enough in the can for about three-four weeks...five or more I think for most people is not true. That is not a lot for the price, but you have to consider the quality, brand, etc. If you&#x27;re sooo concerned about the cost you should go buy a $10 spray foundation and see what you get. This really is worth it. You have to get new foundation every month or so anyway if you go out everyday so it really is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You probably waste a lot when you spray it onto your face because you do it back and forth horizontally. There is another option which is to spray a little onto a plate and dab a sponge or brush into it and apply it that way. You&#x27;d have to replace the sponge about every time you buy a new can of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;I tried to read and cover everything the others said in their reviews if it was relevant. I didn&#x27;t try to copy, I just took out most of the stories. It does work-the review that says it&#x27;s hard to apply is false, you just have to learn how. If you spray it directly onto your face, you should do it w/o any clothes on (or else cover your shoulders with a towel) and try to tie your hair back or put a cloth headband on it (or turbie twist). It really does feel like you aren&#x27;t wearing any make up-which guys love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering buying it for $60, you obviously need it and this is worth the money. At least try it once. You wont regret it and the only thing thatwill keep you from buying it again is the price. I would always keep it on hand for emergencies (when you want to look flawless, a first date or special date, when you&#x27;re running late, girls night out, to make someone kick themselves for dumping you, at concerts so you don&#x27;t sweat your make up off if you get to meet the band afterwards).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**To get SPF coverage with this foundation which I feel is more important than just a foundation that just makes you look good, I recommend SMASHBOX HALO hydrating powder (Find it on eBay or QVC.com). It is Dior AirFlash in powder form. If you don&#x27;t apply lotion or cream with SPF before your AirFlash, please find a powder with one in it!(when you want to look flawless, a first date or special date, when you&#x27;re running late, girls night out, to make someone kick themselves for dumping you, at concerts so you don&#x27;t sweat your make up off if you get to meet the band afterwards).      **To get SPF coverage with this foundation which I feel is more important than just a foundation that just makes you look good, I recommend SMASHBOX HALO hydrating powder (Find it on eBay or QVC.com).

            <li> I have been using this for quite some time.  A can lasts me about 2 months, BUT I do not spray on my face - I spray on a rounded disposal type foam spong (bag at Sally Beauty Supply runs around $6.00) and yes, I do throw the sponge out each and every application.  I used to use Sally Hansen Aribrush makeup but that has since been discontinued - every make up person I know says to use an airbrush foundation versus bottle, tube, etc.  Can I afford $60?  Not really - but you get what you pay for and I would rather pay for something a tad more pricey and have excellent results than buy 1/2 of this and get mediocre results.</li>
            <li> I AM SOOOOOooooooooooooooooooo dissapointed...i waited forver for this product and when it finally got here i was shocked at how dark it was - i picked the lightest color possible!!! color chart not accurate at all!!!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product, after having it applied at the makeup counter in John Lewis.  For my skin, and everyone is different, I find the best coverage I have is when applied with a good makeup brush (I highly recommend Boots to buy this.) I paid £7 for my brush, and it is a godsend.  The product goes much further using a brush, and gives a lovely even and natural looking coverage.  I love this product, and it is well worth the money.  With foundation, you can really tell when you buy cheaper products, the great quality of this product really shows.  Highly recommended.  I also love Dior Capture Totale foundation, but this is even more expensive than the Airflash, but goes on like a dream !</li>
            <li> This foundation is my absolute favorite of all time!  It is SO EASY and FAST to apply, I refuse to use anything else.  Shake it, spray it on a Kabuki brush, and circle on your face.  It really doesn&#x27;t get any  better than that.  It looks awesome on too!  Doesn&#x27;t look cakey at all.  Makes my face look flawless!  I was aprehensive at first because it is costly.  I&#x27;m not an everyday makeup person, but I do use it occassionally and this bottle has lasted me just about 10 months.  Hope you all find this helpful :)</li>
            <li> The DiorSkin AirFlash is very easy to apply, and gives a light matte finish that wonderfully evens out skin tone.  Once applied, it&#x27;s very lightweight- you can&#x27;t feel it on your skin at all.  Not much is needed, HOWEVER, there&#x27;s barely any product in the can.  I used it off and on for about a month, perhaps 15 applications in my estimation, and the can was bone dry after that.  For $60, this is unacceptable!  And I wasn&#x27;t piling it on or anything, I would just do a light mist over my nose and cheek area. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If this was half the price, I would give it 5 stars, it&#x27;s really a great product, but for a can mostly filled with compressed air, I have a hard time shelling out that kind of cash.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this foundation.  I used to work for Christian Dior and I have to say over the years I have tried every line and every type of foundation including prior dior foundations.  They were always heavy and oily.  I have oily skin, so trying to find a foundation that will work ok withous hassle seems next to impossible.  There is ALWAYS a downside.  However while shopping at Dillards this past weekend I discovered this product at the Dior counter.  Out of curiosity, yet still hesitant because of my prior experience with Dior foundations (they are not oil free) I went for it...she HIGHLY recommend spraying on your hand and applying with a foundation brush, it makes the product last a lot longer and gives a more even application.  It took a few minutes and she was done and when I looked in the mirror WOW!! It was amazing!!  I put it on today and same result, quick and fabulous!  It&#x27;s so light, yet covers so well.  I also bought the powder foundation for more of an everyday use and I like it as well, but this takes the cake...If anyone is doubting the purchase, please don&#x27;t.  You will not be disappointed.  I would switch it up and use it about twice a week and another Dior foundation the other days to make it go further, but if you can afford the $60, just use it as your primary.  Again LOVE, LOVE LOVE and if this does not give you that COSMO LOOK we all admire, I don&#x27;t know what will.</li>
            <li> I have been wearing foundation since I was thirteen years old. I can still remember that fateful Saturday afternoon at the department store when I finally found the cure for the bright red acne scars under my nose and on my chin. Since then, I&#x27;ve been hooked. But, alas, every foundation seemed to cause some kind of problem.  Some were so light that they didn&#x27;t even cover my imperfections. Others were so heavy that they made me look completely plastic and overdone. And yet others were too liquidy and easy to overuse. I always seemed to end up looking like a pale-skinned, distant brunette cousin of Barbie.  It seemed that, finally, I had found my perfect foundation, and that was Benefit brand. I went through three bottles of it, However, there was still one problem, and that was the bottle itself. One morning, while I was applying my secret weapon, I was distracted by a flyaway hair that had seemed to escape my hairspray. I bent over to turn on the faucet to fix it when -- BAM! -- my elbow spilt all that remained of my foundation onto the counter. I was in a pickle, but I was also in luck -- it was a Saturday! I rushed out to my local Sephora to purchase another bottle. It was that morning when I had my first encounter with this wonderful foundation.  I stumbled upon it at the Dior display on my way towards the Benefit counter. I have always been a fan of Christian Dior&#x27;s perfumes and especially his cosmetics (their cream eyeshadow is to die for!).   I saw an interesting-looking can and, thinking it was fake tanner, picked it up. Once I saw it was foundation, I glanced at the price. \\&quot;$60!\\&quot; my head screamed, \\&quot;Let&#x27;s see how good this stuff really is!\\&quot;  I lifted the proper color -- the lightest shade -- to my face and began spraying. The sensation that I felt was interesting. The foundation felt really cool and refreshing on my skin. I reached up to blend it and immediately realized that it was the perfect consistency. It easily covered ZitZilla on my cheek, so I took arisk and sprayed it all over the rest of my face.  After rubbing it in, I discovered that for once, I didn&#x27;t look like I had just crawled out of the Mattel corporation. Instead, I had the dewy, soft, healthy, and perfectly even skin I&#x27;ve always dreamed about. And, the color was perfect on my superpale skin -- I felt like the product was made especially for me. And, best of all, none of it was bulky. It felt feather-light but it didn&#x27;t give the wimpy coverage of other foundations I&#x27;ve tried that also feel weightless. It was heavy enough to cover my imperfections, yet light enough to not give me that \\&quot;masked\\&quot; look. I was so impressed that I immediately dropped it in my basket and headed for the counter. My search was over.  Well, it&#x27;s been an easy road so far with this foundation. The amazing look that it gave me was worth way more than $60. Plus, you do get a lot of bang for your buck -- the container is about the same size as your average perfume bottle. I will never go back to ordinary foundations. Plus, I know that I will never spill my foundation again. The $60 price tag is nothing compared to all the compliments you&#x27;ll get on your beautiful skin. If you&#x27;re in doubt, buy this product -- you most certainly won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I bought this at sephora and really liked it. It&#x27;s the only foundation I&#x27;ve tried so far that&#x27;s so light but covers so well. It hides my moderate breakouts and mild acne scaring  yet it doesnt look like I have anything on. It gives the perfect amount of glow without looking oily. It looks so, so natural!!    the reason for 4 stars is that theres only 4 colors to choose from. It&#x27;s not enough even for only white skin. I have pale skin and I noticed after about a week of using this that it doesnt match my neck. But if one of the shades matches you well and you have a little to cover, go for it!!       To use this, spray it on a brush and then apply it to your face. This stuff is expensive and that makes it last about 2 months instead of 1-1.5 months. I think the reason for the spray can if your not supposed to spray it on your face is because the foundation is a very thin liquid and it would be messy in a typical container.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to trying this product after reading the rave reviews and having tried a couple of other Dior beauty products that were top-notch quality. I didn&#x27;t mind the price because I was intending on only using it for special occasions or when I thought I might get my picture taken, not for every day use (I have to have an SPF for every day foundation.) Well, after the first time I used it I DID get my picture taken and it was awful. Even though it looked like it when on very smooth (and I checked it in artificial and natural light before going out) by the end of the evening it looked very blotchy on my skin!! I have never had this problem with other high quality, but less expensive foundations. I DO NOT recommend this product if you have dry skin as I do. I think my skin absolutely needs a cream foundation. Since I got it from Sephora I am going to try to exchange it for the DiorSkin Icone Photo Perfect Creme and let you know how it works for me. If that doesn&#x27;t work either I&#x27;m just going back to my old foundation which really wasn&#x27;t bad, it just made my skin a little whiter than I preferred in pictures because of the SPF content.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend brought this on our annual girl&#x27;s trip to Vegas.  She wanted each of us to try it and unfortunately for her, we all liked it so much we couldn&#x27;t go back to using our own make up.  It gave each of us a flawless finish that still looked very natural.  We each got compliments on our skin throughout the weekend.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of acne...but using this foundation conceals nearly all of it. When I take pictures, I seemingly have flawless skin. I&#x27;d post a picture if I could ;-)</li>
            <li> This is the best foundation ever! It is easy to apply and has a flawless finish. One thing to note is it will last longer if you spray it on your hand and then use a foundation brush to apply it to your face...otherwise before you know it the bottle is gone! But it is so wonderful that you WILL buy another bottle. I keep an extra on hand. It just makes your skin look flawless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    A+++++++++++++++</li>
            <li> I had terrible terrible acne for about 2 years before this. I tried everything. I switched my soap, I went on the pill, I changed foundations 100 times, I tried proactive, anti-biotics, even bare minerals (which made my acne worse. DO NOT USE BARE MINERALS IF YOU HAVE DRY SKIN!!!! IT WILL RUIN YOUR FACE!!!) they should tell people that, but they dont.    Anyway, one day, my mother suggested that I use this new spray foundation she got from Dior, and I laughed and said \\&quot;a spray foundation? that sounds rediculous\\&quot;--- yes-- it took a while for me to get the hang of putting it on, but I swear to you, a few weeks after I started wearing this, my skin CLEARED UP COMPLETELY. Its a miracle product. I love it, and even though its 60 bucks, I wouldnt give it up for anythign in the world. To apply, spray a circular amount on a few different places on your face, and then blend with clean fingertips. It&#x27;s lightweight, has great coverage and evens out skintone PERFECTLY. It&#x27;s like putting water on your face, but it covers EVERYTHING!    I am so happy this product exists. It literally saved my life in a way. When you have terrible acne, your moral is low, you feel bad about yourself... its awful. This product gave me hope again. Cleared my skin, got me to leave the house instead of staying on at night worrying about how terrible my acne was. Thank you so much!!!    I would like to make a disclaimer saying that I have VERY pale ivory skin. Porcelain, if you will. So this product might not be as great for coverage and skin balancing for peopel with darker complexions.     If I could give it 10 starts, I would!!!</li>
            <li> Everything about this product is amazing except for the price and how long it lasts. i splurged on this one just out of curiosity and i fell in love with it! It is very easy to apply honestly. i usually put it on right out of the shower and i have a towel on my head and it doesn&#x27;t get on my hair. You really don&#x27;t even need to touch up unless its been something like 10 hours since you&#x27;ve applied. I was using this product daily for about 3 weeks when i noticed it was getting a little low 8[ so i bought a different (but still expensive $40 foundation) - so now i use this off and on only on 1. days I&#x27;m in a huge rush 2. days that i have some horrible blemishes on my face (b/c this stuff will make them practically disappear!) or 3. I&#x27;m going out at night with friends or special occasions and don&#x27;t want to worry at all about my makeup. I will continue to buy this product BUT if you aren&#x27;t rich you can&#x27;t use it for everyday application. If you use this product everyday it will probably last you one month. I&#x27;ve stretched its use out to probably 2.5+ months from using sparingly over after the first 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> I really liked the AirFlash because it honestly does not look as if you&#x27;re wearing makeup.  The only down side is, it&#x27;s very expensive for how little use you get out of it and if you use it to cover acne, your acne has to be light to mild or else it wont cover it very well.  Besides that it actually really does give your face a natural looking smooth glow.    tip: don&#x27;t spray directly on face, put it on the back of your hand and then apply</li>
            <li> I have a helpful hint for those who say this wonderful make up does not last very long. I spray a small amount on a sponge wedge and dab it on all over , then with the sponge work it all over my face. I only have to spray the sponge 2 times .. Hope this helps girls .</li>
            <li> This has a very fast application with light-medium coverage. However, it still does not provide the same coverage as a less expensive, well known mineral make-up I use. Also, I don&#x27;t like how it also lands in your eyelashes and eyebrows. This was fun to experiment with, but I think I will stick with the mineral make-up.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my 4th can, and I plan on purchasing another one as soon as I finish typing this.      I don&#x27;t have perfect skin, but this make up, by far, makes my skin look the most flawless, whereas other make up had the danger of accentuating my problem areas on my skin simply because I don&#x27;t have the professional artistry to conceal them properly.    With this spray, it&#x27;s pretty much fool-proof in achieving the perfect look.  Everytime I wear this, I get compliments, whereas when I wear the liquid/cream foundation, I&#x27;m warned that I look tired, or that my jawline is not blended well enough!  This spray goes on evenly, it&#x27;s light weight and does not feel like I&#x27;m wearing a foundation (just looks like you have good skin, by minimizing pores and covering up blotchy skin).    The first can I got, I hadn&#x27;t mastered the air spray technique yet, so I went through it quickly, and didn&#x27;t get a good result (unevenly sprayed).  That was my fault in technical artistry - lol.  Now, I enjoy the fact that it takes 3 second vs 3 minutes to do my foundation.  It&#x27;s especially great when I get a short call to step outside, and I don&#x27;t have to tell my friends, \\&quot;I need 30 min to get ready\\&quot; instead of, \\&quot;I&#x27;m can leave my house in 5 minutes\\&quot;, with most of those 5 minutes being used on other things beside make up time!    Okay, I agree it&#x27;s a bit costly, and I also agree that it does not last as long as other make ups, but I consider it a reasonable exchange for all the positives it offers.  Have a sponge handy to take care of the spray that gets onto your hair line and eye lashes/brows - a quick rub pretty much takes care of that. Use sparingly, and just sponge your face to conserve some - I&#x27;ve made the mistake of over-using it unneccessarily, and now my spray lasts twice as long as my first can.    One last thing - I personally think that it&#x27;s more hygenic and improved my skin condition over-all.  The make up never comes in contact with my fingers or sponge that can cross contaminate the makeup, because there is no opening where the bacteria can get in like other traditional make ups containers.      Watch out for some online sites that sends you 1.7 oz can instead of the 2.3 oz you should be getting for $60.  I think some people got the smaller can and that&#x27;s why it only lasted for such few usage. I initially got the 1.7 oz sent to me, and I didn&#x27;t know it was smaller than what it was supposed to be BECAUSE I got it over the internet and you can&#x27;t tell how big the can is looking at the pictures.  Once I visited Sephora and saw how much bigger the can was supposed to be, I was more careful to check the correct content weight before purchasing it.  Buy only if it&#x27;s 2.3 oz, and expect a smaller 1.7 oz if they are posting it for cheaper price (around $48-$55), one such site being Strawberry.com</li>
            <li> I bought this make up at Neiman Marcus excited to try it and I was horribly disappointed. It was hard to apply (I accidentaly sprayed it in my hair and in the air) and what I did manage to get on my face, it did not cover much.  For the price they wanted this is unexcusable.  I promptly returned my Airflash and got my money back.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I bought this foundation for my wedding, and although I had a make-up artist, I really wanted to make sure the products she was going to use were high quality products. My makeup was simply flawless, and I looked really fabulous thanks to the airbrush effect of this foundation! The coverage is awesome; however, it doesn&#x27;t make you look like you&#x27;re wearing a mask, and it really lets your skin breathe. My wedding pictures came out so beautiful that I have used this product every day since! Also, the color really seems to adjust to your skin tone. I have medium skin and tan occasionally, so I went for the 300. On the contrary of other reviews, this product can last a lot longer than 3 weeks... it&#x27;s been over 6 weeks since I purchased it, and the bottle feels like there&#x27;s still a lot of product in it... I don&#x27;t know what the other girls are doing, but for me a little goes a long way, and like I said before, it&#x27;s not heavy and gives you a natural-not-tacky kind of look... Yes, it&#x27;s pricey, but if you&#x27;re a makeup junkie like me, you&#x27;ll not give it up because of the price... it&#x27;s worth every penny! I&#x27;ve received a lot of compliments... give it try!!</li>
