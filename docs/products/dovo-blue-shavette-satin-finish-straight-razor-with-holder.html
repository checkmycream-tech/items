            <li>Great straight razor for the price.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>It is very light and cleans up easy.</li>
            <li>The razor is very light and easy to maneuver.</li>
            <li>Many barbers still use a straight razor and, for hygienic purposes, this is the best way to ensure a quality straight razor shave.</li>
            <li>liked the full length blades that came with it.</li>
            <li>Besides the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of being cheep, this is one of the better designed and comfortable to hold ones.</li>
            <li>easy to use and load the blades.  </li>
            <li>Great product, will actual purchase more for gifts.</li>
            <li>it is wonderful especially paired with the right blade</li>
            <li>then that works fine</li>
            <li>but once you get a handle on it you&#x27;ll be fine.  </li>
            <li>Since then, I have become skilled / lucky at using it.</li>
            <li>It is extremely light.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I even forget I have it in my hand because it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li>The handle is cheap</li>
            <li>It is light, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li>It feels cheaply made but seems to be holding up alright.</li>
            <li>This razor seems light but is by no means cheap.</li>
            <li>Light weight.,</li>
            <li>Just started using straight razors and this is amazing</li>
            <li>Been working good so far for me.</li>
            <li>Very nice blue blade holder</li>
            <li>i own high end strait razors</li>
            <li>Great razor just wish it had a little more weight.</li>
            <li>I use this blade to clean the edges but not shave nobody because it tugs and pulls</li>
            <li>Super smooth shave.</li>
            <li>Since it uses disposable blades, the quality is only as good as the blades you put in it.</li>
            <li>I keep a full beard.  </li>
            <li>Not only have I saved 100&#x27;s of dollars there is a certain joy one gets from shaving like this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really light and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>First, this razor is extremely light weight.</li>
            <li>The blades it came with are very sharp and worked great.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, can&#x27;t beat the price to get into straight razor shaving.</li>
            <li>I never had a straight edge razor before, so I wanted to buy something that I could easily replace the blades on and where the holder would also stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They will fit in the red holder just fine, and they do stay secure.</li>
            <li>Cheap quality I returned it and bought the feather straight razor</li>
            <li>step is a real straight razor for me.</li>
            <li>So far I haven&#x27;t been able to locate them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Also has a nice simple pouch to keep it in.</li>
            <li>The smaller blade is more precise and glides on your face better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If nothing else, this particular razor is a nice way to introduce yourself to straight shaving without worrying about stropping &amp; honing or making the significant investment a first class straight razor requires.</li>
            <li>High quality product, Super light, Rigid.</li>
            <li>Balanced, solid, easy to use/clean, and I love the large blades.</li>
            <li>You can start shaving right out of the box.</li>
            <li>i enjoy the long blades that come with it if anyone can point me to the direction to get more.</li>
            <li>It works as it should and it&#x27;s great being able to use a standard DE razor by breaking it in half.</li>
            <li>The handle is plastic, and I would like it to feel a little more substantial, but outside that, I&#x27;ve been happily shaving with this for months.</li>
            <li>The only true downside to this shavette is that it&#x27;s super light</li>
            <li>I purchased a cheap stainless steel one and this one is much easier to handle on my face.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit tricky to get a blade in, so be careful with your precious fingers!</li>
            <li>It holds the blade just fine, my only qualm is that shaving cream seeps through where the blade so every time I use it I have to take everything out, clean it, and reassemble it.</li>
            <li>they are tricky to get out at first</li>
            <li>First time for everything, I guess: junk.  </li>
            <li>Absolute junk!  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I cut myself 6 times.</li>
            <li>I used it for the first time yesterday.</li>
            <li>This is exactly that.  </li>
            <li>This is nice because you don&#x27;t have to go purchase another insert as you would for one of the other Dovo razors.</li>
            <li>It is lighter than the other and it feels really nice in my hand when I shave.</li>
            <li>But, I had purchased the Dovo Shavette long blades which work outstandingly..</li>
            <li>Cheap price and great quality make it useful for anyone looking to try old style shaving without the expensive price tag.</li>
            <li>Really like the Dovo shavette.</li>
            <li>There is a seam on the back of the plastic but its smooth.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>and I really like it.</li>
            <li>This is a really well built shavette.</li>
            <li>I am really liking this Shavette.</li>
            <li>I inherited a couple straight razors.  </li>
            <li>Fits my hand very well.</li>
            <li>The truth is that I have the stainless steel shavette by Dovo</li>
            <li>You must get the full length Dovo blades for the whole experience, but still, this is the only way to go if you want to try straight razor shaving on a budget.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is a slick design, and it&#x27;s super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am new to straight razors and was browsing for a decent one.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical at the price, but the easy-secure blades really made me happy with this one.</li>
            <li>Great little razor for those interested in getting started in shaving with a straight razor but not willing to part with $200 plus for a traditional straight razor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve found Merkur blades to be of fairly high quality.</li>
            <li>High quality, lightweight and ergonomically designed.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a shavette.</li>
            <li>The screw at the joint isn&#x27;t loose so the blade doesn&#x27;t swing wildly, and probably thanks to its light weight as well, it stays in place.</li>
            <li>Made cheap and it&#x27;s off center</li>
            <li>The blades it comes with include one long blade, and a Merkur Super Safety Blade.</li>
            <li>For those new to straight-edge shaving, this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li>I only use the red handle but thats what the problem is, it doesn&#x27;t securely clip together.</li>
            <li>But even with this small flaw I am still quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>There are a lot of people who will go to one extreme or the other regarding the question of what kind of blades to use.</li>
            <li>I would have liked the black handle to be a harder or heavier plastic.</li>
            <li>The refill blades are so cheap I generally replace one every day or every other day.</li>
            <li>Would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the market for a straight razor.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lighter than a straight razor, but still seems solid and sable.  </li>
            <li>only issue is that you can only fit one regular blade in there, instead of 2 side by side.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a straight razor.</li>
            <li>I bought this wanting a disposable straight razor that didn&#x27;t require honing or stropping on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li>While still in the paper wrapping, snap the razor in half and fit it to the red plastic holder, then slide the holder into the shavette and get to work on your face.  </li>
            <li>One left a nasty scar on my left cheek that my be there a while.&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have a nice clean shave that lasts most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>With a slow, steady shave you&#x27;ll be fine, but increasing your speed too much leads to easier nicks than other razors with a truly fixed blade might.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try the long one; I imagine it&#x27;s like a regular straight razor (but lighter).</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re only using it for a small job like a mustache, then the shorter safety blades will be adequate.</li>
            <li>Pretty much waste of time.</li>
            <li>A few weeks ago I got a shave at a new barbershop where I live.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately the razor-holder does not sit perfectly flush in the aluminum frame, and a tiny bit of wobble in something so sharp that is so close to your face is never good.  </li>
            <li>Came with a few single blades so it could be used right when it arrived.</li>
            <li>The fact that it is inexpensive while being small and lightweight, and requiring no stropping like a traditional straight razor, makes this a very practical choice for the average joe.</li>

            <li> Great little razor for those interested in getting started in shaving with a straight razor but not willing to part with $200 plus for a traditional straight razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found Merkur blades to be of fairly high quality.</li>
            <li> High quality, lightweight and ergonomically designed.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a shavette.</li>
            <li> The screw at the joint isn&#x27;t loose so the blade doesn&#x27;t swing wildly, and probably thanks to its light weight as well, it stays in place.</li>
            <li> Made cheap and it&#x27;s off center</li>
            <li> The blades it comes with include one long blade, and a Merkur Super Safety Blade.</li>
            <li> For those new to straight-edge shaving, this is the way to go.  </li>
            <li> I only use the red handle but thats what the problem is, it doesn&#x27;t securely clip together.</li>
            <li> But even with this small flaw I am still quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> There are a lot of people who will go to one extreme or the other regarding the question of what kind of blades to use.</li>
            <li> I would have liked the black handle to be a harder or heavier plastic.</li>
            <li> The refill blades are so cheap I generally replace one every day or every other day.</li>
            <li> Would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the market for a straight razor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lighter than a straight razor, but still seems solid and sable.  </li>
            <li> only issue is that you can only fit one regular blade in there, instead of 2 side by side.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a straight razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this wanting a disposable straight razor that didn&#x27;t require honing or stropping on a regular basis.  </li>
            <li> While still in the paper wrapping, snap the razor in half and fit it to the red plastic holder, then slide the holder into the shavette and get to work on your face.  </li>
            <li> One left a nasty scar on my left cheek that my be there a while.&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have a nice clean shave that lasts most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> With a slow, steady shave you&#x27;ll be fine, but increasing your speed too much leads to easier nicks than other razors with a truly fixed blade might.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try the long one; I imagine it&#x27;s like a regular straight razor (but lighter).</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re only using it for a small job like a mustache, then the shorter safety blades will be adequate.</li>
            <li> Pretty much waste of time.</li>
            <li> A few weeks ago I got a shave at a new barbershop where I live.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately the razor-holder does not sit perfectly flush in the aluminum frame, and a tiny bit of wobble in something so sharp that is so close to your face is never good.  </li>
            <li> Came with a few single blades so it could be used right when it arrived.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is inexpensive while being small and lightweight, and requiring no stropping like a traditional straight razor, makes this a very practical choice for the average joe.</li>
            <li> several other ,economy line, razors and this is by far my favorte.</li>
            <li> A small problem, and this is no problem at all if you intend to use only the large Dovo blades.</li>
            <li> Some People will only use the proprietary long blades from the manufacturer.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re shaving a beard, I&#x27;d definitely suggest the long blades.</li>
            <li> I like that it comes with both short and long blade inserts.</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t know if it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Allows for both long and short blades.  </li>
            <li> but I live on a farm and things tend to not last as long in heavy work/</li>
            <li> oh&#x27;s, but no major blood loss.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This has also helped with my sensitive skin issues: since it&#x27;s one blade it&#x27;s less trauma on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since it was designed for larger blades the shavette will remove cream from more than just the area with the cutting edge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with DE&#x27;s for a while now and wanted to get into straight shaving, at least occasionally.</li>
            <li> As you can now see it also comes with the long blade and hair shaper blade holders.  </li>
            <li> They work well, but the blades are a bit long  --</li>
            <li> and i have only spent 5 dollars of blades in that time shaving 6 days a week</li>
            <li> If, however, you are looking into other brands of disposable blades I would say get a different shavette.</li>
            <li> so i only expect it to last a few months to a year.</li>
            <li> The handle doesn&#x27;t twist while you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with one each long and short double-edge blade you snap in half to insert into the handle.  </li>
            <li> long blade and one (breaks in half) short blade.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i would recommend this product to people who don&#x27;t have a lot of time for razor care, people who are just beginning getting into wet-shaving, people who have been wet shaving for a long time, and barbers.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
            <li> i can only find half blades.</li>
            <li> because using small, standard double edge sized, blades doesn&#x27;t quite work so well.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something a little shorter, as I&#x27;m only using it to touch up the edges of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but if you use the edge of the counter at the base of the holder to push it out the top , there will be no worries of cutting yourself as they ar in there nice and tight.</li>
            <li> I bought a vintage straight but got a sub par hone job on it and had no joy whatsoever with it.</li>
            <li> not much to sat about this item except that it serves its purpose</li>
            <li> was plastic, not a fan of that other</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recommend using the blades that come with the Dovo, they&#x27;re all subpar in quality and not worth dignifying with a shave.</li>
            <li> Keep this in mind because it&#x27;s so instinctive to press down when shaving</li>
            <li> I do  want to try the longer blade soon, after I get my technique down.</li>
            <li> then you decided black plastic would make it pop.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it four and a half stars, if I could.</li>
            <li> It came with one (breaks in half)</li>
            <li> I used an Astra that was snapped in half.</li>
            <li> and that&#x27;s a one way ticket to not enjoying the art of wet shaving.</li>
            <li> It seems a little flimsy but it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It could be a little heavier, and a metal alternative to the plastic blade holders would be great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This item broke within a few months.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t without a few</li>
            <li> Use it almost everyday.</li>
            <li> The razors that came with the plastic blade holders do not fit any of the blades.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.  </li>
            <li> My biggest problem is that the blade holders have a small notch of plastic at the end, that prevent the use of the tip of the razor blade in tight spaces (like around the ears).</li>
            <li> The black parts on the shavette are hard plastic.</li>
            <li> It only takes about 30 seconds but is a bit tedious to do every time you use it.</li>
            <li> But I find it hard to detail with because the corner of the blade is covered by the holder.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh hardly anything.</li>
            <li> cheap piece of plastic don not buy terrible</li>
            <li> my water is very hard</li>
            <li> Not happy.</li>
            <li> Not happy with product.</li>
            <li> Service even worse.</li>
            <li> This product was not advertised properly and gave me the wrong impression as to what I was buying I am very unhappy and will not shop on line anymore</li>
            <li> Nothing  says quality like black plastic :-(.</li>
            <li> If somehow you manage to nick yourself using a Merkur, then I&#x27;d say it is probably because you&#x27;re doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> , I am  a barber and was not impressed by the quality of your razor .</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ve gotta be careful, but I haven&#x27;t knicked myself very badly yet.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed</li>

            <li> Great straight blade, I use it all the time!!!</li>
            <li> For those new to straight-edge shaving, this is the way to go.  Note that no razors come with this, so order 7a.m. Platinum Double Edge Safety Razor Blades at the same time.  While still in the paper wrapping, snap the razor in half and fit it to the red plastic holder, then slide the holder into the shavette and get to work on your face.  Many barbers still use a straight razor and, for hygienic purposes, this is the best way to ensure a quality straight razor shave.</li>
            <li> Nothing  says quality like black plastic :-(. What were you thinking? Very nice blue blade holder then you decided black plastic would make it pop. Not happy.</li>
            <li> Works well for me. But I find it hard to detail with because the corner of the blade is covered by the holder.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this about a month ago and use it almost every night. it is nice and light . i own high end strait razors but this is a nice addition. i enjoy the long blades that come with it if anyone can point me to the direction to get more. i can only find half blades. this came with all three holders. which is great . they are tricky to get out at first but if you use the edge of the counter at the base of the holder to push it out the top , there will be no worries of cutting yourself as they ar in there nice and tight.</li>
            <li> Cheap quality I returned it and bought the feather straight razor</li>
            <li> First time for everything, I guess: junk.  Absolute junk!  Will not hold blades.</li>
            <li> Really like the Dovo shavette. The refill blades are so cheap I generally replace one every day or every other day. Great little razor for those interested in getting started in shaving with a straight razor but not willing to part with $200 plus for a traditional straight razor. This will help you determine if this type of shaving is for you or not.</li>
            <li> It is flimsy made but does the job.</li>
            <li> Great quality, but I wish it had more weight to it. It is extremely light.</li>
            <li> What else is there to say.  High quality product, Super light, Rigid. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the market for a straight razor.</li>
            <li> Easy to maintain and comes with some good blades.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe an instruction manual would be nice?</li>
            <li> I have been shaving with this razor and the replacement blades for over a year now. Not only have I saved 100&#x27;s of dollars there is a certain joy one gets from shaving like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has also helped with my sensitive skin issues: since it&#x27;s one blade it&#x27;s less trauma on the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next step is a real straight razor for me. I will get that once I go through the rest of the blades.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really light and exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> As you can now see it also comes with the long blade and hair shaper blade holders.  It is very light and cleans up easy.</li>
            <li> The fact that it is inexpensive while being small and lightweight, and requiring no stropping like a traditional straight razor, makes this a very practical choice for the average joe. Since it uses disposable blades, the quality is only as good as the blades you put in it. There are a lot of people who will go to one extreme or the other regarding the question of what kind of blades to use. Some People will only use the proprietary long blades from the manufacturer. Others stick exclusively with the standard safety blades because they&#x27;re cheaper. I&#x27;m different. If you&#x27;re shaving a beard, I&#x27;d definitely suggest the long blades. If you&#x27;re only using it for a small job like a mustache, then the shorter safety blades will be adequate. I would recommend having both types in your shave bag. The blades it comes with include one long blade, and a Merkur Super Safety Blade. I&#x27;ve found Merkur blades to be of fairly high quality. If somehow you manage to nick yourself using a Merkur, then I&#x27;d say it is probably because you&#x27;re doing it wrong.</li>
            <li> Great razor just wish it had a little more weight. Sometimes I even forget I have it in my hand because it&#x27;s so light.</li>
            <li> This item broke within a few months. The handle is cheap</li>
            <li> Works as expected so far after a couple months. It is light, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me. The black parts on the shavette are hard plastic. There is a seam on the back of the plastic but its smooth. The blade holders are flimsy, but thats not a bother either as they slide into the rigid blue aluminum(?). The screw at the joint isn&#x27;t loose so the blade doesn&#x27;t swing wildly, and probably thanks to its light weight as well, it stays in place. I feel proud to own one and to slice up all my fingers haha.</li>
            <li> I use this blade to clean the edges but not shave nobody because it tugs and pulls&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way I am a babes</li>
            <li> Came with what it said. Was in great condition. Looks awesome. Shaves great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using for several months and I really like it. I like that it comes with both short and long blade inserts.</li>
            <li> No stars from me . I was very disappointed , I am  a barber and was not impressed by the quality of your razor . If I could I would return it but I&#x27;ve already used it for my work purposes . Never would I order from amazon again!</li>
            <li> This is a really well built shavette. Balanced, solid, easy to use/clean, and I love the large blades. I took off a star because using small, standard double edge sized, blades doesn&#x27;t quite work so well. They will fit in the red holder just fine, and they do stay secure. But the problem is the rest of the holder. Since it was designed for larger blades the shavette will remove cream from more than just the area with the cutting edge. A small problem, and this is no problem at all if you intend to use only the large Dovo blades. If, however, you are looking into other brands of disposable blades I would say get a different shavette. But even with this small flaw I am still quite satisfied. I&#x27;d give it four and a half stars, if I could.</li>
            <li> I am really liking this Shavette. It works as it should and it&#x27;s great being able to use a standard DE razor by breaking it in half. I prefer this to DE shaving greatly. The handle is plastic, and I would like it to feel a little more substantial, but outside that, I&#x27;ve been happily shaving with this for months. You&#x27;ve gotta be careful, but I haven&#x27;t knicked myself very badly yet.</li>
            <li> Four stars because I only like this razor. Its a bit lite. It doesn&#x27;t weigh hardly anything. I prefer a heftier razor. But I like the feel enough I&#x27;ll just replace the scales with something heavier.</li>
            <li> Made cheap and it&#x27;s off center but, shaves nice</li>
            <li> I inherited a couple straight razors.  They work well, but the blades are a bit long  -- I keep a full beard.  I wanted to try something a little shorter, as I&#x27;m only using it to touch up the edges of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works well for that.  It&#x27;s lighter than a straight razor, but still seems solid and sable.  The blade goes where you aim it.  The handle doesn&#x27;t twist while you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comes with one each long and short double-edge blade you snap in half to insert into the handle.  I didn&#x27;t try the long one; I imagine it&#x27;s like a regular straight razor (but lighter).</li>
            <li> I am a barber, and need a razor for use on every customer (sideburns, around the ears and the back of the neck) For sanitation purposes, we only use razors where the blades can be changed. First, this razor is extremely light weight. It feels cheaply made but seems to be holding up alright. My biggest problem is that the blade holders have a small notch of plastic at the end, that prevent the use of the tip of the razor blade in tight spaces (like around the ears). The plastic notch touches the skin and blocks the razor from doing its job, making this razor unusable for my needs.</li>
            <li> Great Shavette. Comes with 3 inserts so you can use various blades. The blades it came with are very sharp and worked great. I recommend spending the extra money and getting the DOVO brand blades when you need them. It came with one (breaks in half) long blade and one (breaks in half) short blade. Awesome razor for the money, and it looks nice too!</li>
            <li> I got this as a birthday present. it is lightweight but feels sturdy. my water is very hard so i only expect it to last a few months to a year. but I live on a farm and things tend to not last as long in heavy work/ wear and tear environments.&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend this product to people who don&#x27;t have a lot of time for razor care, people who are just beginning getting into wet-shaving, people who have been wet shaving for a long time, and barbers.&lt;br /&gt;all and all I like it but i don&#x27;t know if it will last a long time.</li>
            <li> Best introduction into straight razor shaving for this beginner. GREAT PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> I would have liked the black handle to be a harder or heavier plastic. It seems a little flimsy but it will get the job done.</li>
            <li> PLASTIC PLASTIC PLASTIC</li>
            <li> I like the razor. The first time I used it I cut myself 6 times. The second time, I made 2 cuts. Since then, I have become skilled / lucky at using it. One left a nasty scar on my left cheek that my be there a while.&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have a nice clean shave that lasts most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;I liked the full length blades that came with it. So far I haven&#x27;t been able to locate them on Amazon. If someone finds them, please reply with a link.&lt;br /&gt;It could be a little heavier, and a metal alternative to the plastic blade holders would be great.&lt;br /&gt;There were no instructions, so it took me a while to figure out how to put this thing together. (The blade goes in the plastic. There are nubs that hold the blade in place. Fold the plastic around the blade, then insert the plastic holder into the tip of the blue razor shaft.)</li>
            <li> cheap piece of plastic don not buy terrible</li>
            <li> Love it. Easy to use, can&#x27;t beat the price to get into straight razor shaving. You can start shaving right out of the box.</li>
            <li> Not happy with product. Never used. When asked if I could return brushed me off. Service even worse. Do not buy.</li>
            <li> Awesome beginning for a straight razor, and still a great travel razor.  You must get the full length Dovo blades for the whole experience, but still, this is the only way to go if you want to try straight razor shaving on a budget.</li>
            <li> This is a solid starter shavette. It&#x27;s a bit tricky to get a blade in, so be careful with your precious fingers! I don&#x27;t recommend using the blades that come with the Dovo, they&#x27;re all subpar in quality and not worth dignifying with a shave. The only true downside to this shavette is that it&#x27;s super light so you don&#x27;t get to let the weight of the razor help you shave. Keep this in mind because it&#x27;s so instinctive to press down when shaving and that&#x27;s a one way ticket to not enjoying the art of wet shaving. If nothing else, this particular razor is a nice way to introduce yourself to straight shaving without worrying about stropping &amp; honing or making the significant investment a first class straight razor requires.</li>
            <li> I only use the red handle but thats what the problem is, it doesn&#x27;t securely clip together. Beyond that the product is great</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with DE&#x27;s for a while now and wanted to get into straight shaving, at least occasionally. I bought a vintage straight but got a sub par hone job on it and had no joy whatsoever with it. A few weeks ago I got a shave at a new barbershop where I live. He used a shavette. It was great, so I grabbed this one. I used it for the first time yesterday. It wasn&#x27;t without a few uh oh&#x27;s, but no major blood loss. Super smooth shave. I used an Astra that was snapped in half. I do  want to try the longer blade soon, after I get my technique down.</li>
            <li> I love this design. Fits my hand very well. I have several other ,economy line, razors and this is by far my favorte.</li>
            <li> I am a noob at this type of shaving. I am very happy with quality.</li>
            <li> Awesome shaver. You can&#x27;t beat German engineering. Perfect for what I was looking for.</li>
            <li> Still using it over 2 Years later and i have only spent 5 dollars of blades in that time shaving 6 days a week</li>
            <li> This product was not advertised properly and gave me the wrong impression as to what I was buying I am very unhappy and will not shop on line anymore</li>
            <li> This razor seems light but is by no means cheap. it is wonderful especially paired with the right blade</li>
            <li> Absolutely a great purchase. Purchased for my brother who says he gets better with it after every use. Cheap price and great quality make it useful for anyone looking to try old style shaving without the expensive price tag. Came with a few single blades so it could be used right when it arrived. Also has a nice simple pouch to keep it in.</li>
            <li> not much to sat about this item except that it serves its purpose and it&#x27;s inexpensive. Been working good so far for me.</li>
            <li> Besides the &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; of being cheep, this is one of the better designed and comfortable to hold ones. I purchased a cheap stainless steel one and this one is much easier to handle on my face. I was skeptical at the price, but the easy-secure blades really made me happy with this one.</li>
            <li> CAREFUL.&lt;br /&gt;Careful.</li>
            <li> was plastic, not a fan of that other then that works fine</li>
            <li> Great razor.  Light weight., easy to use and load the blades.  Like the idea it comes with two different blades so, you can try different styles of shaving</li>
            <li> I never had a straight edge razor before, so I wanted to buy something that I could easily replace the blades on and where the holder would also stand out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a slick design, and it&#x27;s super easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only issue is that you can only fit one regular blade in there, instead of 2 side by side. But, I had purchased the Dovo Shavette long blades which work outstandingly.. the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had.. Great product, will actual purchase more for gifts.</li>
            <li> I am new to straight razors and was browsing for a decent one. I found this through a shaving forum on the web. Use it almost everyday. Takes some time getting used to the shaving technique for a straight razor but gives one of the best shaves I have ever had. I prefer using the smaller blade that comes with the razor than the big one. The smaller blade is more precise and glides on your face better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is looking for a straight razor.</li>
            <li> High quality, lightweight and ergonomically designed. Great straight razor for the price. Would buy for friends and family without hesitation.</li>
            <li> The razors that came with the plastic blade holders do not fit any of the blades. I keep spending money trying to get blades so I can use this product. Pretty much waste of time.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and good quality. Has lasted all shaves well.</li>
            <li> I used a safety razor for a few months and wanted to make the move into straight razor shaves but didn&#x27;t want to have to strop or hone my razor. I decided to go with the dove shavette and I&#x27;m glad I did. The razor is very light and easy to maneuver. There is definitely a learning curve but once you get a handle on it you&#x27;ll be fine.  They made changing razors very simple with their plastic insert. I would highly recommend this razor to anyone looking for a shavette.</li>
            <li> Excellent Razor! Allows for both long and short blades.  This is nice because you don&#x27;t have to go purchase another insert as you would for one of the other Dovo razors.</li>
            <li> The truth is that I have the stainless steel shavette by Dovo and I had to have the blue one. It is lighter than the other and it feels really nice in my hand when I shave.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Looks good and feels even better. Just started using straight razors and this is amazing I didn&#x27;t know what I was missing.  Plus the bumps have started going away unlike the claims of some of the bump givers (fighters) I&#x27;ve used. Even beats my mock3.</li>
            <li> It holds the blade just fine, my only qualm is that shaving cream seeps through where the blade so every time I use it I have to take everything out, clean it, and reassemble it. It only takes about 30 seconds but is a bit tedious to do every time you use it.</li>
            <li> I bought this wanting a disposable straight razor that didn&#x27;t require honing or stropping on a regular basis.  This is exactly that.  Plastic handle, aluminum frame with rubber accents.  Unfortunately the razor-holder does not sit perfectly flush in the aluminum frame, and a tiny bit of wobble in something so sharp that is so close to your face is never good.  With a slow, steady shave you&#x27;ll be fine, but increasing your speed too much leads to easier nicks than other razors with a truly fixed blade might.</li>
