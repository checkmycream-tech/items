            <li>It smells nice, lasts for days if needed, and leaves no residue on clothes.  </li>
            <li>and she is beyond thrilled to have it.  </li>

            <li>it smells good and not in an overwhelming way.</li>

            <li>Its great too have a deodrant your excited to put on..</li>
            <li>and I love it, if you can love a deodorant!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is by far the best deodorant I have ever tried</li>
            <li>Elizabeth Arden has been my deodorant of choice for many many years, after being turned on to it by my own mother.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This product has a very light scent but most importantly does what it&#x27;s suppose to!  </li>
            <li>I love the creamy aspect as opposed to spray or roll-on and there is no scent.</li>
            <li>love it and always keeps a stock of it.  </li>
            <li>I love this item..........</li>
            <li>and I reallllly appreciate the price that I&#x27;m able to get from Amazon</li>

            <li>so I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has it</li>
            <li>and I love the price for the size.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nivea Rool-on and Ban Roll-on deodorant are better for me--both available on Amazon!  </li>
            <li>Aren&#x27;t we all in search of perfect deodorant which wouldn&#x27;t stain our clothes and would do its job at the same time?</li>
            <li>Love this things</li>

            <li>Its so refreshing.</li>
            <li>I bought this product based off of reviews from a beauty blog and it is a nice product with a creamy texture and light scent</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I just ordered more</li>
            <li>Elizabeth Arden is my favorite brand from my 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>Blue Grass Scent is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Makes me feel good and hopefully smell fresh.  </li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Many deodorants give me a rash, this one does not</li>
            <li>and it has a nice light smell.  </li>
            <li>I have tried numerous brands and this one is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>I love Elizabeth Arden deodorants.</li>
            <li>satisfied to quality and neutral smell.</li>
            <li>so far so good!</li>
            <li>It was originally recommended by my gynecologist!</li>
            <li>It is so effective and has a mild scent.</li>
            <li>This deodorant works very well and has a pleasant scent.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it as a gentle and very pleasant smelling deodorant.</li>
            <li>It leaves a slight scent that is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Nice spray, but as I have arthritis in my hands, the deodorant cream spray was too large for me to use.  </li>
            <li>so good has a very light scent nothing over powering  the only difference I find between the two</li>
            <li>It also goes on smoothly and is non-irritating.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t enjoy writing reviews</li>
            <li>ENJOY YOU WILL BE HOOKED...</li>
            <li>This is a great deodorant that I rely on regularly.</li>
            <li>Smells nice and really controls both perspiration and odor.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Elizabeth Arden Blue Grass deodorant for many years and it is by far the best on the market!  </li>
            <li>Wonderful, could never find it locally and have been using it since I was in high school!</li>
            <li>This product is just as I always found it very effective - only difference</li>
            <li>If you are not a physically active person or if you work in an office this might still be a good product for you.</li>
            <li>I read so many good reviews about this deodorant I decided to order some my favorite is green tea by Elizabeth Arden</li>
            <li>This deodorant is wonderful especially if you have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>My daugther has an ultra sensitive skin and Blue Grass works perfectly for her.</li>
            <li>IT HAVE A GREAT SMELLS AND STAYS FRESH FOR LONG.</li>
            <li>It is great to  find a company that not only has what my entire family (male and female) needs but has great prices and great service.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t feel fresh and clean all day.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with my purchase and most likely to buy again.</li>
            <li>and it came quickly.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this works for very hot days</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great for when you have a black shirt/dress on that is sleeveless; won&#x27;t leave deodorant marks.</li>
            <li>It lasts and has a crisp clean scent.</li>
            <li>It keeps you fresh all day, no worries at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recommend this product if you enjoy the light misty sweet scent of Blue Grass products by Elizabeth Arden.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that the Blue Grass deodorant quality has stayed the same after all these years.  </li>
            <li>I ordered the perfumed talc first and now the cream deodorant.</li>
            <li>Works very well!</li>
            <li>Love them got it the next day</li>
            <li>I love Blue Grass Perfume and I have purchased this deodorant years ago.  </li>
            <li>Blue Grass Deoderant is the BEST DEODERANT as it is the only one that does not give me BIG BLOTCHES on the UNDERARMS.</li>
            <li>Only deodorant that I have used for many years..</li>
            <li>It still works the way it did when I first began using it.</li>
            <li>I love the Blue Grass scent.</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>I prefer Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Green Tea deodorant over this one because it smells good and lasts longer.</li>
            <li>Thanks to the internet and Amazon, I was able to find Blue Grass again.  </li>
            <li>Other than that it works great and has kept my clothes nicer- no yellow stain!</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>BUT GOOD THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES.</li>
            <li>it is much cheaper than when I purchase it at Macys.</li>
            <li>, it goes on smooth and does not leave white marks on your clothes.</li>
            <li>This is a real find.  </li>
            <li>Overall it was a stress free purchase.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say how well it works since I would never use it being that I am a male and that these were for my mother, but I will give it 5 stars because it was cheap</li>
            <li>(I left same review for Green Tea deodorant since I bought both kinds and very happy with  both of them).</li>
            <li>I am now sixty-five and was searching for a deodorant that would really work.  </li>
            <li>and it really works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Over the years it has felt like the bottles run out much faster</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and well-packaged.</li>
            <li>Really like.</li>
            <li>Also, it works very well for men.</li>
            <li>Before that deo i found just one really helpful, Kenzo women stick.</li>
            <li>Really was excited to find it here because it seems like when I go to the shopping mall to get it they have just sold their last one.  </li>
            <li>Blue Grass was her first fragrance dating back many decades.</li>
            <li>I started using it about 8 years ago after my husband kept getting a rash from most other deodorants he was using.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m spoiled now and would not be able to go back to regular deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I am a busy real estate agent in Florida and have used this for years.</li>
            <li>Purchased the green tea fragrance and we like that even better.</li>
            <li>This stuff is AWSOME better than the green tea</li>
            <li>,I like the green tea scent better</li>
            <li>Would not think of trying something new.</li>
            <li>Delicate scent, great absorbtion, clothes stay totally clean - this what describes Elizabeth Arden Green Tea and Blue Gras deodorants.</li>
            <li>Such a Feminine pretty powdery fragrance &amp;</li>
            <li>Usually order a dozen at a time  and never paid more than 4.00 each.</li>
            <li>You push up to dispense and if you are not careful, you may dispense too much.</li>
            <li>It is the only product that absolutely works to fight odor.  </li>
            <li>than it would if I purchased it directly from the company.  </li>
            <li>Early in my life, a deodorant would not work and I would have to change the brand.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t, because my skin is ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li>Its price is a little high, but it is well worth the expense.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s subtle aroma is never overpowering, it goes on smoothly and NEVER leaves underarm garments stains!</li>
            <li>When I first tried a sample of this product, I was hooked and now 2 years later - only deodorant I have purchased.  </li>
            <li>You should put it on a little bit before you put your top on so the cream will dry.</li>
            <li>I especially like the Nivea Roll-on as I have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>it keeps me fresh and dry all day long.  </li>
            <li>and I have used it since I was old enough to use deodorant.  </li>
            <li>Nice scent, just bit expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li>I had to skip a bath for a day due to a long flight and with all of the stress of flying and such, I still smelled fresh.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m grateful that Amazon offers this product at a price that costs far less</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s also great for when you have a black shirt/dress on that is sleeveless; won&#x27;t leave deodorant marks.</li>
            <li> It lasts and has a crisp clean scent.</li>
            <li> It keeps you fresh all day, no worries at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recommend this product if you enjoy the light misty sweet scent of Blue Grass products by Elizabeth Arden.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that the Blue Grass deodorant quality has stayed the same after all these years.  </li>
            <li> I ordered the perfumed talc first and now the cream deodorant.</li>
            <li> Works very well!</li>
            <li> Love them got it the next day</li>
            <li> I love Blue Grass Perfume and I have purchased this deodorant years ago.  </li>
            <li> Blue Grass Deoderant is the BEST DEODERANT as it is the only one that does not give me BIG BLOTCHES on the UNDERARMS.</li>
            <li> Only deodorant that I have used for many years..</li>
            <li> It still works the way it did when I first began using it.</li>
            <li> I love the Blue Grass scent.</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> I prefer Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Green Tea deodorant over this one because it smells good and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> Thanks to the internet and Amazon, I was able to find Blue Grass again.  </li>
            <li> Other than that it works great and has kept my clothes nicer- no yellow stain!</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> BUT GOOD THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES.</li>
            <li> it is much cheaper than when I purchase it at Macys.</li>
            <li> , it goes on smooth and does not leave white marks on your clothes.</li>
            <li> This is a real find.  </li>
            <li> Overall it was a stress free purchase.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say how well it works since I would never use it being that I am a male and that these were for my mother, but I will give it 5 stars because it was cheap</li>
            <li> (I left same review for Green Tea deodorant since I bought both kinds and very happy with  both of them).</li>
            <li> I am now sixty-five and was searching for a deodorant that would really work.  </li>
            <li> and it really works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Over the years it has felt like the bottles run out much faster</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and well-packaged.</li>
            <li> Really like.</li>
            <li> Also, it works very well for men.</li>
            <li> Before that deo i found just one really helpful, Kenzo women stick.</li>
            <li> Really was excited to find it here because it seems like when I go to the shopping mall to get it they have just sold their last one.  </li>
            <li> Blue Grass was her first fragrance dating back many decades.</li>
            <li> I started using it about 8 years ago after my husband kept getting a rash from most other deodorants he was using.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m spoiled now and would not be able to go back to regular deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li> I am a busy real estate agent in Florida and have used this for years.</li>
            <li> Purchased the green tea fragrance and we like that even better.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWSOME better than the green tea</li>
            <li> ,I like the green tea scent better</li>
            <li> Would not think of trying something new.</li>
            <li> Delicate scent, great absorbtion, clothes stay totally clean - this what describes Elizabeth Arden Green Tea and Blue Gras deodorants.</li>
            <li> Such a Feminine pretty powdery fragrance &amp;</li>
            <li> Usually order a dozen at a time  and never paid more than 4.00 each.</li>
            <li> You push up to dispense and if you are not careful, you may dispense too much.</li>
            <li> It is the only product that absolutely works to fight odor.  </li>
            <li> than it would if I purchased it directly from the company.  </li>
            <li> Early in my life, a deodorant would not work and I would have to change the brand.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t, because my skin is ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li> Its price is a little high, but it is well worth the expense.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s subtle aroma is never overpowering, it goes on smoothly and NEVER leaves underarm garments stains!</li>
            <li> When I first tried a sample of this product, I was hooked and now 2 years later - only deodorant I have purchased.  </li>
            <li> You should put it on a little bit before you put your top on so the cream will dry.</li>
            <li> I especially like the Nivea Roll-on as I have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> it keeps me fresh and dry all day long.  </li>
            <li> and I have used it since I was old enough to use deodorant.  </li>
            <li> Nice scent, just bit expensive for what you get.</li>
            <li> I had to skip a bath for a day due to a long flight and with all of the stress of flying and such, I still smelled fresh.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m grateful that Amazon offers this product at a price that costs far less</li>
            <li> They glide on very smoothly, do not irritate my skin, and they really work!</li>
            <li> Smells like toilet cleaner mixed with baby powder.</li>
            <li> and it did not last long.  </li>
            <li> I sweat alot at the gym and so far this product hasn&#x27;t let me down</li>
            <li> It also works long term.  </li>
            <li> A friend recommended this to him and although it is not a masculine scent, it works for him and does not give him rash or lumps under his forearm.  </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a long time</li>
            <li> The deodorant keeps you dry.</li>
            <li> it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as the product I was using previously</li>
            <li> You are not going to be disappointed with this amazing product.</li>
            <li> You only need a little dab.</li>
            <li> Blue Grass, Green Tea, and Eau Fraiche.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll buy it again (or the same with the flavor of the green tea).</li>
            <li> I will not consider using any other deodorant.  </li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER HAD A PROBLEM WITH OTHER DEODORANTS</li>
            <li> the way that the deodorant comes out is a bit odd because it sorta squirts out like its lotion.</li>
            <li> A little goes a&lt;br /&gt;long</li>
            <li> I ordered this fragrance because I was curious about the late Miss Arden.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and received it within a few days.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like to waste product.</li>
            <li> But Kenzo closed this line, and i was forced to looking for other.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m</li>
            <li> Works so well and for how small it is, it lasts quite a whilez</li>
            <li> I do not perspire heavily, so not sure if that would work for you if this is a problem you have.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too hard to find anymore</li>
            <li> My daughter was having a hard time getting an antiperspirant to work for her.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this in the late 1960s and it never disappoints.  </li>
            <li> I know it gets me through at least 8 hrs who knows</li>
            <li> It has become LESS expensive through the years.</li>
            <li> , that is sad, but I still buy this and the Green Tea</li>
            <li> Even though it&#x27;s just a deodorant, it still reduces perspiration, at least for me!</li>
            <li> I bought 6 of these bad boys for my mom since she loves this deodorant.</li>
            <li> have never had any bad reaction from this product.&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This deodorant has a very nice fragrance and controls odor all day! It also goes on smoothly and is non-irritating.</li>
            <li> This product is great. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating was sometimes it leaves a white residue on my clothes. Other than that it works great and has kept my clothes nicer- no yellow stain!</li>
            <li> My preferred deodorant</li>
            <li> This product is just as I always found it very effective - only difference it is much cheaper than when I purchase it at Macys.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a deodorant that didn&#x27;t smell like a flowerbomb and this one does the trick.  It isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant so you will still sweat (perspire) but the smell is yummy.  It also works long term.  I had to skip a bath for a day due to a long flight and with all of the stress of flying and such, I still smelled fresh.</li>
            <li> This is the best deodorant I have used.  It does a great job, better than any I have used.  I get it on Amazon because I cannot find it in anywhere in stores.</li>
            <li> My dermatologist recommended this in the late 1960s and it never disappoints.  It has become LESS expensive through the years.</li>
            <li> Love it keep you smeling good</li>
            <li> I ordered this fragrance because I was curious about the late Miss Arden. Blue Grass was her first fragrance dating back many decades. I ordered the perfumed talc first and now the cream deodorant. I recommend this line daytime wear or office employees.</li>
            <li> Only deodorant I&#x27;ve used that did not cause a rash or itching. Works very well!</li>
            <li> I wish this was a subscribe and save product. I&#x27;d definitely have it on my list. I love the creamy aspect as opposed to spray or roll-on and there is no scent. It also did a great job of hiding my scent, so to speak.</li>
            <li> This deodorant is wonderful especially if you have sensitive skin.  I started using it about 8 years ago after my husband kept getting a rash from most other deodorants he was using.  A friend recommended this to him and although it is not a masculine scent, it works for him and does not give him rash or lumps under his forearm.  Since I loved the smell, I started using it as we&#x27;ll and we have never used anything else for the last 8 years.  It keeps you fresh all day, no worries at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We love it and always keeps a stock of it.  When you wear it, you don&#x27;t need perfume, people always tell me how nice I smell and that is the only fragrance I wear.  I highly recommend it as a gentle and very pleasant smelling deodorant.</li>
            <li> I love this item..........I&#x27;ve used it for years......and I reallllly appreciate the price that I&#x27;m able to get from Amazon -- it&#x27;s much, much better than in the stores.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I ordered several of these for my friend, who loves them. I also ordered a couple for my wife, who did not.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve known of this product for over 15 years and have used it since.  I will not consider using any other deodorant.  I&#x27;ve have numerous friend now using this product as well.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I did not like Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Blue Grass deodorant.  I did not like the scent at all and it did not last long.  I prefer Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s Green Tea deodorant over this one because it smells good and lasts longer.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with my purchase and most likely to buy again. Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Runu</li>
            <li> My grandmother used to work at the Elizabeth Arden in Manhattan.  She introduced our family--the girls--to this product and I have used it since I was old enough to use deodorant.  I like it because there is no scent, it goes on smooth and does not leave white marks on your clothes. I have a daughter who uses it now.  That makes three generations![[ASIN:B000195GAY Blue Grass by Elizabeth Arden for Women, 1.5 oz Cream Deodorant Stick]]</li>
            <li> I love using this deodorant.</li>
            <li> This is a real find.  It smells nice, lasts for days if needed, and leaves no residue on clothes.  It packs well also.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t enjoy writing reviews but I have been using Elizabeth Arden for over 20 years! It works wonderful. You should put it on a little bit before you put your top on so the cream will dry. I used to buy this at Macy&#x27;s but it&#x27;s too hard to find anymore so I&#x27;m so glad Amazon has it line.&lt;br /&gt;You will love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!!!  Works so well and for how small it is, it lasts quite a whilez</li>
            <li> My mother introduced my sister and me to this product back in the 60&#x27;s when we were children and shopped at Maas Brothers, now known as Macy&#x27;s in our area.  It is the only product that absolutely works to fight odor.  I do wish that they would remove the aluminum, though.</li>
            <li> The deodorant keeps you dry. It smells great and I love the price for the size.&lt;br /&gt;  It arrived in a timely manner. Overall it was a stress free purchase.</li>
            <li> MY DAUGHTER HAD A PROBLEM WITH OTHER DEODORANTS TILL I FOUND THIS PRODUCT. IT HAVE A GREAT SMELLS AND STAYS FRESH FOR LONG. SHOULD OF BEEN A LIL BIGGER BUT GOOD THINGS COME IN SMALL PACKAGES.</li>
            <li> I would have given this item 5 stars but one of the containers arrived with no cap and had squeezed out all over the container. The product is terrific! I&#x27;ve used it for years. Can use immediately after shaving - no sting or burn.</li>
            <li> My daughter was having a hard time getting an antiperspirant to work for her. I had used this product some years before when I had her same problem. Remembering, I ordered this and it works for her and she loves the scent. I bout several for her and myself. Purchased the green tea fragrance and we like that even better.</li>
            <li> Nice spray, but as I have arthritis in my hands, the deodorant cream spray was too large for me to use.  Nivea Rool-on and Ban Roll-on deodorant are better for me--both available on Amazon!  I especially like the Nivea Roll-on as I have sensitive skin!</li>
            <li> Such a Feminine pretty powdery fragrance &amp; it keeps me fresh and dry all day long.  I&#x27;ve been using BGD for years, EA hasn&#x27;t changed this one thank God!</li>
            <li> Love this product and it never stains expensive suits</li>
            <li> I bought 6 of these bad boys for my mom since she loves this deodorant. I can&#x27;t say how well it works since I would never use it being that I am a male and that these were for my mother, but I will give it 5 stars because it was cheap and it came quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent...does not fight against your own body phd, which is a good thing.</li>
            <li> Love them got it the next day</li>
            <li> Aren&#x27;t we all in search of perfect deodorant which wouldn&#x27;t stain our clothes and would do its job at the same time? Now I found it. Delicate scent, great absorbtion, clothes stay totally clean - this what describes Elizabeth Arden Green Tea and Blue Gras deodorants. Great product. (I left same review for Green Tea deodorant since I bought both kinds and very happy with  both of them).</li>
            <li> The product is great! The price is not. Usually order a dozen at a time  and never paid more than 4.00 each.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve use this product for years and truly think it is the best.  Really was excited to find it here because it seems like when I go to the shopping mall to get it they have just sold their last one.  Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> Nice scent, just bit expensive for what you get. I don&#x27;t think this works for very hot days, I think I&#x27;ll go back to Dove</li>
            <li> I love Blue Grass Perfume and I have purchased this deodorant years ago.  I&#x27;m happy to say that the Blue Grass deodorant quality has stayed the same after all these years.  I&#x27;m grateful that Amazon offers this product at a price that costs far less than it would if I purchased it directly from the company.  I recommend this product if you enjoy the light misty sweet scent of Blue Grass products by Elizabeth Arden.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for years and love it! It is so effective and has a mild scent. Even some men are using it! Never sweat or smell using this product.</li>
            <li> Perfect. Love this things</li>
            <li> This product has a very light scent but most importantly does what it&#x27;s suppose to!  It&#x27;s also great for when you have a black shirt/dress on that is sleeveless; won&#x27;t leave deodorant marks.</li>
            <li> I used Blue Grass Deodorant for years back when I was much younger.  I loved it then, but lost track of it through the years.  I am now sixty-five and was searching for a deodorant that would really work.  Thanks to the internet and Amazon, I was able to find Blue Grass again.  It&#x27;s the same reliable deodorant I remember it to be.  Blue Grass deodorant is the best for me.  Thank you Amazon.</li>
            <li> This stuff is AWSOME better than the green tea</li>
            <li> The product itself is a staple, especially for those who need hypoallergenic products.  I purchase it literally by the case.  It is great to  find a company that not only has what my entire family (male and female) needs but has great prices and great service.</li>
            <li> Wonderful, could never find it locally and have been using it since I was in high school!</li>
            <li> Smells like toilet cleaner mixed with baby powder.</li>
            <li> Have been using for over 10 yrs. no residue and no sweat. Leaves my skin nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> My Mom used this deodorant for years and thought they had quit making it.  Mom is 85.  When I found it on Amazon I couldn&#x27;t wait to surprise her and she is beyond thrilled to have it.  Since I was ordering for her I thought I would order some for me too.  I am now using it and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and received it within a few days.  Very good service and followup from the seller.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling deodorant I have ever used. You only need a little dab. It lasts a long time. I wish it was sold in the markets and drug stores across the country.</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden has been my deodorant of choice for many many years, after being turned on to it by my own mother.&lt;br /&gt;I love this stuff and it really works!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only concern is the price. Over the years it has felt like the bottles run out much faster, that is sad, but I still buy this and the Green Tea flavor.&lt;br /&gt;It is by far the best deodorant I have ever tried and I am just going to continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;I have never had any bad reaction from this product.&lt;br /&gt;If my review helped you, please click on \\&quot;Helpful\\&quot; (or \\&quot;yes\\&quot;) below. Thank you! :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with antiperspirent, as an option, and that doesn&#x27;t work for me when the weather warms up.  And the applicator just kind of squirts out the creamy gel.</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant for about fifteen years now and I love it, if you can love a deodorant!  A little goes a&lt;br /&gt;long way and you put it on and forget it as they say. I used to buy it from a name department store till I found on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;The only way to go. Would not think of trying something new.</li>
            <li> Blue Grass Deoderant is the BEST DEODERANT as it is the only one that does not give me BIG BLOTCHES on the UNDERARMS.</li>
            <li> Only deodorant that I have used for many years.. It&#x27;s just the very best! Hope that Arden never stops making this product...</li>
            <li> I have been using this deodorant cream for over 50 years, and it still has served me well. Early in my life, a deodorant would not work and I would have to change the brand.  Not with this cream. It still works the way it did when I first began using it.</li>
            <li> if you want a cream good smelling plus it works this is it.... IT HAS been around along time and I KNOW WHY. IT Does not stain your clothes. It is not over powering. Its so refreshing. Its great too have a deodrant your excited to put on.. You cannot find it at this price anywhere. ENJOY YOU WILL BE HOOKED...</li>
            <li> Shipped fast and well-packaged. This is a great deodorant that I rely on regularly. Its price is a little high, but it is well worth the expense. Will roder again when needed.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years.  Really like.</li>
            <li> I love the Blue Grass scent. This deodorant works well and does not stain. It leaves a slight scent that is wonderful. The reason I only give it four stars is because of the applicator. You push up to dispense and if you are not careful, you may dispense too much. Because of this, I will have to think about whether or not I will purchase again. I don&#x27;t like to waste product.</li>
            <li> I bought this product based off of reviews from a beauty blog and it is a nice product with a creamy texture and light scent it just doesn&#x27;t last as long as the product I was using previously so I don&#x27;t feel fresh and clean all day. If you are not a physically active person or if you work in an office this might still be a good product for you. Thank you</li>
            <li> I have used this product for 41 years; there is nothing like it. It was originally recommended by my gynecologist!</li>
            <li> I have used this deodorant for over 40 yrs. Love it.</li>
            <li> I read so many good reviews about this deodorant I decided to order some my favorite is green tea by Elizabeth Arden it is a cream and it hasn&#x27;t stained my white shirts that was a plus .Smells so good has a very light scent nothing over powering  the only difference I find between the two is the scent ,I like the green tea scent better but I like this Blue Grass also it does last along time on I know it gets me through at least 8 hrs who knows mybe it could for another hour. I sweat alot at the gym and so far this product hasn&#x27;t let me down I just ordered more so I think this deodorant is the one for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for quite some time.  I&#x27;m spoiled now and would not be able to go back to regular deodorant!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> Elizabeth Arden is my favorite brand from my 20&#x27;s. This is the best deodorant ever! My daugther has an ultra sensitive skin and Blue Grass works perfectly for her. You are not going to be disappointed with this amazing product. Also, it works very well for men.</li>
            <li> the way that the deodorant comes out is a bit odd because it sorta squirts out like its lotion. it smells good and not in an overwhelming way. so far so good!</li>
            <li> Blue Grass Scent is wonderful.  The Cream works well and look forward to buying and using the Elizabeth Arden Blue Grass line of products for years.  Makes me feel good and hopefully smell fresh.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for years and love it!  Won&#x27;t use anything else...can&#x27;t, because my skin is ultra sensitive.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  Many deodorants give me a rash, this one does not and it has a nice light smell.  I do not perspire heavily, so not sure if that would work for you if this is a problem you have.  But it nicely covers any odor.</li>
            <li> Smelled like shaving cream. Was not for me</li>
            <li> Smells nice and really controls both perspiration and odor.  Even though it&#x27;s just a deodorant, it still reduces perspiration, at least for me!</li>
            <li> Been using it for about 35 years &amp; now my daughter uses it too! Incredible product even though the price has gone thru the roof in that time!!!</li>
            <li> This deodorant works very well and has a pleasant scent.  I have tried numerous brands and this one is one of the best.  It controls both wetness and odor.</li>
            <li> I love Elizabeth Arden deodorants. I&#x27;ve bought 3 scents now: Blue Grass, Green Tea, and Eau Fraiche. Love them all! They glide on very smoothly, do not irritate my skin, and they really work!</li>
            <li> It really works! Before that deo i found just one really helpful, Kenzo women stick. But Kenzo closed this line, and i was forced to looking for other.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m satisfied to quality and neutral smell. I&#x27;ll buy it again (or the same with the flavor of the green tea).</li>
            <li> Fancy deodorant and affordable price&lt;br /&gt;Love it.</li>
            <li> I am a busy real estate agent in Florida and have used this for years. Hope they never stop making it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Elizabeth Arden Blue Grass deodorant for many years and it is by far the best on the market!  It&#x27;s subtle aroma is never overpowering, it goes on smoothly and NEVER leaves underarm garments stains! It&#x27;s the best for me!</li>
            <li> When I first tried a sample of this product, I was hooked and now 2 years later - only deodorant I have purchased.  It lasts and has a crisp clean scent.</li>
            <li> is an excellent product and i bought for a good price. I have used this product for a long time</li>
