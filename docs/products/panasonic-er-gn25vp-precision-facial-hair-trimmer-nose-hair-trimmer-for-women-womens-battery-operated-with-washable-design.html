            <li>This is a great product for helping women with those &#x27;mustache&#x27; hairs that we can&#x27;t seem to get rid of.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This does not beat tweezing, threading, waxing, shaving, or epilating, but it is great for a last-minute type situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This one fits great into a pen holder in a courier bag or in your glove box.</li>
            <li>but I am happy I bought it</li>
            <li>I use it to remove those unsightly \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; hairs and for that it works great.</li>
            <li>and it also did a great job on them.  </li>
            <li>These work great for eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Would make a great gift or stocking stuffer.</li>
            <li>It never pulls the hair and comes in an attractive case that looks like mascara.</li>

            <li>Works great.</li>
            <li>I love  it!!</li>
            <li>It works very nicely in each of these situations.</li>
            <li>I decided to buy this hair trimmer when I brought the Panasonic Beauty Heater Eyelash curler (which also works amazing!)</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; sleek!</li>
            <li>Most of the cheaper trimmers offer a 90 day warranty, at best.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to carry around and perfect for getting rid of unsightly hairs.</li>
            <li>Perfect, easy to use, works great, love it!</li>
            <li>For the money, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>Good product; ladylike.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m delighted I bought it.</li>
            <li>Have been using this once a week for about 18 months , am rather fair, so once weekly is sufficient.</li>
            <li>It also does a good job of getting rid of nose hair and trimming eyebrows.  </li>
            <li>Quality seems good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied</li>
            <li>Hence, I decided to look for a trimmer that was created exclusively for women and am glad I purchased a great brand like Panasonic....</li>
            <li>Over all I am very glad I bought this...</li>
            <li>Awesome product fast delivery!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Once its going, you are going to love it!.  </li>
            <li>Love it!~</li>
            <li>I am so glad I got this!  </li>
            <li>That is one thing I love because I don&#x27;t have to worry about removing hair that I did not want to remove !</li>
            <li>I gave this product 5 stars because its easy to use, pain free, and works great!</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li>Everyone said very good, worth buying.</li>
            <li>This works amazing.</li>
            <li>This is a great idea, in fabulous packaging, but it just doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li>Is doesn&#x27;t leave you real smooth</li>
            <li>Amazing tool, color and shape</li>
            <li>nice for the purse and traveling</li>
            <li>Does a nice job without pulling hair.</li>
            <li>Would be nice if it was rechargeable.</li>
            <li>would recommend that every woman buy this hair trimmer and keep it handy for emergencies.  </li>
            <li>It comes in a nice discreet package and it fits nicely into your pocketbook -</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that I also own the ER-GN30 [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O</li>
            <li>It has a 2 yr warranty which is nice and the color is girly</li>
            <li>To remove a stray hair, tidy up the edge of a haircut, etc.  </li>
            <li>It is effective on eyebrows, nose hairs, ear hair, stray hairs on the face and neck, or stray hair on your haircut.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li>It does a spectacular job on that.</li>
            <li>I mainly bought it to trim nose hair and for me it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li>And as a cherry on top - it&#x27;s a really nice color.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Quite happy with this product and hope it lasts for many years!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I liked it so much that I bought another as a gift!</li>
            <li>Don&#x60;t have much to write, except that this is lovely in appearance and feel, holds comfortably and well, and works perfectly, all as described.</li>
            <li>It was great for the first use.  </li>
            <li>very cheap-</li>
            <li>Easy to use, painless, nice for touch-up.</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>But for the money, I found it a cute way to keep maintenance up on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>One might find razor stubble acceptable (or even sexy) on a guy, but there is nothing acceptable about it on a woman&#x27;s face, chin, ears, or nose.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I do like the cute and sleek packaging, but I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it for brows.</li>
            <li>I guess there should be better product out there.</li>
            <li>LOVE</li>
            <li>I thought I might be able to use it as an eyebrow trimmer... not.</li>
            <li>Does the job I love it.</li>
            <li>I guess it works ok.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer fits nice and comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li>I can safely trim around my eyebrows without accidentally shaving them off.</li>
            <li>For me, this is perfect for removing a stray hair or two, but if you have a bigger job, then you might want a stronger tool.</li>
            <li>I really love this product and, hopefully</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>My husband and I each got Sharper Image trimmers many years ago --</li>
            <li>Love the size, shape, and color.</li>
            <li>It fits perfectly in my make-up bag and simply looks like a tube of mascara.</li>
            <li>Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li>It is wonderful for upper lip.</li>
            <li>nose is ok and</li>
            <li>spend some more money and get a better one.</li>
            <li>I love this item.  </li>
            <li>it is a safe tool and used with care</li>
            <li>and I could not have made a better purchase.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>sure what to get your friends for Christmas?</li>
            <li>I feel like have much better control.</li>
            <li>I do have to go over some places more than once, however.  </li>
            <li>This is the best such item I have ever used</li>
            <li>and I love it.</li>
            <li>I love the color and lid.</li>
            <li>It is able to get in the tip of the nose with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;UPDATE: LOVE USING ON THE EYEBROWS...</li>
            <li>Try it, you will love it too.</li>
            <li>This tool is a must:  clean, neat and you always know you can be confident all the time!  </li>
            <li>I love how it is very accessible as well.</li>
            <li>Works well, clean, no pull and tidy.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little trimmer and works great!  </li>
            <li>Very good for hairs on your upper lips and for the eyebrow area</li>
            <li>But, it sure does a great job, it is quiet, and yet reliable, you will be so glad you got it.</li>
            <li>I can get a much more precise angle and have not had any goof-ups and consequential over-corrections in the month I&#x27;ve been using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I was happy to discover this product and give trimmers another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to be clear</li>
            <li>I love that now I am able to remove hair any where and quickly.</li>
            <li>I think its best value is as a supplement to whatever other technique you use for hair removal - tweezing, shaving, or chemical.</li>
            <li>It also matches perfectly with the other two beauty tools.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The design to get the battery is easy too.</li>
            <li>Painless and easy &amp;#34;facial&amp;#34</li>
            <li>easy to install</li>
            <li>It has a good design that makes it easy to keep a steady grip.</li>
            <li>device is sleek and easy to use.</li>
            <li>so it is easy to carry/store.  </li>
            <li>Sleek easy to use item.</li>
            <li>it fits easily in my purse and it does the job</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easy to use,</li>
            <li>easy to control.  </li>
            <li>I never expected this hair trimmer to be so great.</li>
            <li>Trimmer did exactly what it was stated to do - perfect for removal of upper lip hair and also easy to shape ones eyebrows.</li>
            <li>Pretty casing, does the job best on nasal hairs, but facial, it&#x27;s ok for a quick trim.  </li>
            <li>It has been working just fine.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise and delight it works just fine.  </li>
            <li>piece of junk, does not trim fine hair,Iam not one for a lot of words</li>
            <li>Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>So happy to have found such a practical solution to hair in an unwanted place.</li>
            <li>Fantastic quality.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The tool is easy to take apart to clean and I have not had to replace the battery yet.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Easy to disasemble and clean.</li>
            <li>so I was happy to try the Panasonic Precision Facial Hair Trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It truly is pain-free and does a great job of getting rid of the hair that constantly grows on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li>this does not have a light.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The Panasonic Precision Facial Hair Trimmer does a great job.</li>
            <li>This trimmer will not give you a baby smooth shave, but I like that</li>
            <li>his was great (still is); mine always gave me what felt like tiny shocks</li>
            <li>I used it along my lip to capture any hairs and it did a FANTASTIC job.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my eyebrows only so it&#x27;s just great.</li>
            <li>But that is its primary value.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It cuts close to the skin for smooth results.&lt;br</li>
            <li>easy to clean.</li>
            <li>doesn&#x27;t stay on securely for trimming.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>works well for nose hair; good product thus far</li>
            <li>The Swing Head is a far superior model for removing fuzz and the stray hairs that do increase with age.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer is very small and discreet as well as being designed in a cute metalic fuchsia, so it hides perfectly in your purse and looks like a pen or a tube of make-up.</li>
            <li>This Panasonic ER-GN25VP works great for the nose and upper lip but it takes a lot more passes to do the whole face.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get it</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic tool for quick touch-ups on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li>This seems to happen more and more frequently.  </li>
            <li>Does not pull but cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li>A precise and quick tool is what is needed.  </li>
            <li>but it kept getting weaker and wouldn&#x27;t clean the hairs the way</li>
            <li>This ladies&#x27; trimmer runs on a single AAA battery and works great, just like the ER-GN30.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use, pretty, and can fit in your purse.</li>
            <li>Most ear trimmers are rather large and made to keep at home.</li>
            <li>some of this facial hair trimmer is good, works fairly well depending on what type of hair you are trying to remove, but I do think that other parts of it could have been made better than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Item great as expected.</li>
            <li>Pretty color too-not that that really matters, but it&#x27;s nice nonetheless.</li>
            <li>only good for lips and eyebows</li>
            <li>Good for eyebrows and upper lip and nose.</li>
            <li>It works good on the nose, however, does not cut well around the upper lip and chin.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t give a definite opinion since I have yet to give it a fair trial.</li>
            <li>This was quite true.</li>
            <li>I tried on facial hair, but did not think it was meant for that specifically as it did not do a good job on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li>honestly it doesn&#x27;t clear the hair as well as the  </li>
            <li>However the ER-GN25VP appears to be more durable, more reliable and works as well, and typically better than other trimmers of this type.</li>
            <li>Easy to use; works exactly as it promised.  </li>
            <li>It is comfortable to use and better than my old Remington that was good but finally gave out.  </li>
            <li>On the flip side, if you&#x27;re expecting a super close shave, that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re going to get.  </li>
            <li>BUT it is perfect for simple facial trimming.</li>
            <li>Longer, more coarse hair might take a pass or two more, but it will get them.</li>
            <li>The head detaches and may be rinsed under water and washed with mild soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you need something to carry around and quickly deal with hairs which you may have missed in routine grooming (or need nose hair trimming), this does well.</li>
            <li>It is quick and unlike tweezers, painless.</li>
            <li>This has worked great for me; just the thing I needed to get rid of the occasional overly prominent facial hair.  </li>
            <li>I bought this, first off its made of really cheap plastic.</li>
            <li>Its very pretty and no one would ever guess that its a hair remover.  </li>
            <li>A brush on cream does a more thorough job, but they are harsh, so this is the next best thing I think.</li>
            <li>have my brows done professionally, but I would use this for sure to clean up any wisps that are strays.  </li>
            <li>This is my first trimmer, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience nor am I able to have any comparisons.&lt;br /&gt;The battery protector[bottom]  comes off more easily than the top portion, which is becoming irritating.</li>
            <li>It works well and is so pretty!</li>
            <li>This is a great little cosmetic tool.  </li>
            <li>Extra fine hair also may take a bit more effort - you need to get at it from the correct angle.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very easy to use and the small size is nice for the face.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very efficient, smooth and compact.</li>
            <li>And the tip can be unscrewed and rinsed under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, because this trimmer is used straight on so it trims the area between my eyebrows smoothly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and free...</li>
            <li>The trimmer cuts very well and does leave your skin quite smooth.</li>
            <li>was hoping for it to be somewhat powerful.</li>
            <li>I used fresh batterys, went to flip it on</li>
            <li>I think the trade-off is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>There is also a skin guard that prevents the blade from touching sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Removes hair with ease and keeps things net and tidy.  </li>
            <li>; ....... What&#x27;s it worth to you?</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s effective as such.  </li>
            <li>However, it would be faster and just as effective to shave off facial hairs than to use this type of trimmer.</li>
            <li>For what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>They may laugh and you can all think of it as a joke, but believe me, they will use it.</li>
            <li>I recommend that if you purchase this, you should couple it with the Panasonic pivoting head facial hair trimmer, which cleanly and safely removes the peach fuzz -- as this product alone will not do a thorough job.</li>
            <li>I was deceived by all the good reviews, buyer beware: spend the extra money on a decent trimmer with a functional design.</li>
            <li>highly recommend this -- cleans up easily and is small and attractive to slip into overnight bag or purse.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll update this review if I encounter any problems over time, but right now I rate it &amp;#34;highly recommended&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>I scoured the internet for a hair trimmer and made the right selection.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean with the little brush it comes with, and it shows you that you can also remove the top part and rinse under water to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Usually Panasonic products have a great record, but I guess I got a dud.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking to zap a hair or two in small places (for example, just inside your nose), then this is a great tool.  </li>
            <li>Men - don&#x27;t read this - no one wants to know their wife or girlfriend might start finding a hair or two on her chin, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>It barely cuts the hairs and the blade inside wobbles around shaving the inside of the metal cap more than the hair</li>
            <li>Not loud, looks nice with</li>
            <li>However, given that this does not shave hair off at the surface it does do a nice job when it comes to trimming or shaping eyebrows and certainly beats my former alternative</li>
            <li>Very gentle but removes all the hair.</li>
            <li>Used for the first time last night and surprisingly it was very quiet and not painful AT ALL.</li>
            <li>This is a great little trimmer and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>such, it is designed nicely for bikini area trimming, which is my main use.  </li>
            <li>This is actually a very good feature if you don&#x27;t want to worry about irritating your skin.  </li>
            <li>B006JKY3X0 Veet High Precision Warm Facial Wax, 0.5 Ounce]] -- which didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li>I wanted a rotating blade, finally found it and am by satisfied.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s enough said, but I have to type more works to have the comment posted.</li>
            <li>I can use it for many ways to get rid of unwanted facial hair!!</li>
            <li>First off, this is NOT an epilator or a tweezer.  </li>
            <li>I love to keep this product in my purse for times like when I didn&#x27;t have time to thread or wax my eyebrows or upper lip.  </li>
            <li>Pretty color.</li>
            <li>Moroever, it tend to get hot easily.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>My advice, look elsewhere for a higher quality</li>
            <li>Works pretty well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Not intended to be put into liquid.</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li>First, like any hair removal product, hair must be like 1/4&amp;#34; (they state something like 3/16...</li>
            <li>I debated buying the NoNo hair remover but decided I couldn&#x27;t justify spending around $300, so it seemed a worthwhile gamble to purchase this trimmer (along with the Panasonic pivoting head facial hair remover - I will review separately).  </li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s best for very brief use on small patches; afterward, it also cools within moments.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Packaged in a slim, pretty case.</li>
            <li>B0009DT39C Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer, Pink]]And still use it I love it.</li>
            <li>This hair trimmer is discreet, it looks more like a longer lipstick from the outside.  </li>
            <li>First of all, you need a AAA battery to get this machine going.  </li>
            <li>Works really well on nose hair!</li>
            <li>upper lip also ok</li>
            <li>At first I thought, \\&quot;I could never do</li>
            <li>This facial hair trimmer is ON POINT with direction and is always precise !</li>
            <li>Does exactly what it claims</li>
            <li>I was starting to use tweezers, but I like this much better.</li>
            <li>It worked well the first couple times I used it</li>
            <li>No complaints whatsoever, I love the guard above the blade that prevents nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li>most recently the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I love how sleek and simple this is.  </li>
            <li>I would even say it carries an air of being discrete as well, no announcing you are trying to remove some unwanted hair at first glance.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>It is very easy to change the single AAA battery in this product.</li>
            <li>For another thing, the cut isn&#x27;t super short or smooth.  </li>
            <li>great small tool for trimming!</li>
            <li>will not completely remove hair to a smooth skin surface, but it will do a great job in a pinch when you do not have time to use a removal product that requires time to work and leave a mess in your aftermath.</li>
            <li>The tip gets warm -- not hot -- within moments</li>
            <li>The Panasonic ER-GN25VP Beauty Line Ladies Precision Facial Hair Trimmer is a powerful yet gentle rotary trimmer that allows you get fine hairs.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with it and would recommend it for the uses I&#x27;ve detailed above.</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t really know what it is at first glance.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t get too hot as I read in another review; it&#x27;ll get a little warm after using for a bit, but you can just turn it off, wait a minute, and then use it again.  </li>
            <li>The product is made in China, but seems to have the same high quality of most Panasonic products.</li>
            <li>Not that anyone needs to carry a facial hair trimmer in her purse, but you could easily toss it in there</li>
            <li>I love the hot pink color.  </li>
            <li>its compact shape, this is easy to use and manipulate at different angles.</li>
            <li>after I cleaned it the first time, it was difficult to put the top back on &amp; now my blade is not as great as when I first used it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use, fairly quiet, certainly portable.</li>
            <li>Most products i looked at were a single blade rather than rotating.</li>
            <li>The unit is about the size of a large pen and uses one AAA battery.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty quiet, only uses a AAA battery, easy to clean..</li>
            <li>This is going to lighten my load; moreover, I see clearly that it works better than my old rechargeable, even when that one was new.</li>
            <li>Only used twice and seems to work just fine for me.</li>
            <li>This is a handy little trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Fast response, fast shipping, high quality!</li>
            <li>It is a very surface trim.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s girly, pink and cute.</li>
            <li>I am also very like shape, color.</li>
            <li>It is not a shaver, so you don&#x27;t get a really close trim.  </li>
            <li>I have very conflicting feeling about this hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>It works very well.</li>
            <li>and this is a cute pink color that fits in with your make up.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;ve got quite a bit of hair to trim, then this isn&#x27;t really the tool for you.  </li>
            <li>and have appreciated its performance.  </li>
            <li>It does the job just fine...and at a much cheaper price than this ladies&#x27; version (which is why I&#x27;m deducting one star for this one)...</li>
            <li>and it bugs me the whole time I am gone.</li>
            <li>It works very well on longer hair, but does not work very well if you have shorter, coarser</li>
            <li>Since shipping for warranty service can cost as much as one of the cheapo trimmers, they are, in essence, disposable.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Bonus...in adorable pink.</li>
            <li>I noticed how much money I was spending pampering myself.</li>
            <li>It is very slim and portable and it looks like a pen that I can just throw in my purse.</li>
            <li>I bought this one for my mother-in-law at the request of my wife because my wife likes hers so much.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works really well on fine/medium  hair around the mouth/upper lip area.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that I would have to use it more frequently and that the hair would grow back faster</li>
            <li>Its small head (with tiny blades underneath) excellently (and absolutely painlessly) trims nasal hair and fine facial hair (e.g. upper lip).</li>
            <li>I have used Remington Steele in the past but wasn&#x27;t satisfied because the trimmer died out too quickly.</li>
            <li>Beyond that, it works well when you first put a new battery in</li>
            <li>If your concern is the visibility of facial hair, then this is probably good enough, especially since this is portable, painless, and not terribly expensive.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to clean the facial areas on your face!</li>
            <li>Love the pink case!</li>
            <li>/replace the single AAA battery, easy on/off to use, easy to clean (requires minor disassembly; a tiny cleaning brush is included).</li>
            <li>This facial hair trimmer is a great tool for small jobs.  </li>
            <li>Clean up is simple, just take the cutter out and rinse it</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty--almost like a long lipstick tube, and looks fine on the dresser.  </li>
            <li>This is a cool little contraption and can get most nose hair pretty short without pain/tickle.</li>
            <li>Beauty Line Ladies Precision Facial Hair Trimmer is a great trimmer, gentle enough for the ladies but strong enough to cut mens&#x27; coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li>However the ER-GN25VP appears to be more durable, more reliable and works as well, and typically better than other trimmers of this type.like the ER-GN25VP, and many are less expensive.  </li>
            <li>I had had a smaller version of the shaver that did a pretty good job of cutting longer hair, but this one is much better.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Unlike other facial trimmers in the market, this one is very discreet and comes in a nice case.</li>
            <li>Keep it sexy, sleek and discreet by silver or black - not fuchsia.</li>
            <li>face hair, it more or less does the job.</li>
            <li>If you are an older woman, get your magnifying mirror and take a look.</li>
            <li>you use it regularly (every few days, or as needed) rather than wait till there&#x27;s a lot to remove, it&#x27;ll go more quickly.</li>
            <li>This is a cute little shaver to carry with you anywhere.  </li>
            <li>This model works MUCH better (trims much closer and without repeated passes over the area with no discomfort or  mild abrading) than the other similar products I have tried of the $10.00 variety purchased at big box store.</li>
            <li>The only obvious difference is that this trimmer has a bright pink</li>
            <li>Inexpensive was good, but results are poor.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as effective for the upper lip area as traditional trimmers with the flat edge.  </li>
            <li>This little trimmer is small, handy, light, discreet and works.</li>
            <li>The tip gets a little warm after continuous trimming, but not enough to \\&quot;burn\\</li>
            <li>Hopefully because it is just new</li>
            <li>Mainly, I think this would be good for someone who needs very focused trimming over small areas or over facial contours (such as eyebrows) or who needs to do touch ups.</li>
            <li>This is only my second such trimmer, so I&#x27;m not as experienced as some of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I wanted to groom unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li>I ordered the Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Precision Facial Hair Trimmer because I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the Panasonic Swing Head facial hair trimmer that I currently use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to trim the very short end of your hair, but clean enough</li>
            <li>and/or a quicky if less time is available.</li>
            <li>Also the motor gets hot so fast like in 30 sec.</li>
            <li>a woman of a certain age I&#x27;ve started getting unwanted facial hair</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a trimmer -- not a tweezer/epilator (it trims to skin-surface depth, not root depth) and not a razor (it doesn&#x27;t work well on coarse facial/eyebrow hair or large areas).</li>
            <li>In one review it stated the person stated she used it to get the clear colored hairs under eyebrow and also between the brows.  </li>
            <li>Had a Remington comb type that completely fell apart where the motor area was.</li>
            <li>This is not a heavy duty trimmer</li>
            <li>I was a bit surprised at the shaver head which doesn&#x27;t look at all like a shaving blade and a bit apprehensive about how it works.  </li>
            <li>My house tends to be dimly lit</li>
            <li>For one thing, the cutting mechanism gets pretty hot if you use it more than about 30 seconds in a row.  </li>
            <li>This is by far the gentlest trimmer I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>After my initial testing, I turned the unit over to my wife and she loves it for the ease of use and gentle trimming.</li>
            <li>It moves delicately near the skin and doesn&#x27;t cause discomfort when trimming hair.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it very often, but I think I would prefer a different type of blade.</li>
            <li>Please do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not loud at all, but makes a funny clicking noise when it clips a hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like the facial hair trimmer -</li>
            <li>Just received it and so far it exceeds my expectancy.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quiet and discrete while still being powerful enough to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li>I am sorry that I didn&#x27;t use it more right away so that I could have returned it.  </li>
            <li>This is very annoying when you want more precise work, like shaping the brows.&lt;br /&gt;For nose hair, this trimmer makes it so easy.</li>
            <li>Although this trimmer works it is not as functional as the older Panasonic facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li>would definitely recommend this product for eyebrow control in particular.</li>
            <li>which I do not want to do since shaving usually would grow back quickly and leave more stubble than previously.  </li>
            <li>but this trimmer is so pretty that you just might want to pay the extra money to indulge your inner girly-girl!  </li>
            <li>Panasonic ER-GN25VP, on the other hand, while it costs around $20-$25, is better made than any other trimmer of this sort I have used.  </li>
            <li>Rotary cutters spin within a perforated metal cone that is small enough to insert safely into the ear or nose.</li>
            <li>This is great for shaping eyebrows, but makes shaving the upper lip just a little slow going.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is precise, working on a small area at a time.  </li>
            <li>The convenience, cleanliness and fast work makes it a necessary part of personal care.  </li>
            <li>So it&#x27;s a major battery eater.</li>
            <li>I found lots of use for this powerful little trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that I was using it for the whole 30 sec, it&#x27;s just that I turned it on, check my skin, taking my time.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li>When offered this through Amazon&#x27;s Vine Program, I wanted to try it, to see if it was any different from other facial hair trimmers, because the tip of it looked different from the other kind of facial hair trimmers, the ones with the comb looking tip.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a little bigger than I expected (size of a pen) but works great and is small enough to keep in your cosmetic or travel bag.</li>
            <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the hot pink color which is obviously aimed at ladies.</li>
            <li>For facial hair, if it is that long, it&#x27;s good, any shorter than that, useless.</li>
            <li>I have VERY sensitive skin, and it has never left any red marks or scratched my skin or left scabs or anything.  </li>
            <li>It makes quick work of all those annoying little hairs and is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li>Small enough to slip into your bag or toss in a suitcase for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been using the trimmer for long, but so far I&#x27;m fully-satisfied with the purchased.</li>
            <li>That said, I knew what I wanted this to do - trim those extra fine eyebrow hairs that are hard to tweeze, upper lip hair and stray facial hair.</li>
            <li>Delivery was far too long however.</li>
            <li>I used 3 fresh batteries in a row (since it only needs one) to get this thing to work and the motor is just so sensitive and slow.</li>
            <li>this thing is worth about 10.00 dollars no more way over priced.</li>
            <li>Not only is the body vivid pink, but this comes with a matching vivid pink cover so that the whole thing simply looks like a big, long lipstick.  </li>
            <li>It really cuts the longer hair on my face down to the skin.  </li>
            <li>the head will turn a little bit hot when you use only couple of minutes....</li>
            <li>no name brands we use, while very inexpensive, tend to fail quickly.  </li>
            <li>Where the ER-GN30 is angled and bulkier, this little beauty is straight and slim.  </li>
            <li>Really like this little device to remove the facial hair.  </li>
            <li>Item works perfectly at getting those little annoying hairs.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> /&gt;This does not beat tweezing, threading, waxing, shaving, or epilating, but it is great for a last-minute type situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

            <li> Nice &amp; sleek!</li>
            <li> Most of the cheaper trimmers offer a 90 day warranty, at best.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to carry around and perfect for getting rid of unsightly hairs.</li>
            <li> Perfect, easy to use, works great, love it!</li>
            <li> For the money, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> Good product; ladylike.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m delighted I bought it.</li>
            <li> Have been using this once a week for about 18 months , am rather fair, so once weekly is sufficient.</li>
            <li> It also does a good job of getting rid of nose hair and trimming eyebrows.  </li>
            <li> Quality seems good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> Hence, I decided to look for a trimmer that was created exclusively for women and am glad I purchased a great brand like Panasonic....</li>
            <li> Over all I am very glad I bought this...</li>
            <li> Awesome product fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> Once its going, you are going to love it!.  </li>
            <li> Love it!~</li>
            <li> I am so glad I got this!  </li>
            <li> That is one thing I love because I don&#x27;t have to worry about removing hair that I did not want to remove !</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because its easy to use, pain free, and works great!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very handy and easy to use.</li>
            <li> Everyone said very good, worth buying.</li>
            <li> This works amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, in fabulous packaging, but it just doesn&#x27;t work well.</li>
            <li> Is doesn&#x27;t leave you real smooth</li>
            <li> Amazing tool, color and shape</li>
            <li> nice for the purse and traveling</li>
            <li> Does a nice job without pulling hair.</li>
            <li> Would be nice if it was rechargeable.</li>
            <li> would recommend that every woman buy this hair trimmer and keep it handy for emergencies.  </li>
            <li> It comes in a nice discreet package and it fits nicely into your pocketbook -</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that I also own the ER-GN30 [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O</li>
            <li> It has a 2 yr warranty which is nice and the color is girly</li>
            <li> To remove a stray hair, tidy up the edge of a haircut, etc.  </li>
            <li> It is effective on eyebrows, nose hairs, ear hair, stray hairs on the face and neck, or stray hair on your haircut.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It does a spectacular job on that.</li>
            <li> I mainly bought it to trim nose hair and for me it is wonderful.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> And as a cherry on top - it&#x27;s a really nice color.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Quite happy with this product and hope it lasts for many years!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I liked it so much that I bought another as a gift!</li>
            <li> Don&#x60;t have much to write, except that this is lovely in appearance and feel, holds comfortably and well, and works perfectly, all as described.</li>
            <li> It was great for the first use.  </li>
            <li> very cheap-</li>
            <li> Easy to use, painless, nice for touch-up.</li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> But for the money, I found it a cute way to keep maintenance up on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> One might find razor stubble acceptable (or even sexy) on a guy, but there is nothing acceptable about it on a woman&#x27;s face, chin, ears, or nose.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I do like the cute and sleek packaging, but I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it for brows.</li>
            <li> I guess there should be better product out there.</li>
            <li> LOVE</li>
            <li> I thought I might be able to use it as an eyebrow trimmer... not.</li>
            <li> Does the job I love it.</li>
            <li> I guess it works ok.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer fits nice and comfortably in my hand.  </li>
            <li> I can safely trim around my eyebrows without accidentally shaving them off.</li>
            <li> For me, this is perfect for removing a stray hair or two, but if you have a bigger job, then you might want a stronger tool.</li>
            <li> I really love this product and, hopefully</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I each got Sharper Image trimmers many years ago --</li>
            <li> Love the size, shape, and color.</li>
            <li> It fits perfectly in my make-up bag and simply looks like a tube of mascara.</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li> It is wonderful for upper lip.</li>
            <li> nose is ok and</li>
            <li> spend some more money and get a better one.</li>
            <li> I love this item.  </li>
            <li> it is a safe tool and used with care</li>
            <li> and I could not have made a better purchase.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> sure what to get your friends for Christmas?</li>
            <li> I feel like have much better control.</li>
            <li> I do have to go over some places more than once, however.  </li>
            <li> This is the best such item I have ever used</li>
            <li> and I love it.</li>
            <li> I love the color and lid.</li>
            <li> It is able to get in the tip of the nose with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: LOVE USING ON THE EYEBROWS...</li>
            <li> Try it, you will love it too.</li>
            <li> This tool is a must:  clean, neat and you always know you can be confident all the time!  </li>
            <li> I love how it is very accessible as well.</li>
            <li> Works well, clean, no pull and tidy.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little trimmer and works great!  </li>
            <li> Very good for hairs on your upper lips and for the eyebrow area</li>
            <li> But, it sure does a great job, it is quiet, and yet reliable, you will be so glad you got it.</li>
            <li> I can get a much more precise angle and have not had any goof-ups and consequential over-corrections in the month I&#x27;ve been using this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I was happy to discover this product and give trimmers another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to be clear</li>
            <li> I love that now I am able to remove hair any where and quickly.</li>
            <li> I think its best value is as a supplement to whatever other technique you use for hair removal - tweezing, shaving, or chemical.</li>
            <li> It also matches perfectly with the other two beauty tools.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The design to get the battery is easy too.</li>
            <li> Painless and easy &amp;#34;facial&amp;#34</li>
            <li> easy to install</li>
            <li> It has a good design that makes it easy to keep a steady grip.</li>
            <li> device is sleek and easy to use.</li>
            <li> so it is easy to carry/store.  </li>
            <li> Sleek easy to use item.</li>
            <li> it fits easily in my purse and it does the job</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easy to use,</li>
            <li> easy to control.  </li>
            <li> I never expected this hair trimmer to be so great.</li>
            <li> Trimmer did exactly what it was stated to do - perfect for removal of upper lip hair and also easy to shape ones eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Pretty casing, does the job best on nasal hairs, but facial, it&#x27;s ok for a quick trim.  </li>
            <li> It has been working just fine.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise and delight it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> piece of junk, does not trim fine hair,Iam not one for a lot of words</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> So happy to have found such a practical solution to hair in an unwanted place.</li>
            <li> Fantastic quality.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The tool is easy to take apart to clean and I have not had to replace the battery yet.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Easy to disasemble and clean.</li>
            <li> so I was happy to try the Panasonic Precision Facial Hair Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It truly is pain-free and does a great job of getting rid of the hair that constantly grows on my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> this does not have a light.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The Panasonic Precision Facial Hair Trimmer does a great job.</li>
            <li> This trimmer will not give you a baby smooth shave, but I like that</li>
            <li> his was great (still is); mine always gave me what felt like tiny shocks</li>
            <li> I used it along my lip to capture any hairs and it did a FANTASTIC job.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my eyebrows only so it&#x27;s just great.</li>
            <li> But that is its primary value.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It cuts close to the skin for smooth results.&lt;br</li>
            <li> easy to clean.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t stay on securely for trimming.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> works well for nose hair; good product thus far</li>
            <li> The Swing Head is a far superior model for removing fuzz and the stray hairs that do increase with age.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very small and discreet as well as being designed in a cute metalic fuchsia, so it hides perfectly in your purse and looks like a pen or a tube of make-up.</li>
            <li> This Panasonic ER-GN25VP works great for the nose and upper lip but it takes a lot more passes to do the whole face.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get it</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic tool for quick touch-ups on the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> This seems to happen more and more frequently.  </li>
            <li> Does not pull but cuts cleanly.</li>
            <li> A precise and quick tool is what is needed.  </li>
            <li> but it kept getting weaker and wouldn&#x27;t clean the hairs the way</li>
            <li> This ladies&#x27; trimmer runs on a single AAA battery and works great, just like the ER-GN30.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use, pretty, and can fit in your purse.</li>
            <li> Most ear trimmers are rather large and made to keep at home.</li>
            <li> some of this facial hair trimmer is good, works fairly well depending on what type of hair you are trying to remove, but I do think that other parts of it could have been made better than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Item great as expected.</li>
            <li> Pretty color too-not that that really matters, but it&#x27;s nice nonetheless.</li>
            <li> only good for lips and eyebows</li>
            <li> Good for eyebrows and upper lip and nose.</li>
            <li> It works good on the nose, however, does not cut well around the upper lip and chin.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t give a definite opinion since I have yet to give it a fair trial.</li>
            <li> This was quite true.</li>
            <li> I tried on facial hair, but did not think it was meant for that specifically as it did not do a good job on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li> honestly it doesn&#x27;t clear the hair as well as the  </li>
            <li> However the ER-GN25VP appears to be more durable, more reliable and works as well, and typically better than other trimmers of this type.</li>
            <li> Easy to use; works exactly as it promised.  </li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use and better than my old Remington that was good but finally gave out.  </li>
            <li> On the flip side, if you&#x27;re expecting a super close shave, that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re going to get.  </li>
            <li> BUT it is perfect for simple facial trimming.</li>
            <li> Longer, more coarse hair might take a pass or two more, but it will get them.</li>
            <li> The head detaches and may be rinsed under water and washed with mild soap.&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you need something to carry around and quickly deal with hairs which you may have missed in routine grooming (or need nose hair trimming), this does well.</li>
            <li> It is quick and unlike tweezers, painless.</li>
            <li> This has worked great for me; just the thing I needed to get rid of the occasional overly prominent facial hair.  </li>
            <li> I bought this, first off its made of really cheap plastic.</li>
            <li> Its very pretty and no one would ever guess that its a hair remover.  </li>
            <li> A brush on cream does a more thorough job, but they are harsh, so this is the next best thing I think.</li>
            <li> have my brows done professionally, but I would use this for sure to clean up any wisps that are strays.  </li>
            <li> This is my first trimmer, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience nor am I able to have any comparisons.&lt;br /&gt;The battery protector[bottom]  comes off more easily than the top portion, which is becoming irritating.</li>
            <li> It works well and is so pretty!</li>
            <li> This is a great little cosmetic tool.  </li>
            <li> Extra fine hair also may take a bit more effort - you need to get at it from the correct angle.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very easy to use and the small size is nice for the face.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very efficient, smooth and compact.</li>
            <li> And the tip can be unscrewed and rinsed under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, because this trimmer is used straight on so it trims the area between my eyebrows smoothly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and free...</li>
            <li> The trimmer cuts very well and does leave your skin quite smooth.</li>
            <li> was hoping for it to be somewhat powerful.</li>
            <li> I used fresh batterys, went to flip it on</li>
            <li> I think the trade-off is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is also a skin guard that prevents the blade from touching sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Removes hair with ease and keeps things net and tidy.  </li>
            <li> ; ....... What&#x27;s it worth to you?</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s effective as such.  </li>
            <li> However, it would be faster and just as effective to shave off facial hairs than to use this type of trimmer.</li>
            <li> For what it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> They may laugh and you can all think of it as a joke, but believe me, they will use it.</li>
            <li> I recommend that if you purchase this, you should couple it with the Panasonic pivoting head facial hair trimmer, which cleanly and safely removes the peach fuzz -- as this product alone will not do a thorough job.</li>
            <li> I was deceived by all the good reviews, buyer beware: spend the extra money on a decent trimmer with a functional design.</li>
            <li> highly recommend this -- cleans up easily and is small and attractive to slip into overnight bag or purse.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll update this review if I encounter any problems over time, but right now I rate it &amp;#34;highly recommended&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I scoured the internet for a hair trimmer and made the right selection.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean with the little brush it comes with, and it shows you that you can also remove the top part and rinse under water to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Usually Panasonic products have a great record, but I guess I got a dud.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to zap a hair or two in small places (for example, just inside your nose), then this is a great tool.  </li>
            <li> Men - don&#x27;t read this - no one wants to know their wife or girlfriend might start finding a hair or two on her chin, but it&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> It barely cuts the hairs and the blade inside wobbles around shaving the inside of the metal cap more than the hair</li>
            <li> Not loud, looks nice with</li>
            <li> However, given that this does not shave hair off at the surface it does do a nice job when it comes to trimming or shaping eyebrows and certainly beats my former alternative</li>
            <li> Very gentle but removes all the hair.</li>
            <li> Used for the first time last night and surprisingly it was very quiet and not painful AT ALL.</li>
            <li> This is a great little trimmer and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> such, it is designed nicely for bikini area trimming, which is my main use.  </li>
            <li> This is actually a very good feature if you don&#x27;t want to worry about irritating your skin.  </li>
            <li> B006JKY3X0 Veet High Precision Warm Facial Wax, 0.5 Ounce]] -- which didn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
            <li> I wanted a rotating blade, finally found it and am by satisfied.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s enough said, but I have to type more works to have the comment posted.</li>
            <li> I can use it for many ways to get rid of unwanted facial hair!!</li>
            <li> First off, this is NOT an epilator or a tweezer.  </li>
            <li> I love to keep this product in my purse for times like when I didn&#x27;t have time to thread or wax my eyebrows or upper lip.  </li>
            <li> Pretty color.</li>
            <li> Moroever, it tend to get hot easily.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> My advice, look elsewhere for a higher quality</li>
            <li> Works pretty well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Not intended to be put into liquid.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to do.</li>
            <li> First, like any hair removal product, hair must be like 1/4&amp;#34; (they state something like 3/16...</li>
            <li> I debated buying the NoNo hair remover but decided I couldn&#x27;t justify spending around $300, so it seemed a worthwhile gamble to purchase this trimmer (along with the Panasonic pivoting head facial hair remover - I will review separately).  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s best for very brief use on small patches; afterward, it also cools within moments.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Packaged in a slim, pretty case.</li>
            <li> B0009DT39C Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer, Pink]]And still use it I love it.</li>
            <li> This hair trimmer is discreet, it looks more like a longer lipstick from the outside.  </li>
            <li> First of all, you need a AAA battery to get this machine going.  </li>
            <li> Works really well on nose hair!</li>
            <li> upper lip also ok</li>
            <li> At first I thought, \\&quot;I could never do</li>
            <li> This facial hair trimmer is ON POINT with direction and is always precise !</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims</li>
            <li> I was starting to use tweezers, but I like this much better.</li>
            <li> It worked well the first couple times I used it</li>
            <li> No complaints whatsoever, I love the guard above the blade that prevents nicks and cuts.  </li>
            <li> most recently the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I love how sleek and simple this is.  </li>
            <li> I would even say it carries an air of being discrete as well, no announcing you are trying to remove some unwanted hair at first glance.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> It is very easy to change the single AAA battery in this product.</li>
            <li> For another thing, the cut isn&#x27;t super short or smooth.  </li>
            <li> great small tool for trimming!</li>
            <li> will not completely remove hair to a smooth skin surface, but it will do a great job in a pinch when you do not have time to use a removal product that requires time to work and leave a mess in your aftermath.</li>
            <li> The tip gets warm -- not hot -- within moments</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN25VP Beauty Line Ladies Precision Facial Hair Trimmer is a powerful yet gentle rotary trimmer that allows you get fine hairs.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with it and would recommend it for the uses I&#x27;ve detailed above.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t really know what it is at first glance.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get too hot as I read in another review; it&#x27;ll get a little warm after using for a bit, but you can just turn it off, wait a minute, and then use it again.  </li>
            <li> The product is made in China, but seems to have the same high quality of most Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> Not that anyone needs to carry a facial hair trimmer in her purse, but you could easily toss it in there</li>
            <li> I love the hot pink color.  </li>
            <li> its compact shape, this is easy to use and manipulate at different angles.</li>
            <li> after I cleaned it the first time, it was difficult to put the top back on &amp; now my blade is not as great as when I first used it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, fairly quiet, certainly portable.</li>
            <li> Most products i looked at were a single blade rather than rotating.</li>
            <li> The unit is about the size of a large pen and uses one AAA battery.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty quiet, only uses a AAA battery, easy to clean..</li>
            <li> This is going to lighten my load; moreover, I see clearly that it works better than my old rechargeable, even when that one was new.</li>
            <li> Only used twice and seems to work just fine for me.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Fast response, fast shipping, high quality!</li>
            <li> It is a very surface trim.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s girly, pink and cute.</li>
            <li> I am also very like shape, color.</li>
            <li> It is not a shaver, so you don&#x27;t get a really close trim.  </li>
            <li> I have very conflicting feeling about this hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> It works very well.</li>
            <li> and this is a cute pink color that fits in with your make up.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;ve got quite a bit of hair to trim, then this isn&#x27;t really the tool for you.  </li>
            <li> and have appreciated its performance.  </li>
            <li> It does the job just fine...and at a much cheaper price than this ladies&#x27; version (which is why I&#x27;m deducting one star for this one)...</li>
            <li> and it bugs me the whole time I am gone.</li>
            <li> It works very well on longer hair, but does not work very well if you have shorter, coarser</li>
            <li> Since shipping for warranty service can cost as much as one of the cheapo trimmers, they are, in essence, disposable.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bonus...in adorable pink.</li>
            <li> I noticed how much money I was spending pampering myself.</li>
            <li> It is very slim and portable and it looks like a pen that I can just throw in my purse.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my mother-in-law at the request of my wife because my wife likes hers so much.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works really well on fine/medium  hair around the mouth/upper lip area.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that I would have to use it more frequently and that the hair would grow back faster</li>
            <li> Its small head (with tiny blades underneath) excellently (and absolutely painlessly) trims nasal hair and fine facial hair (e.g. upper lip).</li>
            <li> I have used Remington Steele in the past but wasn&#x27;t satisfied because the trimmer died out too quickly.</li>
            <li> Beyond that, it works well when you first put a new battery in</li>
            <li> If your concern is the visibility of facial hair, then this is probably good enough, especially since this is portable, painless, and not terribly expensive.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to clean the facial areas on your face!</li>
            <li> Love the pink case!</li>
            <li> /replace the single AAA battery, easy on/off to use, easy to clean (requires minor disassembly; a tiny cleaning brush is included).</li>
            <li> This facial hair trimmer is a great tool for small jobs.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is simple, just take the cutter out and rinse it</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty--almost like a long lipstick tube, and looks fine on the dresser.  </li>
            <li> This is a cool little contraption and can get most nose hair pretty short without pain/tickle.</li>
            <li> Beauty Line Ladies Precision Facial Hair Trimmer is a great trimmer, gentle enough for the ladies but strong enough to cut mens&#x27; coarse facial hair.</li>
            <li> However the ER-GN25VP appears to be more durable, more reliable and works as well, and typically better than other trimmers of this type.like the ER-GN25VP, and many are less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I had had a smaller version of the shaver that did a pretty good job of cutting longer hair, but this one is much better.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Unlike other facial trimmers in the market, this one is very discreet and comes in a nice case.</li>
            <li> Keep it sexy, sleek and discreet by silver or black - not fuchsia.</li>
            <li> face hair, it more or less does the job.</li>
            <li> If you are an older woman, get your magnifying mirror and take a look.</li>
            <li> you use it regularly (every few days, or as needed) rather than wait till there&#x27;s a lot to remove, it&#x27;ll go more quickly.</li>
            <li> This is a cute little shaver to carry with you anywhere.  </li>
            <li> This model works MUCH better (trims much closer and without repeated passes over the area with no discomfort or  mild abrading) than the other similar products I have tried of the $10.00 variety purchased at big box store.</li>
            <li> The only obvious difference is that this trimmer has a bright pink</li>
            <li> Inexpensive was good, but results are poor.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as effective for the upper lip area as traditional trimmers with the flat edge.  </li>
            <li> This little trimmer is small, handy, light, discreet and works.</li>
            <li> The tip gets a little warm after continuous trimming, but not enough to \\&quot;burn\\</li>
            <li> Hopefully because it is just new</li>
            <li> Mainly, I think this would be good for someone who needs very focused trimming over small areas or over facial contours (such as eyebrows) or who needs to do touch ups.</li>
            <li> This is only my second such trimmer, so I&#x27;m not as experienced as some of the other reviewers.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted to groom unwanted facial hair.</li>
            <li> I ordered the Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Precision Facial Hair Trimmer because I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the Panasonic Swing Head facial hair trimmer that I currently use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to trim the very short end of your hair, but clean enough</li>
            <li> and/or a quicky if less time is available.</li>
            <li> Also the motor gets hot so fast like in 30 sec.</li>
            <li> a woman of a certain age I&#x27;ve started getting unwanted facial hair</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a trimmer -- not a tweezer/epilator (it trims to skin-surface depth, not root depth) and not a razor (it doesn&#x27;t work well on coarse facial/eyebrow hair or large areas).</li>
            <li> In one review it stated the person stated she used it to get the clear colored hairs under eyebrow and also between the brows.  </li>
            <li> Had a Remington comb type that completely fell apart where the motor area was.</li>
            <li> This is not a heavy duty trimmer</li>
            <li> I was a bit surprised at the shaver head which doesn&#x27;t look at all like a shaving blade and a bit apprehensive about how it works.  </li>
            <li> My house tends to be dimly lit</li>
            <li> For one thing, the cutting mechanism gets pretty hot if you use it more than about 30 seconds in a row.  </li>
            <li> This is by far the gentlest trimmer I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> After my initial testing, I turned the unit over to my wife and she loves it for the ease of use and gentle trimming.</li>
            <li> It moves delicately near the skin and doesn&#x27;t cause discomfort when trimming hair.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it very often, but I think I would prefer a different type of blade.</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not loud at all, but makes a funny clicking noise when it clips a hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like the facial hair trimmer -</li>
            <li> Just received it and so far it exceeds my expectancy.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quiet and discrete while still being powerful enough to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> I am sorry that I didn&#x27;t use it more right away so that I could have returned it.  </li>
            <li> This is very annoying when you want more precise work, like shaping the brows.&lt;br /&gt;For nose hair, this trimmer makes it so easy.</li>
            <li> Although this trimmer works it is not as functional as the older Panasonic facial hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> would definitely recommend this product for eyebrow control in particular.</li>
            <li> which I do not want to do since shaving usually would grow back quickly and leave more stubble than previously.  </li>
            <li> but this trimmer is so pretty that you just might want to pay the extra money to indulge your inner girly-girl!  </li>
            <li> Panasonic ER-GN25VP, on the other hand, while it costs around $20-$25, is better made than any other trimmer of this sort I have used.  </li>
            <li> Rotary cutters spin within a perforated metal cone that is small enough to insert safely into the ear or nose.</li>
            <li> This is great for shaping eyebrows, but makes shaving the upper lip just a little slow going.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is precise, working on a small area at a time.  </li>
            <li> The convenience, cleanliness and fast work makes it a necessary part of personal care.  </li>
            <li> So it&#x27;s a major battery eater.</li>
            <li> I found lots of use for this powerful little trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that I was using it for the whole 30 sec, it&#x27;s just that I turned it on, check my skin, taking my time.&lt;br /&gt;For</li>
            <li> When offered this through Amazon&#x27;s Vine Program, I wanted to try it, to see if it was any different from other facial hair trimmers, because the tip of it looked different from the other kind of facial hair trimmers, the ones with the comb looking tip.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a little bigger than I expected (size of a pen) but works great and is small enough to keep in your cosmetic or travel bag.</li>
            <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the hot pink color which is obviously aimed at ladies.</li>
            <li> For facial hair, if it is that long, it&#x27;s good, any shorter than that, useless.</li>
            <li> I have VERY sensitive skin, and it has never left any red marks or scratched my skin or left scabs or anything.  </li>
            <li> It makes quick work of all those annoying little hairs and is so easy to clean.</li>
            <li> Small enough to slip into your bag or toss in a suitcase for quick touch ups.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the trimmer for long, but so far I&#x27;m fully-satisfied with the purchased.</li>
            <li> That said, I knew what I wanted this to do - trim those extra fine eyebrow hairs that are hard to tweeze, upper lip hair and stray facial hair.</li>
            <li> Delivery was far too long however.</li>
            <li> I used 3 fresh batteries in a row (since it only needs one) to get this thing to work and the motor is just so sensitive and slow.</li>
            <li> this thing is worth about 10.00 dollars no more way over priced.</li>
            <li> Not only is the body vivid pink, but this comes with a matching vivid pink cover so that the whole thing simply looks like a big, long lipstick.  </li>
            <li> It really cuts the longer hair on my face down to the skin.  </li>
            <li> the head will turn a little bit hot when you use only couple of minutes....</li>
            <li> no name brands we use, while very inexpensive, tend to fail quickly.  </li>
            <li> Where the ER-GN30 is angled and bulkier, this little beauty is straight and slim.  </li>
            <li> Really like this little device to remove the facial hair.  </li>
            <li> Item works perfectly at getting those little annoying hairs.  </li>
            <li> The other unit has a wide trimming edge so you are done fast.</li>
            <li> Mainly use this on my chin but have used it on my eyebrows a little as well.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that mine starts to get hot after about a minute of use..</li>
            <li> hair trimmer is small in size, making it very convenient</li>
            <li> You have to admit at some time that there are long white hairs coming out of your nose, Ladies.  </li>
            <li> One battery seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> I had used the area below my eyebrow, it &amp;#34;prick&amp;#34; and left a minor cut on the skin..</li>
            <li> I wonder how long it will last.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend it for anyone who has unwanted long hairs growing on their face.</li>
            <li> what I read along with the facial hair trimmer, you were supposed to get a cleaning brush, which mine did not come with one which is minor, but I thought I should point that out to anyone who might also be ordering this product, whether it will include the cleaning brush they say should come in the packaging or</li>
            <li> Only gripe is when companies gender type with pink - such not a fan of the color.</li>
            <li> For its limited uses (nose, lip), I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t take long before it&#x27;s dying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s intended to trim, not completely remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> long for it to work.</li>
            <li> I occasionally use it for my eye brows as well, but please be careful because I accidentally nicked myself while doing this once.</li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, so this device did not get hot enough to work</li>
            <li> The new unit will not take out a coarse hair, at least not mine.</li>
            <li> (I realize now it must have been tiny cuts, perhaps from a slightly misaligned blade), and I long-ago migrated back to using blunt-tip beauty scissors.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There are numerous other products like the ER-GN25VP, and many are less expensive.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other cheaper trimmers, but this is what a personal trimmer is supposed to be.  </li>
            <li> I do agree with other reviewers that is does not pull the hair out on a deep level at all.  </li>
            <li> Trims hair around a facial mole as well as other areas that a shaver type could not.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;longer is as sharp as when initially puchased, and needs to be replaced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also relatively quiet so you can use it discreetly even when other people are around.  </li>
            <li> I gave this away as a present along with 2 other Panasonic ladies&#x27; products.</li>
            <li> Having said that, the battery life is very long on AAA&#x27; s.</li>
            <li> It also does not leave your skin dry or ashy.  </li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know why sometimes I get a bit of wound in my nose, which is not  a new thing.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There is a 2 year limited warranty on this, and a 30 day quality satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li> It runs on a single AAA battery.  </li>
            <li> manual says the ER-GN25VP will run up to a year on a single battery.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This trimmer will appeal to the person who wants to trim their nose or ear hair and/or prefers cutting their facial or body hair rather than removing it completely with tweezers, depilatory or epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> nose hair partially removed and long operating process</li>
            <li> , the price will come down a bit from the current $25 range.  </li>
            <li> I used to travel with a rechargeable trimmer (the only other option was travelling with none!)</li>
            <li> Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]]</li>
            <li> Neither part is in there tightly, so I would not recommend that you use this facial hair trimmer over your bathroom sink, or some place like that, because if you open the head of the trimmer the smaller black pieces can go down the drain.  </li>
            <li> We will see how long it lasts and stays sharp.</li>
            <li> It does the job for the embarrassing nose hairs as well as the upper lip and even the little hairs around the eyebrows.</li>
            <li> i perfer the pink sharper....</li>
            <li> Be careful -</li>
            <li> u use it again and again and again but hair remains partially removed.</li>
            <li> For finer hairs, such as those on the upper lip, I don&#x27;t imagine the feel of any stubble left behind would be an issue.</li>
            <li> works as expected.  </li>
            <li> You need to open the tip carefully, as there is a small black part, that part of it stays in the trimmer itself, the other smaller piece fits into the head of the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> The barrel is half white, half metallic fuchsia.</li>
            <li> The trimmer won&#x27;t hurt my skin, but it takes a while to take off all the hair near my mouth since the tip is very small.</li>
            <li> not very powerful though.  </li>
            <li> After all, this has a small head, and can&#x27;t be expected to trim larger areas all at once.</li>
            <li> Not good for a female&#x27;s facial hair.  </li>
            <li> It is small, less than 6\\&quot; long, and not much larger than a pen</li>
            <li> I have purchased other trimmers over the years, but they lay unused in the drawer.  </li>
            <li> My MIL uses it around other areas on her face as well.</li>
            <li> I could not be more disappointed with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Small enough to carry with you and the battery lasts.</li>
            <li> Like I mentioned, the tip is small, however the head is big..</li>
            <li> That said, it&#x27;s a painless trimmer, doesn&#x27;t pull the skin or leave the redness behind that other trimmers do (especially if they&#x27;re not new).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long the battery lasts but it would depend on use.</li>
            <li> -- there&#x27;s no wax to heat, stir or apply, no strips, no razor mess, no residual redness, and no pain.</li>
            <li> so I did a little online research and found this nifty device.</li>
            <li> I do like that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> It is a little thicker than a pen.  </li>
            <li> all I have to do is run this little guy over the hair</li>
            <li> Guide the tip of the wand over the area that has the unwanted hair and with a little \\&quot;zapping\\&quot; noise, the hair is cut quite close to the skin.</li>
            <li> so it take a little while to use it on the upper lip area or the chin, but I can see this is an advantage if you are trying to carefully sculp your eyebrows and don&#x27;t want to take off the wrong spot of your brow line.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.  </li>
            <li> After a few weeks use, the battery cuts on and off intermittently while I am using it.  </li>
            <li> and of course it dosnt work, waste of mony.</li>
            <li> The securing mechanism when screwing the head in is a tiny thin plastic lip-</li>
            <li> a claim said that broken parts are considered physical damage and not warrantied.  </li>
            <li> Small and compact too.</li>
            <li> You can also use it on small spots on your arms or legs.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s small and it cuts hair well without any pulling or snagging.  </li>
            <li> BTW--this product was painfree, in the past I used tweezers to remove stubborn hairs....</li>
            <li> Usually the store/</li>
            <li> I was then unable to return the product because the dealer stated it was a personal hygene product and could not be returned.</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed, no more plucking and definitely no more creams that burn my face.</li>
            <li> Small scissors is not the answer.  </li>
            <li> small and compact.  </li>
            <li> The illustrations show this trimmer running across hair and cutting them such that nothing is left behind.</li>
            <li> bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is that a disposable razor would probably do the job just as well, but women are generally uncomfortable with the idea of shaving their faces since it feels like something only men should do.</li>
            <li> So, I was a bit skeptical of a battery operated wand advertised as a facial hair</li>
            <li> I did not do this when using it under my eyebrow and a small \\&quot;nick\\&quot; appeared.</li>
            <li> NO MORE WAXING....</li>
            <li> and it makes it hard to pluck those stray hairs that just don&#x27;t match up with the eyebrows, but</li>
            <li> It removes one or two hairs at a time, so you can use it in delicate spots.  </li>
            <li> It can be used by a woman or man &amp; can painlessly trim those areas that need a delicate touch.</li>
            <li> I have a few random heavy &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34;  and it does not touch them, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very small</li>
            <li> So basically it is an electric razor with a very small surface area.</li>
            <li> you have very faint facial hair, this can be used to trim it.</li>
            <li> However, if your concern is about smoothness and the feel of your face, then you&#x27;ll need to use something which plucks or tears out hair instead of merely trims it down.</li>
            <li> Not a piece if serious grooming equipment.  </li>
            <li> There are those annoying times when you shave your leg, and then later notice a small patch of hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s about the size of a fat fountain pen or thin cigar.</li>
            <li> It will cut off and shorten the hairs, but leaves behind what feels like stubble.</li>
            <li> should not to any damage.&lt;br /&gt;The cutting head is removeable and can be washed in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I have poor eyesight</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s broken.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t stand behind their products.  </li>
            <li> (I hate those gadgets with a deep buried batter being difficult to get)</li>
            <li> Also, if the hair is dark at all, it is useless as it leaves bad stubble.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in this hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> It looks flashy and like lip stick case.</li>
            <li> This device was unable</li>
            <li> useless for eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> is not well assembled frame falls apart any time u touch device very uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> Nothing serious, but very painful!</li>
            <li> disappointed with Panansonic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s quite.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies...it will zap those annoying chin hair no problem and doesnt pull.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s awful, not to mention itchy as all h*ll.</li>
            <li> I have horrible eyebrows with almost no arch whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer ever.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Excellent quality, works like a charm!</li>
            <li> Had a Remington comb type that completely fell apart where the motor area was. Pay the tad extra and pay once on something which lasts. Works well, clean, no pull and tidy. Only gripe is when companies gender type with pink - such not a fan of the color. Keep it sexy, sleek and discreet by silver or black - not fuchsia.</li>
            <li> It is comfortable to use and better than my old Remington that was good but finally gave out.  Has lady-like-looks too!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought other cheaper trimmers, but this is what a personal trimmer is supposed to be.  Best part about it is that it does not pull out hairs...it cuts them and that is what I was looking for.  Small and compact too.</li>
            <li> Pretty casing, does the job best on nasal hairs, but facial, it&#x27;s ok for a quick trim.  For the money, it&#x27;s a good buy.</li>
            <li> nice for the purse and traveling</li>
            <li> Never got it to work even one time.</li>
            <li> Very good for hairs on your upper lips and for the eyebrow area</li>
            <li> i perfer the pink sharper....the head will turn a little bit hot when you use only couple of minutes....only good for lips and eyebows</li>
            <li> It is a little bigger than I expected (size of a pen) but works great and is small enough to keep in your cosmetic or travel bag.</li>
            <li> I love it.  I used to dread trimming but now it is no big deal.  I would recommend it for anyone.</li>
            <li> Does a nice job without pulling hair. Has feminine touch/color so husband will not use it (though he could, noses are noses). Would be nice if it was rechargeable. Having said that, the battery life is very long on AAA&#x27; s.</li>
            <li> I have purchased other trimmers over the years, but they lay unused in the drawer.  I have this one for two weeks and used it twice.  It is great. It doesn&#x27;t pinch or cut and does a neat and efficient trim of nose hair.  So happy to have found such a practical solution to hair in an unwanted place.</li>
            <li> Although this trimmer works it is not as functional as the older Panasonic facial hair trimmer. I won&#x27;t purchase another one.</li>
            <li> Perfect, easy to use, works great, love it!</li>
            <li> Really like this little device to remove the facial hair.  Works well.</li>
            <li> This is a handy little trimmer.  It is lightweight and portable.  Easy to use.  I do agree with other reviewers that is does not pull the hair out on a deep level at all.  It is a very surface trim.  But for the money, I found it a cute way to keep maintenance up on my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> Works like it should. Good product. I am very satisfied</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed in this hair trimmer. It&#x27;s girly, pink and cute. Beyond that, it works well when you first put a new battery in but it doesn&#x27;t take long before it&#x27;s dying. So it&#x27;s a major battery eater.</li>
            <li> Works great! I am very satisfied with it! It actually cuts the hair and doesn&#x27;t pluck or tug. Not loud, looks nice with it&#x27;s sleek design.</li>
            <li> This product broke the fourth time I used it.  What a waste of money.  I am sorry that I didn&#x27;t use it more right away so that I could have returned it.  I tried to fix it but no go.</li>
            <li> Awesome product fast delivery!</li>
            <li> Good product; ladylike.</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic tool for quick touch-ups on the eyebrows. My MIL uses it around other areas on her face as well. Perfect for when you don&#x27;t have time to tweeze!</li>
            <li> This is a cute little shaver to carry with you anywhere.  But, it sure does a great job, it is quiet, and yet reliable, you will be so glad you got it.</li>
            <li> Does what it promises, nuff said.</li>
            <li> I got this for my stash, and it works great for me. Epically if you don&#x27;t like to tweeze. Great Product for me!!</li>
            <li> You have to admit at some time that there are long white hairs coming out of your nose, Ladies.  This facial hair trimmer -- although it does not specifically say so -- is great for remove nose hair without any pain at all.  Go for it.</li>
            <li> This works amazing. I love  it!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very efficient, smooth and compact. Most products i looked at were a single blade rather than rotating. I wanted a rotating blade, finally found it and am by satisfied.</li>
            <li> Very easy to use. I am also very like shape, color. Introduces the side a lot of friends to buy. Everyone said very good, worth buying.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; sleek! Love it!</li>
            <li> I used 3 fresh batteries in a row (since it only needs one) to get this thing to work and the motor is just so sensitive and slow. I just missed the window to return this so unfornuatly it will just sit unused and unworking in my cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping for it to be somewhat powerful. Usually Panasonic products have a great record, but I guess I got a dud.</li>
            <li> Don&#x60;t have much to write, except that this is lovely in appearance and feel, holds comfortably and well, and works perfectly, all as described. I will be using it to supplement my epilator, for tricky places and/or a quicky if less time is available. I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> This is a great idea, in fabulous packaging, but it just doesn&#x27;t work well. I can trim closer with a pair of cuticle scissors. One might find razor stubble acceptable (or even sexy) on a guy, but there is nothing acceptable about it on a woman&#x27;s face, chin, ears, or nose. It&#x27;s awful, not to mention itchy as all h*ll. I cannot recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I could not be more disappointed with this trimmer.  After a few weeks use, the battery cuts on and off intermittently while I am using it.  I removed that battery and tried it in another appliance.  It has been working just fine.  So the problem is NOT the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find that the trimmer will sometimes snag on a hair and pull...it HURTS.  This seems to happen more and more frequently.  I don&#x27;t know if one of those snags bent a blade in the trimmer but these snags are not at all acceptable to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I don&#x27;t find this trimmer of use whatsoever.</li>
            <li> This has worked great for me; just the thing I needed to get rid of the occasional overly prominent facial hair.  Very easy to use and the small size is nice for the face.  One battery seems to last a long time.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. But don&#x27;t think you can&#x27;t cut the inside of your nose with this!</li>
            <li> This is a great little cosmetic tool.  Fantastic quality.</li>
            <li> I bought this, first off its made of really cheap plastic. When you incert a battery it will not close all the way. I used fresh batterys, went to flip it on and of course it dosnt work, waste of mony.</li>
            <li> She loves it.  Great shape, color and it works. That&#x27;s enough said, but I have to type more works to have the comment posted.</li>
            <li> This is a cool little contraption and can get most nose hair pretty short without pain/tickle. We will see how long it lasts and stays sharp.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, painless, nice for touch-up. Small enough to carry with you and the battery lasts.Easy to clean. Would definitely recommend this.</li>
            <li> This product works great.  The trimmer is just that, a trimmer.  It is not a shaver, so you don&#x27;t get a really close trim.  This is actually a very good feature if you don&#x27;t want to worry about irritating your skin.  On the flip side, if you&#x27;re expecting a super close shave, that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re going to get.  I like the size of this unit and the cap makes it great for traveling.</li>
            <li> I gave this product 5 stars because its easy to use, pain free, and works great! I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using the trimmer for long, but so far I&#x27;m fully-satisfied with the purchased. Looks-wise, it reminds me of a tube of mascara (maybe a bit bigger than that). I&#x27;ll update this review if I encounter any problems over time, but right now I rate it &amp;#34;highly recommended&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> ...so I did a little online research and found this nifty device. My tormenting nose hairs are trimmed to manageable short i also use  without pinching my skin at all. And the tip can be unscrewed and rinsed under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, because this trimmer is used straight on so it trims the area between my eyebrows smoothly. I found lots of use for this powerful little trimmer. I&#x27;m delighted I bought it.</li>
            <li> As advertized everything was great.</li>
            <li> very easy to use!!  I can use it for many ways to get rid of unwanted facial hair!!</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product!! I have used Remington Steele in the past but wasn&#x27;t satisfied because the trimmer died out too quickly. Hence, I decided to look for a trimmer that was created exclusively for women and am glad I purchased a great brand like Panasonic....</li>
            <li> I have very conflicting feeling about this hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;For face hair, it more or less does the job. The trimmer won&#x27;t hurt my skin, but it takes a while to take off all the hair near my mouth since the tip is very small. Also the motor gets hot so fast like in 30 sec. I got scared. It&#x27;s not that I was using it for the whole 30 sec, it&#x27;s just that I turned it on, check my skin, taking my time.&lt;br /&gt;For brows, I don&#x27;t feel it would help shaping the brow. Keeping the shape, maybe. Like I mentioned, the tip is small, however the head is big.. This means you cannot see where the tip is... This is very annoying when you want more precise work, like shaping the brows.&lt;br /&gt;For nose hair, this trimmer makes it so easy. But who needs a nose trimmer for $17....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do like the cute and sleek packaging, but I don&#x27;t know if I would recommend it for brows. I guess there should be better product out there.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I ever had. Very gentle but removes all the hair. I use it for my nose hair. Great product.  I already purchased the second one for my boyfriend.  He loves it too.</li>
            <li> It looks flashy and like lip stick case. I feel like a woman having all the hairs in my nose and ears :P&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know why sometimes I get a bit of wound in my nose, which is not  a new thing. I think I shouldn&#x27;t stick the hair trimmer&#x27;s tip to my nose.</li>
            <li> I have used it for several months. It works well.&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning is easy.&lt;br /&gt;The design to get the battery is easy too. (I hate those gadgets with a deep buried batter being difficult to get)</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I wanted to groom unwanted facial hair. Mainly use this on my chin but have used it on my eyebrows a little as well. I do like that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other products I have tried in the past.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for helping women with those &#x27;mustache&#x27; hairs that we can&#x27;t seem to get rid of.  The tool is easy to take apart to clean and I have not had to replace the battery yet.  If travelling, you can throw it into a make up bag and bring it with you.  I was concerned that I would have to use it more frequently and that the hair would grow back faster but I haven&#x27;t found that to be the case.</li>
            <li> It was bought as a gift; I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> First off, this is NOT an epilator or a tweezer.  This product is a hair trimmer.  It is a little thicker than a pen.  It removes one or two hairs at a time, so you can use it in delicate spots.  I love to keep this product in my purse for times like when I didn&#x27;t have time to thread or wax my eyebrows or upper lip.  I run it across my upper lip and done!  It&#x27;s fast and free...well, once you purchase the device.  I have VERY sensitive skin, and it has never left any red marks or scratched my skin or left scabs or anything.  It also does not leave your skin dry or ashy.  However, it will not work well on OVERLY moisturized skin or if you&#x27;re trying to use it around your lip area where maybe you have some excess chapstick on your skin on the downy hair you&#x27;re trying to get to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not beat tweezing, threading, waxing, shaving, or epilating, but it is great for a last-minute type situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend that every woman buy this hair trimmer and keep it handy for emergencies.  You can also use it on small spots on your arms or legs.  There are those annoying times when you shave your leg, and then later notice a small patch of hair.  This works great for that type of situation as well!</li>
            <li> This little trimmer is small, handy, light, discreet and works. I used to travel with a rechargeable trimmer (the only other option was travelling with none!) This is going to lighten my load; moreover, I see clearly that it works better than my old rechargeable, even when that one was new. Takes triple A batteries. Easy to clean. Pretty color. You can purchase it for what it would cost to have a beauty shop visit for defuzzing.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, pretty, and can fit in your purse. Be careful - it looks harmless but the blade can hurt if you get to close.</li>
            <li> I had used the area below my eyebrow, it &amp;#34;prick&amp;#34; and left a minor cut on the skin.. Moroever, it tend to get hot easily.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed with Panansonic product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I would like to rate Amazon service &amp;#34;First Class&amp;#34; !</li>
            <li> So far so good. I wonder how long it will last. Seems to do what it is supposed to. Good for eyebrows and upper lip and nose.</li>
            <li> This thing is like a toy.  Not a piece if serious grooming equipment.  My advice, look elsewhere for a higher quality</li>
            <li> Awesome in every way. Already have told friends that bought it also. Does not pull, pinch or hurt in any way. Very happy..!!</li>
            <li> I had had a smaller version of the shaver that did a pretty good job of cutting longer hair, but this one is much better.  It really cuts the longer hair on my face down to the skin.  I would definitely recommend it for anyone who has unwanted long hairs growing on their face.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS THING!&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for nose and facial hair. I keep this with me in my makeup bag in my purse. Have it at all times just in case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s intended to trim, not completely remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As such, it is designed nicely for bikini area trimming, which is my main use.  Works pretty well for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE:  Not intended to be put into liquid.</li>
            <li> I have thin hair, so this device did not get hot enough to work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt; This device was unable 2 hold my hair</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it needs to do. Trims hair around a facial mole as well as other areas that a shaver type could not. Does not pull but cuts cleanly. Easy to disasemble and clean. Just got it so can make no comments on durability. However for the price it works well.</li>
            <li> It works good on the nose, however, does not cut well around the upper lip and chin.  I don&#x27;t think I would buy another one</li>
            <li> great small tool for trimming!</li>
            <li> Have been using this once a week for about 18 months , am rather fair, so once weekly is sufficient. It is no&lt;br /&gt;longer is as sharp as when initially puchased, and needs to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed it did not last longer.</li>
            <li> Painless and easy &amp;#34;facial&amp;#34; hair trimming.  Ladies, yes you can stick this up your nose, in your ears, or where ever you want and it&#x27;ll trim it painlessly.</li>
            <li> Most ear trimmers are rather large and made to keep at home. This one fits great into a pen holder in a courier bag or in your glove box. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I always see stray hairs when backlit while driving. Or stray nose hairs when glancing in the rear view mirror before a date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that the blade module is water rinsable and removable. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the hot pink color which is obviously aimed at ladies. But whatever. It&#x27;s the only slim profile ear trimmer I&#x27;ve ever found. It&#x27;s about the size of a fat fountain pen or thin cigar.</li>
            <li> I just got it. It works very well.</li>
            <li> First, like any hair removal product, hair must be like 1/4&amp;#34; (they state something like 3/16...basically the same thing) long for it to work. For facial hair, if it is that long, it&#x27;s good, any shorter than that, useless. Also, if the hair is dark at all, it is useless as it leaves bad stubble. I thought I might be able to use it as an eyebrow trimmer... not.</li>
            <li> doesn&#x27;t cut very good. It  pinched me as well.</li>
            <li> Does the job I love it.</li>
            <li> I guess it works ok.  This is my first trimmer, so I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience nor am I able to have any comparisons.&lt;br /&gt;The battery protector[bottom]  comes off more easily than the top portion, which is becoming irritating.</li>
            <li> This is not a heavy duty trimmer BUT it is perfect for simple facial trimming. I have been looking for a nose hair trimmer and this is a cute pink color that fits in with your make up. It does the job for the embarrassing nose hairs as well as the upper lip and even the little hairs around the eyebrows. It doesn&#x27;t pinch or pull. It&#x27;s pretty quiet, only uses a AAA battery, easy to clean.. Over all I am very glad I bought this... My only complaint is that mine starts to get hot after about a minute of use.. Hopefully because it is just new but I am happy I bought it</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very small and discreet as well as being designed in a cute metalic fuchsia, so it hides perfectly in your purse and looks like a pen or a tube of make-up. It&#x27;s very small so it take a little while to use it on the upper lip area or the chin, but I can see this is an advantage if you are trying to carefully sculp your eyebrows and don&#x27;t want to take off the wrong spot of your brow line. The trimmer cuts very well and does leave your skin quite smooth. It&#x27;s also convenient that the head is removable and washable, although the entire trimmer is not waterproof so it is not a wet/dry trimmer as others have stated. If you are likely to carry a trimmer around with you for on the go touch-ups, this would be the one to get.</li>
            <li> I have horrible eyebrows with almost no arch whatsoever.  As a result, I like to get rid of the peak so I don&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m on the verge of an emotional breakdown.  This trimmer works quite well for that purpose. I can get a much more precise angle and have not had any goof-ups and consequential over-corrections in the month I&#x27;ve been using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as effective for the upper lip area as traditional trimmers with the flat edge.  That said, it&#x27;s a painless trimmer, doesn&#x27;t pull the skin or leave the redness behind that other trimmers do (especially if they&#x27;re not new). I think the trade-off is worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product for eyebrow control in particular.</li>
            <li> This is only my second such trimmer, so I&#x27;m not as experienced as some of the other reviewers. That said, I knew what I wanted this to do - trim those extra fine eyebrow hairs that are hard to tweeze, upper lip hair and stray facial hair. Also wanted to use it on my husband&#x27;s nasal and ear hairs.  It works very nicely in each of these situations. Longer, more coarse hair might take a pass or two more, but it will get them. Extra fine hair also may take a bit more effort - you need to get at it from the correct angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use it regularly (every few days, or as needed) rather than wait till there&#x27;s a lot to remove, it&#x27;ll go more quickly. After all, this has a small head, and can&#x27;t be expected to trim larger areas all at once. I didn&#x27;t feel any stubble after using it on my eyebrow and upper lip areas, nor was there any visible sign that trimming had gone on.  I think its best value is as a supplement to whatever other technique you use for hair removal - tweezing, shaving, or chemical. Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with it and would recommend it for the uses I&#x27;ve detailed above.</li>
            <li> works well for nose hair; good product thus far</li>
            <li> The Panasonic Precision Facial Hair Trimmer trims nose hair, eyebrows, and facial hair.  It is battery-operated (batteries are not included), has a wand design, and features an inner dual-edged blade.  There is also a skin guard that prevents the blade from touching sensitive skin.  The detachable head can be washed with soap and water; the trimmer body is not washable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a woman of a certain age I&#x27;ve started getting unwanted facial hair and I&#x27;m always looking for an inexpensive, pain-free way of getting rid of that hair so I was happy to try the Panasonic Precision Facial Hair Trimmer.  It comes in a nice discreet package and it fits nicely into your pocketbook - if anyone saw it they would probably think it is a pen.  I was a bit surprised at the shaver head which doesn&#x27;t look at all like a shaving blade and a bit apprehensive about how it works.  To my surprise and delight it works just fine.  It truly is pain-free and does a great job of getting rid of the hair that constantly grows on my cheeks.  It also does a good job of getting rid of nose hair and trimming eyebrows.  It is also relatively quiet so you can use it discreetly even when other people are around.  The trimmer fits nice and comfortably in my hand.  The one thing that kept me from giving this five stars is that unlike the [[ASIN:B000FRVA8O Finishing Touch Lumina Lighted Hair Remover with Pivoting Head]] this does not have a light.  My house tends to be dimly lit and I appreciate any extra lighting I can get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic Precision Facial Hair Trimmer does a great job.</li>
            <li> I debated buying the NoNo hair remover but decided I couldn&#x27;t justify spending around $300, so it seemed a worthwhile gamble to purchase this trimmer (along with the Panasonic pivoting head facial hair remover - I will review separately).  Those two items coupled together are all I need!  This trimmer will not give you a baby smooth shave, but I like that I can safely trim around my eyebrows without accidentally shaving them off. I have also shaved around a beauty mark (mole) on my face without any nicking or bleeding.  I recommend that if you purchase this, you should couple it with the Panasonic pivoting head facial hair trimmer, which cleanly and safely removes the peach fuzz -- as this product alone will not do a thorough job.</li>
            <li> This facial hair trimmer is a great tool for small jobs.  If you&#x27;re looking to zap a hair or two in small places (for example, just inside your nose), then this is a great tool.  It&#x27;s small and it cuts hair well without any pulling or snagging.  If you&#x27;ve got quite a bit of hair to trim, then this isn&#x27;t really the tool for you.  For one thing, the cutting mechanism gets pretty hot if you use it more than about 30 seconds in a row.  For another thing, the cut isn&#x27;t super short or smooth.  For me, this is perfect for removing a stray hair or two, but if you have a bigger job, then you might want a stronger tool.</li>
            <li> It seems I might as well shave (which I do not want to do since shaving usually would grow back quickly and leave more stubble than previously.  Shaving would leave immediate smoother results, but this product does not remove the hairs, but leaves stubble, rather than smoothness.  Not good for a female&#x27;s facial hair.  Inexpensive was good, but results are poor.</li>
            <li> I gave this away as a present along with 2 other Panasonic ladies&#x27; products. I actully had the chance to use it few times and the trimmer does get really close to the skin and leaves no stubble. Quality seems good too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other facial trimmers in the market, this one is very discreet and comes in a nice case. No one would ever know it&#x27;s a facial trimmer, which is one of the reasons I bought it. It also matches perfectly with the other two beauty tools. I wish they sold them as a set!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll preface this by saying that I also own the ER-GN30 [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]] and have appreciated its performance.  It does the job just fine...and at a much cheaper price than this ladies&#x27; version (which is why I&#x27;m deducting one star for this one)...but this trimmer is so pretty that you just might want to pay the extra money to indulge your inner girly-girl!  This ladies&#x27; trimmer runs on a single AAA battery and works great, just like the ER-GN30.  Where the ER-GN30 is angled and bulkier, this little beauty is straight and slim.  Not only is the body vivid pink, but this comes with a matching vivid pink cover so that the whole thing simply looks like a big, long lipstick.  Not that anyone needs to carry a facial hair trimmer in her purse, but you could easily toss it in there and it wouldn&#x27;t look out of place at all.  I really love this product and, hopefully, the price will come down a bit from the current $25 range.  She&#x27;s a beauty!</li>
            <li> This is by far the gentlest trimmer I&#x27;ve used and I love it. It makes quick work of all those annoying little hairs and is so easy to clean. It&#x27;s quiet and discreet and doesn&#x27;t hurt at all. This is a great little trimmer and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> My husband and I each got Sharper Image trimmers many years ago -- his was great (still is); mine always gave me what felt like tiny shocks (I realize now it must have been tiny cuts, perhaps from a slightly misaligned blade), and I long-ago migrated back to using blunt-tip beauty scissors. So I was happy to discover this product and give trimmers another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to be clear, it&#x27;s a trimmer -- not a tweezer/epilator (it trims to skin-surface depth, not root depth) and not a razor (it doesn&#x27;t work well on coarse facial/eyebrow hair or large areas). Its small head (with tiny blades underneath) excellently (and absolutely painlessly) trims nasal hair and fine facial hair (e.g. upper lip). The tip gets warm -- not hot -- within moments so it&#x27;s best for very brief use on small patches; afterward, it also cools within moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to install/replace the single AAA battery, easy on/off to use, easy to clean (requires minor disassembly; a tiny cleaning brush is included). Packaged in a slim, pretty case. For its limited uses (nose, lip), I definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Takes up no room in makeup drawer or purse. Works will. Would order again.</li>
            <li> This product is a trimmer that is designed to cut hairs, not to pull them out. So basically it is an electric razor with a very small surface area. It is very easy to change the single AAA battery in this product. It has a good design that makes it easy to keep a steady grip. I use it to remove those unsightly \\&quot;mustache\\&quot; hairs and for that it works great. I occasionally use it for my eye brows as well, but please be careful because I accidentally nicked myself while doing this once. Nothing serious, but very painful! The product is made in China, but seems to have the same high quality of most Panasonic products.</li>
            <li> Great Product!  I purchased this to be used as a nose trimmer and the product exceeded my expectations.  I immediately threw out my two inexpensive trimmers.  BTW--this product was painfree, in the past I used tweezers to remove stubborn hairs....now my tweezers will be used for eyebrows only.</li>
            <li> Easy to use; works exactly as it promised.  Removes hair with ease and keeps things net and tidy.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Love the size, shape, and color. It fits perfectly in my make-up bag and simply looks like a tube of mascara. Used for the first time last night and surprisingly it was very quiet and not painful AT ALL. Good buy for the price!!</li>
            <li> Great product, works very well.</li>
            <li> I was very very pleased withe Panasonic trimmer!!!</li>
            <li> I have had the [[ASIN:B0009DT39C Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer, Pink]]And still use it I love it. It takes off the peach fuzz that is blonde and seems to increase with age. It will take out coarse chin hairs sometimes takes 2-3 passes. This Panasonic ER-GN25VP works great for the nose and upper lip but it takes a lot more passes to do the whole face. The other unit has a wide trimming edge so you are done fast. The new unit will not take out a coarse hair, at least not mine. It does say it cannot take out really short hairs so that may be the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to carry this one in my purse as sometimes I can forget to check those stubborn hairs and it bugs me the whole time I am gone. There is no pain with this unit it is trimming not pulling out. It has a 2 yr warranty which is nice and the color is girly pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took off one star for not taking out the coarse hairs out. It is wonderful for upper lip.</li>
            <li> When offered this through Amazon&#x27;s Vine Program, I wanted to try it, to see if it was any different from other facial hair trimmers, because the tip of it looked different from the other kind of facial hair trimmers, the ones with the comb looking tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions for this product, as well as the parts of it could have been written clearer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I read along with the facial hair trimmer, you were supposed to get a cleaning brush, which mine did not come with one which is minor, but I thought I should point that out to anyone who might also be ordering this product, whether it will include the cleaning brush they say should come in the packaging or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The facial hair trimmer itself.  I love the hot pink color.  This hair trimmer is discreet, it looks more like a longer lipstick from the outside.  There are no visable parts on the outside of the trimmer, just the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will need one AAA battery to operate this.  I tested the hair trimmer out on the front of my wrist to see if it would hurt, before using it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could see that it did remove the hair, without any pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In using this facial hair trimmer this is what I found.  It works very well on longer hair, but does not work very well if you have shorter, coarser hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the instructions it does say you can wash the tip of the hair trimmer, but not inside.  You need to open the tip carefully, as there is a small black part, that part of it stays in the trimmer itself, the other smaller piece fits into the head of the trimmer.  Neither part is in there tightly, so I would not recommend that you use this facial hair trimmer over your bathroom sink, or some place like that, because if you open the head of the trimmer the smaller black pieces can go down the drain.  If that happened I don&#x27;t think this facial hair trimmer would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me some of this facial hair trimmer is good, works fairly well depending on what type of hair you are trying to remove, but I do think that other parts of it could have been made better than it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a 2 year limited warranty on this, and a 30 day quality satisfaction guarantee.</li>
            <li> First of all, you need a AAA battery to get this machine going.  Once its going, you are going to love it!.  You can remove hair from your nose, your upper lip, and even your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;I have my brows done professionally, but I would use this for sure to clean up any wisps that are strays.  I used it along my lip to capture any hairs and it did a FANTASTIC job.  I also used it along my jawline to see if it could get any of the finer hair and it also did a great job on them.  I plan on keeping this in my purse, in my makeup bag.  Its very pretty and no one would ever guess that its a hair remover.  Love it!~</li>
            <li> The Panasonic ER-GN25VP Beauty Line Ladies Precision Facial Hair Trimmer is a powerful yet gentle rotary trimmer that allows you get fine hairs. The unit is about the size of a large pen and uses one AAA battery. I personally use the Panasonic ER-GN30-K facial hair trimmer that uses an AA battery and was worried about the power of the ER-GN25VP but found that it even cut my coarse hair without pulling.  After my initial testing, I turned the unit over to my wife and she loves it for the ease of use and gentle trimming. She even showed it to women in her church group and now they want one as well.  Clean up is simple, just take the cutter out and rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the Panasonic ER-GN25VP Beauty Line Ladies Precision Facial Hair Trimmer is a great trimmer, gentle enough for the ladies but strong enough to cut mens&#x27; coarse facial hair. I recommend it.</li>
            <li> We have used several of this type of facial hair trimmer in our house.  To remove a stray hair, tidy up the edge of a haircut, etc.  Usually the store/no name brands we use, while very inexpensive, tend to fail quickly.  I&#x27;ve had some of these $7-$10 trimmers stop working in as short as a week.  Who needs the hassle of returning inexpensive items, mailing them in, etc.  Most of the cheaper trimmers offer a 90 day warranty, at best.  Since shipping for warranty service can cost as much as one of the cheapo trimmers, they are, in essence, disposable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ER-GN25VP, on the other hand, while it costs around $20-$25, is better made than any other trimmer of this sort I have used.  It is backed by a two year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head on the trimmer is not like a shaver.  So keep in mind this is a TRIMMER.  It is not a shaver, razor, or tweezer type device.  The head resembles the blade on a \\&quot;nose hair trimmer\\&quot;.  In fact, one of the demonstrated uses in the user manual is for nose hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is sleek and easy to use. The barrel is half white, half metallic fuchsia. It is small, less than 6\\&quot; long, and not much larger than a pen so it is easy to carry/store.  It runs on a single AAA battery.  A battery is not included.  The product package contains the trimmer, a cap for the blade head, a cleaning brush, and the user manual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device is relatively quiet.  It moves delicately near the skin and doesn&#x27;t cause discomfort when trimming hair.  I found that it trims neatly and causes no discomfort.  It is effective on eyebrows, nose hairs, ear hair, stray hairs on the face and neck, or stray hair on your haircut.&lt;br /&gt;The ER-GN25VP blade is also washable.  You CANNOT wash the entire device.  The head detaches and may be rinsed under water and washed with mild soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual says the ER-GN25VP will run up to a year on a single battery.  Obviously, this will vary with use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are numerous other products like the ER-GN25VP, and many are less expensive.  However the ER-GN25VP appears to be more durable, more reliable and works as well, and typically better than other trimmers of this type.like the ER-GN25VP, and many are less expensive.

            <li> This is a handy little trimmer and works great!  I would recommend this product to anyone that wants to clean the facial areas on your face!</li>
            <li> I use this for my eyebrows only so it&#x27;s just great. It&#x27;s not going to trim the very short end of your hair, but clean enough and you don&#x27;t need to do wax or tweezing which hurt your skin.</li>
            <li> Fast response, fast shipping, high quality!</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it very often, but I think I would prefer a different type of blade. I can&#x27;t give a definite opinion since I have yet to give it a fair trial.</li>
            <li> piece of junk, does not trim fine hair,Iam not one for a lot of words this thing is worth about 10.00 dollars no more way over priced.</li>
            <li> Only used twice and seems to work just fine for me.</li>
            <li> Upon receiving the hair trimmer, I followed instructions and inserted the batteries. The hair trimmer would not turn on. I was then unable to return the product because the dealer stated it was a personal hygene product and could not be returned.</li>
            <li> Finally a nose trimmer that works!  Bonus...in adorable pink. It is so compact and it looks nothing like a nose trimmer. Sleek and elefant. So thrilled with my purchase.</li>
            <li> This was just what I needed, no more plucking and definitely no more creams that burn my face. It is easy to carry around and perfect for getting rid of unsightly hairs. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needed it, male or female.</li>
            <li> Easy to use, fairly quiet, certainly portable. Does a great job without pulling, pinching or causing tears! Small enough to slip into your bag or toss in a suitcase for quick touch ups. Very pleased with this!</li>
            <li> Please do not waste your money on this product. I was excited to get it but after I used it twice, it died. And yes......I checked the battery. Very poor quality.</li>
            <li> Works really well on nose hair! Doesn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> is not well assembled frame falls apart any time u touch device very uncomfortable.  does not  remove hair close enough to skin. useless for eyebrows. nose hair partially removed and long operating process u use it again and again and again but hair remains partially removed. so definitely if u want to bye this device don&#x27;t use it on eyebrows. nose is ok and upper lip also ok</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll admit I was skeptical, but after receiving &amp; using, I&#x27;m glad I bought this. It can be used by a woman or man &amp; can painlessly trim those areas that need a delicate touch. Received promptly &amp; product was as advertised. Would use this seller again.</li>
            <li> My facial hair has to be kept:  my elder age let me see that my nose hair grew unbecomingly.  Small scissors is not the answer.  A precise and quick tool is what is needed.  This is it.  The convenience, cleanliness and fast work makes it a necessary part of personal care.  I am so glad I got this!  If you are an older woman, get your magnifying mirror and take a look. This tool is a must:  clean, neat and you always know you can be confident all the time!  You can be out &amp; about, you can do your lipstick in a moment, but if it is &amp;#34;one lone hair&amp;#34; ....... What&#x27;s it worth to you?</li>
            <li> small and compact.  not very powerful though.  sounds like the battery is going to quit every time I use it.  spend some more money and get a better one.</li>
            <li> Sleek easy to use item. Love the pink case!</li>
            <li> I ordered the Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Precision Facial Hair Trimmer because I&#x27;ve been so pleased with the Panasonic Swing Head facial hair trimmer that I currently use.  The Swing Head is a far superior model for removing fuzz and the stray hairs that do increase with age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic Beauty Line trimmer is a nasal hair trimmer.  And it&#x27;s effective as such.  But that is its primary value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three Stars:  The product is misnamed.</li>
            <li> I love this item.  It works well and is so pretty!</li>
            <li> The illustrations show this trimmer running across hair and cutting them such that nothing is left behind. This was not my experience with this trimmer, which does not remove hair so closely. It will cut off and shorten the hairs, but leaves behind what feels like stubble. If your concern is the visibility of facial hair, then this is probably good enough, especially since this is portable, painless, and not terribly expensive. If you need something to carry around and quickly deal with hairs which you may have missed in routine grooming (or need nose hair trimming), this does well. However, if your concern is about smoothness and the feel of your face, then you&#x27;ll need to use something which plucks or tears out hair instead of merely trims it down. For finer hairs, such as those on the upper lip, I don&#x27;t imagine the feel of any stubble left behind would be an issue. For coarser hairs, it may feel rather bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The truth is that a disposable razor would probably do the job just as well, but women are generally uncomfortable with the idea of shaving their faces since it feels like something only men should do. However, it would be faster and just as effective to shave off facial hairs than to use this type of trimmer. Mainly, I think this would be good for someone who needs very focused trimming over small areas or over facial contours (such as eyebrows) or who needs to do touch ups. As a solution to someone with coarse facial hair, especially on the chin, I&#x27;d say look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> If you are expecting a shaver that will get rid of facial hair at the skin&#x27;s surface, this will not do it. Stick to Nair. However, given that this does not shave hair off at the surface it does do a nice job when it comes to trimming or shaping eyebrows and certainly beats my former alternative scissors.&lt;br /&gt;Given its compact shape, this is easy to use and manipulate at different angles. It claims to offer a maximum 72 minute charge. I can&#x27;t verify that because I only use it for a couple of a minutes in eyebrow maintenance mode once a week.&lt;br /&gt;If you have very faint facial hair, this can be used to trim it. For what it&#x27;s worth it is a safe tool and used with care should not to any damage.&lt;br /&gt;The cutting head is removeable and can be washed in a few seconds.</li>
            <li> Skip the Salon, skip the embarrassment! I used to get my facial hair waxed and/or threaded. I noticed how much money I was spending pampering myself. I was also going through pain every time I went. My friend then told me how she uses a razor to shape her eyebrows. At first I thought, \\&quot;I could never do that\\&quot; There is also a myth that says hair grows back thicker. One day, I was in a rush and decided to shape my brows with a hair trimmer. My hair did not grow back thicker, in fact, it took the same amount of time as going to the salon took. I decided to buy this hair trimmer when I brought the Panasonic Beauty Heater Eyelash curler (which also works amazing!) and I could not have made a better purchase. This facial hair trimmer is ON POINT with direction and is always precise ! That is one thing I love because I don&#x27;t have to worry about removing hair that I did not want to remove ! It is very slim and portable and it looks like a pen that I can just throw in my purse. It removes facial hair painlessly, which like I mentioned, I used to go through at salons. I love that now I am able to remove hair any where and quickly. In addition, it does not irritate my skin like threading does.</li>
            <li> I have no idea why I didn&#x27;t purchas this sooner.  Great product and packaged beautifully.  If you walked into my bathroom and saw my makeup supplies, you would have no idea that this is a hair trimmer.</li>
            <li> Easy to use and easy to clean. It&#x27;s quiet and discrete while still being powerful enough to remove unwanted hair.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it claims</li>
            <li> Trimmer did exactly what it was stated to do - perfect for removal of upper lip hair and also easy to shape ones eyebrows. Save money on waxing !</li>
            <li> This trimmer is very handy and easy to use. Is doesn&#x27;t leave you real smooth but it works great for my eyebrows! WITH NO PAIN!</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. it fits easily in my purse and it does the job well. i would definitely recommend</li>
            <li> Women getting into their 40&#x27;s might want to keep something like this in their purse or makeup bag. Men - don&#x27;t read this - no one wants to know their wife or girlfriend might start finding a hair or two on her chin, but it&#x27;s true. Hormones start changing and \\&quot;things happen.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair trimmer is small in size, making it very convenient (it&#x27;s about the thickness of a highlighter marker). It is quick and unlike tweezers, painless. It is easy to clean with the little brush it comes with, and it shows you that you can also remove the top part and rinse under water to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what to get your friends for Christmas? Get them each one of these. They may laugh and you can all think of it as a joke, but believe me, they will use it. You can use it at your eye brows to trim the strays, or your chin, or upper lip - wherever you see a need. I was starting to use tweezers, but I like this much better.</li>
            <li> Unlike an epilator, this device is painless.  It cuts close to the skin for smooth results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is precise, working on a small area at a time.  This is great for shaping eyebrows, but makes shaving the upper lip just a little slow going.  It&#x27;s easy to use and easy to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty--almost like a long lipstick tube, and looks fine on the dresser.  It&#x27;s not loud at all, but makes a funny clicking noise when it clips a hair.  It&#x27;s especially recommended for ladies who have course facial hair.  It does a spectacular job on that.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t even give it one star.  Worked once and has not worked since.  I changed battery and no luck.</li>
            <li> These work great for eyebrows.  I feel like have much better control.</li>
            <li> Item great as expected. Arrived as promised. Amazon customer service is beyond all expectations.</li>
            <li> I like this and use it often.  I do have to go over some places more than once, however.  A brush on cream does a more thorough job, but they are harsh, so this is the next best thing I think.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for my mother-in-law at the request of my wife because my wife likes hers so much.</li>
            <li> This is the best such item I have ever used and I would buy it again.  It didn&#x27;t get too hot as I read in another review; it&#x27;ll get a little warm after using for a bit, but you can just turn it off, wait a minute, and then use it again.  In one review it stated the person stated she used it to get the clear colored hairs under eyebrow and also between the brows.  This was quite true.</li>
            <li> It worked well the first couple times I used it but it kept getting weaker and wouldn&#x27;t clean the hairs the way it should</li>
            <li> This product does its job. I am using it to trim the hair on my face and also use it for my brows. It is very easy to use.</li>
            <li> Amazing tool, color and shape</li>
            <li> I am man, and sometimes I take care of my eyeblow. No hurt, injured. Perfect.</li>
            <li> It works good!! easy to clean. I use this to get rid of my facial hair, and it works with eyebrow too.</li>
            <li> works as expected.  clips nose hairs without any worry about nicking the inside of my nose, which is what I was looking for.  Easy to use, easy to control.  No issues.</li>
            <li> This is the worst trimmer ever. It barely cuts the hairs and the blade inside wobbles around shaving the inside of the metal cap more than the hair I&#x27;m trying to get rid of. I was deceived by all the good reviews, buyer beware: spend the extra money on a decent trimmer with a functional design.</li>
            <li> Item works perfectly at getting those little annoying hairs.  Perfect for in between eyebrows.  I have poor eyesight and it makes it hard to pluck those stray hairs that just don&#x27;t match up with the eyebrows, but all I have to do is run this little guy over the hair and they&#x27;re gone.  WONDERFUL item.  Pretty color too-not that that really matters, but it&#x27;s nice nonetheless.</li>
            <li> I recently bought this and I love it. No complaints whatsoever, I love the guard above the blade that prevents nicks and cuts.  I would defiantly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> The trimmer works really well on fine/medium  hair around the mouth/upper lip area.  This and nose hair trimmer is the  purpose of the trimmer as specified in documentation that came with the trimmer.  Have not yet tried it as nose-hair trimmer.  This model works MUCH better (trims much closer and without repeated passes over the area with no discomfort or  mild abrading) than the other similar products I have tried of the $10.00 variety purchased at big box store. I have a few random heavy &amp;#34;whiskers&amp;#34;  and it does not touch them, but I didn&#x27;t expect it to.  I use a manual razor for those.</li>
            <li> This is great for nose hair trimming, but for the face it is not the best I have used.  I mainly bought it to trim nose hair and for me it is wonderful.  I tried on facial hair, but did not think it was meant for that specifically as it did not do a good job on that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Carol</li>
            <li> The only personal shaver I have ever had that actually works well. And it&#x27;s quite.&lt;br /&gt;Ladies...it will zap those annoying chin hair no problem and doesnt pull.</li>
            <li> It was great for the first use.  I put it away and then tried to use it a couple of weeks later.  It didn&#x27;t work.  I changed the battery.  Nope.  It&#x27;s broken.  AFTER ONE USE.  Do not buy this product.</li>
            <li> Garbage.  Lasted 4 months on a two year warranty.  The securing mechanism when screwing the head in is a tiny thin plastic lip- very cheap- once that broke the head doesn&#x27;t stay on securely for trimming.  Called to make a claim said that broken parts are considered physical damage and not warrantied.  Don&#x27;t stand behind their products.  Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
            <li> If you want to look in your nose and see no hair, but have felt the pain of tweezing, this is for you.</li>
            <li> Believe me, I have tried EVERYTHING to remove unwanted facial hair. Plucking, trimming with scissors, shaving, waxing -- most recently the [[ASIN:B006JKY3X0 Veet High Precision Warm Facial Wax, 0.5 Ounce]] -- which didn&#x27;t work at all. So, I was a bit skeptical of a battery operated wand advertised as a facial hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well I am a believer now! Within minutes after opening the package, finding and installing the required AAA battery (not included), I was in business. The upper lip fuzz - GONE. I&#x27;m not saying you get as close of shave as with a razor, but I don&#x27;t \\&quot;see\\&quot; anything and that was my requirement for success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So -- there&#x27;s no wax to heat, stir or apply, no strips, no razor mess, no residual redness, and no pain. Guide the tip of the wand over the area that has the unwanted hair and with a little \\&quot;zapping\\&quot; noise, the hair is cut quite close to the skin. One piece of advice, if you pull the skin taut, you won&#x27;t have any chance of \\&quot;sucking\\&quot; up a bit of skin into the device. I did not do this when using it under my eyebrow and a small \\&quot;nick\\&quot; appeared. Lesson learned immediately!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this -- cleans up easily and is small and attractive to slip into overnight bag or purse. Would make a great gift or stocking stuffer. I&#x27;m not sure how long the battery lasts but it would depend on use. The tip gets a little warm after continuous trimming, but not enough to \\&quot;burn\\&quot; any skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite happy with this product and hope it lasts for many years!&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I liked it so much that I bought another as a gift!</li>
            <li> I love how sleek and simple this is.  I would even say it carries an air of being discrete as well, no announcing you are trying to remove some unwanted hair at first glance.&lt;br /&gt;This will not completely remove hair to a smooth skin surface, but it will do a great job in a pinch when you do not have time to use a removal product that requires time to work and leave a mess in your aftermath.</li>
            <li> This is your basic, battery operated safety trimmer for nose and ear hair. It is extremely similar to the one my husband uses. The only obvious difference is that this trimmer has a bright pink case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This type of trimmer cuts hair very short without pinching or harming the skin. Rotary cutters spin within a perforated metal cone that is small enough to insert safely into the ear or nose. After use, the cone can be removed from the device and rinsed under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer will appeal to the person who wants to trim their nose or ear hair and/or prefers cutting their facial or body hair rather than removing it completely with tweezers, depilatory or epilator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband, for instance, is very happy with this device.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. It removes the hair. It&#x27;s as close a shave as one would like.... I love the color and lid. You don&#x27;t really know what it is at first glance. It is able to get in the tip of the nose with no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But honestly it doesn&#x27;t clear the hair as well as the  [[ASIN:B0049LUI9O Panasonic ER-GN30-K Vortex Wet/dry Nose and Facial Hair Trimmer, Black]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like both and will continue to use both...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: LOVE USING ON THE EYEBROWS... SHAVES CLOSE... NO MORE WAXING....</li>
            <li> I never expected this hair trimmer to be so great. It never pulls the hair and comes in an attractive case that looks like mascara. The battery lasts a long time and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase. I scoured the internet for a hair trimmer and made the right selection. Try it, you will love it too.</li>
            <li> I really like the facial hair trimmer - it&#x27;s compact and it works.  And as a cherry on top - it&#x27;s a really nice color.</li>
            <li> The look of the item is great. I love how it is very accessible as well. I feel like after I cleaned it the first time, it was difficult to put the top back on &amp; now my blade is not as great as when I first used it. Still did the job 80%.</li>
            <li> Works great - just what I needed!</li>
            <li> Just what I was looking for.  Works great.</li>
            <li> Just received it and so far it exceeds my expectancy.  Delivery was far too long however.</li>
