            <li>Ben Nye&#x27;s banana washes me out for this reason but the topaz color is a mix of warm and cool tones and it fits my shade more flawlessly.  </li>
            <li>this powder has and absolutely amazing finish to the skin.</li>
            <li>Not so amazing like it portrayed all over YouTube.</li>
            <li>The product is amazing.</li>
            <li>Nice finish to face makeup.</li>
            <li>I ordered this to set my highlight, and it works nicely.</li>
            <li>(after hearing them talk about how nice it was..)</li>
            <li>just didn&#x27;t blend well with my kind tone.</li>
            <li>I liked the product.</li>
            <li>Nice product for contouring and as a summer foundation substitute.</li>
            <li>I really like it, and the color is perfect for my brown skin.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t go too well with my warm undertones.</li>
            <li>LOVE, LOVE,  LOVE!!</li>
            <li>The color, it seems very silky, and its very easy to blend, goes perfect on brown skin.  </li>
            <li>This is my NEW favorite highlighter!!!!</li>

            <li>Love this powder esp for my skin tone</li>
            <li>It goes on great and it really opens up your eyes when used with concealer</li>
            <li>I use it on my brown skin as an all over, and as a bronzer and contour on my best friend who is white.</li>
            <li>The color is more orange than I thought it would be.  </li>

            <li>now I can sweat all day and not worry:)</li>
            <li>Favorite under eye concealer setting powder.</li>
            <li>It just makes my face look so much better.</li>
            <li>Love it!!!Helps keep my oily face with a matte finish all day...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li>Works with most complexions but,</li>
            <li>Love, Love, Love this power.</li>
            <li>Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>Enjoying.</li>
            <li>well, I don&#x27;t like the shaker top</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  OK getting use to it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this powder</li>
            <li>In that sense, the price is ok since you still have to find out if you even like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and packaging was great.  </li>
            <li>I get many compliments on my makeup when set with Ben Nye.  </li>
            <li>It also looks better when its blended with a beauty blender or sponge.</li>
            <li>It was ok.</li>
            <li>, that one looks better on me and blends well.</li>
            <li>I have always lacked a glow to my skin but this powder sure does give me it.</li>
            <li>Outstanding face powder</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>lovely item i am glad i got it.</li>
            <li>and I love the quality but for my complexion which is medium brown</li>
            <li>I use it with Ben nye banana and it looks much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll stick to Ben Nye Banana :)</li>
            <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>I love that.</li>
            <li>I love..</li>
            <li>but I do want to try a darker shade to see whether it works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t love it either (besides the mattifying ability).</li>
            <li>This is the better one,(in my opinion) for  my skin tone.</li>
            <li>Love it for under eyes.</li>
            <li>I thought it looked so amazing and full coverage until I looked in the mirror of the car</li>
            <li>it covered them pretty good.</li>
            <li>My skin tone is a mix of warm and cool colors.  </li>
            <li>Arrived before expected date and the product matched my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li>but this is the best thing I&#x27;ve spent my money on.</li>
            <li>Topaz is a much better fit.</li>
            <li>works good for under eye makeup came really fast</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t use this , tried it once an loved it</li>
            <li>Omg im n love this totally worth the price.. sets my highlight to perfection!</li>
            <li>I would recommend this topaz color to those brown skin ladies who are thinking that the original banana powder color is too light!</li>
            <li>The product was in perfect condition and it blends extremely well.</li>
            <li>I plan to order all the other colors its Excellent!!!</li>
            <li>Indeed a great purchase and no regrets.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a dark toned woman and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>but it gives your face a goldish hint/hue and a smooth finish when u r done.</li>
            <li>Its not as smooth as ben nye</li>
            <li>I like the texture of this product and the smooth finish I get from it.</li>
            <li>She stated that the ben nye banana was too light for her skintone</li>
            <li>but it was just too light for me as well</li>
            <li>The banana I found was too light  for me.  </li>
            <li>The translucent powder came earlier than predicted, and is great for controlling shine, just one issue can they find a way to improve the packaging to decrease the amount of spillage???</li>
            <li>Feels smooth and light on skin.</li>
            <li>I thought it wouldn&#x27;t fit my complexion</li>
            <li>The texture is also very good which is another reason why I want to try other colors.</li>
            <li>Love this products and very fast shipping</li>
            <li>Very good coverage for medium to dark girls</li>
            <li>I was excited to receive this, but it made my face orange.</li>
            <li>Worth the price!</li>
            <li>I received  many compliments on my makeup the first time I used this product.</li>
            <li>This product is wonderful and works very well with other cosmetics.  </li>
            <li>&amp; I must say, I made the right choice!</li>
            <li>I love how finely milled it is because it&#x27;s allowed to actually form to your skin &amp; not just sit on top of your foundation like sand on a sidewalk.</li>
            <li>I love this powder so much I use it every time I do my makeup.</li>
            <li>but, it actually did look good on my contouring .</li>
            <li>Wish it would have came in something that&#x27;s EASIER to dispence on your face but the product is cool</li>
            <li>The banana powder made me look ashy and white especially in my pictures but the topaz is perfect.  </li>
            <li>Luckily I bought the banana one</li>
            <li>My new favorite product to add to my makeup collection now and forever</li>
            <li>This is truly a pretty and unique color that blends so well with my foundation to set it, and captures the essence of my skin tone so well.  </li>
            <li>Much better for the girls of color who aren&#x27;t dark skin or light skin more in between.</li>
            <li>Shipping Was accurate &amp; fast.</li>
            <li>I would recommend this product to anyone that has a warm caramel completion with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li>My makeup rarely creases and stays in place for the majority of my 12 hour days.</li>
            <li>I use it to set my under eye concealer but this area kind of looks ashy later on in the day.</li>
            <li>Love my new natural glow!!!!</li>
            <li>I choose this rating of this product because it was just the right color for my shade</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a super match for my skin but a good product.</li>
            <li>Although, I&#x27;ve only used it for nighttime occasions, the highlight makes my face pop and its a great addition to set my makeup (under eyes especially).</li>
            <li>Great for African American skin</li>
            <li>I would recommend this face powder for dark skin ladies because it gives your face a beautiful professional finish.</li>
            <li>But shipping was very fast</li>
            <li>Love this powder, I am ordering Banana next!</li>
            <li>when I first applied it I packed it on, (applied a lot of product)</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t go wrong with Ben Nye ,excellent product!</li>
            <li>I will definitely be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li>Well, I used this powder for the first time</li>
            <li>There aren&#x27;t instructions included so do your research online first</li>
            <li>It sets my concealer very well without leaving a look that I have makeup on!</li>
            <li>Love it &amp; will definitely order again.</li>
            <li>I love the product but only give it a 4 because of the orange look on me.</li>
            <li>This is my first Ben Nye powder.</li>
            <li>This powder is not too orange as some people may say, it does highlight very well and prevents me from looking shiny!</li>
            <li>It fit with dark skin, I love it</li>
            <li>I have  red under tones this powder is perfect, I never thought I would like this,because of the prior powders I&#x27;ve tried as a finish look, I use this when I&#x27;m going for a natural look and natural it is .</li>
            <li>Very nice yellow high light under eyes for dark skin</li>
            <li>I will certainly purchase again</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still learning with makeup being that I don&#x27;t wear it much.</li>
            <li>fit me for the highlighting parts on my face and it use to leave like a white tint and the powder didn&#x27;t cover the concealer like it should have.</li>
            <li>Very orange like color</li>
            <li>I have a caramel color skin complexion and it still showed up very orange</li>
            <li>Came in fast</li>
            <li>I then went to &amp;#34;camerareadycosmetics.com&amp;#34; and purchased the real Ben Nye powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Makes you look very put together.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to try the Ben Nye Banana powder, thanks to the ladies on U-tube for introducing me to this color.</li>
            <li>Haha funniest thing ever.</li>
            <li>Well it didn&#x27;t really meet my expectation</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t wear it as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li>Reasonable price</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and along with my primer, I no longer need to blot or freshen up during the day.</li>
            <li>its more orange than expected</li>
            <li>but I have changed it just to fit this in will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I like the texture of this powder and it is a very mattifying powder which I like.</li>
            <li>A good settled highlighter and costs a fraction of other similar products.</li>
            <li>Other than that the powder is ok.</li>
            <li>, it looks so natural on, and I did try it without a foundation first just to see what it looked like on my skin tone.  </li>
            <li>Looking to actually buy the other kind.</li>
            <li>I normally wear NW43 in MAC, just so you have an idea of my skin tone.</li>
            <li>this is the real shizz, its a fantastic highlight color for black girls, doesnt give the ashy look that banana does.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s you&#x27;re new to this stuff</li>
            <li>And coming from a black girl, trying to find a powder to set your highlight isn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li>This was a wild card based on the reviews and it worked!</li>
            <li>will set your concealer like no other!!!</li>
            <li>Ben Nye banana powder is a little too light</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the bottle was kind of hard to open - still trying to figure that out.</li>
            <li>It gives my face a natural look.</li>
            <li>I was surprised, i didn&#x27;t look as oily and I didn&#x27;t have to apply the product again.</li>
            <li>for lighter skinned girls, it blends really well when mixed with banana powder.</li>
            <li>Forgot the name of the one I found after I already bought this one, but do some searching before you buy directly from here.</li>
            <li>I really like this product I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li>this is not a ben nye product&amp;#62;  first of all I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t realize ben nye products are in red lettering plus it has a a big BEN NYE logo in the upper left hand corner&amp;#62;  The powder for me wasn&#x27;t the right shade&amp;#62;  </li>
            <li>The powder is light and very messy.</li>
            <li>If u apply it correctly, this product is awesome.works very well on African American women!!</li>
            <li>Provide slight golden highlight.</li>
            <li>Depending on how deep your skin tone is this could be a bit on the orange side, so apply with a light hand a fluffy brush.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li>Wow, I can tell the difference between others that claim to do the same thing!</li>
            <li>This product will get every where if you are not careful.</li>
            <li>so be careful not to take too much.</li>
            <li>This product must be used lightly especially if the lighting indoors is dim.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s messy but product is worth</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;m NW 48 in StudioFix Fluid), but I can definitely get for HALF the price and MORE product from other vendors.</li>

            <li> Love the color!</li>
            <li> Ben Nye&#x27;s banana washes me out for this reason but the topaz color is a mix of warm and cool tones and it fits my shade more flawlessly.  </li>
            <li> this powder has and absolutely amazing finish to the skin.</li>
            <li> Not so amazing like it portrayed all over YouTube.</li>
            <li> The product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Nice finish to face makeup.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to set my highlight, and it works nicely.</li>
            <li> (after hearing them talk about how nice it was..)</li>
            <li> just didn&#x27;t blend well with my kind tone.</li>
            <li> I liked the product.</li>
            <li> Nice product for contouring and as a summer foundation substitute.</li>
            <li> I really like it, and the color is perfect for my brown skin.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t go too well with my warm undertones.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE,  LOVE!!</li>
            <li> The color, it seems very silky, and its very easy to blend, goes perfect on brown skin.  </li>
            <li> This is my NEW favorite highlighter!!!!</li>
            <li> love.. love this Stuff!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best thing ive ever bought.</li>

            <li> Love the product its amazing.</li>
            <li> Very smooth finish</li>
            <li> The container could be better.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the top off</li>
            <li> I am glad I went with this instead of banana.</li>
            <li> I love this setting powder.</li>

            <li> and hopefully I&#x27;ll get better result.</li>
            <li> Love this powder esp for my skin tone</li>
            <li> It goes on great and it really opens up your eyes when used with concealer</li>
            <li> I use it on my brown skin as an all over, and as a bronzer and contour on my best friend who is white.</li>
            <li> The color is more orange than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I use it on top of my conceler and bronzer.</li>
            <li> I love my product</li>
            <li> I love this color</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I chose this over the banana powder.</li>
            <li> now I can sweat all day and not worry:)</li>
            <li> Favorite under eye concealer setting powder.</li>
            <li> It just makes my face look so much better.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!Helps keep my oily face with a matte finish all day...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s absolutely stunning.</li>
            <li> Works with most complexions but,</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this power.</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> Enjoying.</li>
            <li> well, I don&#x27;t like the shaker top</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  OK getting use to it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder</li>
            <li> In that sense, the price is ok since you still have to find out if you even like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and packaging was great.  </li>
            <li> I get many compliments on my makeup when set with Ben Nye.  </li>
            <li> It also looks better when its blended with a beauty blender or sponge.</li>
            <li> It was ok.</li>
            <li> , that one looks better on me and blends well.</li>
            <li> I have always lacked a glow to my skin but this powder sure does give me it.</li>
            <li> Outstanding face powder</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> lovely item i am glad i got it.</li>
            <li> and I love the quality but for my complexion which is medium brown</li>
            <li> I use it with Ben nye banana and it looks much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll stick to Ben Nye Banana :)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> I love that.</li>
            <li> I love..</li>
            <li> but I do want to try a darker shade to see whether it works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t love it either (besides the mattifying ability).</li>
            <li> This is the better one,(in my opinion) for  my skin tone.</li>
            <li> Love it for under eyes.</li>
            <li> I thought it looked so amazing and full coverage until I looked in the mirror of the car</li>
            <li> it covered them pretty good.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is a mix of warm and cool colors.  </li>
            <li> Arrived before expected date and the product matched my skin tone perfectly.</li>
            <li> but this is the best thing I&#x27;ve spent my money on.</li>
            <li> Topaz is a much better fit.</li>
            <li> works good for under eye makeup came really fast</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use this , tried it once an loved it</li>
            <li> Omg im n love this totally worth the price.. sets my highlight to perfection!</li>
            <li> I would recommend this topaz color to those brown skin ladies who are thinking that the original banana powder color is too light!</li>
            <li> The product was in perfect condition and it blends extremely well.</li>
            <li> I plan to order all the other colors its Excellent!!!</li>
            <li> Indeed a great purchase and no regrets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark toned woman and it worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> but it gives your face a goldish hint/hue and a smooth finish when u r done.</li>
            <li> Its not as smooth as ben nye</li>
            <li> I like the texture of this product and the smooth finish I get from it.</li>
            <li> She stated that the ben nye banana was too light for her skintone</li>
            <li> but it was just too light for me as well</li>
            <li> The banana I found was too light  for me.  </li>
            <li> The translucent powder came earlier than predicted, and is great for controlling shine, just one issue can they find a way to improve the packaging to decrease the amount of spillage???</li>
            <li> Feels smooth and light on skin.</li>
            <li> I thought it wouldn&#x27;t fit my complexion</li>
            <li> The texture is also very good which is another reason why I want to try other colors.</li>
            <li> Love this products and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Very good coverage for medium to dark girls</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this, but it made my face orange.</li>
            <li> Worth the price!</li>
            <li> I received  many compliments on my makeup the first time I used this product.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and works very well with other cosmetics.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I must say, I made the right choice!</li>
            <li> I love how finely milled it is because it&#x27;s allowed to actually form to your skin &amp; not just sit on top of your foundation like sand on a sidewalk.</li>
            <li> I love this powder so much I use it every time I do my makeup.</li>
            <li> but, it actually did look good on my contouring .</li>
            <li> Wish it would have came in something that&#x27;s EASIER to dispence on your face but the product is cool</li>
            <li> The banana powder made me look ashy and white especially in my pictures but the topaz is perfect.  </li>
            <li> Luckily I bought the banana one</li>
            <li> My new favorite product to add to my makeup collection now and forever</li>
            <li> This is truly a pretty and unique color that blends so well with my foundation to set it, and captures the essence of my skin tone so well.  </li>
            <li> Much better for the girls of color who aren&#x27;t dark skin or light skin more in between.</li>
            <li> Shipping Was accurate &amp; fast.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product to anyone that has a warm caramel completion with yellow undertones.</li>
            <li> My makeup rarely creases and stays in place for the majority of my 12 hour days.</li>
            <li> I use it to set my under eye concealer but this area kind of looks ashy later on in the day.</li>
            <li> Love my new natural glow!!!!</li>
            <li> I choose this rating of this product because it was just the right color for my shade</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a super match for my skin but a good product.</li>
            <li> Although, I&#x27;ve only used it for nighttime occasions, the highlight makes my face pop and its a great addition to set my makeup (under eyes especially).</li>
            <li> Great for African American skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend this face powder for dark skin ladies because it gives your face a beautiful professional finish.</li>
            <li> But shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> Love this powder, I am ordering Banana next!</li>
            <li> when I first applied it I packed it on, (applied a lot of product)</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Ben Nye ,excellent product!</li>
            <li> I will definitely be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li> Well, I used this powder for the first time</li>
            <li> There aren&#x27;t instructions included so do your research online first</li>
            <li> It sets my concealer very well without leaving a look that I have makeup on!</li>
            <li> Love it &amp; will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I love the product but only give it a 4 because of the orange look on me.</li>
            <li> This is my first Ben Nye powder.</li>
            <li> This powder is not too orange as some people may say, it does highlight very well and prevents me from looking shiny!</li>
            <li> It fit with dark skin, I love it</li>
            <li> I have  red under tones this powder is perfect, I never thought I would like this,because of the prior powders I&#x27;ve tried as a finish look, I use this when I&#x27;m going for a natural look and natural it is .</li>
            <li> Very nice yellow high light under eyes for dark skin</li>
            <li> I will certainly purchase again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning with makeup being that I don&#x27;t wear it much.</li>
            <li> fit me for the highlighting parts on my face and it use to leave like a white tint and the powder didn&#x27;t cover the concealer like it should have.</li>
            <li> Very orange like color</li>
            <li> I have a caramel color skin complexion and it still showed up very orange</li>
            <li> Came in fast</li>
            <li> I then went to &amp;#34;camerareadycosmetics.com&amp;#34; and purchased the real Ben Nye powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Makes you look very put together.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to try the Ben Nye Banana powder, thanks to the ladies on U-tube for introducing me to this color.</li>
            <li> Haha funniest thing ever.</li>
            <li> Well it didn&#x27;t really meet my expectation</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t wear it as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> Reasonable price</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin and along with my primer, I no longer need to blot or freshen up during the day.</li>
            <li> its more orange than expected</li>
            <li> but I have changed it just to fit this in will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I like the texture of this powder and it is a very mattifying powder which I like.</li>
            <li> A good settled highlighter and costs a fraction of other similar products.</li>
            <li> Other than that the powder is ok.</li>
            <li> , it looks so natural on, and I did try it without a foundation first just to see what it looked like on my skin tone.  </li>
            <li> Looking to actually buy the other kind.</li>
            <li> I normally wear NW43 in MAC, just so you have an idea of my skin tone.</li>
            <li> this is the real shizz, its a fantastic highlight color for black girls, doesnt give the ashy look that banana does.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s you&#x27;re new to this stuff</li>
            <li> And coming from a black girl, trying to find a powder to set your highlight isn&#x27;t easy.</li>
            <li> This was a wild card based on the reviews and it worked!</li>
            <li> will set your concealer like no other!!!</li>
            <li> Ben Nye banana powder is a little too light</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the bottle was kind of hard to open - still trying to figure that out.</li>
            <li> It gives my face a natural look.</li>
            <li> I was surprised, i didn&#x27;t look as oily and I didn&#x27;t have to apply the product again.</li>
            <li> for lighter skinned girls, it blends really well when mixed with banana powder.</li>
            <li> Forgot the name of the one I found after I already bought this one, but do some searching before you buy directly from here.</li>
            <li> I really like this product I will definitely be purchasing it again.</li>
            <li> this is not a ben nye product&amp;#62;  first of all I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t realize ben nye products are in red lettering plus it has a a big BEN NYE logo in the upper left hand corner&amp;#62;  The powder for me wasn&#x27;t the right shade&amp;#62;  </li>
            <li> The powder is light and very messy.</li>
            <li> If u apply it correctly, this product is awesome.works very well on African American women!!</li>
            <li> Provide slight golden highlight.</li>
            <li> Depending on how deep your skin tone is this could be a bit on the orange side, so apply with a light hand a fluffy brush.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Wow, I can tell the difference between others that claim to do the same thing!</li>
            <li> This product will get every where if you are not careful.</li>
            <li> so be careful not to take too much.</li>
            <li> This product must be used lightly especially if the lighting indoors is dim.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s messy but product is worth</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m NW 48 in StudioFix Fluid), but I can definitely get for HALF the price and MORE product from other vendors.</li>
            <li> a medium/tan don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase this product, I later took off my makeup and applied the powder once again very lightly</li>
            <li> Nice powder, bad packaging.</li>
            <li> Love these powders, just wasn&#x27;t crazy for this shade</li>
            <li> But it is strange because sometimes I do use this to set my foundation and it seems to work</li>
            <li> but u only need a little so dis will last a long time.</li>
            <li> there&#x27;s a big mess.</li>
            <li> And a little goes a looong way so this tiny bit won&#x27;t be done any time soon.</li>
            <li> Just what I want expected.</li>
            <li> This is NOT a real Ben Nye product.</li>
            <li> and it was a total waste.</li>
            <li> I recommend this product especially to those who have had trouble with oily finishes.</li>
            <li> arrived before expected delivery.</li>
            <li> Then I Expected For The Cost</li>
            <li> you only need a few dusts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s darker than I expected.  </li>
            <li> It came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> It was received when expected.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have the banana powder and a little bit goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A LITTLE goes an incredibly long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a significantly LONG way.</li>
            <li> I think I will order again a little goed a long way</li>
            <li> a little bit goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even need a lot; a little goes a long way and leaves a velvety look.</li>
            <li> Once a week or every other week.</li>
            <li> I want to try other colors for my skintone.</li>
            <li> Remember a little goes a long way !</li>
            <li> Other than that the product lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> and can be used on a wide range of skin tones!</li>
            <li> It came quicker than expected!</li>
            <li> Gives a sun kissed look on dark mocha skin</li>
            <li> I have a dark skin tone like chocolate</li>
            <li> Dark skinned and after reading the reviews decided to get this.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Total let down.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m black and I use this almost every time I wear makeup.</li>
            <li> as i thought a little to orange.</li>
            <li> This powder is a little bit orange</li>
            <li> It was a little lighter than I</li>
            <li> Amazon has never let me down!</li>
            <li> I make it one of my everyday routines to wear this with my makeup</li>
            <li> But anyways you medium skinned ladies who are not a light medium but</li>
            <li> It is not cakey or heavy on the skin.</li>
            <li> The powder does not leave the skin looking pale or ashy.</li>
            <li> Not Good for dark skin females..</li>
            <li> Not sure if I will ever use it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a dark skinned woman (approximately Kelly Rowland&#x27;s skin tone)</li>
            <li> so I am a little confused about this color</li>
            <li> but I should have know something was off because of the price&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sad that people are so desperate that they&#x27;ll use someone else to further their profits  DONT PURCHASE</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m dark skin and was skeptical about this powder</li>
            <li> Very disappointed product is too orange not translucent at all very upset !!</li>
            <li> Has a red tone base should order a lighter shade</li>
            <li> This is a FAKE.</li>
            <li> but I choosed the wrong color</li>
            <li> A lot of people are obsessed with the Ben Nye Banana Powder for setting highlights.  </li>
            <li> but I wonder if I need to try another color because although I like this topaz, I think the undertone is the wrong one for my skin.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d say it wasn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> This is a must have, buy this today you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I don&#x27;t hate this powder</li>
            <li> I would post a picture, but it&#x27;s just too horrible to show.</li>
            <li> I hate this product!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have  red under tones this powder is perfect, I never thought I would like this,because of the prior powders I&#x27;ve tried as a finish look, I use this when I&#x27;m going for a natural look and natural it is .</li>
            <li> Just what I want expected. Great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still learning with makeup being that I don&#x27;t wear it much. I just needed this in my kit. The container could be better. I couldn&#x27;t get the top off so once I did I left it off and every time I open it to use it there&#x27;s a big mess. Other than that the powder is ok. It&#x27;s not a super match for my skin but a good product.</li>
            <li> Bottle size was misleading</li>
            <li> This has changed my make up forever!  I could go all day n not worry about excess shine</li>
            <li> A good settled highlighter and costs a fraction of other similar products.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed product is too orange not translucent at all very upset !!</li>
            <li> I fell for the hoopla...the seller delivered product in timely manner...but the product...meh...</li>
            <li> I am glad I went with this instead of banana. Caramel color, mixed Race. Looks beautiful.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE,  LOVE!! I&#x27;m an African american female with a medium/dark skin tone and when I do my make up I do the highlighting and contouring method.. I use to use cover girl fit me for the highlighting parts on my face and it use to leave like a white tint and the powder didn&#x27;t cover the concealer like it should have. Not Good for dark skin females.. But this product is HEAVEN SENT!! Not only does it cover the concealer but it gives your face a goldish hint/hue and a smooth finish when u r done. It just blends so well with a darker complexion.</li>
            <li> Nice finish to face makeup. A little goes a long way. Great for women of color or just want a deeper hue to face.</li>
            <li> Very orange like color I have a caramel color skin complexion and it still showed up very orange</li>
            <li> Omg im n love this totally worth the price.. sets my highlight to perfection! A must BUY! Its not to light either for us brown toned ladies!!  It came just in time for my birthday! !!</li>
            <li> Came in fast it looks great on my darkskin üíïüòç</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved it!!! I&#x27;m a dark toned woman and it worked perfectly. A must as a makeup artist</li>
            <li> I love this setting powder. Great product.</li>
            <li> A must have for every makeup wearer of a deeper skin tone. Gives a sun kissed look on dark mocha skin</li>
            <li> Best powder ever. Like im in love with it. Cant stop using it</li>
            <li> Great product, Ben Nye face powder... Wow, I can tell the difference between others that claim to do the same thing! I can&#x27;t wait to buy the banana face powder.</li>
            <li> love this ben Nye. I have the banana powder and a little bit goes a long way.  I use this with my foundation to set.  it works great.</li>
            <li> this is not a ben nye product&amp;#62;  first of all I don&#x27;t know why I didn&#x27;t realize ben nye products are in red lettering plus it has a a big BEN NYE logo in the upper left hand corner&amp;#62;  The powder for me wasn&#x27;t the right shade&amp;#62;  Its not as smooth as ben nye but I should have know something was off because of the price&amp;#62;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;sad that people are so desperate that they&#x27;ll use someone else to further their profits  DONT PURCHASE</li>
            <li> I was excited to receive this, but it made my face orange. I would post a picture, but it&#x27;s just too horrible to show. I actually watched You Tube videos before applying.  I&#x27;m going to try to Banana powder next and hopefully I&#x27;ll get better result.</li>
            <li> Its like perfection in a bottle</li>
            <li> I choose this rating of this product because it was just the right color for my shade and it makes my skin look radiant and flawless.</li>
            <li> I only apply it once when I do use it. Once a week or every other week. I&#x27;m not a daily makeup person.</li>
            <li> If I mix it with a lighter color I can achieve the perfect color</li>
            <li> It good but not as good..as i thought a little to orange. But shipping was very fast</li>
            <li> This is NOT a real Ben Nye product. Do not purchase</li>
            <li> you have to kow how to really work this product, very loose, so be careful</li>
            <li> Love this powder esp for my skin tone</li>
            <li> I just love this powder!!</li>
            <li> DO NOT PURCHASE ... This is a FAKE. I purchased this and it was a total waste. It creased my highlight under my eye ao baaaad. I then went to &amp;#34;camerareadycosmetics.com&amp;#34; and purchased the real Ben Nye powder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Total let down. Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> This product will get every where if you are not careful. I think this worked well with my brown skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Very happy</li>
            <li> I ordered the banana powder and I love it! This powder is a little bit orange so I have to mix it with the Banana powder for darker skin tone.</li>
            <li> I should have bought a lighter shade. Make me look Orange not a fan art all, suits on counter not being used</li>
            <li> OMG! OMG! OMG! this is the real shizz, its a fantastic highlight color for black girls, doesnt give the ashy look that banana does.</li>
            <li> Love this powder, I am ordering Banana next! It goes on great and it really opens up your eyes when used with concealer</li>
            <li> If u apply it correctly, this product is awesome.works very well on African American women!! Best highlight/setting powder for this price IN my opinion! !!!!!</li>
            <li> Nice powder, bad packaging. Worth the price! Makes you look very put together. I use it on my brown skin as an all over, and as a bronzer and contour on my best friend who is white. Looks great on either complexion.</li>
            <li> Love it! Very smooth finish</li>
            <li> Love my new natural glow!!!!</li>
            <li> I recommend this product for all brown skin beauties!!! This is a must have, buy this today you will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The color is more orange than I thought it would be.  Not sure if I will ever use it cause I have no idea who to use it on.</li>
            <li> I love it. I use it on top of my conceler and bronzer. It gives my face a natural look.</li>
            <li> I love my product it arrived promptly I make it one of my everyday routines to wear this with my makeup</li>
            <li> I am NC 50 in MAC. I ordered this to set my highlight, and it works nicely. I was worried that it would be too orange, but it isn&#x27;t. It is a great setting powder. It makes the skin look flawless.</li>
            <li> This is truly a pretty and unique color that blends so well with my foundation to set it, and captures the essence of my skin tone so well.  I love this color, it looks so natural on, and I did try it without a foundation first just to see what it looked like on my skin tone.  I love this color match for my skin, it is a wonderful match even without my foundation.  I can&#x27;t wait to try the Ben Nye Banana powder, thanks to the ladies on U-tube for introducing me to this color.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews about this powder and I noticed a lot of African american women buying the powder, my skin tone is  medium/tan when I first applied it I packed it on, (applied a lot of product) I thought it looked so amazing and full coverage until I looked in the mirror of the car and I was legit orange!!! Haha funniest thing ever. But anyways you medium skinned ladies who are not a light medium but a medium/tan don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase this product, I later took off my makeup and applied the powder once again very lightly and it gave me very great coverage! I was surprised, i didn&#x27;t look as oily and I didn&#x27;t have to apply the product again. So great for my oily skin. (I do have pimpols) it covered them pretty good. So remember if you are close to my skin tone do not apply this product heavily apply it with a fluffy powder brush and lightly apply it to your face.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful and works very well with other cosmetics.  I recommend this product especially to those who have had trouble with oily finishes.</li>
            <li> Yup yup good stuff! Texture and quality is perfection, its very smooth and a perfect highlighter, I&#x27;m glad I got this instead of the banana üòä And a little goes a looong way so this tiny bit won&#x27;t be done any time soon.</li>
            <li> Does not give the ashy effect. I love how finely milled it is because it&#x27;s allowed to actually form to your skin &amp; not just sit on top of your foundation like sand on a sidewalk.</li>
            <li> Love it! Works great for my under eye area. I&#x27;m a dark skinned woman (approximately Kelly Rowland&#x27;s skin tone) and I&#x27;m glad I chose this over the banana powder. A LITTLE goes an incredibly long way.</li>
            <li> this powder has and absolutely amazing finish to the skin. it does have an orange undertone. will definitely recommend this to darker/brown skinned girls. for lighter skinned girls, it blends really well when mixed with banana powder. arrived before expected delivery. very satisfied thank you</li>
            <li> will set your concealer like no other!!!</li>
            <li> now I can sweat all day and not worry:)</li>
            <li> I like the texture of this product and the smooth finish I get from it.</li>
            <li> Favorite under eye concealer setting powder. I&#x27;m black and I use this almost every time I wear makeup. A little goes a significantly LONG way.</li>
            <li> Love this products and very fast shipping</li>
            <li> Saw it being used by a lot of beauty gurus on Youtube and I decided to give it a try... (after hearing them talk about how nice it was..) Well it didn&#x27;t really meet my expectation but it&#x27;s manageable ...  just didn&#x27;t blend well with my kind tone.</li>
            <li> works good for under eye makeup came really fast I think I will order again a little goed a long way</li>
            <li> Received it n luv it....</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with Ben Nye ,excellent product!</li>
            <li> This powder is to red for my skin town.  Don&#x27;t wear it as much as I thought I would.</li>
            <li> My new favorite product to add to my makeup collection now and forever</li>
            <li> Not so happy about this - makes me break out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a perfect color on my skin.  I have a dark skin tone like chocolate</li>
            <li> I like how it smooths my skin after applying concealer.</li>
            <li> I liked the product. I got compliments galore on my skin tone with the Ben Nye Topaz luxury powder.</li>
            <li> My inspiration to buy this was when I saw one of my fav makeup gurus on youtube (lover4fashion) use this to set her undereye highlight. She stated that the ben nye banana was too light for her skintone and I&#x27;m about a shade darker than her...then I saw another one of my favs (ulovemegz) use it so I haddd to check it out. I already had the banana powder but it was just too light for me as well but the topaz is bombbbbb for chocolately girls like me! Dis was the 1.4 oz. but u only need a little so dis will last a long time. I will definitely be reordering again! Amazon has never let me down! I highlyyyyy recommend dis to all my beautiful chocolate women!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best thing ive ever bought. It just makes my face look so much better. And coming from a black girl, trying to find a powder to set your highlight isn&#x27;t easy. This was the best investment ive made all year so far.</li>
            <li> Nice product for contouring and as a summer foundation substitute.</li>
            <li> Seen YouTubers rave over this product and now I see why. I feel like such a pro using this and it&#x27;s a great product. I will definitely be purchasing more of this.</li>
            <li> Love it!!!Helps keep my oily face with a matte finish all day...a little bit goes a long way. Indeed a great purchase and no regrets.</li>
            <li> Very nice yellow high light under eyes for dark skin I use it with banana powder to make brighter highlight on nights out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a brown skinned woman and took a chance on the topaz Ben Nye Face Powder. It&#x27;s absolutely stunning. Although, I&#x27;ve only used it for nighttime occasions, the highlight makes my face pop and its a great addition to set my makeup (under eyes especially). I would recommend this topaz color to those brown skin ladies who are thinking that the original banana powder color is too light!</li>
            <li> Works with most complexions but, I want to try other colors for my skintone. great highlight setting&amp; finish.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t use this , tried it once an loved it</li>
            <li> Love, Love, Love this power. A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> ehh, don&#x27;t believe the hype. I thought that I was going to see an tramatic difference but NAHHH, lol. This is definitely one of those things that people go for because of the name.</li>
            <li> Pretty awesome product! Downside it has parabens</li>
            <li> Much better for the girls of color who aren&#x27;t dark skin or light skin more in between. The banana I found was too light  for me.  I don&#x27;t like that noticeable brightness under the eyes in pics which the banana would cause.</li>
            <li> Great!!! Enjoying. üòÑüòÑ</li>
            <li> Came on time, has awesome coverage and blend well, I don&#x27;t like the shaker top it&#x27;s messy but product is worth the purchase will order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s  OK getting use to it</li>
            <li> Very good coverage for medium to dark girls</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this powder</li>
            <li> Shipping Was accurate &amp; fast. Love the product its amazing. Will recommended. &amp; purchase from seller again !</li>
            <li> Product works great!  Reasonable price and I received the item the next day</li>
            <li> smaller than i thought</li>
            <li> Great product for my skin tone (I&#x27;m NW 48 in StudioFix Fluid), but I can definitely get for HALF the price and MORE product from other vendors. Forgot the name of the one I found after I already bought this one, but do some searching before you buy directly from here. What I will say is that if you do want to skip the hassle of searching, this size is great if you&#x27;re trying to test out the product. In that sense, the price is ok since you still have to find out if you even like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the bottle was kind of hard to open - still trying to figure that out.</li>
            <li> I hate this product! It does not block the oil and it makes your face look orange. Will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I really like this product I will definitely be purchasing it again. Although It was only the 1.5 ounce one instead of the 3 oz.</li>
            <li> Nice powder! Great for African American skin</li>
            <li> Absolutely great product.  The color, it seems very silky, and its very easy to blend, goes perfect on brown skin.  I will certainly purchase again</li>
            <li> Great product but I choosed the wrong color</li>
            <li> Ben Nye Topaz Powder is AWESOME. I use it as a setting powder for my highlighted areas. It is not cakey or heavy on the skin. The powder does not leave the skin looking pale or ashy. I have very oily skin and along with my primer, I no longer need to blot or freshen up during the day. I would recommend this product to anyone that has a warm caramel completion with yellow undertones. Often times I use the powder as an all over face setter, even when I am not doing any highlighting. Works great for me ! Remember a little goes a long way !</li>
            <li> The translucent powder came earlier than predicted, and is great for controlling shine, just one issue can they find a way to improve the packaging to decrease the amount of spillage??? Other than that the product lives up to the hype.</li>
            <li> Awesome Awesome!!!! I love this powder so much I use it every time I do my makeup. It is great for setting creams and liquids! and can be used on a wide range of skin tones!</li>
            <li> This is what I was looking for. Shipping was fast and packaging was great.  Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try Ben Nye powder-- happy I tried this color. Very nice addition to my makeup routine.</li>
            <li> Love it! This was a wild card based on the reviews and it worked!</li>
            <li> I love this! Perfect for brown girls!!!</li>
            <li> Revived banana power instead of topaz</li>
            <li> its more orange than expected</li>
            <li> Well, I used this powder for the first time and I&#x27;d say it wasn&#x27;t so bad. I&#x27;m dark skin and was skeptical about this powder but, it actually did look good on my contouring .</li>
            <li> Wish it would have came in something that&#x27;s EASIER to dispence on your face but the product is cool</li>
            <li> Awesome product &amp; Awesome service!</li>
            <li> It Was Way Smaller Then I Expected For The Cost Haven&#x27;t Used It Yet</li>
            <li> Great product. Looking to actually buy the other kind. This one is translucent.</li>
            <li> Arrived before expected date and the product matched my skin tone perfectly. The product was in perfect condition and it blends extremely well.</li>
            <li> A lot of people are obsessed with the Ben Nye Banana Powder for setting highlights.  I am a darker-skinned woman and find that the Topaz is a perfect highlight powder for my shade.  I use the Chestnut and/or Nutmeg for the rest of my face.  I get many compliments on my makeup when set with Ben Nye.  I am an official fan!</li>
            <li> I would definitley recommend this for women of darker complexions. The banana powder made me look ashy and white especially in my pictures but the topaz is perfect.  A little goes a long way so be careful not to take too much. It also looks better when its blended with a beauty blender or sponge.</li>
            <li> It was ok. Not so amazing like it portrayed all over YouTube. The powder is light and very messy. One dap of the brush looks like I clapped a chalk board eraser together. I&#x27;m African american and my skin is of a caramel tone so I thought this was best, but it made me look orange. Luckily I bought the banana one, that one looks better on me and blends well. There aren&#x27;t instructions included so do your research online first it&#x27;s you&#x27;re new to this stuff</li>
            <li> I always wanted to try Ban Nye powder because of the effects it has on my celebrities such as Nene Leakes and Kim Kardashians contouring. And I must say I love it! I thought the container would be much bigger for the price but its powder you only need a few dusts. I have always lacked a glow to my skin but this powder sure does give me it.I received  many compliments on my makeup the first time I used this product. I already adored my makeup routine but I have changed it just to fit this in will definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve done research on Ben Nye Finishing Powders and there is a lot controversy about the way the colors show in pictures. I decided to go with the Topaz because I didn&#x27;t want to look like a monster if I took a picture with a flash with the Banana. &amp; I must say, I made the right choice! It sets my concealer very well without leaving a look that I have makeup on! For those of you who are wondering, I am NW45 in MAC Pro Longwear Foundation. This powder was perfect for my complexion. Love it &amp; will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s darker than I expected.  Was hoping from something brighter in order to set highlights.</li>
            <li> Outstanding face powder</li>
            <li> After watching several tutorials on the ben nye I thought I would give it a shot, boy am I happy I did. This is my NEW favorite highlighter!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this product. Will order again</li>
            <li> Great product!  It came faster than I expected.</li>
            <li> My skin tone is a mix of warm and cool colors.  Ben Nye&#x27;s banana washes me out for this reason but the topaz color is a mix of warm and cool tones and it fits my shade more flawlessly.  I get no flash back.  My makeup rarely creases and stays in place for the majority of my 12 hour days.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.  Exactly what I expected!</li>
            <li> Great product for the &amp;#34;BROWNIES&amp;#34;!!! Ben Nye banana powder is a little too light so I opted to go with the topaz!! Great choice!! Yayyyy Me!! I won!!</li>
            <li> lovely item i am glad i got it. i think i will try the banana next time to see the difference</li>
            <li> I like this..good product.</li>
            <li> Just received it and I love the quality but for my complexion which is medium brown it looks a bit orange. I use it with Ben nye banana and it looks much better. This product must be used lightly especially if the lighting indoors is dim. I love the product but only give it a 4 because of the orange look on me. I&#x27;ll stick to Ben Nye Banana :)</li>
            <li> Dark skinned and after reading the reviews decided to get this. Amazing! I absolutely love it. Feels smooth and light on skin.</li>
            <li> It came quicker than expected! I love that. And it&#x27;s perfect. I thought it wouldn&#x27;t fit my complexion but this is the best thing I&#x27;ve spent my money on. Im definitely gonna buy it again</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!  It feels like silk on my skin. I don&#x27;t even need a lot; a little goes a long way and leaves a velvety look. I really like it, and the color is perfect for my brown skin.</li>
            <li> Love these powders, just wasn&#x27;t crazy for this shade</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the my purchase. It was received when expected. The product is amazing.</li>
            <li> Has a red tone base should order a lighter shade</li>
            <li> this product left blotches on my skin that make it look like it was caked on</li>
            <li> very amazing powder, sits well on any foundation.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It was a little lighter than I imagined(reason I gave it 4 stars). However, I can  work with it. The product itself is great! It stays on all day and it does not makes me crease at all and that is a plus!!</li>
            <li> I love.. love.. love this Stuff!</li>
            <li> This is my first Ben Nye powder. I didn&#x27;t think the banana powder would work for me since I am darkskinned but I wonder if I need to try another color because although I like this topaz, I think the undertone is the wrong one for my skin. I like the texture of this powder and it is a very mattifying powder which I like. I use it to set my under eye concealer but this area kind of looks ashy later on in the day. But it is strange because sometimes I do use this to set my foundation and it seems to work so I am a little confused about this color but I do want to try a darker shade to see whether it works better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I don&#x27;t hate this powder but I don&#x27;t love it either (besides the mattifying ability). The texture is also very good which is another reason why I want to try other colors.</li>
            <li> This is an incredible product!!! I&#x27;m about to buy another jar!</li>
            <li> I normally wear NW43 in MAC, just so you have an idea of my skin tone. This is the better one,(in my opinion) for  my skin tone. This powder is not too orange as some people may say, it does highlight very well and prevents me from looking shiny! Absolutely love and would buy again!</li>
            <li> The Ben Nye Topaz Face Powder is a good buy.  It makes your face look so even and flawless. I would recommend this face powder for dark skin ladies because it gives your face a beautiful professional finish.</li>
            <li> Provide slight golden highlight. Love it for under eyes. Perfect for deep/dark skin tones</li>
            <li> This is very light weight, blends beautifully into the skin.  Depending on how deep your skin tone is this could be a bit on the orange side, so apply with a light hand a fluffy brush.</li>
            <li> Love the color! I had initially bought the banana but it didn&#x27;t go too well with my warm undertones. Topaz is a much better fit.</li>
            <li> It fit with dark skin, I love it</li>
            <li> Great product. I will purchase again.</li>
            <li> Ben Nye Topaz face powder&lt;br /&gt;I wore it to a birthday party and the ladies was asking me who did my make up and I said Ben Nye and they asked for the number and I was dying of laughter that well my make looked I was very impressed!!! I plan to order all the other colors its Excellent!!! I was a hit&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Ben Nye ‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
