    <ol>
            <li>Beautiful, natural-looking shade!</li>
            <li>but it came out just beautifully.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was so happy to see that I could order it from here.  </li>
            <li>This is a great color and it can&#x27;t be found in the Walmart or Drug Stores in my area.</li>
            <li>and I always have good results.</li>
            <li>I love, love, love the color!!!</li>
            <li>I love the Camel Kiss #72, and can&#x27;t believe they carry it at amazon!</li>
            <li>Love this color!</li>
            <li>It is a nice color</li>
            <li>(but would have liked that).</li>
            <li>I liked the gentleness of the product, ease of product</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, since the box says it is a &#x27;warm&#x27; color</li>
            <li>I love this color but can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere in the stores</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT AND CANT FIND IT ANY STORE</li>
            <li>I love this shade and it goes well with my coloring.  </li>
            <li>I am sure this color is great for some people, hence the 3 star rating, but I would warn natural blonds with highlights or people with bleached hair to stay away from this color!</li>
            <li>beautiful natural</li>
            <li>A beautiful color for a natural blond.</li>
            <li>I mix two colors together to get a very natural color with great highlights.</li>
            <li>Easy to use</li>
            <li>I love this product, and the &amp;#34;Caramel Kiss&amp;#34; is my new favorite shade!</li>
            <li>but the model is fair skinned and light haired naturally so that could be the difference.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be this light anyway</li>
            <li>but as I was dying my hair, the processing color was purplish and not orangish like warm colors normally are.</li>
            <li>ok the first box i got</li>
            <li>i was so excited</li>
            <li>Maybe if I dyed my hair month after month with this exact color it would be more true to the box...</li>
            <li>Most certainly it was a defective dye however now</li>
            <li>I just dyed it last night, and am very happy to see ME back!</li>
            <li>I have heard this fades quickly too.</li>
            <li>My new growth took the color more, as it always does.</li>
            <li>Yup just the right color.</li>
            <li>I think the $10 price is a lot better then paying $100-200 and then having to pay again and again for what I think are almost the same results.</li>
            <li>It really is a pretty color though.</li>
            <li>if I can find this specific color at my favorite stores.</li>
            <li>(I have used Garnier and it covers grey better, to me).</li>
            <li>Thanks for having it online.</li>
            <li>Feria is great because it creates subtle highlights, and this color looks very natural.</li>
            <li>Also, you don&#x27;t get that chemically smell afterwards like you do with so many other hair products.  </li>
            <li>On top of the color being wrong, it turned my highlights a light purple!</li>
            <li>I will try #73 next time, which is more golden than red, but I didn&#x27;t feel this was that red at all.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;m going to try golden sunset next</li>
            <li>I have naturally dish water blonde hair, and the results are exactly like the box.</li>
            <li>The color comes out true to the picture, which almost never happens with other hair colors.  </li>
            <li>It dyed my light blonde hair pink at the roots and temples.</li>
            <li>I have used this product for years but, could not find my shade at ant store near my home.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I would like improved is that it would not fade so fast.</li>
            <li>and it was thinner than the Garnier that I usually use so easy to cover all hair.</li>
            <li>Yet my grey temples did not take the color very well</li>
    </ol>

            <li> but the color turned my naturally blond hair a dark ASH blond!</li>

            <li> I wanted to deepen my hair color and add a little red to it</li>

            <li> I have a visible muddy pink tone to my hair.</li>
            <li> It may fade over the next few weeks, but I never really noticed it.</li>
            <li> , i used it, it colored nothing, waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;amazon</li>
            <li> you are told NOT to wash your hair before putting on their very heavy conditioning cream.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this hair color for at least 8 years now and no problems what so ever, besides the fact that it&#x27;s  hit or miss</li>
            <li> I had been using a lighter color, and was never really happy with it.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t not wash my dirty hair after coloring for 25 mins.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> I love, love, love the color!!! Feria is great because it creates subtle highlights, and this color looks very natural. It&#x27;s become my \\&quot;regular\\&quot; color.</li>
            <li> I love this color but can&#x27;t seem to find it anywhere in the stores</li>
            <li> I have been trying to find this color for 2 years now, as my local stores aren&#x27;t carrying it anymore. I love the Camel Kiss #72, and can&#x27;t believe they carry it at amazon! It never occurred to me to look here. I had been using a lighter color, and was never really happy with it. I just dyed it last night, and am very happy to see ME back! It may fade over the next few weeks, but I never really noticed it. I think the $10 price is a lot better then paying $100-200 and then having to pay again and again for what I think are almost the same results. I have naturally dish water blonde hair, and the results are exactly like the box. I&#x27;m going to start the auto-shipment with my next order.</li>
            <li> It is a nice color but I am on the fence with it. I think I&#x27;m going to try golden sunset next, I feel this is a bit too red for me personally.It really is a pretty color though.</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t purchase this color from here. It dyed my light blonde hair pink at the roots and temples. Most certainly it was a defective dye however now I have a visible muddy pink tone to my hair. Buyer beware. Check the color of the dye before you mix it.</li>
            <li> The color comes out true to the picture, which almost never happens with other hair colors.  Also, you don&#x27;t get that chemically smell afterwards like you do with so many other hair products.  It leaves your hair in great condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Feria for several years now and I always have good results. Love this color! Easy to use</li>
            <li> I have been using this color of Feria for a long time.  It is extremely hard to find in stores, and I have had to resort to using alternative colors, all of which I did not like nearly as well.  I was so happy to see that I could order it from here.  I am going to buy several at a time and stock up!</li>
            <li> My hair did not come out like the color on the box, but I&#x27;m starting off with medium brown hair so I wouldn&#x27;t expect it to be this light anyway (but would have liked that). So mine is similar in tone but about two or three shades darker. It seemed to go on evenly but in daylight did not look even. My new growth took the color more, as it always does. Yet my grey temples did not take the color very well (I have used Garnier and it covers grey better, to me). I liked the gentleness of the product, ease of product but I did not like you are told NOT to wash your hair before putting on their very heavy conditioning cream.  I just couldn&#x27;t not wash my dirty hair after coloring for 25 mins. (although I may have only had it on 20...I got nervous seeing the color turn pinky purple). So I washed it and then put on their conditioner that I did not like the feel of...did not make hair feel silky. I have heard this fades quickly too. I will try #73 next time, which is more golden than red, but I didn&#x27;t feel this was that red at all. Maybe if I dyed my hair month after month with this exact color it would be more true to the box...but the model is fair skinned and light haired naturally so that could be the difference. I did like that there was plenty mixture for my below shoulder length hair and it was thinner than the Garnier that I usually use so easy to cover all hair.</li>
            <li> Yup just the right color. I was scared when the dye turned a red color but it came out just beautifully.</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of the Feria brand, but this color (Caramel Kiss 72) washed me out. I wanted to deepen my hair color and add a little red to it but the color turned my naturally blond hair a dark ASH blond! I don&#x27;t know why, since the box says it is a &#x27;warm&#x27; color but as I was dying my hair, the processing color was purplish and not orangish like warm colors normally are. On top of the color being wrong, it turned my highlights a light purple! It looks like I have gray streaks now!! I am sure this color is great for some people, hence the 3 star rating, but I would warn natural blonds with highlights or people with bleached hair to stay away from this color!</li>
            <li> This is a great color and it can&#x27;t be found in the Walmart or Drug Stores in my area. Thanks for having it online.</li>
            <li> ok the first box i got i was so excited, i used it, it colored nothing, waste of time and money.&lt;br /&gt;amazon sent me a second box i had to pay for, i couldnt return it, thanx amazon!</li>
            <li> beautiful natural I mix two colors together to get a very natural color with great highlights. I use this with 74</li>
            <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS COLOR FOR 10 PLUS YEARS! I LOVE IT AND CANT FIND IT ANY STORE</li>
            <li> Beautiful, natural-looking shade! I love this product, and the &amp;#34;Caramel Kiss&amp;#34; is my new favorite shade!</li>
            <li> I have been using this color for years and constantly get comments on my hair color. Some people think I have highlights even. I have been using this hair color for at least 8 years now and no problems what so ever, besides the fact that it&#x27;s  hit or miss if I can find this specific color at my favorite stores. One month they have it and I will buy all the boxes (like 3) on the shelf, and then it&#x27;s gone for months. So I&#x27;ve now gone to Amazon for a reliable monthly supply.</li>
            <li> A beautiful color for a natural blond.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for years but, could not find my shade at ant store near my home. So I started to purchase it on line. Which works for  me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda B</li>
            <li> I like L&#x27;Oreal products.  I love this shade and it goes well with my coloring.  The only thing that I would like improved is that it would not fade so fast.</li>
