            <li>As a frequent camper I often get allergies from the outdoors.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this oil as a natural decongestant for my sinus problems.</li>
            <li>Ill be coming back for more!</li>

            <li>Be careful, it is very strong and made me feel nauseated.  </li>

            <li> Not really sure how I want to use this, or if I will.</li>
            <li> Not sure what I can do to dilute it without changing the scent.</li>

            <li> Fast delivery and packaged well, from the reviews it was said to smell just like smudging but not to me, smells good but not like the Indian smudging</li>
            <li> You can tell this is a quality product as soon as you open the bottle!</li>
            <li> I use it but don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> Quality product but the price is prohibitive for a Shaving soap production run such as I produce. I&#x27;ll make and use my own tincture in the future.</li>
            <li> Five stars all the way.  There is limited availability of white sage oil.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it was easy to find on the website. Shipping was fast and free (with over $25 purchase).&lt;br /&gt;The scent of this is wonderful and cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;We are using this to cleanse our new house.</li>

            <li> This is the best Salvia Apiana essential oil I&#x27;ve used thus far.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is it&#x27;s actually affordable, as well as, great quality.&lt;br /&gt;Also, a great seller to purchase from. Thank you.</li>
            <li> The scent is perfect....this is the real deal.  It smells exactly the way the burning leaves smell.  I cannot wait to see the different uses that this oil can serve.  If anyone has a link to recipes of mixed essential oils that includes this, please share!</li>
            <li> I am very happy to add THIS white sage to my essential oils collection! Arrived in a fair amount of time, priced well too!</li>

            <li> Very sage scent. Good value for the price.</li>
            <li> This is the best! Did some research on asian beetles and this helps to repel them from the home. Love it!</li>
            <li> Really into the white sage for many different applications &amp; its pretty pricey.  I got this to try to be sure I was happy with this EO &amp; I am very happy with it.</li>
            <li> As a frequent camper I often get allergies from the outdoors.  I take a few drops in the palm of my hand, add a little splash of water, cup my hands over my nose and mouth and breathe in deeply. it certainly seems to work...relieves my sinus pressure/inflammation and soothes my air passage ways. I would highly recommend this oil. It came with some fresh white sage leaves which was really cool!</li>
            <li> Awesome product the real thing here highly recommend this item, accept no immitation.</li>
            <li> I like using just a few drops of this in the car.  I put in the plug in aroma diffuser.</li>
            <li> Try finding White sage essential oil anywhere. You just can&#x27;t. Until now. I love dabbing this on anything needing a little clearing. Or, add it to a some purified water and spray.  I am so glad I found it here and at a great price.</li>
            <li> I purchased this oil as a natural decongestant for my sinus problems. The aroma was earthy, fresh, pungent and complex, yet not overpowering. I must say as a life long user of various essential oils, this company knows whats up. They seem to have mastered the art of making exquisite oil. Ill be coming back for more!</li>
