            <li>I will always keep some handy!</li>
            <li>After all of the years this product has been around, this is still the best for removing most stains.</li>
            <li>Not as good as what I thought I remembered using years ago.</li>
            <li>After soaking up excess with a paper towel, I spray a good coat of K2R on the surface</li>
            <li>The product is good, if you can get it out of the can.  </li>
            <li>good bye</li>
            <li>Love this product, it&#x27;s great for removing grease spots.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this.</li>
            <li>I was happy to be able to buy this spot remover again that I used to use often on my clothes.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t find this product in stores any more, so I was so happy to find it online.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve liked this product for many years , works great</li>
            <li>Received the product very fast and in perfect shape.  </li>
            <li>As I remembered it&#x27;s best to take care with your first spray.</li>
            <li>I was worried I could not find it any more in shops around here!</li>
            <li>Love it and will never be without it again!</li>
            <li>I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>and I decided to try it and love it!  </li>
            <li>Love this product!  </li>
            <li>5 more words !</li>
            <li>This is a great easy to use on the spot whenever you drop liquid, oily food or anything that stains on your cloth/furniture...</li>
            <li>You may have to use 2 times but it&#x27;s f&#x27;n amazing.</li>
            <li>Found it here at the amazing Elliot&#x27;s Hardware in Dallas and took it home.</li>
            <li>This spot remover is amazing.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as I remember.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay but not as good.  </li>
            <li>so I keep this stuff handy</li>
            <li>Read the label for good info for appropriate fabrics.</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for many years now and it is consistently good at removing spots.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s kind.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty incredible.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find it here in upstate NY, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>By far the best cleaner I have used.</li>
            <li>so was very glad to see it was still available online.</li>
            <li>seemed to be too good to be true.  </li>
            <li>I was able to get the stains out with one treatment.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s the best cleaner for spots on white carpet without leaving a trace.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been able to remove any/ever stain from it, except OIL.  </li>
            <li>When that did not work, I knew I&#x27;d need something stronger, but what to use that would be safe for microfiber?     </li>
            <li>This product has saved many, many things for us over the years.          </li>
            <li>I have never found a product that is better at removing grease/oil stains from material/clothing.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>bought this and is now my favorite spot cleaner.</li>
            <li>It works better than most on removing stains from clothing.</li>
            <li>I tried this on three different stains, and at best it made no difference.  </li>
            <li>We Love IT.  </li>
            <li>I could not push the spray top on the can to use it.  </li>
            <li>SO GLAD</li>
            <li>I am pleased to find this.</li>
            <li>I have been able to save so many stained clothing with this product.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff</li>
            <li>Works better than anything.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>I have been using K2r for many years.  </li>
            <li>I really couldn&#x27;t be happy about my laundry if I didn&#x27;t have this to use.</li>
            <li>Nothing works better.  </li>
            <li>Save your money because anything is better than this.</li>
            <li>I have tried many products, but NONE work as well as K2R.  </li>
            <li>and I feel better about it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find it in the grocery stores, so was glad to be able to order it via Amazon.</li>
            <li>Ordered by mistake but am glad to have it.  </li>
            <li>I love that it drys to a powder and</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re probably can ask for a better cleaning solvent for carpets.</li>
            <li>The brush on the top SHOULD NOT be used on material like this.  </li>
            <li>Make sure to use it in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li>Forget the goofy plastic bristle top.  </li>
            <li>It worked, mostly.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;1)Just follow the instructions it was able to remove  </li>
            <li>This product has been around for many years</li>
            <li>this says it&#x27;s safe to use on &amp;#34;dry-clean only&amp;#34; clothing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This was easy to use and worked better than we had hoped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The former good stuff had a fair amount af</li>
            <li>I am glad that it is available on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li>It is sooo easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It does have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li>Good product, highly recommended by the fabric industry.  </li>
            <li>The fumes are pretty amazing, too.</li>
            <li>Worked fine</li>
            <li>Make sure fabric is color safe first.</li>
            <li>Works fine.</li>
            <li>Probably better for our environment, but not as effective as the old version.</li>
            <li>This K2r Is fantastic, I tried everything to take a stain out of my Microfiber chair and</li>
            <li>, it is fantastic, leaves no marks at all.  </li>
            <li>Light shirts get ring around the collar after 1 wear.  </li>
            <li>It especially works great on ties.</li>
            <li>Seems it&#x27;s no longer available in stores, or I can&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li>We recently moved and the top of our beautiful recliner looked like it had been drug around in someone&#x27;s garage (thanks to our movers).  </li>
            <li>although the husband said he could no longer see it, I did one more spray, dry and wipe just for good measure.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews first.  </li>
            <li>Although it is a great product when it stays too long</li>
            <li>rare that it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li>I befame familiar with K2r</li>
            <li>I remember originally using it as a roll-on liquid about 50 years ago.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to clean a sofa that a friend had given me.</li>
            <li>I grew up using this product to clean almost everything.</li>
            <li>Will clean a grease spot on a wool rug, also.</li>
            <li>So very happy, you just have to go back to an old tried and true product sometimes.  </li>
            <li>This removed candle wax stain from a bright blue silk dress.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a heavy user of Amazon.com, but this is the first review I have written because I am highly impressed.</li>
            <li>Some guest I didn&#x27;t know told me she didn&#x27;t use saucers for her coffee cup and proceeded to place the full cup on the edge of the table,</li>
            <li>Most of them don&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li>Great for cleaning off makeup on the collar or other spots.</li>
            <li>Dries quickly to a powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s quick and works</li>
            <li>Worked fairly well but did not completely remove stained material.</li>
            <li>I use to be able to find this product nearly everywhere.  </li>
            <li>The most frequent use I&#x27;ve found is to remove stains on my ties.  </li>
            <li>Oh well, it was worth a try.</li>
            <li>THE CAN CONTAINS THE SAME AROMATICS, AND THERE WERE SOME SOLVENTS, BUT NOT THE EFFECTIVE INGREDIENT THAT WORKED</li>
            <li>So far, I have not been able to remove any stain with this product.  </li>
            <li>Well worth having a can on hand.</li>
            <li>There was a stain of some kind on a bulky white wool sweater than I had knitted myself, and water wouldn&#x27;t budge it.</li>
            <li>Good old K2R removed the stain completely with two applications.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li>The can looks the same, but the contents aren&#x27;t even close to being effective.  </li>
            <li>and it is particularly useful if you are out to dinner and spill some greasy food on yourself.</li>
            <li>/&gt;While I notice the lightened spots in the right light, this is definitely worth it as the huge oily blotch is completely gone otherwise.  </li>
            <li>Take a dark old piece of fabric &amp; see how easy it is with a light press of button at what you think is a good distance away to over saturate the material.</li>
            <li>but it is as easy as spraying it on, let dry for 10 minutes, rub with top of the can</li>
            <li>Not as good as other reviews I have read on Amazon.</li>
            <li>Right now I&#x27;ve ordered it for a soiled-looking cloth upholstered recliner.  </li>
            <li>I just pick up my Kirby with the brush engaged &amp; run it right over the area if it&#x27;s rug or sofa.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cleaner for everyone with light colored carpet.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works on everything else, but I do know it takes black crayon out of velour, and it takes magic marker (YES, magic marker) off of corduroy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this item in the past with great results.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as easy to find K2r as it used to be, so I&#x27;m very grateful to have a new supply!</li>
            <li>used for yrs on better, dry clean, clothes.  </li>
            <li>Tried a few more times until the stain was almost invisible, and it didn&#x27;t seem that any more was coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>Very fast</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve only used it on white things, but I am super happy and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li>K2R is a wonderful spot remover especially for my white couch because it is a white powder</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Thanks!  </li>
            <li>I think the success people have with this really depends on what they&#x27;re using it on.  </li>
            <li>and I was willing to give anything a shot.</li>
            <li>2nd and 3rd application kept getting more and more of the stain out.  </li>
            <li>Then I went to the local Ace hardware to see if they had anything more.</li>
            <li>Naphtha soap was the first thing I tried.</li>
            <li>This was pretty amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>A small price to pay for restoring a favorite garment to full use!</li>
            <li>All but one were positive reviews but it seems there are now two negatives.  </li>
            <li>It works great on fabrics where its not good to use water.</li>
            <li>Used product on three different stubborn stains; whether carpet or a stain on my dress shirt, stains were removed easily, as advertised, and have not returned.</li>
            <li>a cat and white carpets and this stain remover easily removes all cat food stains on my carpet.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m taking the pillow covers to a dry cleaner as the label says before any more damage is done.</li>
            <li>There is a strong over so door with the windows open</li>
            <li>that had a large stain on the front for quite a while.</li>
            <li>It has a strong smell, so don&#x27;t do it in your bedroom and it will create a powder mess if you don&#x27;t do it over the sink or have your vacuum cleaner handy.</li>
            <li>One more trip through the &#x27;net for \\&quot;rubber cement remover\\&quot; two days ago turned up our old and trusted K2R.  One application and - VOILA!  </li>
            <li>Whether or not the material was negatively effected I can&#x27;t tell, however, the large greasy spot that had been there for a couple years, and almost caused me to throw away a jacket that was in otherwise good condition, is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So I went to the local huge grocery store and bought one of every stain product they had.</li>
            <li>Works really well</li>
            <li>Thanks you, Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Such a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li>I have sprayed it on grease spots on clothing and just let it sit until I&#x27;m ready to launder it</li>
            <li>this stuff really works</li>
            <li>It leaves a ring around the spot no matter how much you scrub.  </li>
            <li>Pricey, but it really works.  </li>
            <li>Really got out the food stains like they never even happened.  </li>
            <li>The back of the can is filled with disclaimers and warnings.  </li>
            <li>This was only after one light brush using the edge of the bristles.  </li>
            <li>It really works well.  </li>
            <li>Had an toxic like smell that filled the entire room when using this product in addition to my clothes too.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well on the stains on my couch.</li>
            <li>I have a whole bunch of products in my laundry area that I bought because they promised to remove stains.  </li>
            <li>It uses a very volatile solution with imbedded powder to bring the material to the surface clinging to the powder, which you then brush off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth a try as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li>I made a beautiful baby blanket, washed it, dried it, and as I was pressing it noticed a blue blob near the edge.</li>
            <li>I am pleased that I was able to order it on Amazon to treat small spots on fabrics that would otherwise need dry cleaning.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live with out having this stuff in my laundry room!  </li>
            <li>I also found that it will take out permanent black magic  maker.  </li>
            <li>and I WOULD CONTACT my suppliers to determine how to resolve this particular issue</li>
            <li>, I would imagine a white/light colored fabric would respond better than the deep blue of my chair.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this K2r product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>but it is no longer highly advertised so it does not get purchased as much anymore as far as I know.</li>
            <li>Also to clean the neck line of shirts and blouses that would need to be sent to a dry cleaners.</li>
            <li>You do have to wash (or dry clean)</li>
            <li>Just used it today on mysterious fresh office chair stain.</li>
            <li>When you use this make sure you are in a well  ventilated room when brushing of the dried coating that forms when it dries.</li>
            <li>I normally have to do three applications</li>
            <li>I am sure the formula has changed, but this stiff still works well on grease-type stains.  </li>
            <li>Great for small dry clean only spots, especially ties.</li>
            <li>- the carpet is like new.  </li>
            <li>Two applications of K2R had it looking nearly new again.    </li>
            <li>Spot gone, but new one came.  </li>
            <li>Two passes and they look like new and did not damage the speakers.  </li>
            <li>Hold it back &amp; use very brief bursts just touch button &amp; release &amp; repeat till area is just lightly covered then</li>
            <li>thing, though - make sure the windows are wide open before you spray this stuff.</li>
            <li>It took it out, plus an 8 year old stain underneath it!</li>
            <li>family has been using K2R for the last 40 years and has never failed.</li>
            <li>Used better products in the past.</li>
            <li>It worked fabulously to remove the oily blotch, however, there is now some slight lightening of the fabric in the treated area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>These days, about the only local stores that may carry it are True Value and/or Ace Hardware stores.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d never heard of the product, but gave it a shot to save the beautiful blue seat of my preposterously expensive</li>
            <li>/&gt;To use, you spray a quick (~1 sec) burst onto the affected area, and</li>
            <li>But I didn&#x27;t have enough for a full second application.  </li>
            <li>I thought, wow, blast from the past, I haven&#x27;t heard anything about K2r in many years.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t completely remove any stains ...</li>
            <li>Was hoping this product would be like to old K2r.  </li>
            <li>The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>Never tried it with watery colored spots like coffee or soft drinks</li>
            <li>Thankfully it appears to have removed the stain completely</li>
            <li>It works like the old Goddards stain remover.</li>
            <li>I filed an A-Z complaint with Amazon.com and received store gift card for the amount on my credit card, better than nothing.</li>
            <li>I treated the spot twice to completely remove the peanut butter oil.  </li>
            <li>Next came two types of Resolve stain stuff; they didn&#x27;t do anything, but I didn&#x27;t really expect them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>2 month old stain and the jacket retained its water repellant properties&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>Surprised</li>
            <li>We had to clean out my father&#x27;s house after he passed away and came upon a very dark and stubborn stain by the front door.</li>
            <li>I bought this with high hopes, remembering the former product that was taken off the market by the EPA.</li>
            <li>We looked at a large and annoying rubber cement stain on the wall-to-wall carpet for months;  kept thinking that we needed to \\&quot;brave it\\&quot; and purchase a rubber cement remover.  </li>
            <li>After shaking the can of the new stuff for five minutes there was barely enough af the absorbent powder coming out to even see.  </li>
            <li>is not the original stuff-had to air out the house-left a worse stain-very disappointed as I loved the original</li>
            <li>main use for the K2R is to remove the minor amount of \\&quot;grub\\&quot; caused from my neck sweat/oils.  </li>
            <li>and you have to either reapply the solution or sponge it with a wet cloth which might not be suitable for delicate clothing.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, K2R has been a fabulous staple in our house for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li>It does not come completely out of the clothes so a powdery spot is left.  </li>
            <li>but you can just tap it with your bare hands.</li>
            <li>old product,difficult to find if possible, in stores.</li>
            <li>not the same as the old stuff  </li>
            <li>This product was apparently taken off the market.  </li>
            <li>Kind of pricey and increasingly difficult to find.</li>
            <li>Secondly the white powder left after the product has dried does not come off easily.  </li>
            <li>The solvents are much too polar - they dissolved the dye in the shirt, making the large dark ring.  </li>
            <li>The product says it works well on all dry clean items, however that&#x27;s just not true.  </li>
            <li>I would try all other methods for stain removal first and use this as a last resort.  </li>
            <li>Because I t worked well in the past, I recently bought it to clean my cowboy hat.</li>
            <li>think K2r is going to be the first thing I try for my next unknown, and maybe even for my next known, stain.</li>
            <li>Used to be able to buy it in stores but unable to find it near my home.</li>
            <li>My mother did woolen hand embroidery on the pocket of an otherwise blah dress of mine and less than a year later some kitchen grease plunked right in the middle of the pocket - Well, it was ruined, might as well try K2R.  </li>
            <li>oil, just blot stain if really messy first.  </li>
            <li>This stuff is expensive compared to Resolve and other carpet cleaners but based on the good reviews I decided to try this out.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention this stuff is extremely toxic and highly flammable.  </li>
            <li>Old fashion dry cleaning fluid.</li>
            <li>This product has saved me from having to dry clean numerous items with stains on delicate fabrics.</li>

            <li> OMG, this product works amazing!</li>
            <li> I will always keep some handy!</li>
            <li> After all of the years this product has been around, this is still the best for removing most stains.</li>
            <li> Not as good as what I thought I remembered using years ago.</li>
            <li> After soaking up excess with a paper towel, I spray a good coat of K2R on the surface</li>
            <li> The product is good, if you can get it out of the can.  </li>
            <li> good bye</li>
            <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s great for removing grease spots.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> I was happy to be able to buy this spot remover again that I used to use often on my clothes.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t find this product in stores any more, so I was so happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked this product for many years , works great</li>
            <li> Received the product very fast and in perfect shape.  </li>
            <li> As I remembered it&#x27;s best to take care with your first spray.</li>
            <li> I was worried I could not find it any more in shops around here!</li>
            <li> Love it and will never be without it again!</li>
            <li> I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> and I decided to try it and love it!  </li>
            <li> Love this product!  </li>
            <li> 5 more words !</li>
            <li> This is a great easy to use on the spot whenever you drop liquid, oily food or anything that stains on your cloth/furniture...</li>
            <li> You may have to use 2 times but it&#x27;s f&#x27;n amazing.</li>
            <li> Found it here at the amazing Elliot&#x27;s Hardware in Dallas and took it home.</li>
            <li> This spot remover is amazing.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as I remember.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but not as good.  </li>
            <li> so I keep this stuff handy</li>
            <li> Read the label for good info for appropriate fabrics.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years now and it is consistently good at removing spots.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s kind.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty incredible.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find it here in upstate NY, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> By far the best cleaner I have used.</li>
            <li> so was very glad to see it was still available online.</li>
            <li> seemed to be too good to be true.  </li>
            <li> I was able to get the stains out with one treatment.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the best cleaner for spots on white carpet without leaving a trace.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been able to remove any/ever stain from it, except OIL.  </li>
            <li> When that did not work, I knew I&#x27;d need something stronger, but what to use that would be safe for microfiber?     </li>
            <li> This product has saved many, many things for us over the years.          </li>
            <li> I have never found a product that is better at removing grease/oil stains from material/clothing.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> bought this and is now my favorite spot cleaner.</li>
            <li> It works better than most on removing stains from clothing.</li>
            <li> I tried this on three different stains, and at best it made no difference.  </li>
            <li> We Love IT.  </li>
            <li> I could not push the spray top on the can to use it.  </li>
            <li> SO GLAD</li>
            <li> I am pleased to find this.</li>
            <li> I have been able to save so many stained clothing with this product.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff</li>
            <li> Works better than anything.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> I have been using K2r for many years.  </li>
            <li> I really couldn&#x27;t be happy about my laundry if I didn&#x27;t have this to use.</li>
            <li> Nothing works better.  </li>
            <li> Save your money because anything is better than this.</li>
            <li> I have tried many products, but NONE work as well as K2R.  </li>
            <li> and I feel better about it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find it in the grocery stores, so was glad to be able to order it via Amazon.</li>
            <li> Ordered by mistake but am glad to have it.  </li>
            <li> I love that it drys to a powder and</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re probably can ask for a better cleaning solvent for carpets.</li>
            <li> The brush on the top SHOULD NOT be used on material like this.  </li>
            <li> Make sure to use it in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Forget the goofy plastic bristle top.  </li>
            <li> It worked, mostly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;1)Just follow the instructions it was able to remove  </li>
            <li> This product has been around for many years</li>
            <li> this says it&#x27;s safe to use on &amp;#34;dry-clean only&amp;#34; clothing.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This was easy to use and worked better than we had hoped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The former good stuff had a fair amount af</li>
            <li> I am glad that it is available on Amazon.com.  </li>
            <li> It is sooo easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It does have a strong odor.  </li>
            <li> Good product, highly recommended by the fabric industry.  </li>
            <li> The fumes are pretty amazing, too.</li>
            <li> Worked fine</li>
            <li> Make sure fabric is color safe first.</li>
            <li> Works fine.</li>
            <li> Probably better for our environment, but not as effective as the old version.</li>
            <li> This K2r Is fantastic, I tried everything to take a stain out of my Microfiber chair and</li>
            <li> , it is fantastic, leaves no marks at all.  </li>
            <li> Light shirts get ring around the collar after 1 wear.  </li>
            <li> It especially works great on ties.</li>
            <li> Seems it&#x27;s no longer available in stores, or I can&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> We recently moved and the top of our beautiful recliner looked like it had been drug around in someone&#x27;s garage (thanks to our movers).  </li>
            <li> although the husband said he could no longer see it, I did one more spray, dry and wipe just for good measure.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews first.  </li>
            <li> Although it is a great product when it stays too long</li>
            <li> rare that it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I befame familiar with K2r</li>
            <li> I remember originally using it as a roll-on liquid about 50 years ago.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to clean a sofa that a friend had given me.</li>
            <li> I grew up using this product to clean almost everything.</li>
            <li> Will clean a grease spot on a wool rug, also.</li>
            <li> So very happy, you just have to go back to an old tried and true product sometimes.  </li>
            <li> This removed candle wax stain from a bright blue silk dress.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a heavy user of Amazon.com, but this is the first review I have written because I am highly impressed.</li>
            <li> Some guest I didn&#x27;t know told me she didn&#x27;t use saucers for her coffee cup and proceeded to place the full cup on the edge of the table,</li>
            <li> Most of them don&#x27;t seem to do much.  </li>
            <li> Great for cleaning off makeup on the collar or other spots.</li>
            <li> Dries quickly to a powder.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s quick and works</li>
            <li> Worked fairly well but did not completely remove stained material.</li>
            <li> I use to be able to find this product nearly everywhere.  </li>
            <li> The most frequent use I&#x27;ve found is to remove stains on my ties.  </li>
            <li> Oh well, it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> THE CAN CONTAINS THE SAME AROMATICS, AND THERE WERE SOME SOLVENTS, BUT NOT THE EFFECTIVE INGREDIENT THAT WORKED</li>
            <li> So far, I have not been able to remove any stain with this product.  </li>
            <li> Well worth having a can on hand.</li>
            <li> There was a stain of some kind on a bulky white wool sweater than I had knitted myself, and water wouldn&#x27;t budge it.</li>
            <li> Good old K2R removed the stain completely with two applications.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s well worth</li>
            <li> The can looks the same, but the contents aren&#x27;t even close to being effective.  </li>
            <li> and it is particularly useful if you are out to dinner and spill some greasy food on yourself.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I notice the lightened spots in the right light, this is definitely worth it as the huge oily blotch is completely gone otherwise.  </li>
            <li> Take a dark old piece of fabric &amp; see how easy it is with a light press of button at what you think is a good distance away to over saturate the material.</li>
            <li> but it is as easy as spraying it on, let dry for 10 minutes, rub with top of the can</li>
            <li> Not as good as other reviews I have read on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Right now I&#x27;ve ordered it for a soiled-looking cloth upholstered recliner.  </li>
            <li> I just pick up my Kirby with the brush engaged &amp; run it right over the area if it&#x27;s rug or sofa.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cleaner for everyone with light colored carpet.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works on everything else, but I do know it takes black crayon out of velour, and it takes magic marker (YES, magic marker) off of corduroy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this item in the past with great results.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as easy to find K2r as it used to be, so I&#x27;m very grateful to have a new supply!</li>
            <li> used for yrs on better, dry clean, clothes.  </li>
            <li> Tried a few more times until the stain was almost invisible, and it didn&#x27;t seem that any more was coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> Very fast</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve only used it on white things, but I am super happy and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> K2R is a wonderful spot remover especially for my white couch because it is a white powder</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Thanks!  </li>
            <li> I think the success people have with this really depends on what they&#x27;re using it on.  </li>
            <li> and I was willing to give anything a shot.</li>
            <li> 2nd and 3rd application kept getting more and more of the stain out.  </li>
            <li> Then I went to the local Ace hardware to see if they had anything more.</li>
            <li> Naphtha soap was the first thing I tried.</li>
            <li> This was pretty amazing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> A small price to pay for restoring a favorite garment to full use!</li>
            <li> All but one were positive reviews but it seems there are now two negatives.  </li>
            <li> It works great on fabrics where its not good to use water.</li>
            <li> Used product on three different stubborn stains; whether carpet or a stain on my dress shirt, stains were removed easily, as advertised, and have not returned.</li>
            <li> a cat and white carpets and this stain remover easily removes all cat food stains on my carpet.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m taking the pillow covers to a dry cleaner as the label says before any more damage is done.</li>
            <li> There is a strong over so door with the windows open</li>
            <li> that had a large stain on the front for quite a while.</li>
            <li> It has a strong smell, so don&#x27;t do it in your bedroom and it will create a powder mess if you don&#x27;t do it over the sink or have your vacuum cleaner handy.</li>
            <li> One more trip through the &#x27;net for \\&quot;rubber cement remover\\&quot; two days ago turned up our old and trusted K2R.  One application and - VOILA!  </li>
            <li> Whether or not the material was negatively effected I can&#x27;t tell, however, the large greasy spot that had been there for a couple years, and almost caused me to throw away a jacket that was in otherwise good condition, is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So I went to the local huge grocery store and bought one of every stain product they had.</li>
            <li> Works really well</li>
            <li> Thanks you, Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Such a fabulous product.  </li>
            <li> I have sprayed it on grease spots on clothing and just let it sit until I&#x27;m ready to launder it</li>
            <li> this stuff really works</li>
            <li> It leaves a ring around the spot no matter how much you scrub.  </li>
            <li> Pricey, but it really works.  </li>
            <li> Really got out the food stains like they never even happened.  </li>
            <li> The back of the can is filled with disclaimers and warnings.  </li>
            <li> This was only after one light brush using the edge of the bristles.  </li>
            <li> It really works well.  </li>
            <li> Had an toxic like smell that filled the entire room when using this product in addition to my clothes too.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well on the stains on my couch.</li>
            <li> I have a whole bunch of products in my laundry area that I bought because they promised to remove stains.  </li>
            <li> It uses a very volatile solution with imbedded powder to bring the material to the surface clinging to the powder, which you then brush off.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth a try as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> I made a beautiful baby blanket, washed it, dried it, and as I was pressing it noticed a blue blob near the edge.</li>
            <li> I am pleased that I was able to order it on Amazon to treat small spots on fabrics that would otherwise need dry cleaning.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out having this stuff in my laundry room!  </li>
            <li> I also found that it will take out permanent black magic  maker.  </li>
            <li> and I WOULD CONTACT my suppliers to determine how to resolve this particular issue</li>
            <li> , I would imagine a white/light colored fabric would respond better than the deep blue of my chair.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this K2r product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> but it is no longer highly advertised so it does not get purchased as much anymore as far as I know.</li>
            <li> Also to clean the neck line of shirts and blouses that would need to be sent to a dry cleaners.</li>
            <li> You do have to wash (or dry clean)</li>
            <li> Just used it today on mysterious fresh office chair stain.</li>
            <li> When you use this make sure you are in a well  ventilated room when brushing of the dried coating that forms when it dries.</li>
            <li> I normally have to do three applications</li>
            <li> I am sure the formula has changed, but this stiff still works well on grease-type stains.  </li>
            <li> Great for small dry clean only spots, especially ties.</li>
            <li> - the carpet is like new.  </li>
            <li> Two applications of K2R had it looking nearly new again.    </li>
            <li> Spot gone, but new one came.  </li>
            <li> Two passes and they look like new and did not damage the speakers.  </li>
            <li> Hold it back &amp; use very brief bursts just touch button &amp; release &amp; repeat till area is just lightly covered then</li>
            <li> thing, though - make sure the windows are wide open before you spray this stuff.</li>
            <li> It took it out, plus an 8 year old stain underneath it!</li>
            <li> family has been using K2R for the last 40 years and has never failed.</li>
            <li> Used better products in the past.</li>
            <li> It worked fabulously to remove the oily blotch, however, there is now some slight lightening of the fabric in the treated area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> These days, about the only local stores that may carry it are True Value and/or Ace Hardware stores.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d never heard of the product, but gave it a shot to save the beautiful blue seat of my preposterously expensive</li>
            <li> /&gt;To use, you spray a quick (~1 sec) burst onto the affected area, and</li>
            <li> But I didn&#x27;t have enough for a full second application.  </li>
            <li> I thought, wow, blast from the past, I haven&#x27;t heard anything about K2r in many years.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t completely remove any stains ...</li>
            <li> Was hoping this product would be like to old K2r.  </li>
            <li> The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> Never tried it with watery colored spots like coffee or soft drinks</li>
            <li> Thankfully it appears to have removed the stain completely</li>
            <li> It works like the old Goddards stain remover.</li>
            <li> I filed an A-Z complaint with Amazon.com and received store gift card for the amount on my credit card, better than nothing.</li>
            <li> I treated the spot twice to completely remove the peanut butter oil.  </li>
            <li> Next came two types of Resolve stain stuff; they didn&#x27;t do anything, but I didn&#x27;t really expect them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 2 month old stain and the jacket retained its water repellant properties&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> Surprised</li>
            <li> We had to clean out my father&#x27;s house after he passed away and came upon a very dark and stubborn stain by the front door.</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes, remembering the former product that was taken off the market by the EPA.</li>
            <li> We looked at a large and annoying rubber cement stain on the wall-to-wall carpet for months;  kept thinking that we needed to \\&quot;brave it\\&quot; and purchase a rubber cement remover.  </li>
            <li> After shaking the can of the new stuff for five minutes there was barely enough af the absorbent powder coming out to even see.  </li>
            <li> is not the original stuff-had to air out the house-left a worse stain-very disappointed as I loved the original</li>
            <li> main use for the K2R is to remove the minor amount of \\&quot;grub\\&quot; caused from my neck sweat/oils.  </li>
            <li> and you have to either reapply the solution or sponge it with a wet cloth which might not be suitable for delicate clothing.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile, K2R has been a fabulous staple in our house for at least 20 years.  </li>
            <li> It does not come completely out of the clothes so a powdery spot is left.  </li>
            <li> but you can just tap it with your bare hands.</li>
            <li> old product,difficult to find if possible, in stores.</li>
            <li> not the same as the old stuff  </li>
            <li> This product was apparently taken off the market.  </li>
            <li> Kind of pricey and increasingly difficult to find.</li>
            <li> Secondly the white powder left after the product has dried does not come off easily.  </li>
            <li> The solvents are much too polar - they dissolved the dye in the shirt, making the large dark ring.  </li>
            <li> The product says it works well on all dry clean items, however that&#x27;s just not true.  </li>
            <li> I would try all other methods for stain removal first and use this as a last resort.  </li>
            <li> Because I t worked well in the past, I recently bought it to clean my cowboy hat.</li>
            <li> think K2r is going to be the first thing I try for my next unknown, and maybe even for my next known, stain.</li>
            <li> Used to be able to buy it in stores but unable to find it near my home.</li>
            <li> My mother did woolen hand embroidery on the pocket of an otherwise blah dress of mine and less than a year later some kitchen grease plunked right in the middle of the pocket - Well, it was ruined, might as well try K2R.  </li>
            <li> oil, just blot stain if really messy first.  </li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive compared to Resolve and other carpet cleaners but based on the good reviews I decided to try this out.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention this stuff is extremely toxic and highly flammable.  </li>
            <li> Old fashion dry cleaning fluid.</li>
            <li> This product has saved me from having to dry clean numerous items with stains on delicate fabrics.</li>
            <li> do like my mom used to, take the vacuum cleaner too it.</li>
            <li> Not happy right now!</li>
            <li> if you&#x27;ve saturated the area, it must be all powder dry to work properly &amp; expect a 2nd</li>
            <li> I have used K2R for many years, but lately have had a hard time finding it locally.  </li>
            <li> I bought it on Amazon and as usual it worked great, BUT IT IS EXPENSIVE!  </li>
            <li> Gets out spots that other methods won&#x27;t, particularly grease or other marks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this new version.  </li>
            <li> Just spray it on, let is dry, give clothing a shake, and throw in with you regular load of laundry.  </li>
            <li> You just spray it on the grease stain, wait for it to dry and turn white, and brush it off.  </li>
            <li> Nothing short of what I expected, in fact (oddly enough) it works just like</li>
            <li> apparently -- an ingredient was removed due to EPA regs.  </li>
            <li> I had  relatively new blue shirt with a small grease spot.  </li>
            <li> Finally ordered a 3rd can, and after 4-5 applications the damed stain was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K2R works, where other products and methods didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> gentle enough for my microfiber, but tough enough to remove OIL?!      </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t take long to work.</li>
            <li> So if it is on your shelf too long spay it on a thrash fabric.first.</li>
            <li> Then it disappeared off the market for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I have an somewhat pricey Under Armour jacket (although a few years old)</li>
            <li> And obviously when you use it, be careful!</li>
            <li> have not used any other competitor products just regular dry cleaner.</li>
            <li> 1 spray (and letting it dry into a powder)</li>
            <li> You just spray it and wait until its completely dry and brush it off.</li>
            <li> let it dry</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me by the dry cleaner</li>
            <li> Got the job done on a wool suit when even dry cleaning couldn&#x27;t get the job done.</li>
            <li> This is basically dry cleaning in a can.</li>
            <li> Just spray it on, let dry, and wash.  </li>
            <li> I sprayed it on and let it dry as the instructions said.</li>
            <li> Once dry, I sprayed some on the stain and let it dry.</li>
            <li> , let dry, brush off...</li>
            <li> I accidentally ruined my north face apex bionic jacket with butter from corn on the cob.&lt;br /&gt;After inquiring  Dry cleaners the cost I wanted to save some $.&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the white powder is sometimes difficult to get totally rid of, and the garment must be washed to free it of the K2R residue.</li>
            <li> The only complaint I have ever had with it is that the powder sometimes does not brush off completely</li>
            <li> it did help slightly I suppose but not near enough what I was hoping.</li>
            <li> the usual things post-party, swearing and nearly in tears.  </li>
            <li> This junk turned the small grease spot into a large very dark ring.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s like dry cleaning in a can!</li>
            <li> After following the instructions, it removed about 90% of a stain on a pair of suit pants that sat unnoticed for too long.</li>
            <li> Often a slight white residual remains, but after one wash it&#x27;s gone and the shirts are prestin.</li>
            <li> I wish I had found this earlier, it would have saved quite a few items from the trash bin.</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t work after multiply tries.</li>
            <li> A total waste of money.  </li>
            <li> I have used it for years but had trouble finding it in the stores recently</li>
            <li> When my can of K2r dried up, I looked for the product locally and could not find it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give it minus four stars if I could.</li>
            <li> When it dried white</li>
            <li> IT DID NOT PRODUCE THE SAME LIFTING SALTS THAT WERE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRODUCT IN THE PAST.  </li>
            <li> I had to let my previous attempts dry before trying it.</li>
            <li> Another year we moved into a newly purchased home and found a horrid stain of unknown origin on the wallpaper behind a hallway door.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested it on other items yet</li>
            <li> This item is very difficult to find in stores but is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know of any other stain remover requiring that.  </li>
            <li> This product works just like the other brand.</li>
            <li> I got it to remove a couple of spots I couldn&#x27;t get out with other products.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what it was from, but it was enough to make the jacket unwearable except for yard work.</li>
            <li> This removed stains from carpet that at least ten other products didn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> little duplicate stitch with a yarn needle, and, presto -</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why this is so hard to find locally.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m assuming it would if you had a sturdier fabric that you could fully brush, but as stated before this isn&#x27;t possible with delicate material, so a visible mark remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It works very well to remove oily stains from clothing that you might be unwilling or unable to launder.</li>
            <li> Seagrass carpet should not be wet, so when my mother&#x27;s dog urinated on it and blotting did not remove the stain (stain still there after it dried), I purchased the K2R.  </li>
            <li> 25 year old  grease stain and was giving away furniture and tried everything else on the market which either stained it worse or water</li>
            <li> Says it&#x27;s for dry cleanables, but the directions tell you to launder as usual after applied and rubbed off.</li>
            <li> It made a mess of my hat without removing the stains or the sweat.</li>
            <li> This has saved me at least half on my dry cleaning bill</li>
            <li> removes food spills and spots w/ oily base very quickly.  </li>
            <li> If it was just a little lower in cost I would have given five stars.</li>
            <li> I decided the built-in plastic brush might be a little harsh on the fabric</li>
            <li> Even stains that had been dried for months.</li>
            <li> I was directed to this product by a web site that said it would work for removing oil-based stains from microfiber, but that&#x27;s the stain that it actually made worse.</li>
            <li> then wait a few minutes longer.</li>
            <li> The seller and I exchanged a few e-mails</li>
            <li> so I used my clothes brush instead to wipe off the dried powder.</li>
            <li> Ruined a knit polo, so I trashed it, so don&#x27;t waste a penny on this stuff.</li>
            <li> while I can find it, I pass over it a few times before finding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t even have to wash the garment afterwards (for those times when you find the stain after the garment has been washed and dried).  </li>
            <li> Stains that other so-called stain removers failed to take out vanish after following the instructions.</li>
            <li> I did find the bristles on the cap a bit too harsh for brushing and used a small laundry brush I already had.</li>
            <li> The brush on the tip is a little harsh for delicate fabric so get one</li>
            <li> Got salad dressing on a brand new tie, cold not find this product in stores so after a couple months I ordered from Amazon.</li>
            <li> At worst, it made the stain more visible.  </li>
            <li> IN THE PAST.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately it did not get the grease out of my bedspread that was deposited by the commercial dryer</li>
            <li> A bottle of Resolve or Woolite works just as well if not better and without all the toxic garbage K2R</li>
            <li> Unable to do what was necessary during the party, I tried ll</li>
            <li> For the past five decades, we have used K2r for spot removal.  </li>
            <li> I even brought it to the dry cleaner and pointed out the stain to them, but they were unable to remove it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;2) Brush provided on the cap is not suitable for delicate clothes</li>
            <li> When I opened the box, both of the cans tops were broken, the cans were in an unsecured plastic bag with no protection around the cans to keep them tight in the box they were shipped in.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores.  </li>
            <li> In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> At least 10 minutes</li>
            <li> I have since talked to your  agent and complained.  </li>
            <li> and it sucks the oil out of the fabric.</li>
            <li> So I would not recommend this for any delicate materials.  </li>
            <li> with all products, test on a small price before using where it&#x27;s visible!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand a spot, even a very small one, on my jackets or pants.  </li>
            <li> &quot; I do not recall a time K2r was not successful in rescuing a tie from the trash bin.</li>
            <li> Obviously I was disappointed which prompted the 3 star rating.</li>
            <li> When all else fails, this usually does the job.  </li>
            <li> This is a poor product.  </li>
            <li> as described, lots of scrubbing and caustic smelling &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;-foam</li>
            <li> I dutifully dab them onto stains and wash the garment, and perhaps the stain is a bit lighter, but not a great solution.  </li>
            <li> Horrible product that only makes stains worse as the \\&quot;spot lifting\\&quot; powder gets stuck in the fibers and will not release.</li>
            <li> it took off some weird stains on microfiber that I could NOT get off with anything else.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult to find K2R in retail stores, so</li>
            <li> Maybe the hat&#x27;s felt material is the wrong fabric to use this on.</li>
            <li> that is removing dirt and nicotine stains from some expensive Bose Speaker covers that could not be removed from the speakers.</li>
            <li> Completely useless.</li>
            <li> Spot Lifter\\&quot; worked on a very tough stain that even a carpet scrubber couldn&#x27;t get out.</li>
            <li> stuff stinks.</li>
            <li> Works well on carpets also, but it stinks.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed as this stuff hardly did anything for my carpet</li>
            <li> Very difficult to find in retail stores, you need to order  it online.</li>
            <li> It has been nearly impossible to get that out until I got this stuff.  </li>
            <li> It smells bad.  </li>
            <li> If you have some in the car you can go out and treat yourself for about 5 min. and remove the ugly stain.</li>
            <li> Often, fuel leaks inside an airplane, and since it contains 15-20% oil, can be very destructive to glue joints.</li>
            <li> So frustrated!</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The descriptions of those products sounded terrible.  </li>
            <li> It smells awful, too, and the smell lingers for a while.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s awful!</li>
            <li> Honestly, worst cleaning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> this is nasty stuff.  </li>
            <li> The worst stain I encounter is grease/oil on cotton or cotton/poly blends.  </li>

            <li> I use to be able to find this product nearly everywhere.  These days, about the only local stores that may carry it are True Value and/or Ace Hardware stores.  Works really well but must be used in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Love this product, it&#x27;s great for removing grease spots.</li>
            <li> Great for removing set in stains. I have several ties that were stained. I was able to get the stains out with one treatment. Even stains that had been dried for months. It was a lot cheaper that taking the ties to the cleaners.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great.  The seller is wonderful and the packaging is perfect.  Very fast delivery.  This product has saved me from having to dry clean numerous items with stains on delicate fabrics.</li>
            <li> My moma used this when I was growing up, and I thought it was out of production. I used it to get an oil spot off of my silk ottoman. It&#x27;s like dry cleaning in a can!</li>
            <li> This K2r Is fantastic, I tried everything to take a stain out of my Microfiber chair and nothing worked until K2R, it is fantastic, leaves no marks at all.  Great Product.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be as effective as I remember.</li>
            <li> I have used K2R for over 15 years, we have white carpet and it&#x27;s the best cleaner for spots on white carpet without leaving a trace.  I highly recommend this cleaner for everyone with light colored carpet.</li>
            <li> Our microfiber recliner was sprayed with a protectant upon purchasing it.  I&#x27;ve been able to remove any/ever stain from it, except OIL.  We recently moved and the top of our beautiful recliner looked like it had been drug around in someone&#x27;s garage (thanks to our movers).  I tried scrubbing it with water (our protectant says that is all we need).  When that did not work, I knew I&#x27;d need something stronger, but what to use that would be safe for microfiber?     I did some research and K2R seemed to be too good to be true.  Well, it DELIVERS on its promise.  1 spray (and letting it dry into a powder) the wiping away had almost ALL of the oil stain gone.  But, I am a perfectionist and although the husband said he could no longer see it, I did one more spray, dry and wipe just for good measure.  VOILA!  You would NEVER know the stain was ever there... gentle enough for my microfiber, but tough enough to remove OIL?!      AMAZING product!  I will always keep some handy!</li>
            <li> Delighted to find K2R at Amazon by Googling the product itself!  This product has saved many, many things for us over the years.          My mother did woolen hand embroidery on the pocket of an otherwise blah dress of mine and less than a year later some kitchen grease plunked right in the middle of the pocket - Well, it was ruined, might as well try K2R.  Grease GONE!  Dress (and my mother-daughter relationship) saved.          Another year we moved into a newly purchased home and found a horrid stain of unknown origin on the wallpaper behind a hallway door. Tried several things.  Finally thought, \\&quot;Why not?\\&quot; and sprayed K2R.  Two treatments and the spot was gone saving us HUNDREDS of dollars in repapering costs.          Right now I&#x27;ve ordered it for a soiled-looking cloth upholstered recliner.  Thanks you, Amazon.  This time YOU saved the day!</li>
            <li> I used this product all the time years ago and  then it disappeared in California.  I order this last month and tried using it twice on two different types of fabric.  It does not come completely out of the clothes so a powdery spot is left.  I had to wash the clothes to get rid of it.  Whatever changed about it was a big mistake.  Threw it away.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me. I used it on a spot on a mattress that had gotten stained via shipping. I don&#x27;t know what the stain was - looked like grease. The stain would not remove.</li>
            <li> K2R is a wonderful spot remover especially for my white couch because it is a white powder</li>
            <li> When my can of K2r purchased sometime before 2003 gave out recently, I checked the stores locally and could not find it.  I am glad that it is available on Amazon.com.  The most frequent use I&#x27;ve found is to remove stains on my ties.  Before K2r stains meant a tie was likely ruined.  Now it&#x27;s \\&quot;no problem.\\&quot; I do not recall a time K2r was not successful in rescuing a tie from the trash bin.</li>
            <li> I have never found a product that is better at removing grease/oil stains from material/clothing. Kind of pricey and increasingly difficult to find.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000BQWN08 American Home Foods 56610 Spot-Lifter]]  Good product, highly recommended by the fabric industry.  Very difficult to find in retail stores, you need to order  it online. Works great on auto seats and carpets, as well  as upholstery and carpets in the home.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT IS DEFECTIVE</li>
            <li> This removed stains from carpet that at least ten other products didn&#x27;t. This is my go to now.</li>
            <li> We looked at a large and annoying rubber cement stain on the wall-to-wall carpet for months;  kept thinking that we needed to \\&quot;brave it\\&quot; and purchase a rubber cement remover.  Yuk!  The descriptions of those products sounded terrible.  Meanwhile, K2R has been a fabulous staple in our house for at least 20 years.  One more trip through the &#x27;net for \\&quot;rubber cement remover\\&quot; two days ago turned up our old and trusted K2R.  One application and - VOILA!  - the carpet is like new.  Such a fabulous product.  Thank you, Amazon, for carrying it!</li>
            <li> Works great for oily stains.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works every time.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live with out having this stuff in my laundry room!  I&#x27;ve been using K2R since, well since my mom hooked me on it when I was taught how to do laundry way back when! It removes grease stains off clothing. It&#x27;s worked on butter stains, car grease, veg. oil, just blot stain if really messy first.  Just spray it on, let is dry, give clothing a shake, and throw in with you regular load of laundry.  We use ERA/BIZ but whatever works for you and it takes out the grease off pants, shirts, etc.</li>
            <li> This product did an excellent job removing a stain that I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of things but would not come out.  K2R took it out instantly.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;K2R Spot Lifter\\&quot; worked on a very tough stain that even a carpet scrubber couldn&#x27;t get out. We had to clean out my father&#x27;s house after he passed away and came upon a very dark and stubborn stain by the front door. We have no idea what it was, but are thinking it was some sort of grease, and it resisted every attempt to remove it before we tried K2R.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was easy to use and worked better than we had hoped!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CFH</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It&#x27;s the best thing I&#x27;ve ever found for removing greasy stains from clothes.  Often, you can use it to remove a spot and then just wear the item without even re washing it!!</li>
            <li> It works! perfect for those oily stains that don&#x27;t go even after laundry. You just spray it and wait until its completely dry and brush it off. The cap itself is a brush, which makes it easier but you can just tap it with your bare hands. It has a strong smell, so don&#x27;t do it in your bedroom and it will create a powder mess if you don&#x27;t do it over the sink or have your vacuum cleaner handy.</li>
            <li> Useful&lt;br /&gt;Take it on trips and home</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve liked this product for many years , works great</li>
            <li> I bought this product to get out a shoe polish stain on my couch cover. The material of the couch cover was sturdy cotton and the stain was quite visible. But I followed instructions I found on a How To website that required the use of this product. And it worked like a charm. You can&#x27;t even tell it was ever there!</li>
            <li> Best oil spot remover I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with the K2-r....it took off some weird stains on microfiber that I could NOT get off with anything else.</li>
            <li> bought this and is now my favorite spot cleaner. i&#x27;ve only used it on white things, but I am super happy and would recommend highly.</li>
            <li> old product,difficult to find if possible, in stores. same quality as always. Great for small dry clean only spots, especially ties.</li>
            <li> It works better than most on removing stains from clothing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this item in the past with great results.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it here in upstate NY, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s GREAT!</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY spot cleaner for fabrics that cannot be cleaned with water.  Have been using this for decades, and it has always worked.</li>
            <li> I bought this to clean a sofa that a friend had given me. It didn&#x27;t completely remove any stains ... it did help slightly I suppose but not near enough what I was hoping.</li>
            <li> I tried this on three different stains, and at best it made no difference.  At worst, it made the stain more visible.  It smells awful, too, and the smell lingers for a while.  I was directed to this product by a web site that said it would work for removing oil-based stains from microfiber, but that&#x27;s the stain that it actually made worse.</li>
            <li> Not as good as what I thought I remembered using years ago.</li>
            <li> Gets grease spots out of upholstery fabrics.</li>
            <li> This is a poor product.  It does not work.  It smells bad.  I would not recommend it or order it again.</li>
            <li> We recently had a chair that had become quite soiled over the years from hair oil residue. Two applications of K2R had it looking nearly new again.    I have used K2R over the years in my hobby of model aviation. Often, fuel leaks inside an airplane, and since it contains 15-20% oil, can be very destructive to glue joints. After soaking up excess with a paper towel, I spray a good coat of K2R on the surface and it actually draws the oils out of the wood. Vacumning out the residue completes the job.    Unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult to find K2R in retail stores, so thank goodness for the internet.</li>
            <li> Was hoping this product would be like to old K2r.  It&#x27;s okay but not as good.  Won&#x27;t order it again</li>
            <li> Received the product very fast and in perfect shape.  The item is as described and has completely met and exceeded my expectations.  I would definitely order this again and I&#x27;m glad I read all the reviews first.  In response to the Negative reviews below, I have not found them to be accurate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main use for the K2R is to remove the minor amount of \\&quot;grub\\&quot; caused from my neck sweat/oils.  Light shirts get ring around the collar after 1 wear.  This has saved me at least half on my dry cleaning bill</li>
            <li> Still the best product on the market for removing oil stains from clothing!</li>
            <li> Great stain remover! Cannot find anything that comes close.</li>
            <li> My family has been using this for decades. Works perfectly, so why change? Still have one can hanging around, but need another. Hope they make it forever.    Just used it today on mysterious fresh office chair stain. It took it out, plus an 8 year old stain underneath it!</li>
            <li> Great established product!!</li>
            <li> We have used this product for years.  We Love IT.  Had to buy it online because we could not find it in any store in our area.</li>
            <li> This works as advertised. Cleaned up spots on carpets. Doesn&#x27;t take long to work. I highly recommend this K2r product.</li>
            <li> Although it is a great product when it stays too long it may spray a blackish color , I guess it spoils . So if it is on your shelf too long spay it on a thrash fabric.first. If blackish then do not use it.</li>
            <li> This is an invaluable addition to the bathroom cabinet; we all get an occasional spot and stain, and this stuff avoids the need for those enormous dry-cleaning bills. Just spray and scape off, along with the spot.</li>
            <li> As I remembered it&#x27;s best to take care with your first spray. Take a dark old piece of fabric &amp; see how easy it is with a light press of button at what you think is a good distance away to over saturate the material. Hold it back &amp; use very brief bursts just touch button &amp; release &amp; repeat till area is just lightly covered then wait - then wait a few minutes longer. At least 10 minutes if you&#x27;ve saturated the area, it must be all powder dry to work properly &amp; expect a 2nd application.&lt;br /&gt;I do like my mom used to, take the vacuum cleaner too it. If it&#x27;s upholstery. I just pick up my Kirby with the brush engaged &amp; run it right over the area if it&#x27;s rug or sofa. If it&#x27;s clothing then you have to brush it, take a blow dryer &amp; blow it out from the back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes out oily stains like spots on chairs from us greasy sweat hogs laying our head on the same spot all the time, it works with silicone lubes. Never tried it with watery colored spots like coffee or soft drinks so  buy accordingly.</li>
            <li> Seagrass carpet should not be wet, so when my mother&#x27;s dog urinated on it and blotting did not remove the stain (stain still there after it dried), I purchased the K2R.  Thankfully it appears to have removed the stain completely and MY dogs have not gone to the spot to &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;mark&amp;#34; it for themselves.  Happy!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know why this is so hard to find locally.  I grew up with this stuff.  It does about an 80-90% job on spots that aren&#x27;t big enough to bother taking the entire garment in to a dry-cleaner.</li>
            <li> It works like the old Goddards stain remover. Dries quickly to a powder.&lt;br /&gt;It only took 5 minutes and it was done.</li>
            <li> The product is good, if you can get it out of the can.  I have since talked to your  agent and complained.  I could not push the spray top on the can to use it.  When I opened the box, both of the cans tops were broken, the cans were in an unsecured plastic bag with no protection around the cans to keep them tight in the box they were shipped in.  I am to receive a refund.</li>
            <li> I was worried I could not find it any more in shops around here! Problem solved along with stains dissolved!</li>
            <li> There was a stain on the seat of a formal dining chair that nothing would remove.  The fabric is white damask.  I remembeted K2r from many years ago so searched for it, bought it, tried it, stain gone!!!!! So very happy, you just have to go back to an old tried and true product sometimes.  Love it and will never be without it again!</li>
            <li> For about 40 years I have used K2r to remove any grease stains from our clothing.  Then when I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore, I asked around to see what others use for grease stains in clothing and table cloths, etc. No one seemed to have a solution that they were please with that didn&#x27;t require a lot of work.  When I finally found K2r on the Web, I was ecstatic.  It is sooo easy to use.  Just spray it on, throw it in the wash and the grease is gone! I LOVE it!</li>
            <li> K2r works great on removing those oily stains from the carpet. I would recommend and buy this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> The product did not work as advertised. The seller sends another can but it did not work either. My friend has used this product for years and never had any issues with it. The seller and I exchanged a few e-mails but THEY said I should CONTACT the manufacture “IT’S NOT MY JOB” they are the Seller and I’m the Buyer. I asked for a refund on my credit card but no response to that. I filed an A-Z complaint with Amazon.com and received store gift card for the amount on my credit card, better than nothing. If I was in the business of selling products on Amazon.com I would think I would have a working relationship with the companies I purchase products from and I WOULD CONTACT my suppliers to determine how to resolve this particular issue BUT NO on Gatzies. If their just a mom and pop operation then good luck to them!</li>
            <li> A friend had it and I decided to try it and love it!  I didn&#x27;t know such a cleaner existed.</li>
            <li> This works so awesome!!!!  JUST DON&#x27;T BREATHE IT OR LET YOUR PETS OR KIDS BREATHE IT.&lt;br /&gt;I AM SO GLAD THEY STILL MAKE IT!!!</li>
            <li> Best on the market. I have work in the upholstery business for 22 years and if K2R can&#x27;t remove your stain, nothing else will. The brush on the tip is a little harsh for delicate fabric so get one softer.&lt;br /&gt;As with all products, test on a small price before using where it&#x27;s visible!</li>
            <li> OMG, this product works amazing! I&#x27;m a business traveler that seems to have a slit on my lower lip and this product removes grease stains as if they just disappear. You may have to use 2 times but it&#x27;s f&#x27;n amazing. I wish it came in 3oz size to travel so I could take to go but keeping one in home, car and office works for me.</li>
            <li> It must be too old---there is now powder in it....And, it doesn&#x27;t remove the spots!!!  I won&#x27;t order it again...</li>
            <li> This sprays on as a powder. Let it set and brush off the stain.  I treated the spot twice to completely remove the peanut butter oil.  Works Great!</li>
            <li> Since this has been outlawed in California I had to order it outside of California but have used this product for years. If you get a food/oil stain in a shirt or pants just spray this product on the spot let it dry and it sucks the oil out of the fabric.</li>
            <li> This is a smelly and toxic product.....but it works.  So spray....and then walk away for a while.  Let it work and scrub out the spots!</li>
            <li> I grew up using this product to clean almost everything. Because I t worked well in the past, I recently bought it to clean my cowboy hat. It made a mess of my hat without removing the stains or the sweat. Obviously I was disappointed which prompted the 3 star rating. Maybe the hat&#x27;s felt material is the wrong fabric to use this on.</li>
            <li> stuff stinks. did not work. not the same as the old stuff  junk</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.  It doesn&#x27;t work as well as it did years ago.  I suspect that some ingredient was taken out of it but I have no evidence to prove that.  I had to search out a different produce to get the grease spot out of the carpet.</li>
            <li> Spot gone, but new one came.  It is white.  Oh well, it was worth a try.</li>
            <li> I do not take clothing to the cleaner&#x27;s anymore because of the toxin burden but sometimes I want to get a stain out of clothing so I keep this stuff handy and it works.  I do it out in the garage then run back into the house holding my breath so none gets in my lungs, because you can tell by the smell, you do not want to breathe this stuff.</li>
            <li> I am pleased to find this. After following the instructions, it removed about 90% of a stain on a pair of suit pants that sat unnoticed for too long. I did find the bristles on the cap a bit too harsh for brushing and used a small laundry brush I already had. I would purchase again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been able to save so many stained clothing with this product. Stains that other so-called stain removers failed to take out vanish after following the instructions. My only complaint is that the white powder is sometimes difficult to get totally rid of, and the garment must be washed to free it of the K2R residue. A small price to pay for restoring a favorite garment to full use!</li>
            <li> I always keep a can at my house. use it on clothing, upholstery, and rugs to remove stains.  used to keep a can at my work to remove oil stains from my clothes.&lt;br /&gt;added later:&lt;br /&gt;THIS PRODUCT MUST HAVE BEEN REFORMULATED IN THE LAST 2 YEARS, BECAUSE WHAT I RECEIVED ON THIS ORDER WAS TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE!  IT DID NOT PRODUCE THE SAME LIFTING SALTS THAT WERE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PRODUCT IN THE PAST.  THE CAN CONTAINS THE SAME AROMATICS, AND THERE WERE SOME SOLVENTS, BUT NOT THE EFFECTIVE INGREDIENT THAT WORKED SO WELL IN THE PAST. I BOUGHT 2 CANS, NEITHER WORK TO REMOVE STAINS, PERHAPS ONLY TO SPREAD THEM.&lt;br /&gt;LIKELY WILL NOT TRY IT ANYMORE.</li>
            <li> I had some food stains on a dining room chair, applied this.  It left a white stain that cannot be removed.  The product used to be the tops, not anymore.  Now I can recover all my chairs.</li>
            <li> This product was apparently taken off the market.  I cant find it the supermarket any more.&lt;br /&gt;But it is the best for getting grease and oil stains out of cotton/polyester.</li>
            <li> Greatest stain remover I&#x27;ve ever used. You can&#x27;t find this in the retail stores. When you use this make sure you are in a well  ventilated room when brushing of the dried coating that forms when it dries.</li>
            <li> 25 year old  grease stain and was giving away furniture and tried everything else on the market which either stained it worse or water stained.&lt;br /&gt;My family has been using K2R for the last 40 years and has never failed. Found it here at the amazing Elliot&#x27;s Hardware in Dallas and took it home. 10 minute spray and brush off powder and it&#x27;s gone. Love this stuff nothing on the market now works like this stuff. Always test out a small patch first. Very pleased with this.</li>
            <li> Used product on three different stubborn stains; whether carpet or a stain on my dress shirt, stains were removed easily, as advertised, and have not returned. Has worked great on my applications.</li>
            <li> Always have this on hand! Works better than anything.</li>
            <li> When I accidentally smeared oil-based antibiotic ointment on my Herman Miller Embody chair, the manual recommended K29 to remove stains.  I&#x27;d never heard of the product, but gave it a shot to save the beautiful blue seat of my preposterously expensive chair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To use, you spray a quick (~1 sec) burst onto the affected area, and wait until it dries.  It turns into a powder that extracts the stain with it which can be brushed away.  It worked fabulously to remove the oily blotch, however, there is now some slight lightening of the fabric in the treated area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I notice the lightened spots in the right light, this is definitely worth it as the huge oily blotch is completely gone otherwise.  I haven&#x27;t tested it on other items yet, I would imagine a white/light colored fabric would respond better than the deep blue of my chair.</li>
            <li> The only place I can find this. Love it.</li>
            <li> removes fuel from balsa wood for repairs to be made</li>
            <li> I have been using K2r for many years.  I have sprayed it on grease spots on clothing and just let it sit until I&#x27;m ready to launder it and the grease spots come out.  I also found that it will take out permanent black magic  maker.  I really couldn&#x27;t be happy about my laundry if I didn&#x27;t have this to use.</li>
            <li> Old fashion dry cleaning fluid. Very fast</li>
            <li> This item is very difficult to find in stores but is fantastic.  I have a cat and white carpets and this stain remover easily removes all cat food stains on my carpet.  I normally have to do three applications but it is as easy as spraying it on, let dry for 10 minutes, rub with top of the can and it&#x27;s done!  Great product.</li>
            <li> This is the best stain lifter for greasy stains.  Nothing works better.  I will always buy this product and keep it on hand.</li>
            <li> So far, I have not been able to remove any stain with this product.  Save your money because anything is better than this.</li>
            <li> Works well to remove grease spots.  Also to clean the neck line of shirts and blouses that would need to be sent to a dry cleaners.</li>
            <li> used for yrs on better, dry clean, clothes.  removes food spills and spots w/ oily base very quickly.  rare that it doesn&#x27;t work!</li>
            <li> I have used K2R for many years, but lately have had a hard time finding it locally.  I am pleased that I was able to order it on Amazon to treat small spots on fabrics that would otherwise need dry cleaning.</li>
            <li> I use K2R for grease spot removal.  I have tried many products, but NONE work as well as K2R.  Some may remove the grease, but they also fade the fabric.  Others leave a lingering odor that is offensive.  K2R has never faded any of the fabrics I have used it on and it does not leave any lingering odor.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t like this product at all.  It was recommended to me by the dry cleaner and I read the reviews on line.  All but one were positive reviews but it seems there are now two negatives.  This product did nothing to remove any of the stains I purchased it for.  I would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> Works great on stains on rugs, furniture and clothing. By far the best cleaner I have used. I wish I had found this earlier, it would have saved quite a few items from the trash bin.</li>
            <li> Got the job done on a wool suit when even dry cleaning couldn&#x27;t get the job done. Well worth having a can on hand. I decided the built-in plastic brush might be a little harsh on the fabric so I used my clothes brush instead to wipe off the dried powder. Worked fine and I feel better about it.</li>
            <li> This is basically dry cleaning in a can. Gets out spots that other methods won&#x27;t, particularly grease or other marks. Make sure fabric is color safe first.</li>
            <li> I was happy to be able to buy this spot remover again that I used to use often on my clothes. Unfortunately it did not get the grease out of my bedspread that was deposited by the commercial dryer I fluffed it in.</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> ▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄█▓▒░  Excellent Product!  Fast Shipping! Thanks!  ░▒▓█▀▄▀▄▀▄▀▄</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t remove spots for me</li>
            <li> This doesnt work at all and just leave a bunch of white powder everywhere.</li>
            <li> Kr2 is great for spots on non-washable clothes. I couldn&#x27;t find it in the grocery stores, so was glad to be able to order it via Amazon.</li>
            <li> This spot remover is amazing. It especially works great on ties. I haven&#x27;t found a fabric that it doesn&#x27;t work on.</li>
            <li> This removed candle wax stain from a bright blue silk dress. Just followed directions. Saved the dress.</li>
            <li> Ordered by mistake but am glad to have it.  Works fine.</li>
            <li> this product gets rid of every grease stain known to man. You spray it on, wait till it dries, then put it as is in the wash and the garment will come out spotless. Every time. A great product.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a reason this product is still around. It works great! I love that it drys to a powder and the cap is a built in brush. It works great on fabrics where its not good to use water.</li>
            <li> There was a stain of some kind on a bulky white wool sweater than I had knitted myself, and water wouldn&#x27;t budge it. Good old K2R removed the stain completely with two applications.  I can&#x27;t find this product in stores any more, so I was so happy to find it online.</li>
            <li> this stuff really works</li>
            <li> To my view, the best stain remover product out there.  You do have to wash (or dry clean) the garment once sprayed, but it removes blood, red wine, butter, etc.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of all the great reviews but it&#x27;s awful! It leaves a ring around the spot no matter how much you scrub.  It has left bigger stains than the ones I was trying to cleanup.  Honestly, worst cleaning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> The product didn&#x27;t work after multiply tries. My son dropped salsa on the floor and is tried the product multiple times as can directed but no luck.. I got the stain out with another product purchased somewhere else.</li>
            <li> This stuff is the best spot remover for carpet or uphosltery that I have ever used.  I can&#x27;t find it at any of the local retailers.  Why does nobody sell it?  I bought it on Amazon and as usual it worked great, BUT IT IS EXPENSIVE!  I would give it 5 stars if not for the cost.</li>
            <li> Based on what this product said it would do... it did not.  A total waste of money.  i would not buy this again.</li>
            <li> Totally reliable product on fabrics. Read the label for good info for appropriate fabrics. Has saved me $ hundreds over the years.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re probably can ask for a better cleaning solvent for carpets. There is a strong over so door with the windows open but it&#x27;s well worth it it&#x27;s gotten up all kinds of soil. Great product</li>
            <li> I befame familiar with K2r a ton of years ago.  Then it disappeared off the market for a long time.  I was so happy to find it again.  Gets all stains out that are grease related even after the garment was washed.  Even useable on silk and leaves no rings!</li>
            <li> Pricey, but it really works.  It saved a bunch of t shirts that would have gone in the trash.  Really got out the food stains like they never even happened.  Works well on carpets also, but it stinks.</li>
            <li> This stuff is expensive compared to Resolve and other carpet cleaners but based on the good reviews I decided to try this out.  I am very disappointed as this stuff hardly did anything for my carpet stains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A person has to come back and dust the K2R ten minutes after it&#x27;s sprayed. I don&#x27;t know of any other stain remover requiring that.  Not to mention this stuff is extremely toxic and highly flammable.  The back of the can is filled with disclaimers and warnings.  A bottle of Resolve or Woolite works just as well if not better and without all the toxic garbage K2R, you&#x27;ve to breathe in when using k2R!</li>
            <li> I think the success people have with this really depends on what they&#x27;re using it on.  The product says it works well on all dry clean items, however that&#x27;s just not true.  I used on some Crate &amp; Barrel Silk couch pillow covers that had some protein shake droplets on it.  The brush on the top SHOULD NOT be used on material like this.  I could immediately see it start to pull some of the threads apart.  This was only after one light brush using the edge of the bristles.  So I would not recommend this for any delicate materials.  Secondly the white powder left after the product has dried does not come off easily.  I&#x27;m assuming it would if you had a sturdier fabric that you could fully brush, but as stated before this isn&#x27;t possible with delicate material, so a visible mark remains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m taking the pillow covers to a dry cleaner as the label says before any more damage is done.</li>
            <li> I used this product to get some stains out of the seats in my truck. I heard that it might work and I was willing to give anything a shot. Low and behold, the stains are gone!</li>
            <li> I bought this item because no body made another brand I used to buy anymore. This product works just like the other brand. If you need a spot remover that&#x27;s quick and works this is your product.</li>
            <li> Did just what I wanted it to... that is removing dirt and nicotine stains from some expensive Bose Speaker covers that could not be removed from the speakers. Two passes and they look like new and did not damage the speakers.  If it was just a little lower in cost I would have given five stars.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find in stores.  Great for cleaning off makeup on the collar or other spots. Doesn&#x27;t leave a ring.  Will clean a grease spot on a wool rug, also.</li>
            <li> apparently -- an ingredient was removed due to EPA regs.  Probably better for our environment, but not as effective as the old version.</li>
            <li> This is a very good spot remover.  I have used it for years but had trouble finding it in the stores recently so was very glad to see it was still available online.</li>
            <li> Horrible product that only makes stains worse as the \\&quot;spot lifting\\&quot; powder gets stuck in the fibers and will not release. Ruined a knit polo, so I trashed it, so don&#x27;t waste a penny on this stuff. Says it&#x27;s for dry cleanables, but the directions tell you to launder as usual after applied and rubbed off. If I have to take the garment to the cleaners anyhow, then why bother pretreating with this stuff. Completely useless.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for many years now and it is consistently good at removing spots. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Used to be able to buy it in stores but unable to find it near my home.</li>
            <li> Smelly, but the best spot remover I&#x27;ve ever found. Seems it&#x27;s no longer available in stores, or I can&#x27;t find it.</li>
            <li> K2r is the best product I have found to remove grease or oil stains from clothing.  When my can of K2r dried up, I looked for the product locally and could not find it.  Amazon to the rescue.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> After all of the years this product has been around, this is still the best for removing most stains. I seem to drop oily food on my shirt as i eat. That was always such a problem to launder out. My sister reminded me of this product that my Mom had used in our youth (the 1960&#x27;s). It was the solution.</li>
            <li> I remember this product from when I was a kid.  It really works well.  I got it to remove a couple of spots I couldn&#x27;t get out with other products.  Worked like a charm.  It does have a strong odor.  Make sure to use it in a well ventilated area.</li>
            <li> Had an toxic like smell that filled the entire room when using this product in addition to my clothes too. Didn&#x27;t work very well on the stains on my couch. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
            <li> This stain remover has been around for generations.  I remember originally using it as a roll-on liquid about 50 years ago.  I am sure the formula has changed, but this stiff still works well on grease-type stains.  Just spray it on, let dry, and wash.  Forget the goofy plastic bristle top.  I wouldn&#x27;t even think of using it on my clothes.  Maybe a back scratcher.</li>
            <li> I had a coffee stain in a handmade Persian carpet.  Some guest I didn&#x27;t know told me she didn&#x27;t use saucers for her coffee cup and proceeded to place the full cup on the edge of the table, from whence it spilled.  Unable to do what was necessary during the party, I tried ll the usual things post-party, swearing and nearly in tears.  This is a beautiful carpet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried everything, for weeks, and stain was still there.  Finally, I read an online post about coffee stains with cited K2R, a product I remember from childhood.  I ordered a can.  It worked, mostly.  But I didn&#x27;t have enough for a full second application.  So I ordered another can. 2nd and 3rd application kept getting more and more of the stain out.  Finally ordered a 3rd can, and after 4-5 applications the damed stain was gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K2R works, where other products and methods didn&#x27;t.  So why not 4-stars?  &#x27;Cause this is nasty stuff.  CA require a cancer warning on the product.  You&#x27;re going to inhale this power.  Can&#x27;t help it.  I would try all other methods for stain removal first and use this as a last resort.  And obviously when you use it, be careful!</li>
            <li> I bought this with high hopes, remembering the former product that was taken off the market by the EPA. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this new version.  The can looks the same, but the contents aren&#x27;t even close to being effective.  I had  relatively new blue shirt with a small grease spot.  This junk turned the small grease spot into a large very dark ring.  The reasons are: 1. The former good stuff had a fair amount af some sort of grease absorbent powder in it.  After shaking the can of the new stuff for five minutes there was barely enough af the absorbent powder coming out to even see.  The solvents are much too polar - they dissolved the dye in the shirt, making the large dark ring.  the ring was the dye in the shirt, not the grease.  In summry there are a lot cheaper ways to ruin clothes than using this stuff.  I&#x27;d give it minus four stars if I could.</li>
            <li> Works well for a home with a doxy puppy</li>
            <li> Worked fairly well but did not completely remove stained material.</li>
            <li> Nothing short of what I expected, in fact (oddly enough) it works just like the can it replaced.  good bye</li>
            <li> This is the only product I know of it&#x27;s kind.  I can&#x27;t stand a spot, even a very small one, on my jackets or pants.  This will remove it.</li>
            <li> I have an somewhat pricey Under Armour jacket (although a few years old) that had a large stain on the front for quite a while. I am not sure what it was from, but it was enough to make the jacket unwearable except for yard work. I think it may have been oil based. I tried everything from washing it dozens of times, to pre-scrubbing and pre-treating it, but nothing worked. I even brought it to the dry cleaner and pointed out the stain to them, but they were unable to remove it. I tried the K2r as a last resort before throwing the jacket out. I sprayed it on and let it dry as the instructions said. When it dried white and I brushed away the powder, the stain was basically highlighted in white. It wasn&#x27;t part of the instructions, but I then washed it. It came out of the wash with 100% of the stain gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The can says do not use on waterproof material, and I would classify the shell as \\&quot;somewhat waterproof\\&quot;. That materials tag lists the makeup as 85% nylon and 15% elastine. Whether or not the material was negatively effected I can&#x27;t tell, however, the large greasy spot that had been there for a couple years, and almost caused me to throw away a jacket that was in otherwise good condition, is gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a heavy user of Amazon.com, but this is the first review I have written because I am highly impressed. This stuff works!</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  I tried it on a stain that had been in a jacket for months - red, greasy stain from pizza - and it came out!  I couldn&#x27;t believe it!  That jacket alone made up for the cost of the cleaner.  It also got stains out of a sofa cushion.</li>
            <li> I made a beautiful baby blanket, washed it, dried it, and as I was pressing it noticed a blue blob near the edge. Talk about wanting to scream... So I went to the local huge grocery store and bought one of every stain product they had. Then I went to the local Ace hardware to see if they had anything more. They did, and one of the things they had was K2r. I thought, wow, blast from the past, I haven&#x27;t heard anything about K2r in many years. I bought a can and carted my truckload of stain products home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep in mind, I have no idea what this stain is, or how it got there, so I have no idea what will get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fels Naphtha soap was the first thing I tried. It got some of the stain out, but not all of it. Next came two types of Resolve stain stuff; they didn&#x27;t do anything, but I didn&#x27;t really expect them to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then came K2r. I had to let my previous attempts dry before trying it. Once dry, I sprayed some on the stain and let it dry. Brushed it out, and whaddya know, the stain was quite a bit lighter. Tried again, even lighter. Tried a few more times until the stain was almost invisible, and it didn&#x27;t seem that any more was coming out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little duplicate stitch with a yarn needle, and, presto - while I can find it, I pass over it a few times before finding it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think K2r is going to be the first thing I try for my next unknown, and maybe even for my next known, stain. This was pretty amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing, though - make sure the windows are wide open before you spray this stuff. The fumes are pretty amazing, too.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t believe supermarkets no longer carry this.  My mother swore by it, and it&#x27;s still the only thing that gets oily stains out of fabric.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get the red slushie stain out of my carpet</li>
            <li> Gave used it for years. Excellent product if follow directions.</li>
            <li> For the past five decades, we have used K2r for spot removal.  Greasy spot?  Spray on, let dry, brush off...cleaning bill avoided!  It&#x27;s not as easy to find K2r as it used to be, so I&#x27;m very grateful to have a new supply!</li>
            <li> Its a great product discovered here in amazon.I accidentally ruined my north face apex bionic jacket with butter from corn on the cob.&lt;br /&gt;After inquiring  Dry cleaners the cost I wanted to save some $.&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;1)Just follow the instructions it was able to remove  2 month old stain and the jacket retained its water repellant properties&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;2) Brush provided on the cap is not suitable for delicate clothes&lt;br /&gt;I have not used any other competitor products just regular dry cleaner.</li>
            <li> Bought it for microfiber couch&lt;br /&gt;works as described, lots of scrubbing and caustic smelling &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34;-foam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;wtf 5 more words !</li>
            <li> This is a great easy to use on the spot whenever you drop liquid, oily food or anything that stains on your cloth/furniture... The only thing I do not like is when u need to brush it off after it dries.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t found anything that compares to this product for getting out oils from clothing. It&#x27;s pretty incredible. Since moving to the SW, we have had to order it online, and laundry waits for its arrival!</li>
            <li> I have a whole bunch of products in my laundry area that I bought because they promised to remove stains.  Most of them don&#x27;t seem to do much.  I dutifully dab them onto stains and wash the garment, and perhaps the stain is a bit lighter, but not a great solution.  The worst stain I encounter is grease/oil on cotton or cotton/poly blends.  It has been nearly impossible to get that out until I got this stuff.  You just spray it on the grease stain, wait for it to dry and turn white, and brush it off.  You don&#x27;t even have to wash the garment afterwards (for those times when you find the stain after the garment has been washed and dried).  It does not smell toxic and has not harmed any of the fabrics I have used it on.  I will be getting this again.</li>
            <li> This product has been around for many years but it is no longer highly advertised so it does not get purchased as much anymore as far as I know. It works very well to remove oily stains from clothing that you might be unwilling or unable to launder. It uses a very volatile solution with imbedded powder to bring the material to the surface clinging to the powder, which you then brush off. The only complaint I have ever had with it is that the powder sometimes does not brush off completely and you have to either reapply the solution or sponge it with a wet cloth which might not be suitable for delicate clothing. Even so, it does the job and it is particularly useful if you are out to dinner and spill some greasy food on yourself. If you have some in the car you can go out and treat yourself for about 5 min. and remove the ugly stain. It&#x27;s worth a try as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
            <li> Not happy right now! This product not only didn&#x27;t remove the stains on my daughter&#x27;s volleyball jersey but it peeled off the corners of her number!  Surprised this says it&#x27;s safe to use on &amp;#34;dry-clean only&amp;#34; clothing.  So frustrated!</li>
            <li> This is the product we havebeen looking for. My husband has R/C planes and this producthelped reove the gas residue without hurting th plane cover.</li>
            <li> is not the original stuff-had to air out the house-left a worse stain-very disappointed as I loved the original</li>
            <li> Not as good as other reviews I have read on Amazon. Would not get out nacho cheese stain on upholstery. Used better products in the past.</li>
            <li> It works, always has.</li>
            <li> When all else fails, this usually does the job.  At the final step of brushing it off  the garment I use a&lt;br /&gt;gauze mask to preent breathing in any particiles.</li>
            <li> Best spot remover ever. Got salad dressing on a brand new tie, cold not find this product in stores so after a couple months I ordered from Amazon. Took the spot out with one application.</li>
            <li> Great to remove olive oil, pasta sauce etc from t shirt and shirts. Often a slight white residual remains, but after one wash it&#x27;s gone and the shirts are prestin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works on everything else, but I do know it takes black crayon out of velour, and it takes magic marker (YES, magic marker) off of corduroy. I thought I was going to have to re-upholster the couch, but K2r saved the day. Thanks!</li>
