            <li>Drinks lots of water, eat healthy and moisturize!</li>
            <li>Cocoa Butter Lotion gives amazing moisture without greasy leftover.</li>
            <li>Product smells and moisturizes nice but has no effect.</li>
            <li>my theory has been that the lotion helps the oil absorb into the skin and seals it off nicely.</li>
            <li>Would be great to be able to better see ingredients, etc.  </li>
            <li>Just hope it will be effective to my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I will be buying the tummy butter to add to my routine just to make sure the \\&quot;good looking skin trend\\</li>
            <li>Smells really yummy too &amp; moisturizes perfectly.</li>
            <li>do absolutely nothing and hope for the best (then atleast</li>
            <li>so I have to kind of scoop it out.</li>
            <li>its great and leaves your skin feeling sexy and smoothed you will love it so buy it now take my word</li>
            <li>The glass bottle is good for baby&#x27;s healthy.</li>
            <li>smells really nice and it lasts for a while</li>
            <li>It feels good putting on the tummy and for sure relieves any dryness.</li>
            <li>fast shipping, Perfect!</li>
            <li>Earth Mama stretch mark oil for the itching (works great and dissolves quickly), and Sanctuary hypoallergenic stretch mark lotion (because I am hopeful, and still am doing whatever I can to avoid more marks!)</li>
            <li>well there is not much to say, it is a great product and was an excellent price, will buy again !</li>
            <li>Nothing super, nothing great</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more for sure!</li>
            <li>The aroma is also chocolaty nice :)</li>
            <li>It takes a bit longer to be absorbed into the skin, but feels great as it keeps your skin hydrated.</li>
            <li>Great lotion, but it does not absorb into the skin right away</li>
            <li>I use this cream with my three pregnant and never appear stretch marks in my skin , my skin is very clean, this product is excellet!!</li>
            <li>Smells great, works great, isn&#x27;t greasy and actually does seem to have some effect on stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I love it, it works great and was priced right.</li>
            <li>Been using this stuff for some time now, very light and not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>It is very light and has a nice light smell.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d recommend to anyone :)</li>
            <li>but no where, where I applied this magical cream.</li>
            <li>Then at 20 weeks, upon reading too many blogs, etc.</li>
            <li>My baby boy is being delivered Friday via c-section (breech), so I think it is safe to say I have escaped them.</li>
            <li>quite sure whether the lotion helped or not,</li>
            <li>it smelled better, though.</li>
            <li>I then decided to buy another bottle thinking that maybe I just needed to give it more time, but again nothing happened.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not awful.  </li>
            <li>Just love this product.  </li>
            <li>its under my clothes! :)</li>
            <li>We will see if it helps prevent getting stretchmarks! :)</li>
            <li>I will probably order more.</li>
            <li>Literally WHILE I was putting it on, my skin looked better.</li>
            <li>I love Palmers.  </li>
            <li>I use this up to 3 times a day along with my bio-oil, and now my tummy looks 10 times better than it did before.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s going OK haven&#x27;t seen any change</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li>I love this coco butter not like the one that comes in the jar that one is</li>
            <li>I love</li>
            <li>if it work then I will Order for two more..am sure it will</li>

            <li>Absolutely love this lotion</li>
            <li>I love it for my nite cream...</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize how potent the smell was.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking ok, it may not prevent stretch marks</li>
            <li>Love this production...</li>
            <li>I use the even more affordable [[ASIN:B001JGIXNA</li>
            <li>I have enjoyed it</li>
            <li>I love this lotion.  </li>
            <li>but I love the way it feels for hours</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great and feel good on my growing belly, but it stops the itchiness.</li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>You can see and feel that your skin is hydrated after applying, and I love the way it is healing for the skin.  </li>
            <li>I love this lotion.</li>

            <li>can&#x27;t say for sure</li>
            <li>Stay hydrated and maintain a healthy bmi.</li>
            <li>I LOVE COCOA BUTTER</li>
            <li>IT WORKS BETTER</li>
            <li>I love cocoa butter skin care products.</li>
            <li>Love it (:</li>
            <li>I opened up the bottle and realizes that the lotion had turned to a paste consistancy and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it.</li>
            <li>Many articles say no</li>
            <li>I will get more when i need it.</li>
            <li>I bought this lotion and its ok.</li>
            <li>I also LOVE the smell.</li>
            <li>I mostly focused on m belly area and sometimes my thighs.</li>
            <li>I love this through out my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>They say it is mostly genetic</li>
            <li>She made sure to use this stuff every day, even before she started showing.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect anything to magically make your stretch marks vanish.</li>
            <li>I love this product, it works better than cocoa butter for stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Be aware amazon buyers from here !!!</li>
            <li>It has a very rich smell to it, like chocolate.</li>
            <li>Good genes or lotion or both, I don&#x27;t know but certainly the lotiin can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really stink, but it&#x27;s not the most pleasant thing either.</li>
            <li>getting out of the shower works great and its not thick or not watery</li>
            <li>This way the skin stays supple and hydrated all day long, not to mention smells delicious!</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it is easy to apply, not too greasy.</li>
            <li>But if you&#x27;re like me and you get stretch marks during pregnancy this is the best, creamiest, good smelling, thick lotion.</li>
            <li>, I will update this review after I give birth for the most accurate review).</li>
            <li>goes on smooth, smells OK.</li>
            <li>I am happy to say that I had my baby nearly 4 months ago and do not have any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Great, no stretch mark so far, not too greesy</li>
            <li>This is great if you can&#x27;t use the butter because your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li>The main reason WHY I prefer this lotion in the morning compared to anything else is because its non-greasy, light, doesnt have a strong smell (not the most pleasant smell but not unbearable either), and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li>Its smell is very nice and the its ingredient is natural.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works for pregnancy, and shouldn&#x27;t know at nineteen years old anyway!  :P  </li>
            <li>I love Palmer&#x27;s Original Cocoa Butter Formula, I use it all over including my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am now 30 weeks pregnant and so far so good!  </li>
            <li>Has a bit of a strong smell.  </li>
            <li>It was cloying and too strong.</li>
            <li>The oil has a strong oil scent and the regulation lotion also has a cocoa butter scent, both of which I don&#x27;t prefer.  </li>
            <li>Purchased it to use on my sons stretch marks it does not have a strong odor</li>
            <li>and so far so good :)</li>
            <li>Since I have been having morning sickness and has been very sensitive to the smell, I prefer something which have pleasant smell or unscented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard good comments, but have just started to use it, so I cannot really tell if it will work or not, but so far it feels good.</li>
            <li>Nice &amp; thick, good staying power &amp; smells good too.</li>
            <li>I think the moisturizing quality was fine and it lasted a while</li>
            <li>and it seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li>I just ran out of this lotion, so I need to stop by the store and pick up another one, quick!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, super moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>My advice is to use this on every inch of your body while you&#x27;re pregnant since it seemed to work well on the areas it was applied!</li>
            <li>This is a fantastic lotion to use while pregnant!</li>
            <li>but in this time with amazon it just gave me huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;since</li>
            <li>I ordered online through amazon and was free shipping and got delivered in 7 days.</li>
            <li>I have light stretch marks on my stomach...</li>
            <li>Has kept me virtually stretch mark free through two pregnancies.</li>
            <li>It keeps the skin comfortable and the smell is lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fragrance is light and smells like cocoa butter and has this organic smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Not greasy, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li>Thank goodness its cheap, I will probably get the cream too for overnight usage.  </li>
            <li>It even smells fabulous, and I&#x27;m not one for fragrant lotions</li>
            <li>so thick.this one goes on so smooth</li>
            <li>Great for use post partum too when your tummy is trying to get back in shape.</li>
            <li>But the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li>I like the smell of it and how smooth it goes on.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think anything can except fate, so anything is worth a try :)</li>
            <li>Thank goodness they were so cheap</li>
            <li>In the end, I guess it&#x27;s important to remember that nothing will ever get rid of stretch marks 100%, but</li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t expect this kind of experiences...</li>
            <li>but I am sooo happy they are finally gone.</li>
            <li>It blends into the skin and leaves it feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>After speaking with Palmer&#x27;s, I discovered that this product has been discontinued, and instead Palmer&#x27;s is shipping out the \\&quot;light scent\\&quot; version of this product.</li>
            <li>As a result, it feels like a cheap product when you put it on, like it has no substance to</li>
            <li>Happy overall with item.</li>
            <li>Stretch marks are genetic, so I can&#x27;t say whether this has actually prevented them or not, but it is a great moisturizer for a stretching belly.</li>
            <li>but I am still free of them.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s soft and smells good.</li>
            <li>and I have yet to see stretch marks, so far so good.</li>
            <li>originally bought it, because I heard it can help get rid of stretch marks.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks were purple and have faded significantly.</li>
            <li>but please try not to stress about it, know that sometimes there really isn&#x27;t anything you can do, and enjoy the ride that is pregnancy anyway. :)</li>
            <li>What I especially find exciting about this emulsion its is great smell and the way it glides onto the fingers when applied.</li>
            <li>I found the smell to be rather pleasant actually.  </li>
            <li>Then applying it to the skin works a treat on whatever needs that special touch, even those unsightly stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Since I am pregnant, I use it on my stomach, I hope not long stretch marks.it smell good.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone who wants their skin to be silky and smooth!</li>
            <li>The smell is sweet like chocolate.</li>
            <li>My skin is nice and soft ..</li>
            <li>Some say that having \\&quot;good genes\\&quot; is the only way to avoid stretch marks during pregnancy</li>
            <li>but they are ALL fading which is good enough for me.</li>
            <li>Excellent, thick lotion cream with a yummy chocolatey scent that I use for my prego belly.</li>
            <li>but the smell is too sweet.</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are still easily visible but by no means the bright pink monsters they used to be.</li>
            <li>Great product to keep belly moisturized to avoid stretch marks (along with other palmers products).</li>
            <li>While I was pregnant, I did not use anything to prevent stretch marks, thinking I wouldn&#x27;t get any.</li>
            <li>My mother bought this for me as a gift when i was pregnant</li>
            <li>i didnt get stretch marks till i was around 30 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li>I use this lotion and the cocoa butter as well on my pregnant belly.</li>
            <li>I began using Palmers at 15 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li>It is not oily and absorbs quickly as well.</li>
            <li>If you are concerned about using products with Parabens while pregnant do not order this product.  </li>
            <li>When I got pregnant I gained 70 pounds (I know...)  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m pregnant again and am not taking any chances</li>
            <li>I was pregnant at 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li>I started using while I was about 37 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li>It also helped soothe my super itchy pregnancy skin.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not 33 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>I hope this review helps atleast one pregnant woman out there...</li>
            <li>I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li>I used to 2 times a day while pregnant and still got tons of stretch marks on my belly and hips.  </li>
            <li>and i&#x27;m 6 months pregnant.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lotion since I was 7 week pregnant.</li>
            <li>, it absorbs really quick</li>
            <li>I got pregnant</li>
            <li>Bought for granddaughter who is pregnant.</li>
            <li>I recommend this to every pregnant mother-to-be.</li>
            <li>So, once I became pregnant myself, I decided to give this a shot.</li>
            <li>I am 7 months pregnant and have no stretch marks at all on my growing belly.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect any quick miracle results though.</li>
            <li>This product is designed for pregnant women.</li>
            <li>Light, not greasy, and really did prevent strecthmarks!</li>
            <li>great product, keeps my skin moisturized during the day and minimizes stretch marks and has cleared up some dark spots on my skin.</li>
            <li>I work out regularly and have a pretty good diet plan.  </li>
            <li>When I first opened the package I tried to pump the nozzle and nothing came out!</li>
            <li>and I have already gained 29 pounds throughout my own (currently I&#x27;m 30 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s worth paying $8.45.</li>
            <li>I bout it for some fresh ones on my bum, never had stretch marks before.</li>
            <li>I had tried naturally derived lotions with healthy amounts of vitamins to even rubbing Salmon oil on my skin.</li>
            <li>For the sheer fact that I saw a marked improvement in moments of usage, I am elated, relieved, happy</li>
            <li>Honestly this product does not work, i used it for several months and there was no difference.</li>
            <li>Not afraid to show my body.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth the shot.</li>
            <li>not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li>I hope it is useful for my wife.</li>
            <li>didnt remove stretch marks...not useful but sticky</li>
            <li>I feel like a chocolate chip, or fresh cake batter.</li>
            <li>The only reason my rating is not higher is because unforgettably this lotion smells a million times better and is thicker if you get it without the added shea butter.</li>
            <li>I assumed since this product is mostly aimed at pregnant women this brand would be responsible enough to not have parabens or have an easy way to find out if there are any.  </li>
            <li>My product arrived very fast, and I am pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li>The only thing I liked about it was the smell and how it made my skin feel; it smells like chocolate and smells almost good enough to eat and keeps your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li>So instead of treat it right away when it started I decided to neglect it.    </li>
            <li>but right now I haven&#x27;t seen any stretch marks.</li>
            <li>Right after I apply Palmers, I also add a couple drops of vitamin E oil and rub that in.</li>
            <li>Then I use Palmer&#x27;s every morning and right before bed.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully I have the right product</li>
            <li>&amp; I searched for a product that would reduce my stretch marks right away.</li>
            <li>My wife has used this for her first two pregnancies, (the first being with twins), and she does not have one stretch mark on her!</li>
            <li>cocoa smell is very powerful, sweet and not probably suitable for women who are sensitive to different smells.</li>
            <li>Most importantly it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes like other lotions.</li>
            <li>But please if you are serious about changing your skin, nothing is a cure-all, eat healthy, and take vitamins, omega&#x27;s, and live happy.</li>
            <li>(3) Repeat exact process right before bed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good lotion, but I believe the one I received was several years old.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Helps a great deal with heavy miniaturization much needed in the mid-west winters.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s nice and thick with a better scent.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t rate this lotion five stars just because even that the smells is nice, I&#x27;m kind of getting tired of it.</li>
            <li>, it goes on smoothly, and my skin has never been so soft!  </li>
            <li>Ive read many reviews in the past where women make the mistake of only applying cream on the stomach and then regret it because thier stomach looks great but everything else is covered with stretch marks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m twenty years old and pregnant with my first child; I&#x27;ve been using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter for stretch marks since I was about 18 weeks pregnant, where as I didn&#x27;t even begin to show until I was about 15 weeks.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t love is the smell.</li>
            <li>i am not going to continue to use a product that&#x27;s done nothing after the first month.</li>
            <li>(2) Repeat exact procedure with two pumps of Palmers...</li>
            <li>It gives my skin a soft silky smooth appearance.</li>
            <li>I used it because like lip pumpers it is sort of tingly at first</li>
            <li>First off just wanted to let everyone know I am a guy.</li>
            <li>To find a product that actually works i believe it will cost you more than 9 dollars, i have yet to find one.</li>
            <li>Best thing about this product is that it actually made my skin firm!</li>
            <li>I definitely prefer it to Mederma. :)</li>
            <li>This is my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s probably because I wasn&#x27;t consistent with it</li>
            <li>It was recommended to me during my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does warn that you can have an allergic reaction and to test on your forearm first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been used this item since my first pregnancy.(been 2</li>
            <li>I ordered this a couple months ago and am currently ordering more but this time</li>
            <li>, I think the oil I use daily works better to keep my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li>but I think it&#x27;s pretty content.</li>
            <li>I think I would recommend it, but I would definitely put it on more than once a day.</li>
            <li>I actually came back and ordered 2 more bottles because I love it so much!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a first time mommy to be and taking every precaution to prevent stretch marks,</li>
            <li>even though they say it&#x27;s totally genetics, I think your health routine has a lot more to do with it.</li>
            <li>This is my first pregnancy</li>
            <li>When you are putting it on a pregnant belly it is a large surface area and that smell is too much.</li>
            <li>so it feels pretty clean and dry easily.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t get many stretch marks, but I was also fortunate to gain less than 30 pounds.</li>
            <li>and I already had many in other parts of my body before getting pregnant.</li>
            <li>I have honestly tried better (in terms of moisturizing) lotions from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li>However, I decided to do my best to avoid them or at least try to reduce them is possible.</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells, and although it&#x27;s not as thick as the Burt&#x27;s Bees Belly Butter, this product has more ingredients that seem to diminish stretch marks.</li>
            <li>It smells nice enough, and is a soft, non-greasy lotion</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 28 years old and am pregnant with our first baby.  </li>
            <li>&quot; continues.&lt;br /&gt;The smell (especially if you&#x27;re fighting a lot of morning sickness) is pretty strong</li>
            <li>Considering to return it because I am not sure if the quality is still good.</li>
            <li>on my stomach, breasts, ribcage, hips, thighs, and butt (they say lotion absorbs into the skin the most right after taking a shower than at any other time throughout the day).</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this lotion - nice and thick but not greasy, very soothing, and makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li>These ladies are not heavy to begin with, but they are basically scarred for life and that made my wife super nervous.</li>
            <li>So far so good, my dark stretch marks have already lightened up.</li>
            <li>Smells a little strange, but good smooth product</li>
            <li>It is thick and creamy, with a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li>The reason I love this product is because with pregnancy my skin gets very dry as well as itchy.</li>
            <li>specific formula is creamier and a little oilier, which is great to help keep the tummy moisturized.</li>
            <li>I really dont like the smell</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li>not really work for me, but love the smell</li>
            <li>I really wish I would have known this stuff would do absolutely nothing for me so that I could have invested in something that would have helped.</li>
            <li>still received some light marks on my lower abdomen, which have not disappeared in the 6 months following</li>
            <li>However, this lotion did moisture very well, but that is it.</li>
            <li>Only the organic line is paraben free.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how much I can prove this worked</li>
            <li>Thanks palmers</li>
            <li>I have some areas that I really really dont like to look at because of the size and the amount of marks I have.</li>
            <li>I cant wait for my girlfriend to smell me... haha</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle</li>
            <li>I know it is a part of having babies, but I really thought this would help</li>
            <li>6 dollars for this product all ready seeing results in a month.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t really help my stretch mark</li>
            <li>And is very mositurizing.</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>My stretch marks are red as I am light skin color, just don&#x27;t give up after a week or two</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not out too much money.</li>
            <li>However, I am currently 30 weeks and still stretch mark free, so maybe this helped do the job.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really think anything can really prevent stretchmarks since they say their hereditary.  </li>
            <li>but i do really like the lotion</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s to much cocoa smell for me...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li>the oil is really oily and stains my nightshirts if I don&#x27;t let it soak in for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t think it really did much for my stretch marks.</li>
            <li>She really likes it.</li>
            <li>It has the cocoa butter she likes and the vitamin E I like, Arrived fast too.,</li>
            <li>The smell itself doesn&#x27;t really bother me too much</li>
            <li>This product is very flaky.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just enough moisture, smells light, and is affordable.</li>
            <li>Thanks amazon</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know any lotion really work in preventing stretch marks.  </li>
            <li>I do not know if it really helps with preventing stretch marks</li>
            <li>Much cheaper</li>
            <li>I really like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li>They faded some, I didn&#x27;t really expect much</li>
            <li>So I tried this stuff to see if my skin would react as much to it</li>
            <li>They really help to weaken the stretch marks.</li>
            <li>were really visible before, but not purple or anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I like it so so much.</li>
            <li>, I put it on the back burner because I was more intrigued in using naturally derived lotions.</li>
            <li>Although does not make stretch marks disappear, they are much lighter and it works better than expected.</li>
            <li>To be honest, I have only used this product a handful of times, so, my star rating isn&#x27;t based upon whether or not it actually prevented any stretch marks but rather, it&#x27;s based on my thoughts around this</li>
            <li>But in the mean time it smells good</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll need to apply this lotion twice a day and make sure no clothing or any fabric touches the area as it will rub off, I personally just went shirtless or naked most days with fans on to make it dry out on my skin faster.</li>
            <li>so I was surprised to find such a strong one.</li>
            <li>This is an ok product, I have pretty deep stretch marks that have been there for a long time now</li>
            <li>so far Thanks!</li>
            <li>but the cocoa butter formula is classic.  </li>
            <li>yesterday 07/29/2014.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s totally different product that i bought this from duane reade it had great coconut smell with thick creamy texure.it&#x27;s walways like this..</li>
            <li>but it definitely keeps my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i&#x27;ve used it 3 times a day every day on my entire body since i found out i was pregnant at 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant and bought couple different brands pregnancy creams.</li>
            <li>and I never got one single stretch mark on my stomach (and it was huge).  </li>
            <li>I bought this to try and help prevent stretch marks as I am trying to lose weight right now, but it obviously hasn&#x27;t worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I was 130lbs when I graduated high school</li>
            <li>I highly doubt I got lucky.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li>I\\&quot;m using it as a base to mix it with other oils like Rose hips, grape seed oil, and vitamin E, the pump makes it much more easier for me to use it and the smell is nice too for me.</li>
            <li>This keeps my skin moisturized because it is very thick and smells good.</li>
            <li>lotion isn&#x27;t the best smelling lotion, but it isnt as bad as some reviewers are saying.</li>
            <li>Lotion is not thick</li>
            <li>I was amaze about the fast shipping bcos I saw it unexpectedly.........</li>
            <li>I started to work out not too long ago and as a result I got stretch marks near my back end of my biceps towards the armpit and had a fair share of stretch marks in my upper thighs.</li>
            <li>so I definitely think its worth it.  </li>
            <li>I use this product everyday and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li>Packaged this way, so much more product goes to waste.</li>
            <li>My wife uses it everyday :)</li>
            <li>(by the way, stretch mark removal surgery is expensive, and does a pretty good job, but I have not seen one that looks normal).</li>
            <li>So far so good but have only used a few days.</li>
            <li>Good product, poor packaging.  </li>
            <li>Nice and thick</li>
            <li>(right after I finally had accepted them).</li>
            <li>The fine lines I had starting are GONE after 4 months of daily use!</li>
            <li>Have been using this since last 3 months and has given amazing results such as reduce in itching, stretch marks to some extent but not completely</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve put on quite a bit of weight all around my belly, butt, and thighs and haven&#x27;t seen any new stretch marks.</li>
            <li>For the price it&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li>and I had to live on Benadryl.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This cream also helped prevent any new ones from forming coz believe me, I thought they&#x27;d never stop.</li>
            <li>I bought this because I have a big problem with dry patches on my skin, and so far I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything to hydrate me.</li>
            <li>glycerine can be animal, vegetable or synthetic, but I would double check from the company, some cruelty free products are known to still have animal thing&#x27;s actually in it.</li>
            <li>it was enough to finally feel comfortable LOOKING at the spots.</li>
            <li>but it can be very overpowering, especially when you are pregnant and your sense of smell is especially heightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very soft scent that fades within an hour.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I am in second trimester and have been using this since first trimester.</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend, and it&#x27;s inexpensive too;)</li>
            <li>but the pressing top is not okay..........</li>
            <li>and so far NO STRETCH MARKS!</li>
            <li>And makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li>The product was delivered international 3 wks prior to the originally mentioned date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li>I used Mederma in the past, and I have to say I like Palmer&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li>I personally mixed three different products in a glass jar and it makes my skin and tummy feel super moisturized and baby soft and alleviates itching!</li>
            <li>I am aware that vitamin E is already included in the Palmers massage lotion for stretch marks, but I have a feeling that this is going to promote even more elasticity of the skin so a little extra can only help, not hurt.  </li>
            <li>putting this on as you get bigger during pregnancy doesn&#x27;t hurt, especially because it&#x27;s reasonably priced (I probably went through 2 bottles during the 9 months the first time around).</li>
            <li>The only issue I have is the aroma is less than appealing to me.</li>
            <li>then it should do wonders for dry skin, right?</li>
            <li>I tried the Mederma Advanced stuff and it worked a little.</li>
            <li>Now they just look like white little scars but that&#x27;s much better than having jagged red/purple marks on my hips during the summertime.</li>
            <li>My daughter is 8 months old</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have any stretch mark so far.</li>
            <li>Like it so far</li>
            <li>Eyes completely swelled up for 3 days</li>
            <li>Since I started using it, if people touch my skin they always comment on how soft it is.  </li>
            <li>and so far this moisturizer has not made me break out.</li>
            <li>Maybe it&#x27;s because I am darker skinned, but it hasn&#x27;t really worked enough for me to suggest it to others.</li>
            <li>these did not work on my old stretch marks.</li>
            <li>but like it says on the bottle makes skin sensitive.</li>
            <li>Zero stretch marks so far</li>
            <li>I was a fan of palmer&#x27;s tummy butter which they produced in 2010, for some reason this product has completely different smell, which I do not like so much.</li>
            <li>I use it faithfully every night before bed and it keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li>MAKES YOU SKIN FEEL SOFT</li>
            <li>It states to apply up to three times a day and with the hot weather and the fact that it is still quite greasy after application I do not like be soo sticky all day long.</li>
            <li>I developed no stretch mark</li>
            <li>I really like this lotion and have used it in the later stages of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li>I think stretch marks have a ton of factors that come into play and thus far ( at 9 months)</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li>What girl wants the extra five pounds?!</li>
            <li>I use this nearly daily, I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference in the stretch marks on my stomach.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 22 years old.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day (once in the morning and once before bed) and it has drastically faded stretch marks i&#x27;ve suffered from for about 5 years that have made me very self-concious and it only took about... 3 weeks tops.</li>
            <li>Just like my genetics still made me get a few tiny ones, but I still love this</li>
            <li>Love the smell, but a bit thick going on, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have emollient staying power.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this for stretch marks, but now I use it all over my body as an everyday lotion.  </li>
            <li>I used this lotion daily on my belly and sides starting when I first found out</li>
            <li>Then I actually bought this and have been using it for the past week or so and my stretch marks look so much better.</li>
            <li>but it took an extreme amount of time to absorb into my skin and it stained alot of my clothes, plus it didnt smell right</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for daily use, day and night.</li>
            <li>Just apply it at night, after your shower, and the next day the smell will be gone and you can carry on your day as normal.</li>
            <li>The pump of one bottle did not work well; after we contacted the customer service, a new bottle of lotion was shipped to us on the next day.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m saying all of this because I got stretch marks from dry skin and growing too fast.</li>
            <li>So after using several products, not seeing really any results, I bought this at a local retail outlet.</li>
            <li>I rub it on everyday because I am 8 months pregnant</li>
            <li>Used this almost everyday while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li>the price is higher than other web</li>
            <li>as an overnight cream (right on the back label it says \\&quot;widely used to treat stretch marks, before and after pregnancy\\&quot;).</li>
            <li>it smells very heavy and makes me nauseous, it might just be because i&#x27;m pregnant and overly sensitive to smells but just a warning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;from general market</li>
            <li>The lotion is very moisturizing and seems to last on my skin for a long time.</li>
            <li>I have tried literally EVERYTHING as far as moisturizer goes, and this one is, unfortunately, no different.  </li>
            <li>It worked for several months until I developed an allergic reaction to this cream.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only 17 years old and have alwayed been scared to wear two peace bathing suit.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve only had it for a month so far</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re barely even noticeable.</li>
            <li>I could barely see a difference.</li>
            <li>our doctor told us to continue using it until her tummy gets back to its old size.</li>
            <li>I use Mama Mio Tummy Rub Oil every day after getting out of the shower, and I let my tummy go bare for about an hour to soak in all the oil.  </li>
            <li>This lotion has helped them fade and turn back into my natural skin color, some of the stretch marks are taking longer to fade</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using just the regular Palmers Cocoa Butter for about 2 weeks or so and it lightened my marks up considerably.</li>
            <li>You can barely tell I have stretch marks anymore.</li>
            <li>I got two bottles in spanish that are Cocoa butter marked for post-partum firming.</li>
            <li>I try not to put clothes back on (or atleast lift my shirt high up and wear my pants as low as possible if I do need to keep my clothes on) until it is completely absorbed into my skin, which does take a little longer because it is a thicker formula</li>
            <li>and im pregnant and using, not sure if its helping or not.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used other products, so I cannot compare, but I don&#x27;t like the texture and smell that much.</li>
            <li>This lotion soothes my skin and keeps the relief longer than other products and the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li>I was sooooo itchy, and putting this cream on a few extra times a day helped calm the itching...</li>
            <li>but on my right side only a little have disappeared</li>
            <li>It is much thicker than an average moisturizer</li>
            <li>I guess its true what they say--there really isn&#x27;t anything to PREVENT stretch marks unless there is something that is ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li>It is not thick at all, like other tummy butters I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>My daughter really likes this lotion, very moisturizing, her skin has been very dry lately, so</li>

            <li> Cocoa Butter Lotion gives amazing moisture without greasy leftover.</li>
            <li> Product smells and moisturizes nice but has no effect.</li>
            <li> my theory has been that the lotion helps the oil absorb into the skin and seals it off nicely.</li>

            <li> Earth Mama stretch mark oil for the itching (works great and dissolves quickly), and Sanctuary hypoallergenic stretch mark lotion (because I am hopeful, and still am doing whatever I can to avoid more marks!)</li>

            <li> I&#x27;d recommend to anyone :)</li>
            <li> but no where, where I applied this magical cream.</li>
            <li> Then at 20 weeks, upon reading too many blogs, etc.</li>
            <li> My baby boy is being delivered Friday via c-section (breech), so I think it is safe to say I have escaped them.</li>
            <li> quite sure whether the lotion helped or not,</li>
            <li> it smelled better, though.</li>
            <li> I then decided to buy another bottle thinking that maybe I just needed to give it more time, but again nothing happened.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s not awful.  </li>
            <li> Just love this product.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s going OK haven&#x27;t seen any change</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this product.</li>
            <li> I love this coco butter not like the one that comes in the jar that one is</li>

            <li> IT WORKS BETTER</li>
            <li> I love cocoa butter skin care products.</li>
            <li> Love it (:</li>
            <li> I opened up the bottle and realizes that the lotion had turned to a paste consistancy and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it.</li>
            <li> Many articles say no</li>
            <li> I will get more when i need it.</li>

            <li> Be aware amazon buyers from here !!!</li>
            <li> It has a very rich smell to it, like chocolate.</li>
            <li> Good genes or lotion or both, I don&#x27;t know but certainly the lotiin can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t really stink, but it&#x27;s not the most pleasant thing either.</li>
            <li> getting out of the shower works great and its not thick or not watery</li>
            <li> This way the skin stays supple and hydrated all day long, not to mention smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it is easy to apply, not too greasy.</li>
            <li> But if you&#x27;re like me and you get stretch marks during pregnancy this is the best, creamiest, good smelling, thick lotion.</li>
            <li> , I will update this review after I give birth for the most accurate review).</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, smells OK.</li>
            <li> I am happy to say that I had my baby nearly 4 months ago and do not have any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Great, no stretch mark so far, not too greesy</li>
            <li> This is great if you can&#x27;t use the butter because your skin is sensitive.</li>
            <li> The main reason WHY I prefer this lotion in the morning compared to anything else is because its non-greasy, light, doesnt have a strong smell (not the most pleasant smell but not unbearable either), and is inexpensive.</li>
            <li> Its smell is very nice and the its ingredient is natural.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it works for pregnancy, and shouldn&#x27;t know at nineteen years old anyway!  :P  </li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s Original Cocoa Butter Formula, I use it all over including my face.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am now 30 weeks pregnant and so far so good!  </li>
            <li> Has a bit of a strong smell.  </li>
            <li> It was cloying and too strong.</li>
            <li> The oil has a strong oil scent and the regulation lotion also has a cocoa butter scent, both of which I don&#x27;t prefer.  </li>
            <li> Purchased it to use on my sons stretch marks it does not have a strong odor</li>
            <li> and so far so good :)</li>
            <li> Since I have been having morning sickness and has been very sensitive to the smell, I prefer something which have pleasant smell or unscented.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good comments, but have just started to use it, so I cannot really tell if it will work or not, but so far it feels good.</li>
            <li> Nice &amp; thick, good staying power &amp; smells good too.</li>
            <li> I think the moisturizing quality was fine and it lasted a while</li>
            <li> and it seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> I just ran out of this lotion, so I need to stop by the store and pick up another one, quick!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, super moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> My advice is to use this on every inch of your body while you&#x27;re pregnant since it seemed to work well on the areas it was applied!</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic lotion to use while pregnant!</li>
            <li> but in this time with amazon it just gave me huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;since</li>
            <li> I ordered online through amazon and was free shipping and got delivered in 7 days.</li>
            <li> I have light stretch marks on my stomach...</li>
            <li> Has kept me virtually stretch mark free through two pregnancies.</li>
            <li> It keeps the skin comfortable and the smell is lovely.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fragrance is light and smells like cocoa butter and has this organic smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Not greasy, smooth and silky.</li>
            <li> Thank goodness its cheap, I will probably get the cream too for overnight usage.  </li>
            <li> It even smells fabulous, and I&#x27;m not one for fragrant lotions</li>
            <li> so thick.this one goes on so smooth</li>
            <li> Great for use post partum too when your tummy is trying to get back in shape.</li>
            <li> But the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of it and how smooth it goes on.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think anything can except fate, so anything is worth a try :)</li>
            <li> Thank goodness they were so cheap</li>
            <li> In the end, I guess it&#x27;s important to remember that nothing will ever get rid of stretch marks 100%, but</li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t expect this kind of experiences...</li>
            <li> but I am sooo happy they are finally gone.</li>
            <li> It blends into the skin and leaves it feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> After speaking with Palmer&#x27;s, I discovered that this product has been discontinued, and instead Palmer&#x27;s is shipping out the \\&quot;light scent\\&quot; version of this product.</li>
            <li> As a result, it feels like a cheap product when you put it on, like it has no substance to</li>
            <li> Happy overall with item.</li>
            <li> Stretch marks are genetic, so I can&#x27;t say whether this has actually prevented them or not, but it is a great moisturizer for a stretching belly.</li>
            <li> but I am still free of them.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s soft and smells good.</li>
            <li> and I have yet to see stretch marks, so far so good.</li>
            <li> originally bought it, because I heard it can help get rid of stretch marks.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks were purple and have faded significantly.</li>
            <li> but please try not to stress about it, know that sometimes there really isn&#x27;t anything you can do, and enjoy the ride that is pregnancy anyway. :)</li>
            <li> What I especially find exciting about this emulsion its is great smell and the way it glides onto the fingers when applied.</li>
            <li> I found the smell to be rather pleasant actually.  </li>
            <li> Then applying it to the skin works a treat on whatever needs that special touch, even those unsightly stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Since I am pregnant, I use it on my stomach, I hope not long stretch marks.it smell good.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone who wants their skin to be silky and smooth!</li>
            <li> The smell is sweet like chocolate.</li>
            <li> My skin is nice and soft ..</li>
            <li> Some say that having \\&quot;good genes\\&quot; is the only way to avoid stretch marks during pregnancy</li>
            <li> but they are ALL fading which is good enough for me.</li>
            <li> Excellent, thick lotion cream with a yummy chocolatey scent that I use for my prego belly.</li>
            <li> but the smell is too sweet.</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are still easily visible but by no means the bright pink monsters they used to be.</li>
            <li> Great product to keep belly moisturized to avoid stretch marks (along with other palmers products).</li>
            <li> While I was pregnant, I did not use anything to prevent stretch marks, thinking I wouldn&#x27;t get any.</li>
            <li> My mother bought this for me as a gift when i was pregnant</li>
            <li> i didnt get stretch marks till i was around 30 weeks pregnant.</li>
            <li> I use this lotion and the cocoa butter as well on my pregnant belly.</li>
            <li> I began using Palmers at 15 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li> It is not oily and absorbs quickly as well.</li>
            <li> If you are concerned about using products with Parabens while pregnant do not order this product.  </li>
            <li> When I got pregnant I gained 70 pounds (I know...)  </li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m pregnant again and am not taking any chances</li>
            <li> I was pregnant at 5 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I started using while I was about 37 weeks pregnant.  </li>
            <li> It also helped soothe my super itchy pregnancy skin.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not 33 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li> I hope this review helps atleast one pregnant woman out there...</li>
            <li> I was pregnant.  </li>
            <li> I used to 2 times a day while pregnant and still got tons of stretch marks on my belly and hips.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m 6 months pregnant.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion since I was 7 week pregnant.</li>
            <li> , it absorbs really quick</li>
            <li> I got pregnant</li>
            <li> Bought for granddaughter who is pregnant.</li>
            <li> I recommend this to every pregnant mother-to-be.</li>
            <li> So, once I became pregnant myself, I decided to give this a shot.</li>
            <li> I am 7 months pregnant and have no stretch marks at all on my growing belly.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect any quick miracle results though.</li>
            <li> This product is designed for pregnant women.</li>
            <li> Light, not greasy, and really did prevent strecthmarks!</li>
            <li> great product, keeps my skin moisturized during the day and minimizes stretch marks and has cleared up some dark spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> I work out regularly and have a pretty good diet plan.  </li>
            <li> When I first opened the package I tried to pump the nozzle and nothing came out!</li>
            <li> and I have already gained 29 pounds throughout my own (currently I&#x27;m 30 weeks pregnant</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s worth paying $8.45.</li>
            <li> I bout it for some fresh ones on my bum, never had stretch marks before.</li>
            <li> I had tried naturally derived lotions with healthy amounts of vitamins to even rubbing Salmon oil on my skin.</li>
            <li> For the sheer fact that I saw a marked improvement in moments of usage, I am elated, relieved, happy</li>
            <li> Honestly this product does not work, i used it for several months and there was no difference.</li>
            <li> Not afraid to show my body.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth the shot.</li>
            <li> not crazy about the smell.</li>
            <li> I hope it is useful for my wife.</li>
            <li> didnt remove stretch marks...not useful but sticky</li>
            <li> I feel like a chocolate chip, or fresh cake batter.</li>
            <li> The only reason my rating is not higher is because unforgettably this lotion smells a million times better and is thicker if you get it without the added shea butter.</li>
            <li> I assumed since this product is mostly aimed at pregnant women this brand would be responsible enough to not have parabens or have an easy way to find out if there are any.  </li>
            <li> My product arrived very fast, and I am pleased with it so far.</li>
            <li> The only thing I liked about it was the smell and how it made my skin feel; it smells like chocolate and smells almost good enough to eat and keeps your skin very soft.  </li>
            <li> So instead of treat it right away when it started I decided to neglect it.    </li>
            <li> but right now I haven&#x27;t seen any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Right after I apply Palmers, I also add a couple drops of vitamin E oil and rub that in.</li>
            <li> Then I use Palmer&#x27;s every morning and right before bed.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully I have the right product</li>
            <li> &amp; I searched for a product that would reduce my stretch marks right away.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for her first two pregnancies, (the first being with twins), and she does not have one stretch mark on her!</li>
            <li> cocoa smell is very powerful, sweet and not probably suitable for women who are sensitive to different smells.</li>
            <li> Most importantly it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes like other lotions.</li>
            <li> But please if you are serious about changing your skin, nothing is a cure-all, eat healthy, and take vitamins, omega&#x27;s, and live happy.</li>
            <li> (3) Repeat exact process right before bed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good lotion, but I believe the one I received was several years old.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Helps a great deal with heavy miniaturization much needed in the mid-west winters.</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s nice and thick with a better scent.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t rate this lotion five stars just because even that the smells is nice, I&#x27;m kind of getting tired of it.</li>
            <li> , it goes on smoothly, and my skin has never been so soft!  </li>
            <li> Ive read many reviews in the past where women make the mistake of only applying cream on the stomach and then regret it because thier stomach looks great but everything else is covered with stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m twenty years old and pregnant with my first child; I&#x27;ve been using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter for stretch marks since I was about 18 weeks pregnant, where as I didn&#x27;t even begin to show until I was about 15 weeks.</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t love is the smell.</li>
            <li> i am not going to continue to use a product that&#x27;s done nothing after the first month.</li>
            <li> (2) Repeat exact procedure with two pumps of Palmers...</li>
            <li> It gives my skin a soft silky smooth appearance.</li>
            <li> I used it because like lip pumpers it is sort of tingly at first</li>
            <li> First off just wanted to let everyone know I am a guy.</li>
            <li> To find a product that actually works i believe it will cost you more than 9 dollars, i have yet to find one.</li>
            <li> Best thing about this product is that it actually made my skin firm!</li>
            <li> I definitely prefer it to Mederma. :)</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s probably because I wasn&#x27;t consistent with it</li>
            <li> It was recommended to me during my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does warn that you can have an allergic reaction and to test on your forearm first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been used this item since my first pregnancy.(been 2</li>
            <li> I ordered this a couple months ago and am currently ordering more but this time</li>
            <li> , I think the oil I use daily works better to keep my skin soft and smooth.  </li>
            <li> but I think it&#x27;s pretty content.</li>
            <li> I think I would recommend it, but I would definitely put it on more than once a day.</li>
            <li> I actually came back and ordered 2 more bottles because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a first time mommy to be and taking every precaution to prevent stretch marks,</li>
            <li> even though they say it&#x27;s totally genetics, I think your health routine has a lot more to do with it.</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy</li>
            <li> When you are putting it on a pregnant belly it is a large surface area and that smell is too much.</li>
            <li> so it feels pretty clean and dry easily.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t get many stretch marks, but I was also fortunate to gain less than 30 pounds.</li>
            <li> and I already had many in other parts of my body before getting pregnant.</li>
            <li> I have honestly tried better (in terms of moisturizing) lotions from Victoria&#x27;s Secret.</li>
            <li> However, I decided to do my best to avoid them or at least try to reduce them is possible.</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells, and although it&#x27;s not as thick as the Burt&#x27;s Bees Belly Butter, this product has more ingredients that seem to diminish stretch marks.</li>
            <li> It smells nice enough, and is a soft, non-greasy lotion</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and am pregnant with our first baby.  </li>
            <li> &quot; continues.&lt;br /&gt;The smell (especially if you&#x27;re fighting a lot of morning sickness) is pretty strong</li>
            <li> Considering to return it because I am not sure if the quality is still good.</li>
            <li> on my stomach, breasts, ribcage, hips, thighs, and butt (they say lotion absorbs into the skin the most right after taking a shower than at any other time throughout the day).</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion - nice and thick but not greasy, very soothing, and makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
            <li> These ladies are not heavy to begin with, but they are basically scarred for life and that made my wife super nervous.</li>
            <li> So far so good, my dark stretch marks have already lightened up.</li>
            <li> Smells a little strange, but good smooth product</li>
            <li> It is thick and creamy, with a nice mild scent.</li>
            <li> The reason I love this product is because with pregnancy my skin gets very dry as well as itchy.</li>
            <li> specific formula is creamier and a little oilier, which is great to help keep the tummy moisturized.</li>
            <li> I really dont like the smell</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> not really work for me, but love the smell</li>
            <li> I really wish I would have known this stuff would do absolutely nothing for me so that I could have invested in something that would have helped.</li>
            <li> still received some light marks on my lower abdomen, which have not disappeared in the 6 months following</li>
            <li> However, this lotion did moisture very well, but that is it.</li>
            <li> Only the organic line is paraben free.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how much I can prove this worked</li>
            <li> Thanks palmers</li>
            <li> I have some areas that I really really dont like to look at because of the size and the amount of marks I have.</li>
            <li> I cant wait for my girlfriend to smell me... haha</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle</li>
            <li> I know it is a part of having babies, but I really thought this would help</li>
            <li> 6 dollars for this product all ready seeing results in a month.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t really help my stretch mark</li>
            <li> And is very mositurizing.</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> My stretch marks are red as I am light skin color, just don&#x27;t give up after a week or two</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not out too much money.</li>
            <li> However, I am currently 30 weeks and still stretch mark free, so maybe this helped do the job.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really think anything can really prevent stretchmarks since they say their hereditary.  </li>
            <li> but i do really like the lotion</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s to much cocoa smell for me...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s really</li>
            <li> the oil is really oily and stains my nightshirts if I don&#x27;t let it soak in for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t think it really did much for my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> She really likes it.</li>
            <li> It has the cocoa butter she likes and the vitamin E I like, Arrived fast too.,</li>
            <li> The smell itself doesn&#x27;t really bother me too much</li>
            <li> This product is very flaky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just enough moisture, smells light, and is affordable.</li>
            <li> Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know any lotion really work in preventing stretch marks.  </li>
            <li> I do not know if it really helps with preventing stretch marks</li>
            <li> Much cheaper</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product.</li>
            <li> They faded some, I didn&#x27;t really expect much</li>
            <li> So I tried this stuff to see if my skin would react as much to it</li>
            <li> They really help to weaken the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> were really visible before, but not purple or anything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I like it so so much.</li>
            <li> , I put it on the back burner because I was more intrigued in using naturally derived lotions.</li>
            <li> Although does not make stretch marks disappear, they are much lighter and it works better than expected.</li>
            <li> To be honest, I have only used this product a handful of times, so, my star rating isn&#x27;t based upon whether or not it actually prevented any stretch marks but rather, it&#x27;s based on my thoughts around this</li>
            <li> But in the mean time it smells good</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll need to apply this lotion twice a day and make sure no clothing or any fabric touches the area as it will rub off, I personally just went shirtless or naked most days with fans on to make it dry out on my skin faster.</li>
            <li> so I was surprised to find such a strong one.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product, I have pretty deep stretch marks that have been there for a long time now</li>
            <li> so far Thanks!</li>
            <li> but the cocoa butter formula is classic.  </li>
            <li> yesterday 07/29/2014.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s totally different product that i bought this from duane reade it had great coconut smell with thick creamy texure.it&#x27;s walways like this..</li>
            <li> but it definitely keeps my skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i&#x27;ve used it 3 times a day every day on my entire body since i found out i was pregnant at 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant and bought couple different brands pregnancy creams.</li>
            <li> and I never got one single stretch mark on my stomach (and it was huge).  </li>
            <li> I bought this to try and help prevent stretch marks as I am trying to lose weight right now, but it obviously hasn&#x27;t worked very well.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I was 130lbs when I graduated high school</li>
            <li> I highly doubt I got lucky.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m using it as a base to mix it with other oils like Rose hips, grape seed oil, and vitamin E, the pump makes it much more easier for me to use it and the smell is nice too for me.</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin moisturized because it is very thick and smells good.</li>
            <li> lotion isn&#x27;t the best smelling lotion, but it isnt as bad as some reviewers are saying.</li>
            <li> Lotion is not thick</li>
            <li> I was amaze about the fast shipping bcos I saw it unexpectedly.........</li>
            <li> I started to work out not too long ago and as a result I got stretch marks near my back end of my biceps towards the armpit and had a fair share of stretch marks in my upper thighs.</li>
            <li> so I definitely think its worth it.  </li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and I absolutely love it.</li>
            <li> Packaged this way, so much more product goes to waste.</li>
            <li> My wife uses it everyday :)</li>
            <li> (by the way, stretch mark removal surgery is expensive, and does a pretty good job, but I have not seen one that looks normal).</li>
            <li> So far so good but have only used a few days.</li>
            <li> Good product, poor packaging.  </li>
            <li> Nice and thick</li>
            <li> (right after I finally had accepted them).</li>
            <li> The fine lines I had starting are GONE after 4 months of daily use!</li>
            <li> Have been using this since last 3 months and has given amazing results such as reduce in itching, stretch marks to some extent but not completely</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve put on quite a bit of weight all around my belly, butt, and thighs and haven&#x27;t seen any new stretch marks.</li>
            <li> For the price it&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t live without.</li>
            <li> and I had to live on Benadryl.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This cream also helped prevent any new ones from forming coz believe me, I thought they&#x27;d never stop.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a big problem with dry patches on my skin, and so far I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything to hydrate me.</li>
            <li> glycerine can be animal, vegetable or synthetic, but I would double check from the company, some cruelty free products are known to still have animal thing&#x27;s actually in it.</li>
            <li> it was enough to finally feel comfortable LOOKING at the spots.</li>
            <li> but it can be very overpowering, especially when you are pregnant and your sense of smell is especially heightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very soft scent that fades within an hour.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I am in second trimester and have been using this since first trimester.</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend, and it&#x27;s inexpensive too;)</li>
            <li> but the pressing top is not okay..........</li>
            <li> and so far NO STRETCH MARKS!</li>
            <li> And makes your skin so soft!</li>
            <li> The product was delivered international 3 wks prior to the originally mentioned date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got</li>
            <li> I used Mederma in the past, and I have to say I like Palmer&#x27;s better.</li>
            <li> I personally mixed three different products in a glass jar and it makes my skin and tummy feel super moisturized and baby soft and alleviates itching!</li>
            <li> I am aware that vitamin E is already included in the Palmers massage lotion for stretch marks, but I have a feeling that this is going to promote even more elasticity of the skin so a little extra can only help, not hurt.  </li>
            <li> putting this on as you get bigger during pregnancy doesn&#x27;t hurt, especially because it&#x27;s reasonably priced (I probably went through 2 bottles during the 9 months the first time around).</li>
            <li> The only issue I have is the aroma is less than appealing to me.</li>
            <li> then it should do wonders for dry skin, right?</li>
            <li> I tried the Mederma Advanced stuff and it worked a little.</li>
            <li> Now they just look like white little scars but that&#x27;s much better than having jagged red/purple marks on my hips during the summertime.</li>
            <li> My daughter is 8 months old</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have any stretch mark so far.</li>
            <li> Like it so far</li>
            <li> Eyes completely swelled up for 3 days</li>
            <li> Since I started using it, if people touch my skin they always comment on how soft it is.  </li>
            <li> and so far this moisturizer has not made me break out.</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s because I am darker skinned, but it hasn&#x27;t really worked enough for me to suggest it to others.</li>
            <li> these did not work on my old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> but like it says on the bottle makes skin sensitive.</li>
            <li> Zero stretch marks so far</li>
            <li> I was a fan of palmer&#x27;s tummy butter which they produced in 2010, for some reason this product has completely different smell, which I do not like so much.</li>
            <li> I use it faithfully every night before bed and it keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> MAKES YOU SKIN FEEL SOFT</li>
            <li> It states to apply up to three times a day and with the hot weather and the fact that it is still quite greasy after application I do not like be soo sticky all day long.</li>
            <li> I developed no stretch mark</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion and have used it in the later stages of my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I think stretch marks have a ton of factors that come into play and thus far ( at 9 months)</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft.</li>
            <li> What girl wants the extra five pounds?!</li>
            <li> I use this nearly daily, I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference in the stretch marks on my stomach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old.</li>
            <li> I used it twice a day (once in the morning and once before bed) and it has drastically faded stretch marks i&#x27;ve suffered from for about 5 years that have made me very self-concious and it only took about... 3 weeks tops.</li>
            <li> Just like my genetics still made me get a few tiny ones, but I still love this</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but a bit thick going on, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have emollient staying power.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for stretch marks, but now I use it all over my body as an everyday lotion.  </li>
            <li> I used this lotion daily on my belly and sides starting when I first found out</li>
            <li> Then I actually bought this and have been using it for the past week or so and my stretch marks look so much better.</li>
            <li> but it took an extreme amount of time to absorb into my skin and it stained alot of my clothes, plus it didnt smell right</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for daily use, day and night.</li>
            <li> Just apply it at night, after your shower, and the next day the smell will be gone and you can carry on your day as normal.</li>
            <li> The pump of one bottle did not work well; after we contacted the customer service, a new bottle of lotion was shipped to us on the next day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m saying all of this because I got stretch marks from dry skin and growing too fast.</li>
            <li> So after using several products, not seeing really any results, I bought this at a local retail outlet.</li>
            <li> I rub it on everyday because I am 8 months pregnant</li>
            <li> Used this almost everyday while I was pregnant.</li>
            <li> the price is higher than other web</li>
            <li> as an overnight cream (right on the back label it says \\&quot;widely used to treat stretch marks, before and after pregnancy\\&quot;).</li>
            <li> it smells very heavy and makes me nauseous, it might just be because i&#x27;m pregnant and overly sensitive to smells but just a warning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;from general market</li>
            <li> The lotion is very moisturizing and seems to last on my skin for a long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried literally EVERYTHING as far as moisturizer goes, and this one is, unfortunately, no different.  </li>
            <li> It worked for several months until I developed an allergic reaction to this cream.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m only 17 years old and have alwayed been scared to wear two peace bathing suit.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only had it for a month so far</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re barely even noticeable.</li>
            <li> I could barely see a difference.</li>
            <li> our doctor told us to continue using it until her tummy gets back to its old size.</li>
            <li> I use Mama Mio Tummy Rub Oil every day after getting out of the shower, and I let my tummy go bare for about an hour to soak in all the oil.  </li>
            <li> This lotion has helped them fade and turn back into my natural skin color, some of the stretch marks are taking longer to fade</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using just the regular Palmers Cocoa Butter for about 2 weeks or so and it lightened my marks up considerably.</li>
            <li> You can barely tell I have stretch marks anymore.</li>
            <li> I got two bottles in spanish that are Cocoa butter marked for post-partum firming.</li>
            <li> I try not to put clothes back on (or atleast lift my shirt high up and wear my pants as low as possible if I do need to keep my clothes on) until it is completely absorbed into my skin, which does take a little longer because it is a thicker formula</li>
            <li> and im pregnant and using, not sure if its helping or not.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used other products, so I cannot compare, but I don&#x27;t like the texture and smell that much.</li>
            <li> This lotion soothes my skin and keeps the relief longer than other products and the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> I was sooooo itchy, and putting this cream on a few extra times a day helped calm the itching...</li>
            <li> but on my right side only a little have disappeared</li>
            <li> It is much thicker than an average moisturizer</li>
            <li> I guess its true what they say--there really isn&#x27;t anything to PREVENT stretch marks unless there is something that is ridiculously expensive.</li>
            <li> It is not thick at all, like other tummy butters I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes this lotion, very moisturizing, her skin has been very dry lately, so</li>
            <li> It also helps if your skin feels dry and stretched out near the end too.</li>
            <li> A little really does go a long way.</li>
            <li> , I lucked out, it seemed to work well for me upfront, but I can possibly attribute my results with other things, but this lotion is a MAJOR contributor.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this seems to have worked for me, though the caveat is that I have used two products together, so it is hard to pinpoint exactly why or how it worked.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight blurring on the areas I&#x27;ve developed some marks, but need to constantly keep it reapplied.</li>
            <li> For less than $10, I can&#x27;t really say I expected this to be a miracle cream</li>
            <li> After 2 weeks, I didn&#x27;t expect a tremendous reduction of my stretch marks, but I expected at least somewhat of a difference.</li>
            <li> , you can really feel it working, usually if I can&#x27;t feel a product working</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it really reduces stretch marks</li>
            <li> Boy do I miss my flat tummy.</li>
            <li> (they weren&#x27;t ever red, the skin is just stretched).</li>
            <li> For those who reviewed it 1 star just because you got stretch marks, I&#x27;m really sorry, but many studies have shown that lotions and creams make absolutely no difference whatsoever during pregnancy...</li>
            <li> Personally, I preferred the Palmer&#x27;s massage cream (in the tube) as I feel like this lotion is pricey compared to other similar lotions.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and stretch marks from my teen age.</li>
            <li> I am quite given up fighting with the stretch marks but can&#x27;t live with my skin going dry in a few hours after I apply some moisturizing cream after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> The bottles are used and filled with fake lotion and tapped to look sealed</li>
            <li> I believe it has effect on the scar, if use for a long time.</li>
            <li> Lasts a long time and helped reduce my stretch marks quite a bit.</li>
            <li> but I would still hope that a product of this price would be somewhat moisturizing, which it is clearly not.</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing without leaving a thick residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> My dry skin stretched out as I was growing taller.</li>
            <li> So I only apply every other day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Palmer&#x27;s other products too (oil, regular lotion)</li>
            <li> used this product throughout my pregnancy and did have a big tummy with visible stretch marks close to due date.</li>
            <li> The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because when you get down to about an inch and half of lotion left in the bottle, it won&#x27;t pump out any more, and for the past week, I&#x27;ve been unscrewing the cap, turning it upside down and shaking and banging as hard as I can to get the rest of the lotion out...</li>
            <li> Bought this lotion after reading reviews and although many people rate this a bad product they tend to think the lotion should work instantly or remove stretch marks permanently, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> This product does wonders for dry patchy skin though.         </li>
            <li> During my 1st pregnancy 3 yrs ago, I used this product every single day, twice a day.</li>
            <li> Not one single stretch</li>
            <li> I am dark skinned, and I didn&#x27;t notice any strech marks as I got bigger (gained about 30 lbs).</li>
            <li> Long story short, I put this on my belly religiously everyday as soon as I started to show (around 10-12 weeks).  </li>
            <li> So I am less likely to scratch my belly when I apply this lotion.</li>
            <li> I notice the color is getting lighter and they are slightly getting smaller.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I don&#x27;t like the smell, even though it is mild.</li>
            <li> was a size 00 prepregnancy and have stretched all the way now two weeks from my due date and have NO stretch marks</li>
            <li> I had a little left over in a bottle I had previously bought at target and the smell, color and texture were different.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that my stretch marks are at least 10 years old.</li>
            <li> about people&#x27;s stretch marks looking like \\&quot;pink marker\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and I have absolutely no stretch marks</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for a few weeks in the middle of my pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> A few hours later my skin felt moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying the one that comes in a tube next time, maybe that will solve my wasted lotion problem.</li>
            <li> image that is on this listing, with the green bar above the image on the lotion bottle, is for the unscented, \\&quot;with shea butter\\&quot; version of this lotion.  </li>
            <li> for a sec think it will reverse any you already have.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money.</li>
            <li> all that energy spent with this product and it didn&#x27;t do anything other than make me feel greasy and nauseous every time i used it.</li>
            <li> I was almost in shock, here after maybe a few seconds my skin looked different, even if it was a slight difference</li>
            <li> You cannot judge smell on other people&#x27;s opinion, go to the drug store and sniff it for yourself.  </li>
            <li> Other&#x27;s say they cannot smell it</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I use other PCBF products; and I must says that this item and the moisturizing oil work well together to produce softer and smoother skin.</li>
            <li> This product is a must if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money in other fancy oils and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It was cheaper than other brands that I heard about</li>
            <li> the oil and the other products I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> this product due to the bottle having a pump and choosing against the tummy butter as the application process would be cleaner; however, the pump did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t extremely noticeable anyway though</li>
            <li> While it may not completely eliminate all stretch marks, it did make my marks less noticeable and it also firmed my skin!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some of the ones I have have actually gotten WORSE (due to the weight loss, not the product) and have noticed some newer, smaller ones that I don&#x27;t recognize.  </li>
            <li> I know it&#x27;s nearly impossible to completely prevent stretch marks, but this lotion seems to be doing the trick so far (knock on wood)!</li>
            <li> Sorry to report as this came very recommended.</li>
            <li> I think my only complaint would be that the pump mechanism with the bottle doesn&#x27;t work</li>
            <li> The lotion was thick enough</li>
            <li> I mean, it&#x27;s inexpensive enough, so</li>
            <li> i used this lotion for the last few months of my pregnancy and about 6 months afterward, applying a thick coat on my stomache after each shower.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Made stretch marks less visible.  </li>
            <li> Skin sensitivity is heightened during pregnancy when in use, it does have a slight tingle to it but that just makes me feel as if it is working...</li>
            <li> They are not gone or even slightly gone.</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell to it</li>
            <li> One and a half month before D-day I don&#x27;t have any stretch-marks.</li>
            <li> I had gotten stretch marks previously during puberty</li>
            <li> Recommend for people on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> It helps with the tight feeling skin and itching.</li>
            <li> All of my pregnant friends and family recommended this to me to prevent stretch marks from getting too bad.</li>
            <li> They seem to be fading a little now 7 months postpartum, although I don&#x27;t know if that can be attributed to time or the Palmer&#x27;s lotion.</li>
            <li> It is little sticky after applying.</li>
            <li> Has been in use, there is no significant effect</li>
            <li> that it feels a little bit heavy when you apply it</li>
            <li> it was uncomfortable to have on the skin, I was hot and felt oily, which was no good.  </li>
            <li> I applied it everyday and night.</li>
            <li> Definitely a waste of time putting it on 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
            <li> Do yourself a favor and put this on everyday.  </li>
            <li> I am a firm believer that stretch marks are genetic - you&#x27;re either going to get them or not.</li>
            <li> stomach is covered with stretch marks past my belly button (dark purple ones).  </li>
            <li> Waste of money.</li>
            <li> all day... everyday...</li>
            <li> I used this every night during my pregnancy and the oil during the day (oil is to messy for bed).</li>
            <li> My wife has a few friends who had babies before her and have these snake-like marks all over their bellies, arms, and legs.</li>
            <li> I started using this when I was about five months pregnant, or so, hoping to keep me from getting stretch marks or to at least keep them from being too bad.</li>
            <li> I ended up with pretty bad stretch marks all the way across my stomach.</li>
            <li> : this lotion is the only thing that kept me from scratching my belly like a crazy person all day long!!  </li>
            <li> and it would slow down the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The product I bought came in a tube (I like the convenience of a pump bottle) and my husband complains that its a little sticky but it absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t smell that bad either.</li>
            <li> I got them either way but only above my bikini line which isn&#x27;t so bad.</li>
            <li> I got this hoping that I would be able to reduce the appearance of my stretchmarks, but I ended up being very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> (4) Never, ever skip the treatment, no matter how big of rush you&#x27;re in in the morning or how tired you are at the end of the day!</li>
            <li> It was really small bottle</li>
            <li> The smell really isn&#x27;t disturbing as I&#x27;ve read in other reviews, it&#x27;s a lot better than other stretch mark creams (their tummy butter smells horrible and is not creamy at all.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i won&#x27;t buy it anymore, i have been used it since 3 month, useless totally, so will not buy it.</li>
            <li> and ive been using this product alot for the past almost 2 months</li>
            <li> Not sure if I can say it was the lotion,</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is thick, so I have to wait a few minutes after I put it on to get dressed</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it&#x27;s helping with the stretch marks</li>
            <li> I put this lotion on every day but not sure if I need to be lathering it on 3 times a day or what.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t even work, its actually making my stretch marks worse!</li>
            <li> Some complained about this product being to thin, but I don&#x27;t like heavy lotions and Mederma is heavy...</li>
            <li> They were hardly noticeable.</li>
            <li> I will not be buying this again, at least not for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> people reviewed this and complained about the smell</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because I never liked the smell or consistency</li>
            <li> so it means..at least 4 years...</li>
            <li> This product is not moisturizing in the least bit (see #3.)</li>
            <li> At least their lotions never flaked on me and they kept my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> I used ever day, gained weight slowly, and drank lots of water.</li>
            <li> , I put a thick coat on my areas before bed.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work I mean to have an affective use you have to buy between 3-5 bottles of this bs</li>
            <li> /&gt;So if yours are from dry skin and growth, and not from weight gain, this thing is A MIRACLE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> the pump on the container is temperamental and the size is very small.</li>
            <li> The product came in dirty and looks like it has been sitting in the warehouse for a long time before shipping.</li>
            <li> Seriously, salmon oil (Yes I smelled like a fish).</li>
            <li> morning sickness is bad enough.</li>
            <li> It smells and feels heavenly, but not good for women with skin sensitivity, I immediately got rashes.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I received a wrong one which is \\&quot;reduce\\&quot; one; and even worse, it is in Spanish!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The lotion goes on very thin, in fact, a little too thin for my liking.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going to be tough work for some</li>
            <li> It was clumped and very, very thick when I received it.  </li>
            <li> also, this type isn&#x27;t very thick.</li>
            <li> It is very thick and moisturizing though.  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> I guess some people described it as irritating</li>
            <li> I have bought two bottles of the location, and I like these Cocoa Butter products including this massage location for stretch marks, but both of the packages (the pump sections) were broken, so I ended up squeeze the location even time when I used.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> Not sure how the product works because I just received it today, but the spout looks dirty like it has been refilled and/or returned...  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not effective, it&#x27;s a waste of time applying this crap to your skin 3 times a day</li>
            <li> What is worse, a little stinky lotion for a couple of hours before you go to bed for a few months,or nasty stretch marks for the rest of your life?</li>
            <li> After gaining weight in college, I developed evil stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> Not incredibly itchy but</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> It also has a weird smell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to go out and buy another expensive lotion, so I thought I would give it a try.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work out for her unfortunately.</li>
            <li> After watching what I ate, rubbing bottles upon bottles on my hips and exercising, I no longer have the evil red stretchmarks.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately scars are unreversable no matter how hopeful you are.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
            <li> Fake product .</li>
            <li> i am now 25 weeks and have awful stretchmarks on my left breast.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had horrible vicious long red marks on my hips and belly.</li>
            <li> It has a thick base to it</li>
            <li> I had a bad allergic reaction within about 4 hours of using it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell,  it makes me sick</li>
            <li> :(I was hoping this would be the end to my search.</li>
            <li> There is basically no change in my stretch marks at all, so I was disappointed.</li>
            <li> My process has been as follows: (1)</li>
            <li> but I was allergic. :(  </li>
            <li> I am 120 and Mederma &amp;#34;tightens the skin&amp;#34; per say and makes me look 125-130 :(</li>
            <li> I HATE the smell of this lotion.  </li>
            <li> very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.  </li>
            <li> I got terrible stretch marks on my breasts, stomach, and thighs.</li>
            <li> Now i&#x27;m stuck trying to find something that will get rid of these horrible stretch marks I now have.</li>
            <li> And have had horrible stretch marks all my life, since I was in my teens so</li>
            <li> Nasty smell to it.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;The odor of this was so awful that I will never use it.  </li>
            <li> It smells horrible also and caused irritation where i applied it.</li>
            <li> did i say it smells horrible?</li>
            <li> This was an awful buy.</li>

            <li> Everyone should try this product which is a nice product with great use and cost efficient. Have been using this since last 3 months and has given amazing results such as reduce in itching, stretch marks to some extent but not completely and it&#x27;s worth paying $8.45. I ordered online through amazon and was free shipping and got delivered in 7 days. I would recommend everyone use this during your pregnancy.</li>
            <li> I dont know if it is good. I really dont like the smell and im pregnant and using, not sure if its helping or not.</li>
            <li> This is the best stretchmark lotion ever! i used aprox 5 bottles of it during my pregnancy and after, and i don´t have any stretchmarks! of course it can also be genetics, but i also loved the smell of cocoa butter!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this lotion - nice and thick but not greasy, very soothing, and makes my skin feel so soft.  ;)</li>
            <li> This definitely helped with keeping the stretch marks at bay during my pregnancy. I would see them start to appear and use the cocoa butter and it would slow down the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a big problem with dry patches on my skin, and so far I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything to hydrate me. I wanted to try this item just because if it&#x27;s supposed to relieve stretch marks then it should do wonders for dry skin, right? Awesome. It works great. The only thing that I don&#x27;t love is the smell. It doesn&#x27;t really stink, but it&#x27;s not the most pleasant thing either. This product does wonders for dry patchy skin though.         I&#x27;d recommend to anyone :)</li>
            <li> I have light stretch marks on my stomach...I work out regularly and have a pretty good diet plan.  I have tried a lot of different products even through pregnancy nothing has worked.  The Palmers tummy butter and cocoa butter lotion feel good going on but I don&#x27;t notice any visible changes in my stomach. Its been a couple weeks. :(I was hoping this would be the end to my search.</li>
            <li> Security and peace of mind</li>
            <li> Te lotion seems a bit stick, never fully absorbs into the skin. I suppose that is the property of cocoa butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought it, because I heard it can help get rid of stretch marks. I bout it for some fresh ones on my bum, never had stretch marks before. I applied it everyday and night. I didn&#x27;t see much difference.</li>
            <li> While I was pregnant, I did not use anything to prevent stretch marks, thinking I wouldn&#x27;t get any. WRONG. I got terrible stretch marks on my breasts, stomach, and thighs. I thought I would give the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Massage Lotion a try, cause I&#x27;d heard that it works before. After 2 weeks, I didn&#x27;t expect a tremendous reduction of my stretch marks, but I expected at least somewhat of a difference. After a month, I&#x27;ve decided to give up. There is basically no change in my stretch marks at all, so I was disappointed. I didn&#x27;t mind the smell, I think it smelled good. Definitely a waste of time putting it on 3 times a day. Would not recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard good comments, but have just started to use it, so I cannot really tell if it will work or not, but so far it feels good.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin and stretch marks from my teen age. I am quite given up fighting with the stretch marks but can&#x27;t live with my skin going dry in a few hours after I apply some moisturizing cream after the shower.&lt;br /&gt;This Cocoa Butter Lotion gives amazing moisture without greasy leftover. The aroma is also chocolaty nice :)&lt;br /&gt;Recommend to anyone who wants their skin to be silky and smooth! And the price is great too!</li>
            <li> not really work for me, but love the smell</li>
            <li> It was clumped and very, very thick when I received it.  It&#x27;s a good lotion, but I believe the one I received was several years old.</li>
            <li> My mother bought this for me as a gift when i was pregnant it DIDNT WORK! i didnt get stretch marks till i was around 30 weeks pregnant. i used this lotion twice a day sometimes 3 time a day and no results. DO NOT BUY!!! WASTE OF MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> I started using this when I was about five months pregnant, or so, hoping to keep me from getting stretch marks or to at least keep them from being too bad. But this stuff didn&#x27;t work for me at all! I ended up with pretty bad stretch marks all the way across my stomach. I really wish I would have known this stuff would do absolutely nothing for me so that I could have invested in something that would have helped. Now i&#x27;m stuck trying to find something that will get rid of these horrible stretch marks I now have. It may work for some, but it definitely did not work for me!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it is easy to apply, not too greasy. I use this lotion and the cocoa butter as well on my pregnant belly.</li>
            <li> I have been using the lotion for a month and am just about finished with the bottle. I know nothing happens overnight ,but I was hoping to atleast see some type of progress by now.</li>
            <li> Since I am pregnant, I use it on my stomach, I hope not long stretch marks.it smell good.I like it.</li>
            <li> i have been using this stuff for over 2 months and no results whatsoever! i was on my second bottle and ended up throwing it in the trash where it belongs. i am not going to continue to use a product that&#x27;s done nothing after the first month. it&#x27;s not effective, it&#x27;s a waste of time applying this crap to your skin 3 times a day and it&#x27;s a waste of money. very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I bought all different types of stretch mark products for my pregnancy. This was the cheapest and the best. It is thick and creamy, with a nice mild scent. The only place I didn&#x27;t use it was on my upper thighs and I got stretch marks there... but no where, where I applied this magical cream. Great buy.</li>
            <li> Has kept me virtually stretch mark free through two pregnancies.</li>
            <li> Product smells and moisturizes nice but has no effect.</li>
            <li> I began using Palmers at 15 weeks pregnant.  Then at 20 weeks, upon reading too many blogs, etc. about people&#x27;s stretch marks looking like \\&quot;pink marker\\&quot; drawn all over their bellies, and coupled with the fact that my sister says she has \\&quot;tons,\\&quot; I scared myself into getting the Bio Oil and using it in conjunction with the Palmers, and as of today at 39 weeks, I still have no stretch marks!  My baby boy is being delivered Friday via c-section (breech), so I think it is safe to say I have escaped them. My process has been as follows: (1) Every morning following a shower, massage the Bio Oil liberally on belly, concentrating on the sides of waist and low on the underside where the baby \\&quot;drops;\\&quot; all over breast area; rub excess oil from hands onto hips. (2) Repeat exact procedure with two pumps of Palmers...my theory has been that the lotion helps the oil absorb into the skin and seals it off nicely. (3) Repeat exact process right before bed. (4) Never, ever skip the treatment, no matter how big of rush you&#x27;re in in the morning or how tired you are at the end of the day! Anyway, this seems to have worked for me, though the caveat is that I have used two products together, so it is hard to pinpoint exactly why or how it worked. Good Luck! [[ASIN:B000VPPUEA Bio-Oil, 2-Ounce Bottle]]</li>
            <li> I use this cream with my three pregnant and never appear stretch marks in my skin , my skin is very clean, this product is excellet!! I RECOMMENDED IT</li>
            <li> i used this lotion for the last few months of my pregnancy and about 6 months afterward, applying a thick coat on my stomache after each shower.&lt;br /&gt;I still received some light marks on my lower abdomen, which have not disappeared in the 6 months following pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;Not quite sure whether the lotion helped or not, but I will continue to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Wish it smelled better, though.</li>
            <li> Great lotion, but it does not absorb into the skin right away and it leaves a coating that lasts for a day or two. So I only apply every other day.</li>
            <li> I got this hoping that I would be able to reduce the appearance of my stretchmarks, but I ended up being very disappointed with the product. I bought one bottle and used it twice a day for around three months and nothing happened. I then decided to buy another bottle thinking that maybe I just needed to give it more time, but again nothing happened. My stretchmarks are still the same way they were when I started using the product. I would not recommend this product to anyone because it does not do what it says it does. However, this lotion did moisture very well, but that is it. It also has a weird smell. I now bought bio-oil and I am hoping that it works!</li>
            <li> The title says it all.  I&#x27;m not going to sit here and tell you that it definitely will not work for your skin, because it has obviously worked for others.  I bought this to try and help prevent stretch marks as I am trying to lose weight right now, but it obviously hasn&#x27;t worked very well.  I&#x27;ve noticed some of the ones I have have actually gotten WORSE (due to the weight loss, not the product) and have noticed some newer, smaller ones that I don&#x27;t recognize.  I have tried literally EVERYTHING as far as moisturizer goes, and this one is, unfortunately, no different.  I don&#x27;t know how it works for pregnancy, and shouldn&#x27;t know at nineteen years old anyway!  :P  The only thing I liked about it was the smell and how it made my skin feel; it smells like chocolate and smells almost good enough to eat and keeps your skin very soft.  But that was it.  I am very disappointed in this product.  I will not be buying this again, at least not for stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I used this with my first child, and I&#x27;m not sure if it kept me from getting stretch marks, but I used it often and did not have any. I am 8 months along now and still doing well. It also helps if your skin feels dry and stretched out near the end too. It is not oily and absorbs quickly as well.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion thinking it was intended for existing stretch marks, but it is actually for prevention of stretch marks. I didn&#x27;t want to go out and buy another expensive lotion, so I thought I would give it a try. It seems to work fairly well, although I haven&#x27;t been using it as often as I should be. I have extensive stretch marks on my lower abdomen that came on during the last 4 weeks of my pregnancy. They seem to be fading a little now 7 months postpartum, although I don&#x27;t know if that can be attributed to time or the Palmer&#x27;s lotion.</li>
            <li> Great all over the body lotion for stretch marks and moisturizing.  It gives my skin a soft silky smooth appearance. Wonderful scent and the consistency of the lotion is just right.  This lotion won&#x27;t leave your skin greasy at all.  Helps to reduce stretch marks from pregnancy and weight gain.  Palmer&#x27;s always delivers with their products.</li>
            <li> If you are concerned about using products with Parabens while pregnant do not order this product.  Only the organic line is paraben free.  Would be great to be able to better see ingredients, etc.  I assumed since this product is mostly aimed at pregnant women this brand would be responsible enough to not have parabens or have an easy way to find out if there are any.  Not the case.  Buyer beware.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lotion through two pregnancies now. My stretch marks are still easily visible but by no means the bright pink monsters they used to be. I feel this lotion and TIME worked for me. But don&#x27;t expect anything overnight or in a month.</li>
            <li> My wife was trying to find a pregnancy-friendly lotion. She tried this product and loved it a lot. It keeps the skin comfortable and the smell is lovely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is also great. The pump of one bottle did not work well; after we contacted the customer service, a new bottle of lotion was shipped to us on the next day. We definitely recommend this product from this merchant.</li>
            <li> It worked for several months until I developed an allergic reaction to this cream.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of the lotion,it tastes good.Just hope it will be effective to my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> MI HIJA PROBO ESTA LOCION, PERO NO LE HIZO CASI EFECTO. ES MEJOR LA  CREMA DE PALMER : COCOA BUTTER FORMULA MASSAGE CREAM FOR STRECH MARK, ES COMO MAS CONCENTRADA Y MUCHO MAS EFECTIVA.</li>
            <li> When I got pregnant I gained 70 pounds (I know...)  Long story short, I put this on my belly religiously everyday as soon as I started to show (around 10-12 weeks).  I used it the entire pregnancy and I never got one single stretch mark on my stomach (and it was huge).  I know it was the cream because I got stretch marks everywhere else that I didn&#x27;t use the cream (breasts, thighs, hips, buttocks, etc.).  Stupidly, I only thought of the belly as an area to worry about. (I guess if you don&#x27;t gain 70 pounds it&#x27;s no big deal!)   Anyway, my skin on my stomach is completely flawless but everywhere else is a nightmare!  Do yourself a favor and put this on everyday.  Also, learn from my mistake and put it on all the areas that will grow!      My daughter is 8 months old and I&#x27;m looking for a way to get rid of the marks on my thighs, etc.  I read that the Palmer&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t work that great for existing marks but I am going to try it and see what happens.  I know it is the only thing that saved my stomach!    Don&#x27;t listen to the reviews about how the lotion smells, that is totally subjective and it didn&#x27;t bother me it all.  I found the smell to be rather pleasant actually.  You cannot judge smell on other people&#x27;s opinion, go to the drug store and sniff it for yourself.  In any case, it works so the smell is of second importance.</li>
            <li> I used this for my twin pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks. I also used another product alternating them but both were good. I don&#x27;t know how much I can prove this worked but I&#x27;m pregnant again and am not taking any chances so i just ordered more!</li>
            <li> I am in second trimester and have been using this since first trimester. I don&#x27;t have any stretch mark so far. This product is probably working. I haven&#x27;t used other products, so I cannot compare, but I don&#x27;t like the texture and smell that much. It is little sticky after applying. The smell is sweet like chocolate. Since I have been having morning sickness and has been very sensitive to the smell, I prefer something which have pleasant smell or unscented.</li>
            <li> I will not go through a pregnancy without this brand.  Got this and the cream...both wonderful 35 weeks, no stretch marks. Jackpot.</li>
            <li> It felt tingly on your skin I guess some people described it as irritating but I didn&#x27;t put back on my shirt when I put it on the next time I used it because like lip pumpers it is sort of tingly at first but you get used to it, you can really feel it working, usually if I can&#x27;t feel a product working I don&#x27;t think It will work.&lt;br /&gt;Some people reviewed this and complained about the smell but it&#x27;s fragrance is light and smells like cocoa butter and has this organic smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it isn&#x27;t tested on animals, although it has GLYCERIN!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But glycerine can be animal, vegetable or synthetic, but I would double check from the company, some cruelty free products are known to still have animal thing&#x27;s actually in it.</li>
            <li> Smells good..  Like it so far</li>
            <li> Has a bit of a strong smell.  Didn&#x27;t notice any reduction in my stretch marks but was a good lotion.</li>
            <li> Wife couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of this and made her  nauseous during pregnancy. Didn&#x27;t work out for her unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 28 years old and am pregnant with our first baby.  And have had horrible stretch marks all my life, since I was in my teens so, I started using this lotion as soon as I found out I was pregnant at 5 weeks.  I am now 30 weeks pregnant and so far so good!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I&#x27;ve put on quite a bit of weight all around my belly, butt, and thighs and haven&#x27;t seen any new stretch marks. I will be buying the tummy butter to add to my routine just to make sure the \\&quot;good looking skin trend\\&quot; continues.&lt;br /&gt;The smell (especially if you&#x27;re fighting a lot of morning sickness) is pretty strong but it&#x27;s just a mix of chocolate and lotion so it&#x27;s not awful.  Now that my morning sickness is gone the smell isn&#x27;t offensive at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m looking forward to trying the Tummy Butter now too!</li>
            <li> Just love this product.  Best lotion for pregnant women to prevent stretch marks.  I applied this in the morning and the evening.  Lotion is not thick so it feels pretty clean and dry easily.  Recommend this lotion to any pregnant women!!!</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling smooth and not greasy. (The chocolate smell is just an added bonus.)</li>
            <li> This is a fantastic lotion to use while pregnant! Light, not greasy, and really did prevent strecthmarks!</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer that stretch marks are genetic - you&#x27;re either going to get them or not. However, I decided to do my best to avoid them or at least try to reduce them is possible. So I purchased this and the heavier cream version and started using them immediately in my pregnancy. I used ever day, gained weight slowly, and drank lots of water. Around week 26 one day some marks popped up out of nowhere on my lower abdomen, and they now (at 37 weeks) cover my belly from my belly button down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for me the lotion didn&#x27;t work. Is it possible they reduced additional marks? Maybe. But I&#x27;m giving it 2 stars because I never liked the smell or consistency, it didn&#x27;t feel moisturizing to me, and it did not help with the itching whatsoever (if anything it worsened it). Additionally, my doctor told me to stop using because it&#x27;s not hypoallergenic and could cause the marks to worsen if I had a reaction to it. So I switched to Earth Mama stretch mark oil for the itching (works great and dissolves quickly), and Sanctuary hypoallergenic stretch mark lotion (because I am hopeful, and still am doing whatever I can to avoid more marks!). Good luck to you Mom&#x27;s-to-be out there- but please try not to stress about it, know that sometimes there really isn&#x27;t anything you can do, and enjoy the ride that is pregnancy anyway. :)</li>
            <li> So far so good but have only used a few days. Not greasy, smooth and silky. But it is kinda smelly... Good thing its under my clothes! :)</li>
            <li> My product arrived very fast, and I am pleased with it so far. We will see if it helps prevent getting stretchmarks! :) Also, it relieves the itching I have on my stomach and legs and chest. I will probably order more.</li>
            <li> Great product to keep belly moisturized to avoid stretch marks (along with other palmers products). I used this all over and not one stretch mark. Thanks palmers</li>
            <li> First off just wanted to let everyone know I am a guy. I have been dealing with stretch marks for some time now, from the onset of puberty to body building to weight gain and weight loss. I have some areas that I really really dont like to look at because of the size and the amount of marks I have. So instead of treat it right away when it started I decided to neglect it.    Initially a family member had told me about this lotion, I put it on the back burner because I was more intrigued in using naturally derived lotions. I had tried naturally derived lotions with healthy amounts of vitamins to even rubbing Salmon oil on my skin. Seriously, salmon oil (Yes I smelled like a fish). Even though the salmon oil made my skin feel great it was uncomfortable to have on the skin, I was hot and felt oily, which was no good.  So after using several products, not seeing really any results, I bought this at a local retail outlet. Literally WHILE I was putting it on, my skin looked better. I was almost in shock, here after maybe a few seconds my skin looked different, even if it was a slight difference it was enough to finally feel comfortable LOOKING at the spots. For the sheer fact that I saw a marked improvement in moments of usage, I am elated, relieved, happy, I cant wait to use this over and over again. Thank goodness its cheap, I will probably get the cream too for overnight usage.  But please if you are serious about changing your skin, nothing is a cure-all, eat healthy, and take vitamins, omega&#x27;s, and live happy. It&#x27;s going to be tough work for some, I lucked out, it seemed to work well for me upfront, but I can possibly attribute my results with other things, but this lotion is a MAJOR contributor. Plus I smell like chocolate I cant wait for my girlfriend to smell me... haha</li>
            <li> I love Palmers.  I like the Shea Butter formula betetr but the cocoa butter formula is classic.  The smell is great and it works.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion!  It smells great, it goes on smoothly, and my skin has never been so soft!  Love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion with each pregnancy &amp; I believe it has helped with the stretch marks, as I don&#x27;t have any.  Nice &amp; thick, good staying power &amp; smells good too.</li>
            <li> Honestly this product does not work, i used it for several months and there was no difference. To find a product that actually works i believe it will cost you more than 9 dollars, i have yet to find one.</li>
            <li> It was really small bottle</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell. cocoa smell is very powerful, sweet and not probably suitable for women who are sensitive to different smells.</li>
            <li> I believe it has effect on the scar, if use for a long time.</li>
            <li> This did not help with my stretch marks at all. I used the whole bottle and I still had stretch marks. I know it is a part of having babies, but I really thought this would help and it did not</li>
            <li> One of the best in the market. use it along with a bio oil for great results. my wife swears by it.</li>
            <li> I just ran out of this lotion, so I need to stop by the store and pick up another one, quick! I love this product! While it may not completely eliminate all stretch marks, it did make my marks less noticeable and it also firmed my skin! Best thing about this product is that it actually made my skin firm! I use this up to 3 times a day along with my bio-oil, and now my tummy looks 10 times better than it did before. I definitely recommend, and it&#x27;s inexpensive too;)</li>
            <li> love this lotion! It even smells fabulous, and I&#x27;m not one for fragrant lotions but this is mild and very pleasant. I also didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks in my pregnancy. Good genes or lotion or both, I don&#x27;t know but certainly the lotiin can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s going OK haven&#x27;t seen any change</li>
            <li> 6 dollars for this product all ready seeing results in a month. The stretch marks are fading and one on my stomach has disappeared. I&#x27;m pleased with this product. Not afraid to show my body. Recommend for people on a tight budget.</li>
            <li> Palmers coco butter I love this coco butter not like the one that comes in the jar that one is so thick.this one goes on so smooth I use it .when getting out of the shower works great and its not thick or not watery I love it.thank you</li>
            <li> It works like a charm on stretch marks!!!!! It&#x27;s a great moisturizer for all of your body too. I definitely prefer it to Mederma. :)</li>
            <li> I was amaze about the fast shipping bcos I saw it unexpectedly.........I like the looks and the odour but the pressing top is not okay..........if it work then I will Order for two more..am sure it will work.&lt;br /&gt;  Thanks</li>
            <li> This is my first pregnancy and I&#x27;ve been using this cream almost every night since I started to show (at 7 weeks). I&#x27;m now 28 weeks and so far NO STRETCH MARKS! I use it on my tummy thighs and breasts. My breast have grown from 34B to 36C and my waist has gone from 25 inches to 40 inches around. Boy do I miss my flat tummy. The product I bought came in a tube (I like the convenience of a pump bottle) and my husband complains that its a little sticky but it absorbs very well and doesn&#x27;t smell that bad either. For the price it&#x27;s something you can&#x27;t live without. Maybe it&#x27;s just genetics but maybe it&#x27;s the cream. Highly recommend. ****</li>
            <li> Perfect for right after shower, easily absorbs and smells great. Although my husband is not a big fan of the smell ...&lt;br /&gt;Helps a great deal with heavy miniaturization much needed in the mid-west winters.</li>
            <li> This keeps my skin moisturized because it is very thick and smells good. It didn&#x27;t really help my stretch mark but that&#x27;s probably because I wasn&#x27;t consistent with it</li>
            <li> Used on my 1st pregnancy &amp; bought again for second with no stretch marks. Smells really yummy too &amp; moisturizes perfectly.</li>
            <li> Cannot stand the smell of this lotion. I think the moisturizing quality was fine and it lasted a while but I could not stand the smell. It was cloying and too strong.</li>
            <li> I started using while I was about 37 weeks pregnant.  Made stretch marks less visible.  Although does not make stretch marks disappear, they are much lighter and it works better than expected.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this lotion! It was recommended to me during my first pregnancy and I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks yay! It also helped soothe my super itchy pregnancy skin.  I am using it again for my 2nd pregnancy.</li>
            <li> But smells great! And is very mositurizing. It relieved my itchy tummy, and I haven&#x27;t seen a stretch mark yet. For the price, it&#x27;s worth the shot.</li>
            <li> I swear by this stuff. There is no miracle cream that will prevent stretch marks. But if you&#x27;re like me and you get stretch marks during pregnancy this is the best, creamiest, good smelling, thick lotion. My belly stays moisturized all day and doesn&#x27;t get itchy. Great for use post partum too when your tummy is trying to get back in shape.</li>
            <li> Very good the product&lt;br /&gt;Ex</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work with white stretch/zebra marks</li>
            <li> Works great - I made it thru my entire preganancy in which I gained about 40 pounds and did not get not 1 strecth Mark!!</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t work for me. I had a bad allergic reaction within about 4 hours of using it. Eyes completely swelled up for 3 days and I had to live on Benadryl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does warn that you can have an allergic reaction and to test on your forearm first. I ignored that and paid the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smelled good though--but I was allergic. :(  I threw it away after one use.</li>
            <li> goes on smooth, smells OK. I think it is helping. losing weight and trying to cope with these marks. thanks</li>
            <li> Smells great! And makes your skin so soft! I&#x27;m not sure if it really reduces stretch marks but it&#x27;s excellent lotion!</li>
            <li> Smells a little strange, but good smooth product</li>
            <li> The smell of this was nauseating</li>
            <li> I originally bought this for stretch marks, but now I use it all over my body as an everyday lotion.  Since I started using it, if people touch my skin they always comment on how soft it is.  Love this stuff.  I&#x27;ve tried Palmer&#x27;s other products too (oil, regular lotion) but this formula is my favorite, best moisturizer in my opinion.  Very soft scent that fades within an hour.  The oil has a strong oil scent and the regulation lotion also has a cocoa butter scent, both of which I don&#x27;t prefer.  This has almost no scent.</li>
            <li> great product, keeps my skin moisturized during the day and minimizes stretch marks and has cleared up some dark spots on my skin.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m only 17 years old and have alwayed been scared to wear two peace bathing suit. I use it every day and and you can see it work in just one use It gets lighter &amp; lighter &amp; lighter before you know they will be gone. Can&#x27;t wait to see them all gone.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight blurring on the areas I&#x27;ve developed some marks, but need to constantly keep it reapplied. No worries though, it smells absolutely fantastic!</li>
            <li> It does take more than one bottle to start noticing the difference, but it&#x27;s there. It definitely started working on my breasts faster than my back.&lt;br /&gt;Not greasy or oily, and it smells great :)</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and so far this moisturizer has not made me break out. It is very light and has a nice light smell. I love it</li>
            <li> not crazy about the smell. also, this type isn&#x27;t very thick. there is another palmer&#x27;s with bio c-elaste that&#x27;s nice and thick with a better scent.</li>
            <li> This product is great for your skin, stretch marks or not. The only issue I have is the aroma is less than appealing to me. Other&#x27;s say they cannot smell it, so I guess it&#x27;s just me. But the results are fantastic.</li>
            <li> I would buy this again. It&#x27;s soft and smells good. I have hope that this lotion will remove stretch marks but right now I haven&#x27;t seen any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> No change but I&#x27;ve only had it for a month so far</li>
            <li> Nasty smell to it. I didn&#x27;t use it. Would not buy again.... Probably will throw it away or give it away.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t get rid of any marks but it did great on my skin so it was okay</li>
            <li> My daughter really likes this lotion, very moisturizing, her skin has been very dry lately, so I decided to buy this for her.</li>
            <li> I still have the stretch marks. I don&#x27;t think it works, but I used it through out my pregnancy. 4 stars just because it&#x27;s a good lotion.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this lotion</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s taking a while, but I can see my stretch marks fading</li>
            <li> Works great but I cannot stand the smell. Might be a pregnancy thing.</li>
            <li> the price is higher than other web</li>
            <li> I love it for my nite cream...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m twenty years old and pregnant with my first child; I&#x27;ve been using Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter for stretch marks since I was about 18 weeks pregnant, where as I didn&#x27;t even begin to show until I was about 15 weeks. I&#x27;m not 33 weeks pregnant and I&#x27;ve been using this cream as often as possible - I can say that the stretch marks have lightened but have not gone away. Maybe it&#x27;s because I am darker skinned, but it hasn&#x27;t really worked enough for me to suggest it to others. The smell really isn&#x27;t disturbing as I&#x27;ve read in other reviews, it&#x27;s a lot better than other stretch mark creams (their tummy butter smells horrible and is not creamy at all.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -&lt;br /&gt;*Lightens Stretch Marks&lt;br /&gt;*Pleasant Smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons -&lt;br /&gt;*Doesn&#x27;t work as well on darker skinned people.</li>
            <li> I think this product is great! I like the smell of it and how smooth it goes on.</li>
            <li> Purchased it to use on my sons stretch marks it does not have a strong odor so he will allow  tme to put it on him. Have not noticed any change in there looks.</li>
            <li> Great product and shipping was good too.</li>
            <li> Can see them starting to fade but not a lot</li>
            <li> I started to work out not too long ago and as a result I got stretch marks near my back end of my biceps towards the armpit and had a fair share of stretch marks in my upper thighs. Bought this lotion after reading reviews and although many people rate this a bad product they tend to think the lotion should work instantly or remove stretch marks permanently, but it doesn&#x27;t. You&#x27;ll need to apply this lotion twice a day and make sure no clothing or any fabric touches the area as it will rub off, I personally just went shirtless or naked most days with fans on to make it dry out on my skin faster. I started to notice my stretch marks getting lighter and in tone with my skin color after 2 months and with a tan setting in they&#x27;re barely even noticeable. NOTHING will get rid of stretch marks permanently (maybe laser treatment), you can only get them lighter with skin care products such as this one. My stretch marks are red as I am light skin color, just don&#x27;t give up after a week or two just keep at it, twice a day.  Hope this review helps.</li>
            <li> This lotion is good lotion, but it didn&#x27;t prevent stretch marks!  I don&#x27;t think anything can except fate, so anything is worth a try :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what was in the bottle when i received it, but it wasn&#x27;t palmers. I had a little left over in a bottle I had previously bought at target and the smell, color and texture were different. Thank goodness they were so cheap i&#x27;m not out too much money.</li>
            <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;The odor of this was so awful that I will never use it.  I didn&#x27;t realize how potent the smell was.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t work I mean to have an affective use you have to buy between 3-5 bottles of this bs</li>
            <li> I used this stuff, and the tummy butter, religiously every morning &amp; every night from 3 weeks pregnant.&lt;br /&gt;My stomach is covered with stretch marks past my belly button (dark purple ones).  I&#x27;m thinking ok, it may not prevent stretch marks but maybe it will help fade them.&lt;br /&gt;I took a pic of my belly &amp; another one a year later.  I could barely see a difference.</li>
            <li> Most trustable  product!</li>
            <li> Love this production... My skin is nice and soft .. I will be ordering more for sure! Smells good to</li>
            <li> Some say that having \\&quot;good genes\\&quot; is the only way to avoid stretch marks during pregnancy but I&#x27;d rather invest in a couple inexpensive moisturing products just in case then do absolutely nothing and hope for the best (then atleast I know I tried). For the record, the women in my family are known to have stretch marks during pregnancy and I have already gained 29 pounds throughout my own (currently I&#x27;m 30 weeks pregnant and I have absolutely no stretch marks, I will update this review after I give birth for the most accurate review). This is the routine I&#x27;ve created for myself:  After taking a shower in the morning, I apply [[ASIN:B0010ED5FC Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Formula Massage Lotion For Stretch Marks with Vitamin E and Shea Butter Women Body Lotion, 8.5 Ounce]] on my stomach, breasts, ribcage, hips, thighs, and butt (they say lotion absorbs into the skin the most right after taking a shower than at any other time throughout the day). Ive read many reviews in the past where women make the mistake of only applying cream on the stomach and then regret it because thier stomach looks great but everything else is covered with stretch marks. The main reason WHY I prefer this lotion in the morning compared to anything else is because its non-greasy, light, doesnt have a strong smell (not the most pleasant smell but not unbearable either), and is inexpensive. Skin sensitivity is heightened during pregnancy when in use, it does have a slight tingle to it but that just makes me feel as if it is working... I tried Bio-Oil but it took an extreme amount of time to absorb into my skin and it stained alot of my clothes, plus it didnt smell right (something you dont want to deal with if you are on your way to work or anywhere else...)  Right after I apply Palmers, I also add a couple drops of vitamin E oil and rub that in. Not the capsules, not a cream or a stick, but regular vitamin E oil that you can find through Amazon, your grocery store, a local health food store, or even adrugstore. I am aware that vitamin E is already included in the Palmers massage lotion for stretch marks, but I have a feeling that this is going to promote even more elasticity of the skin so a little extra can only help, not hurt.  At night before I go to bed I use the even more affordable [[ASIN:B001JGIXNA Palmers Cocoa Butter Formula With Vitamin-E Smoothes Marks &amp; Scars 3.5 oz.]] as an overnight cream (right on the back label it says \\&quot;widely used to treat stretch marks, before and after pregnancy\\&quot;). A little really does go a long way. It has a thick base to it but once its rubbed in, it melts on to the skin like butter. This is the formula that actually smells like cocoa. Again I add a couple drops of vitamin E oil and use circular motions as I massage it into the skin. I try not to put clothes back on (or atleast lift my shirt high up and wear my pants as low as possible if I do need to keep my clothes on) until it is completely absorbed into my skin, which does take a little longer because it is a thicker formula but this system has been working for the last 7 months so I definitely think its worth it.  Other than that, I try to stay hydrated by drinking alot of water and hope for the best :) I hope this review helps atleast one pregnant woman out there... let me know!</li>
            <li> I used this lotion daily on my belly and sides starting when I first found out I was pregnant.  I am happy to say that I had my baby nearly 4 months ago and do not have any stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a bodybuilder, and i used this product to erase stretch marks of my Thais and biceps area. They are not gone or even slightly gone. it smells good though</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me. Keep in mind that my stretch marks are at least 10 years old. I&#x27;ve had them since puberty hit. these did not work on my old stretch marks.</li>
            <li> i won&#x27;t buy it anymore, i have been used it since 3 month, useless totally, so will not buy it.</li>
            <li> I used this lotion for a few weeks in the middle of my pregnancy.  Personally, I preferred the Palmer&#x27;s massage cream (in the tube) as I feel like this lotion is pricey compared to other similar lotions. However, I am currently 30 weeks and still stretch mark free, so maybe this helped do the job.</li>
            <li> This is an ok product, I have pretty deep stretch marks that have been there for a long time now and ive been using this product alot for the past almost 2 months and it made the majority of the stretch marks on my left side go away but on my right side only a little have disappeared</li>
            <li> I guess I cannot say whether this worked or not.  I didn&#x27;t get many stretch marks, but I was also fortunate to gain less than 30 pounds.</li>
            <li> All of my pregnant friends and family recommended this to me to prevent stretch marks from getting too bad. I have enjoyed it so far Thanks!</li>
            <li> I use it twice a day and have already noticed a difference within a week. My stretch marks were purple and have faded significantly. I Definitely will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, super moisturizing.  Don&#x27;t really think anything can really prevent stretchmarks since they say their hereditary.  It helps with the tight feeling skin and itching.</li>
            <li> Has been in use, there is no significant effect</li>
            <li> It smells and feels heavenly, but not good for women with skin sensitivity, I immediately got rashes. I will have to look for something hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> I am in love with this product! The stretch marks on my hips and thighs are starting to disappear after about 2 1/2 weeks. It is great to have even skin-tone (all-over). I use other PCBF products; and I must says that this item and the moisturizing oil work well together to produce softer and smoother skin. I&#x27;m feeling good about the way my skin looks and feels.</li>
            <li> During my 1st pregnancy 3 yrs ago, I used this product every single day, twice a day. I am dark skinned, and I didn&#x27;t notice any strech marks as I got bigger (gained about 30 lbs). It was after I had my son that I saw some just under my belly...but it wasn&#x27;t a big deal. They were hardly noticeable. Not sure if I can say it was the lotion, but I was happy with the results. Now that I&#x27;m expecting baby #2, I am using this product again. I love the way it smells, and although it&#x27;s not as thick as the Burt&#x27;s Bees Belly Butter, this product has more ingredients that seem to diminish stretch marks. In the end, I guess it&#x27;s important to remember that nothing will ever get rid of stretch marks 100%, but putting this on as you get bigger during pregnancy doesn&#x27;t hurt, especially because it&#x27;s reasonably priced (I probably went through 2 bottles during the 9 months the first time around).</li>
            <li> I use it on my face! I have NO wrinkles! I have no clue how it is on stretch marks, I was blessed not to have any. But my OB had FLAWLESS skin. When I asked her secrete, she said she uses THIS on her face and neck! The fine lines I had starting are GONE after 4 months of daily use! LOVE THIS!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  With both my pregnancies I have used this and have not gotten any stretch marks that have stayed.  That could be my genetics but just in case it is this lotion I will keep using it in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is thick, so I have to wait a few minutes after I put it on to get dressed but I love the way it feels for hours after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO BIG PLUS!  PARABEN FREE!!</li>
            <li> Be aware amazon buyers from here !!!&lt;br /&gt;I just got these as a set (2 packages) yesterday 07/29/2014.&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s totally different product that i bought this from duane reade it had great coconut smell with thick creamy texure.it&#x27;s walways like this..I&#x27;ve been used this item since my first pregnancy.(been 2 years)&lt;br /&gt; when I bought this item from amazon it had watery texture with funky smell...manufactured date was 2010. now it&#x27;s 2014. so it means..at least 4 years...can&#x27;t understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and it dose not have updated package design as well.&lt;br /&gt;buyers from here have to watch!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;from general market this product is great. I love it. but in this time with amazon it just gave me huge disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;since I&#x27;m a royal customer for amazon...I really didn&#x27;t expect this kind of experiences...</li>
            <li> If you are looking for something that will get rid of your stretch marks that have already surfaced, I do not recommend this product. I used this product continuously on my stretch marks and it did not help them at all, and my stretch marks weren&#x27;t even too severe. If you are trying to prevent stretch marks, then this will work or you. Otherwise, this product will not work on stretch marks that you already have.</li>
            <li> Great product but like it says on the bottle makes skin sensitive.</li>
            <li> This goes on very smooth and has a pleasant smell. It seems to leave the skin well lubricated without that greasy feeling. Good Stuff</li>
            <li> I HATE the smell of this lotion.  I used to 2 times a day while pregnant and still got tons of stretch marks on my belly and hips.  I can&#x27;t believe I had to suffer the smell for 9 months and didn&#x27;t get anything out of it.</li>
            <li> Great for stretch marks over time.</li>
            <li> well there is not much to say, it is a great product and was an excellent price, will buy again !</li>
            <li> the lotion works really good but the pump on the on i received was broke but i do really like the lotion</li>
            <li> Yes it works. After gaining weight in college, I developed evil stretchmarks. I was 130lbs when I graduated high school so I was definitely irked. After watching what I ate, rubbing bottles upon bottles on my hips and exercising, I no longer have the evil red stretchmarks. This cream also helped prevent any new ones from forming coz believe me, I thought they&#x27;d never stop. You need to work out in order for this work. It took me a year but I am sooo happy they are finally gone. Now they just look like white little scars but that&#x27;s much better than having jagged red/purple marks on my hips during the summertime.</li>
            <li> Great product! Zero stretch marks so far and i&#x27;m 6 months pregnant.</li>
            <li> I use this product everyday and I absolutely love it. The only reason my rating is not higher is because unforgettably this lotion smells a million times better and is thicker if you get it without the added shea butter. So I will not be buying this product again with shea butter in it.</li>
            <li> Great lotion for all around use. What I especially find exciting about this emulsion its is great smell and the way it glides onto the fingers when applied. Then applying it to the skin works a treat on whatever needs that special touch, even those unsightly stretch marks. Add this product to your shopping list, that&#x27;s my recommendation.</li>
            <li> I got this to try on my scars from knee surgery and it works very good.  thank you for a great product</li>
            <li> Greasy! used it once and tossed it away! It smells horrible also and caused irritation where i applied it. did i say it smells horrible?</li>
            <li> I was a fan of palmer&#x27;s tummy butter which they produced in 2010, for some reason this product has completely different smell, which I do not like so much. It just acceptable.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lotion since I was 7 week pregnant. I love it! Not only does it smell great and feel good on my growing belly, but it stops the itchiness. So I am less likely to scratch my belly when I apply this lotion. I highly recommend it for daily use, day and night. It makes a difference. Now I am 21 weeks along and I have yet to see stretch marks, so far so good.</li>
            <li> I used this during pregnancy and it did not help me!  Waste of money.</li>
            <li> Good product, poor packaging.  I used it regularly and still got a lot of stretch marks.  If you&#x27;re prone to getting them, it&#x27;s just going to happen.  It is very thick and moisturizing though.  I&#x27;m still using it for my second pregnancy.  Get the tube though.  Packaged this way, so much more product goes to waste.</li>
            <li> Great product recommended to all mom&#x27;s to be</li>
            <li> I ordered this a couple months ago and am currently ordering more but this time Im going with the palmers in the 13.5 oz tub.  I rub it on everyday because I am 8 months pregnant and it seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> OK. i believe this product will work. But I wanted to buy the \\&quot;prevent and reduce\\&quot; one as it showed before. Unfortunately I received a wrong one which is \\&quot;reduce\\&quot; one; and even worse, it is in Spanish!!!!!!!!! AND i couldn&#x27;t return!</li>
            <li> Great, no stretch mark so far, not too greesy</li>
            <li> This product is a must if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot of money in other fancy oils and creams.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even that it feels a little bit heavy when you apply it, it absorbs really quick so you don&#x27;t have that greasy feeling all day. Some times a have to put it twice (as recommended) or tree times a day, and makes my skin feel better.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t rate this lotion five stars just because even that the smells is nice, I&#x27;m kind of getting tired of it. It&#x27;s to much cocoa smell for me... all day... everyday...</li>
            <li> My wife used as soon as we got it. And now that she gave birth already we don&#x27;t see any stretchmarks! our doctor told us to continue using it until her tummy gets back to its old size. She&#x27;s thankful for this!</li>
            <li> This lotion smells great. It is very moisturizing without leaving a thick residue on the skin. It blends into the skin and leaves it feeling silky smooth.  You can see and feel that your skin is hydrated after applying, and I love the way it is healing for the skin.  A few hours later my skin felt moisturized.  To get the most of the lotion for stretch marks, I can see that applying it 3 times/ day as the directions state, is best.  This way the skin stays supple and hydrated all day long, not to mention smells delicious!</li>
            <li> I bought it because I&#x27;m preparing for my pregnancy. It was cheaper than other brands that I heard about and so far so good :)</li>
            <li> Been using this stuff for some time now, very light and not greasy at all. Lasts a long time and helped reduce my stretch marks quite a bit.</li>
            <li> Love this! Great product has a soothing smell that is not over-powerin.</li>
            <li> I hope it is useful for my wife. But I almost can&#x27;t suffer the smell. I have to open window for a while after my wife apply.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream since I forgot to bring my regular cream on a vacation, at 24 weeks (now 37 weeks).  I have since switched to Palmer&#x27;s and am now trying to find a second bottle!  I love this lotion. The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because when you get down to about an inch and half of lotion left in the bottle, it won&#x27;t pump out any more, and for the past week, I&#x27;ve been unscrewing the cap, turning it upside down and shaking and banging as hard as I can to get the rest of the lotion out...it&#x27;s really annoying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I think the oil I use daily works better to keep my skin soft and smooth.  I use Mama Mio Tummy Rub Oil every day after getting out of the shower, and I let my tummy go bare for about an hour to soak in all the oil.  Then I use Palmer&#x27;s every morning and right before bed.  I think the combination works great for me.  I started noticing teeny tiny stretch marks around 30 weeks, but they have stayed teeny tiny, so I&#x27;m hoping they will go away soon.  I just like the feel of this lotion better...the oil is really oily and stains my nightshirts if I don&#x27;t let it soak in for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Palmer&#x27;s is a great product compared to others out there!  For those who reviewed it 1 star just because you got stretch marks, I&#x27;m really sorry, but many studies have shown that lotions and creams make absolutely no difference whatsoever during pregnancy...so it wasn&#x27;t the cream&#x27;s fault that you got stretch marks, it was your genetics.  Just like my genetics still made me get a few tiny ones, but I still love this cream!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more bonus: this lotion is the only thing that kept me from scratching my belly like a crazy person all day long!!  I was sooooo itchy, and putting this cream on a few extra times a day helped calm the itching...the oil and the other products I&#x27;ve tried didn&#x27;t help at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.  I&#x27;m trying the one that comes in a tube next time, maybe that will solve my wasted lotion problem.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Excellent seller. I recommend it to everyone .</li>
            <li> Has an odd smell to it and I don&#x27;t think it really did much for my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> The image for this listing is incorrect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The image that is on this listing, with the green bar above the image on the lotion bottle, is for the unscented, \\&quot;with shea butter\\&quot; version of this lotion.  After speaking with Palmer&#x27;s, I discovered that this product has been discontinued, and instead Palmer&#x27;s is shipping out the \\&quot;light scent\\&quot; version of this product.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work at all, took before and after pictures after using entire bottle 2-3times a day app,IDE and rubbed in. Not even the slightest change in stretch mark appearance. Sorry to report as this came very recommended.</li>
            <li> Smells and feels wonderful.</li>
            <li> I love this lotion! It is the best ever. I use it faithfully every night before bed and it keeps my skin soft.</li>
            <li> I have a (litteral) ass load of stretch marks from puberty. Unfortunately scars are unreversable no matter how hopeful you are.&lt;br /&gt;When I got pregnant I feared that my belly would be painted with zebra stripes like the ones from my adolescent years.&lt;br /&gt;I was a size 00 prepregnancy and have stretched all the way now two weeks from my due date and have NO stretch marks what so ever on my belly. I have used this lotion every night after bathing, alternating regular lotions in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say for sure it&#x27;s the lotion, but the odds are good. I am prone to stretch marks and this preventive ritual seems to have worked. I highly doubt I got lucky.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t for a sec think it will reverse any you already have. Stay hydrated and maintain a healthy bmi.</li>
            <li> Bought for granddaughter who is pregnant. She really likes it. She says not too greasy..It has the cocoa butter she likes and the vitamin E I like, Arrived fast too.,</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this product!!!  I used it my entire pregnancy and didn&#x27;t get one stretch mark!  It&#x27;s smells great too!  I still use it to this day for the way it makes my skin feel and the smell. I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
            <li> Not sure yet if it&#x27;s helping with the stretch marks but it definitely keeps my skin smooth and soft. Most importantly it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes like other lotions. And I love the smell!</li>
            <li> I did not buy this at amazon but wanted to stop by to leave a feedback. I picked it up at motherhood maternity for $8 something. I delivered a baby 10 weeks back and once I hit my pre-pregnancy waist/weight, I checked myself at my mirror and there was not a sign of stretch mark.&lt;br /&gt;I used this product throughout my pregnancy and did have a big tummy with visible stretch marks close to due date. I recommend this to every pregnant mother-to-be.</li>
            <li> I do like the stuff and it seems to work I think my only complaint would be that the pump mechanism with the bottle doesn&#x27;t work so I have to kind of scoop it out.</li>
            <li> didnt remove stretch marks...not useful but sticky</li>
            <li> I LOVE COCOA BUTTER FOR IT MAKES YOU SKIN FEEL SOFT I USE THIS ON MY FEET EVERY NIGHT BEFORE I GO TO BED IT WORKS BETTER THEN THE ONES YOU BUT FOR YOUR FEET ~</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard women go on about this stretch mark lotion and, in fact, I remember seeing this on my mother&#x27;s dresser counter as a kid. So, once I became pregnant myself, I decided to give this a shot. I mean, it&#x27;s inexpensive enough, so what&#x27;s the harm? To be honest, I have only used this product a handful of times, so, my star rating isn&#x27;t based upon whether or not it actually prevented any stretch marks but rather, it&#x27;s based on my thoughts around this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It has a very rich smell to it, like chocolate. The smell itself doesn&#x27;t really bother me too much but it can be very overpowering, especially when you are pregnant and your sense of smell is especially heightened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The lotion goes on very thin, in fact, a little too thin for my liking. It is not thick at all, like other tummy butters I&#x27;ve tried. As a result, it feels like a cheap product when you put it on, like it has no substance to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. This product is very flaky. After putting it on, I would run my hand over some areas that I had lotioned, and the product would flake, instead of absorb and moisturize my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. This product is not moisturizing in the least bit (see #3.) It left my skin itchy. Not incredibly itchy but when a product is moisturizing, it&#x27;s supposed to defeat the itchiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on these reasons alone, I have discontinued using this product. For less than $10, I can&#x27;t really say I expected this to be a miracle cream but I would still hope that a product of this price would be somewhat moisturizing, which it is clearly not. I have honestly tried better (in terms of moisturizing) lotions from Victoria&#x27;s Secret. At least their lotions never flaked on me and they kept my skin hydrated.</li>
            <li> Fake product . This is not palmers coco butter . The bottles are used and filled with fake lotion and tapped to look sealed</li>
            <li> Keep in mind that stretch marks have a lot to do with genetics and no lotion is going to miraculously prevent you from getting them or make them go away, but this lotion is great. It&#x27;s just enough moisture, smells light, and is affordable. I&#x27;ve loved using it during my pregnancy.</li>
            <li> its great and leaves your skin feeling sexy and smoothed you will love it so buy it now take my word</li>
            <li> I love cocoa butter skin care products. They are kinda pricey in the retail stores and they lack a diversity of Palmers products. Thanks amazon</li>
            <li> The bottle box as gift is really a perfect choice. The glass bottle is good for baby&#x27;s healthy. I like it.</li>
            <li> This is working wonders! Love it (:</li>
            <li> This was an awful buy. When I first opened the package I tried to pump the nozzle and nothing came out! I opened up the bottle and realizes that the lotion had turned to a paste consistancy and I wasn&#x27;t able to use it.</li>
            <li> The product was delivered international 3 wks prior to the originally mentioned date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Got this product due to the bottle having a pump and choosing against the tummy butter as the application process would be cleaner; however, the pump did not work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can not tell you if it is totally working as I do not follow the directions fully. It states to apply up to three times a day and with the hot weather and the fact that it is still quite greasy after application I do not like be soo sticky all day long.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the only product I use and it works. it feels a bit greasy but i apply it before going to bed. smells really nice and it lasts for a while</li>
            <li> the pump on the container is temperamental and the size is very small. The lotion was thick enough and I used it twice a day with no difference in my stretch marks.</li>
            <li> smells good but i don&#x27;t see any difference</li>
            <li> I\\&quot;m using it as a base to mix it with other oils like Rose hips, grape seed oil, and vitamin E, the pump makes it much more easier for me to use it and the smell is nice too for me.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know any lotion really work in preventing stretch marks.  Many articles say no but I still bought this.  I developed no stretch mark but it also can be genetic.  My mother doesn&#x27;t have any either.  It feels good putting on the tummy and for sure relieves any dryness.</li>
            <li> My sister and I use this. I use a LOT and rub it in for three minutes on my stretch marks. It does work but with continuous use. I use it twice a day on my marks. My sister hates the smell but I think it&#x27;s pretty content.</li>
            <li> I used this every night during my pregnancy and the oil during the day (oil is to messy for bed). I didn&#x27;t get any stretch marks during my pregnancy!</li>
            <li> I love it, it works great and was priced right. I will get more when i need it. Happy overall with item.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion and its ok. I guess its true what they say--there really isn&#x27;t anything to PREVENT stretch marks unless there is something that is ridiculously expensive. I got them either way but only above my bikini line which isn&#x27;t so bad. I put this lotion on every day but not sure if I need to be lathering it on 3 times a day or what. It smells really good. I think I would recommend it, but I would definitely put it on more than once a day.</li>
            <li> This is a great product. My wife uses it everyday :) Gets the job done every time. Perfectly moisturizes the body.</li>
            <li> Stretch marks are genetic, so I can&#x27;t say whether this has actually prevented them or not, but it is a great moisturizer for a stretching belly. It is much thicker than an average moisturizer so it lasts longer and prevents itching when you are away from home during the day.</li>
            <li> I have bought two bottles of the location, and I like these Cocoa Butter products including this massage location for stretch marks, but both of the packages (the pump sections) were broken, so I ended up squeeze the location even time when I used.</li>
            <li> la crema es muy buena, ha aclarado unas estrias que tenia , espero que logre desaparecer por completo las que tengo</li>
            <li> The product came in dirty and looks like it has been sitting in the warehouse for a long time before shipping. Considering to return it because I am not sure if the quality is still good.</li>
            <li> I really like this lotion and have used it in the later stages of my pregnancy. I think stretch marks have a ton of factors that come into play and thus far ( at 9 months) I have none, but I attribute that to genetics vs lotions. The reason I love this product is because with pregnancy my skin gets very dry as well as itchy. This lotion soothes my skin and keeps the relief longer than other products and the price is so reasonable.</li>
            <li> Maybe if you are using this to PREVENT stretch marks it would work. But if you are trying to lessen the appearance of stretch marks. Look elsewhere.</li>
            <li> Palmer&#x27;s cocoa butter. Smells great, works great, isn&#x27;t greasy and actually does seem to have some effect on stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Love the smell, but a bit thick going on, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to have emollient staying power. Also don&#x27;t see any difference.</li>
            <li> My wife had surgery and this was recommended to her by the doctor.  Nothing super, nothing great but she said she uses it because the doctor told her to.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product daily for months. I know it&#x27;s nearly impossible to completely prevent stretch marks, but this lotion seems to be doing the trick so far (knock on wood)! I am 7 months pregnant and have no stretch marks at all on my growing belly. The lotion is very moisturizing and seems to last on my skin for a long time. I also LOVE the smell. I actually came back and ordered 2 more bottles because I love it so much!</li>
            <li> Have been using this since they changed the formula of Burts Bees, and this is my second bottle. Sometimes I mix it in my palm with the Massage Oil of the same brand; my girlfriend loves it.</li>
            <li> Smells like chocolate. Leaves my skin soft. I do not know if it really helps with preventing stretch marks but I am still free of them. Heard genetics play a roll but I will continue to use this as I love how it feels and smells!</li>
            <li> So I have recently gotten into weight lifting and the stretch marks have been making an appearance. They did not become a problem for me until they showed up on my biceps and could be seen even when I was wearing a regular t shirt. This lotion has helped them fade and turn back into my natural skin color, some of the stretch marks are taking longer to fade (I have been using it for about a month now) but they are ALL fading which is good enough for me. This is a must buy for MEN and WOMEN dealing with stretch marks.</li>
            <li> Not sure how the product works because I just received it today, but the spout looks dirty like it has been refilled and/or returned...  I&#x27;m going to give the benefit of the doubt that it happened at the factory (it happens sometimes)...  Hopefully I have the right product so I can give a real review after a few weeks of use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for 2 days and can already tell a difference. I used Mederma in the past, and I have to say I like Palmer&#x27;s better. Some complained about this product being to thin, but I don&#x27;t like heavy lotions and Mederma is heavy... I am 120 and Mederma &amp;#34;tightens the skin&amp;#34; per say and makes me look 125-130 :( What girl wants the extra five pounds?! I prefer this product!! Much cheaper</li>
            <li> it is really perfect, wish sell more things like this, wonderful for each one, good product, thank you a lot</li>
            <li> I love it! It just as greasy as it should be. One and a half month before D-day I don&#x27;t have any stretch-marks.</li>
            <li> Sadly, I don&#x27;t like the smell, even though it is mild.</li>
            <li> Not one single stretch and I already had many in other parts of my body before getting pregnant.</li>
            <li> good for my skin ,but smells so so ,I just don&#x27;t like it smell bad,that&#x27;s why i don&#x27;t get it 5 star</li>
            <li> Used this almost everyday while I was pregnant. I mostly focused on m belly area and sometimes my thighs. I didn&#x27;t get stretch arms in those two areas but I did get some on my chest and my hips. My advice is to use this on every inch of your body while you&#x27;re pregnant since it seemed to work well on the areas it was applied!</li>
            <li> it smells very heavy and makes me nauseous, it might just be because i&#x27;m pregnant and overly sensitive to smells but just a warning.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve used it 3 times a day every day on my entire body since i found out i was pregnant at 6 weeks. i am now 25 weeks and have awful stretchmarks on my left breast. all that energy spent with this product and it didn&#x27;t do anything other than make me feel greasy and nauseous every time i used it.</li>
            <li> I love Palmer&#x27;s Original Cocoa Butter Formula, I use it all over including my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific formula is creamier and a little oilier, which is great to help keep the tummy moisturized. It takes a bit longer to be absorbed into the skin, but feels great as it keeps your skin hydrated. I&#x27;m a first time mommy to be and taking every precaution to prevent stretch marks, even though they say it&#x27;s totally genetics, I think your health routine has a lot more to do with it. Drinks lots of water, eat healthy and moisturize! I personally mixed three different products in a glass jar and it makes my skin and tummy feel super moisturized and baby soft and alleviates itching! Almond oil, coconut oil, and this product twice a day.</li>
            <li> Non sticky! I love this through out my pregnancy. All over my body!</li>
            <li> I really like the smell of this product. I hope it works. This is my first pregnancy and I&#x27;ve been putting this on every night after I shower. Hopefully I will not get stretch marks. But stretch marks are genetic so I will see in a couple months. But in the mean time it smells good so I am using it.</li>
            <li> I used this during my pregnancy along with Burt&#x27;s Bees Mama Bee cream. I got a lot of stretch marks on my belly and sides despite using it. They say it is mostly genetic and I would have to agree. I had gotten stretch marks previously during puberty so I knew I was prone to them.</li>
            <li> Excellent, thick lotion cream with a yummy chocolatey scent that I use for my prego belly.</li>
            <li> My wife has used this for her first two pregnancies, (the first being with twins), and she does not have one stretch mark on her! It was recommend to her by her sister-in-law. My wife has a few friends who had babies before her and have these snake-like marks all over their bellies, arms, and legs. These ladies are not heavy to begin with, but they are basically scarred for life and that made my wife super nervous. She made sure to use this stuff every day, even before she started showing. We just found out she is expecting so we immediately purchased some more.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion isn&#x27;t the best smelling lotion, but it isnt as bad as some reviewers are saying. Just apply it at night, after your shower, and the next day the smell will be gone and you can carry on your day as normal. What is worse, a little stinky lotion for a couple of hours before you go to bed for a few months,or nasty stretch marks for the rest of your life? (by the way, stretch mark removal surgery is expensive, and does a pretty good job, but I have not seen one that looks normal).</li>
            <li> Nice and thick but the smell is too sweet. I feel like a chocolate chip, or fresh cake batter. When you are putting it on a pregnant belly it is a large surface area and that smell is too much. The bottle doesn&#x27;t advertise any scent so I was surprised to find such a strong one.</li>
            <li> I use this nearly daily, I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference in the stretch marks on my stomach. They aren&#x27;t extremely noticeable anyway though (they weren&#x27;t ever red, the skin is just stretched). It smells nice enough, and is a soft, non-greasy lotion so I like it. I&#x27;ll keep using it - it can&#x27;t be doing any harm, and I like it as a lotion. Don&#x27;t expect any quick miracle results though.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect anything to magically make your stretch marks vanish. I&#x27;ve always had horrible vicious long red marks on my hips and belly. I literally heard \\&quot;Oh my god! It looks like someone clawed you open!\\&quot; from a guy (right after I finally had accepted them). I tried the Mederma Advanced stuff and it worked a little. They faded some, I didn&#x27;t really expect much but it did help. I can&#x27;t use the Palmer&#x27;s Cocoa Butter Body Butter because my skin will begin to get itchy and red, but during the 2-3 days I use it, it works well. So I tried this stuff to see if my skin would react as much to it and it doesn&#x27;t. This is great if you can&#x27;t use the butter because your skin is sensitive. I&#x27;ve been using just the regular Palmers Cocoa Butter for about 2 weeks or so and it lightened my marks up considerably. Then I actually bought this and have been using it for the past week or so and my stretch marks look so much better. They&#x27;re not as bright and they seemed to have shrank some. I am so happy with this lotion. Every night I slather it on my back, hips, belly, inner thighs, and underarms.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Used it for 9 months. No difference</li>
            <li> It works well. I use it together with Bio-oil. They really help to weaken the stretch marks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 22 years old. My body&#x27;s lean and I&#x27;m probably under 10% in body fat. I&#x27;m saying all of this because I got stretch marks from dry skin and growing too fast. My dry skin stretched out as I was growing taller. Mine are not from weight gain or pregnancy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My stretch marks literally went away in 3 days. I applied 2x a day, one pump.&lt;br /&gt;They were really visible before, but not purple or anything.&lt;br /&gt;After using the lotion, I can&#x27;t even tell I ever had stretch marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if yours are from dry skin and growth, and not from weight gain, this thing is A MIRACLE!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5 months pregnant and bought couple different brands pregnancy creams. This one smells great, and make your skin very smooth. I don&#x27;t have any stretch marks yet and I hope this cream will help me look great through and after the pregnancy.</li>
            <li> fast shipping, Perfect!</li>
            <li> This product is designed for pregnant women. Its smell is very nice and the its ingredient is natural. I like it so so much. Now it&#x27;s winter and I use it every night after bath.</li>
            <li> I love this product, it works better than cocoa butter for stretch marks. I just had my baby 8 mos again &amp; I searched for a product that would reduce my stretch marks right away. So far so good, my dark stretch marks have already lightened up. You can barely tell I have stretch marks anymore.</li>
            <li> This stuff actually works. I used it twice a day (once in the morning and once before bed) and it has drastically faded stretch marks i&#x27;ve suffered from for about 5 years that have made me very self-concious and it only took about... 3 weeks tops. Buy this stuff because it actually works.</li>
            <li> Such a waste of money. It doesn&#x27;t even work, its actually making my stretch marks worse! I&#x27;m not happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using it a lil over a week and i already see a difference, I put a thick coat on my areas before bed. I notice the color is getting lighter and they are slightly getting smaller. Its only been a week so im looking forward to 4 weeks.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t stand the smell,  it makes me sick and I can&#x27;t get away from the stench after I put it on.  morning sickness is bad enough.</li>
            <li> Item is not what I received. I got two bottles in spanish that are Cocoa butter marked for post-partum firming. I don&#x27;t care enough to return it but I will not be buying again.</li>
