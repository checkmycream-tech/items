            <li>Absolutely the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

            <li>It conditions nicely.  </li>
            <li>so that is really nice too.</li>
            <li>Came in on time and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li>but the smell is kind of funky cherry.  </li>
            <li>It smells great, nice and light and does not cause my color to fade at all.</li>
            <li>Told me she really liked the&lt;br /&gt;way</li>

            <li>The smell lasts on the hair, which is nice.</li>

            <li>This is the best smelling shampoo/conditioner I have ever used and it makes my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li>The shampoo lathered wonderfully and the conditioner was very creamy and made it easy to untangle my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li>stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had very fine hair</li>
            <li>I really experienced great results in short time.</li>
            <li>The smell of this one is strong (candy smell), it&#x27;s not bad and it lingers which is great.</li>
            <li>so I came on here and bought me some lol who doesn&#x27;t want silky soft sexy hair that smells so good that you might need a bodyguard</li>
            <li>It smells good and my hair looks shiny and full.  </li>
            <li>I bought this because it had good (and true) reviews and was $20 (better than you can get it in a salon during a sale- trust me).</li>
            <li>but if you don&#x27;t have that I&#x27;m sure it will work fine!</li>
            <li>and i am also a huge fan of the pump!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s lessening that more and more.</li>
            <li>I feel eventually I won&#x27;t have any more issues with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I assure you that using that  will be waaaay more effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I bleach my roots almost every month and straighten my hair every two days and while using this shampoo, the damage has not increased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have refused to cut it because I love the length and don&#x27;t have the strength to part with it</li>
            <li>I have never been more impressed with shampoo and conditioner in my entire life!</li>
            <li>It makes it so much more manegable</li>
            <li>Would suggest they pack the boxes with more padding to prevent this from happening.</li>
            <li>Resurrection is now my favorite bed head out of them all ...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been really pleased with it.</li>

            <li>I used to love Pureology but just can&#x27;t afford it.  </li>
            <li>:3</li>
            <li>I bought this Bed Head shampoo and conditioner at the recommendation of the girl who cuts my hair, and all I can say is that I have been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>so I just make  sure to keep it about an inch away</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo and really love the price I get them for.</li>
            <li>and it has more of a shine or glow to it than it used to.</li>
            <li>The price on here was also better than I could find in stores</li>
            <li>The conditioner also had a more chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li>Love the product, however packaging was a problem.  </li>
            <li>It repairs my hair better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before</li>

            <li>and so glad I did.</li>

            <li>Even better than the level two set.</li>
            <li>and I like the Level 2 RECOVERY set much better since it leaves my hair more weightless.</li>

            <li>its much more softer  and smoother</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair healthy and shiny</li>

            <li>so I need all the help I can get and this worked so much better</li>
            <li>I love the scent and it lasted me about 3 months</li>
            <li>I would stick with the Blue Recovery brand as it smells SOOOOOOOOO AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li>I use mostly Bed Head hair products.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>

            <li>Fast shipping, good packaging.  </li>
            <li>need to use a whole lot for a good wash.</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner makes it feel soft and silky again, and the apple scent is very nice too.</li>
            <li>It reminds me of cotton candy, which is unique for a shampoo, since most tend to just smell like flowers or something.</li>
            <li>True story!</li>
            <li>Keeps my hair from frizzing up everywhere, looking shiny, and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Overall an excellent product and worth the price.</li>
            <li>Easy to manage.</li>
            <li>so it gets damaged easily.</li>

            <li>I can&#x27;t wait to use it again and get my hair smooth, tangle free, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li>First, it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li>I tried this product, which smells amazing by the way, and literally just after the first use my husband and my coworkers commented on how shiny my hair looked.  </li>
            <li>The first day I used this four of my coworkers noticed and commented on how nice my hair looked.</li>
            <li>I love the sweet smell and</li>
            <li>Not my favorite of the Bed Head line, but not bad.</li>
            <li>Great product rinse clean and keeps hair soft</li>
            <li>:)  Very fast shipping :)</li>
            <li>I have a lot of fine hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li>The product seems to work fine despite the smell, but I am now on the fence about purchasing shampoo and conditioner online again.</li>
            <li>When I switched back, my hair felt wonderful from the first wash.</li>
            <li>love the product and how quick is was shipped to me.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy with &amp;#34;resurrection&amp;#34; A great deal lasts almost 2 months and my hair goes down to the lower of my back...</li>
            <li>It smelled awesome (like a combo of sweet tarts and mango), and always left my hair very silky and healthy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely LOVE it and have noticed my hair feeling so much healthier already!!</li>
            <li>I notice I huge difference on the days</li>
            <li>, I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li>I got some tips at the salon and online and one that stood out was get a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li>I had to giggle at this point as her &amp;#34;pet head&amp;#34; by tigi shampoo was indeed sulfate free.</li>
            <li>Overall great product.</li>
            <li>It smells like nail polish remover or cheap hand sanitizer (with a rotten fruit scent to it).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m constantly having to cut it to keep the style and it smells great.</li>
            <li>Leaves hair smooth and revived/resurrected.  </li>
            <li>My hair is much soft and bright now.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and my hair is extremely soft, has more body to it and is a lot stronger more healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair was silky smooth.</li>
            <li>The conditioner is great to put in and leave in for 10-15 minutes if you need a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li>which I enjoy, even though I am not a girly girl.</li>
            <li>Overall I would say this is a great shampoo and conditioner set if your hair has been fried by heat styling tools, chemicals, or is</li>
            <li>It smells AMAZING and really makes your hair shine.</li>
            <li>This one is great for hair that needs extra moisture.</li>
            <li>I was really happy with the product because of the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This shampoo is fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price, did what it said :-)</li>
            <li>my hair just smells FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li>Great price for the same product.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the smell, I just hope the conditioner will start to actually smooth my ends.</li>
            <li>My hair has very little fallout now, is so easy to comb, and styles beautifully!!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is very worth it if you lighten your hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sulfate free, but it still lathers decently which is nice.</li>
            <li>It is super easy to brush out my hair after washing.</li>
            <li>Smells nice, works decently.</li>
            <li>I was talking to my grand daughter about needing some good shampoo for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>Worth it!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a unique, tropical smell that I adore.</li>
            <li>Its worth it if your are feeling discouraged!</li>
            <li>After the first wash, my hair was noticeably softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li>First off let me start on how much I love the scent.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried the first couple of times I used it because my hair was frizzy and didn&#x27;t feel that great, but I kept using it and after the 3rd time of using it, my hair started to feel awesome.</li>
            <li>Fast and easy delivery as well!</li>
            <li>Love this set and how soft and smooth it makes my hair!</li>
            <li>AND HONESTLY, FOR THE SAME PRICE, ID RATHER IT SMELL BETTER.</li>
            <li>they smell fantastic and really have made my hair so much better.</li>
            <li>great shampoo for dry damaged hair</li>
            <li>Bought product on Amazon as it was less than at salon, love Love LOVE the results!</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>So far I love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>I just tried it and my hair was silky smooth, shiny, easy to manage for the first time in my life</li>
            <li>Great product for dry, damaged hair!</li>
            <li>this is great for keeping your hair from breaking and being dry!  </li>
            <li>My hair is very dry and brittle and this shampoo and conditioner made my hair look great.</li>
            <li>this stuff smells amazing and my hair is so soft and shiny</li>
            <li>This is the best shampoo and conditioner for my thick wavy hair out there.</li>
            <li>They both smell like strawberries, which is ok, but the shampoo and conditioner are very watery.  </li>
            <li>Love it really does resurrect your hair.</li>
            <li>If it was actually tigi it would have been good, however, proconcepts shipped something else.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always loved this brand since I went blond last summer.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li>Smells good, my hair feels softer already after only one wash</li>
            <li>Please make sure that you order from Amazon or get an order that is fulfilled by Amazon because then you KNOW you are getting the real deal.</li>
            <li>Way to sweet for me.  </li>
            <li>but product is good enough to overlook the scent.</li>
            <li>and i continue to use it because i love it that much.</li>
            <li>so they mostly use products that really work.</li>
            <li>Based on the way it makes my hair feel, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li>I know she is going to love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li>After 6 months of continued use I consistently only have good hair days.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly, I LOVE this; it really works for</li>
            <li>It has the yummy, sweet fruity/candy smell you&#x27;d anticipate from Tigi and doesn&#x27;t leave any film or cause greasiness, which is often a problem I experience with moisturizing/hydrating/repairing products.</li>
            <li>It could of been a fluke, but when I got my package, the bag that it came in was full of shampoo.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not bad either.  </li>
            <li>I will never change for other products because they are really efficient and my hair are smooth and smells very good.</li>
            <li>Not only does it smell great (which is good for my sensitive sinuses), but it conditions my hair well and leaves it feeling very soft.</li>
            <li>I assumed it was because the product just wasn&#x27;t the right fit for my hair.</li>
            <li>I use two pumps of each on my middle of the back length hair and it is the perfect amount.</li>
            <li>The shampoo does have a mild form of sulfate, so beware if you have a keratin treatment or color-treated hair.</li>
            <li>These arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for two washes and already it is soft, smooth and tangle free!</li>
            <li>Came fast, smelled good, made my hair super soft and glossy.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t use this my hair gets super tangly.</li>
            <li>It smells great and has left my hair feeling much softer after just a couple of uses.</li>
            <li>I have liked other bed head products better.</li>
            <li>with this conditioner it detangles my hair easy without  using a large amount....</li>
            <li>Realizing that it was liking quite dry &amp; lifeless, I started shopping for something that got good reviews to help.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li>this product (shampoo &amp; conditioner) has really saved me!!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite shampoo I has tried so far!</li>
            <li>After using this set the Tigi Resurrection left my hair very soft and smelling great.  </li>
            <li>For fine hair that has been bleached, the shampoo and conditioner are very moisturizing</li>
            <li>I wish the conditioner felt a little more moisturizing in the shower as I have to apply an extra pump to get it worked through the ends, but it&#x27;s very light weight as smells good.</li>
            <li>I was excited to try this product after all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>but I have to say, after a few weeks of using it my hair feels great</li>
            <li>It smells amazing ( almost like berries) which we both love, and it left her hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Ive been using this for about a few weeks now every day and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li>but I just had to laugh and check a bottle in the my cupboard....</li>
            <li>You only smell the shampoo which smells fruity and nice.</li>
            <li>This shampoo can make the most damaged hair soft.</li>
            <li>I Love how silky soft it makes my hair..  </li>
            <li>Honestly it is the only thing I will ever use.</li>
            <li>it also makes my hair much more manageable and soft.</li>
            <li>I love how soft it makes my hair</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, and healthy because of this.</li>
            <li>After 1-2 weeks, my hair completely changed for the better.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>She was delighted and very satisfied.would definitely continue purchasing.</li>
            <li>and i will say i loved how it felt wet and</li>
            <li>Love this shampoo and conditioner so far.  </li>
            <li>And after using both products for the first time, my hair was super soft and had BODY to it again - I was able to style it for the first time in almost a week!</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products and I was so glad to find it at such a decent price.</li>
            <li>I got it today and washed my hair immediately and had high expectation because of all the good reviews I read prior to purchasing this product.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t argue with results right?</li>
            <li>I tried this product because the price was right.  </li>
            <li>and she is right</li>
            <li>She mentioned that people tend to shampoo and wash it right out, which doesnt help the hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;-Dont</li>
            <li>I normally purchase in store, but Amazon was such a good deal.</li>
            <li>I really do like the scent, but i wish it were more lasting and strong.</li>
            <li>it fades pretty quickly, and that the conitioner is too strong to use near my scalp</li>
            <li>It left my hair nice, soft and frizz free.  </li>
            <li>, I have long naturally straight blonde hair, I used the kind in the blue bottle I loved it!</li>
            <li>Easy enough to clean up</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and easy to comb after using the conditioner.  </li>
            <li>It feels strong again to the point of being almost like my natural hair.</li>
            <li>Next to my beloved L&#x27;anza shampoos/conditioners, this one has become an unexpected favourite.</li>
            <li>These have a convenient little squirt top that keeps you from using too much and it has a strong smell (like girl!)</li>
            <li>The smell was a bit disconcerting the first time I used it, but it makes my hair unbelievably soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li>The smell is very intense.</li>
            <li>That I had it lifted to a very light blonde!!</li>
            <li>Came home to realize the product was very very very expired - and the reason for my hairs yucky feel was in fact because Amazon had sold me an expired</li>
            <li>, however I expected my hair to stay in better condition/not so dry since my stylist told me these were best to use after coloring to keep my hair from being dry and to hold the color.</li>
            <li>I now absolutely LOVE the color but initially, I was embarrassed because of the damage.</li>
            <li>When I first received it, the shampoo and conditioner both smelled like strawberries, but about two weeks in, the conditioner started to smell funny.</li>
            <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li>, I can run my fingers through it...without having to brush it first</li>
            <li>Finally, my hair is silky, shiny, and so much more manageable.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li>Never rinse with hot water.</li>
            <li>Have been fan since first time  </li>
            <li>Have been using them for several years now  : )</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner is very nourishing!</li>
            <li>this shampoo does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li>Really yucky stuff!</li>
            <li>First of all, it smells like candy; I could smell it before I had even taken the plastic off of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for 6 months now</li>
            <li>You get exactly what you pay for and it does what it says.</li>
            <li>leaves hair silky and shiny :) .. I believe this is the fourth time that I&#x27;ve bought them.</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping!  </li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner does exactly what It says.</li>
            <li>It keeps it healthy and keeps my fragile ends from splitting therefore, my hair looks longer and healthier.</li>
            <li>My hair might have been pretty when it was made up and curled</li>
            <li>and I probably won&#x27;t need to buy more until next month!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been bleaching and coloring my hair for a decade, and this is the only shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve tried that makes it feel healthy and manageable again.</li>
            <li>Now I look like an after ;)</li>
            <li>do i looked here sure enough here</li>
            <li>Within the first use, my hair was restored to youthful, bouncy, silky hair.</li>
            <li>I noticed the change the first i used it</li>
            <li>I read reviews they were pretty even on the likes and dislikes,  </li>
            <li>I think I am more in the middle.  </li>
            <li>Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it leaves a build up on scalp if used too many days on a row</li>
            <li>I am extremely pleased with this shampoo/conditioner, especially since I thought I might have to cut my hair.</li>
            <li>this shampoo and conditioner is always consistent never had any issues out of it.</li>
            <li>I have finally found another shampoo/conditioner that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li>I was worried I&#x27;d have to go shorter soon, but I won&#x27;t have to get more than a trim next time thanks to Resurrection!</li>
            <li>Her hair looks and feels so much healthier!</li>
            <li>so many different things and nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li>Also, I have naturally semi wavy-semi straight, baby fine hair.</li>
            <li>Hair feels, clean, soft and managable.</li>
            <li>The Bed Head Level 2 (blue bottles) really moisturized my hair much better.</li>
            <li>I have tried many, and I mean many, shampoos on the market.</li>
            <li>It has made my hair super soft after 3 uses!</li>
            <li>She was positive it was either expired or a knock-off product.</li>
            <li>I will never buy hair products online unless I&#x27;m 100% positive they are licensed retailers.  </li>
            <li>(I really couldn&#x27;t do this before, the split ends tend to make my hair pretty gnarly and tangled.)</li>
            <li>Exactly as the picture and the quality is really good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>If you liked Self Absorbed, then the equivalent replacement would be Urban Antidotes Recovery (blue bottle).</li>
            <li>Smells amazing and makes my dry hair soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li>I love the way it smells and it helps my hair which is really dry.</li>
            <li>my hair became super soft after each shower and stayed that way no matter in what weather.</li>
            <li>It smells like candy and leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li>Smells great, no more tangles, and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>but eventually I realized my hair smelled funny after it was dried, kind of like a burnt..smell</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li>so I had to use strong and a lot of bleach to lift the color of my entire head to a light brown/bright blonde color).</li>
            <li>clean and light moisturizer that leaves hair noticeably healthy-looking, shiny, and doesn&#x27;t feel weighted down even after sleeping on it.</li>
            <li>but it doesn&#x27;t really transfer to your hair.</li>
            <li>Shampoo and Conditioner really made my scalp breakout with bumps and became very irritated-</li>
            <li>Did not like it at all - Very Chemical</li>
            <li>It is still noticeably damaged but not as much as without.</li>
            <li>Works really well for my hair type.  </li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need to use much of it.  </li>
            <li>My hair is so much shinier &amp; smoother than its ever been.</li>
            <li>This product works well, and is very moisturizing for the hair.</li>
            <li>My hair grows really fast with this.</li>
            <li>Smells absolutely devine of pomegranate.</li>
            <li>A real Resurrection of chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li>this product and thanks Bed Head for making such an amazing shampoo and conditioner that brought my hair back to life.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;N</li>
            <li>I have sun-damaged hair and this does very well to restore strength and body.</li>
            <li>However, this does not moisturize my hair as much as Moisture Maniac.</li>
            <li>AND I am very picky about my shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s light on your hair, especially for us fine-hair people.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li>I am really please with the product.  </li>
            <li>your hair looks really nice!&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I have really picky hair.</li>
            <li>I have a really picky scalp that hates &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo like Garnier, or Pantine.</li>
            <li>this product works well and was shipped fast.</li>
            <li>definitely received the genuine product.</li>
            <li>I have straight medium length hair</li>
            <li>Bummer I have so much of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Received fast from seller.  </li>
            <li>And it really made a difference.</li>
            <li>At Ulta you will pay this much for just one bottle of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It really does wonders for me together.</li>
            <li>much worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I don&#x27;t have the whole :</li>
            <li>My hair stylist of 4 years saw me go through the whole &amp;#34;dying-puffy-no-moisture-falling</li>
            <li>I think it was because the whole shipping/processing fee, ehhhh</li>
            <li>I have so much frizz</li>
            <li>My daughter has very curly hair/ highlighted, and she straightens it.  </li>
            <li>Product as described and VERY affordable price.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner leaves my hair really silky, too.</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>This works really well on my overly processed hair.</li>
            <li>I was very displeased..</li>
            <li>I really like this product.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t really have any complaints</li>
            <li>I have done so much to my hair</li>
            <li>So I use developer and the dye--the whole enchilada.</li>
            <li>My hair gets a workout &amp; this really seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li>I absolutely give the credit it to this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel very waxy.  </li>
            <li>Makes hair silky smooth but didn&#x27;t notice extra volume.</li>
            <li>Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I actually really really do.</li>
            <li>I really recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d probably give them another shot just because I like the product so much.</li>
            <li>I have had a few people at work or even in crowded bars ask what kind of shampoo I use because it smells</li>
            <li>However, the smell is just blah and more chemically (not awful, but not great.</li>
            <li>and it dried out nicely.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair and this did nothing for it except weigh it down and make it super oily and dull.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>WOW!!!  </li>
            <li>I have very fine hair that has to be washed every day, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and keeps it moisturized.</li>
            <li>Normally, I do not like Tigi products - sure, they have uber cute packaging and smell fantastic, but they typically just don&#x27;t perform well enough to be a go-to for my hair type.</li>
            <li>I love these liter sizes, because they last months (even for long hair) and are a better value than the regular bottle sizes.</li>
            <li>amazing on my over processed bleach blonde hair, makes it smooth and soft without weighing it down</li>
            <li>I feel like this shampoo is gentle enough but also gets my hair clean without leaving it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and wear it long and straight.</li>
            <li>It smelled relatively the same, but it was VERY strong compared to the store product which made it burn my nose a bit.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if I would say it is that much better than all of the other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, but it does make my hair soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>i think i will eep using it a little more and see if it rescues my fantasy color hair, but the first impression so far is just a little better than ok, i think the john frieda shampoos are same as this one</li>
            <li>I have wavey/curly hair that can get frizzy and dry easily.</li>
            <li>This is the only shampoo we have found that helps the dandruff and keeps her hair looking shining and clean.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is not as soft like many other conditioners, but it adds enough softness to the hair making combing easy -</li>
            <li>so I do needto pump it a good 2-3 times, but when I did have short hair, it was like a pump and a half??</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t wait to use this product tonight when I wash my hair; came fully packaged and wrapped up really good; a little leakage, but only a small amount, not enough to fuss about; smells great</li>
            <li>I have bleached curly hair, so I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to products that might be drying, and this isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>Pretty surprised.</li>
            <li>It smells great, but I think it should be used more for a person who wants that dramatic hairstyle everyday.  </li>
            <li>I live by the beach, so the wind murders it every day of my life!</li>
            <li>I have a combination of dry/oily 3A curly hair (oily on the scalp and dry at the ends) and I can tell that it&#x27;s going to make a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li>Love the brand, will try a different bead head shampoo the next time.</li>
            <li>This is the first shampoo I have tried that actually made a noticeable difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>My niece wanted some for Christmas and the local salon was out of it, so luckily found it online here and ordered it.</li>
            <li>Now, TIGI Head Resurrection is my main go-to for hair product.</li>
            <li>It works really good on my super way dry chemically treated thick hair.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>so I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I read reviews and bought this, with high hopes and fingers crossed.</li>
            <li>There is another product that I highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly suggest this set.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li>When I say significant, I mean I lost a good inch off of my ends due to breakage, and what hair I managed to salvage was gummy and was snapping like rubber bands.</li>
            <li>But in an attempt to change it back to my natural colour once and for all, I incurred some significant damage.</li>
            <li>was working overseas in Korea for the past 4-5 years, and most of the Korean hair salons are very high end.</li>
            <li>It has made a major difference in the health of my hair!!!!</li>
            <li>My hair is soft and shiny again, and feels and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li>I know this shampoo is expensive, but it works great.</li>
            <li>Normally.  </li>
            <li>Finally, a shampoo and conditioner that is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>I love this set because it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my hair</li>
            <li>Great for my thick curly dry hair</li>
            <li>I use a blow dryer and flat iron on my hair, but I have to say after using this shampoo and conditioner daily my hair is healthy and soft.</li>
            <li>The products weigh my hair down and the smell is just TOO strong.</li>
            <li>My hair is totally white and sometimes or rather very dry this shampoo adds body, oil and love the aroma</li>
            <li>I switched for a little over a month to a different brand my friend wanted me to try, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel as amazing as this one did.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it is a little more watery than what I am used to with Sleek Look, but that isn&#x27;t really a problem and just means that I leave a little more conditioner on my hair.</li>
            <li>Was looking for a new, quality shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s like I have new hair.  </li>
            <li>I live in Florida</li>
            <li>My hair feels like new.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I don&#x27;t even have severely damaged hair, I just live in a super dry climate that beats the hell out of my hair and skin.</li>
            <li>it also came a day earlier than the expected shipped date; thats why it deserves 5 stars &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>Fantastic product...now me and my 2 daughters use this...and I was paying the same amount for much smaller bottles!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I only gave it 4/5 stars because I have used Sebastian Drench in the past and liked that a little bit better.</li>
            <li>HIGHLY recommend Clear Shampoo over this product</li>
            <li>They leave it feeling very soft, probably softer than its ever been</li>
            <li>, conditioner combo makes hair very soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li>I usually don&#x27;t wash my hair with sulfate shampoos but this is my favorite duo.</li>
            <li>I did not notice a difference for about three washes, but after that, WOW!</li>
            <li>My husband, my siblings, even my cousin who is a professional hair dresser kept grabbing it and saying &amp;#34;wow!</li>
            <li>I have used many various shampoos and conditioners from several different brands.</li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length, fine and slightly wavy.</li>
            <li>I have curly hair and it leaves them soft and smelling all fruity!</li>
            <li>My only problem is that it smells a little sweet for my tastes luckily</li>
            <li>, It is a little strong in the shower, but once your hair dries it has a softer sent that lasts</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t going to hold my breath, have tried a whole bunch of \\&quot;nice\\&quot; shampoos in the past and they&#x27;ve been fine</li>
            <li>The size of the bottle was huge and the price was much less than at retail stores.</li>
            <li>The seller was great- super fast shipping, but the product (Tigi&#x27;s fault) was pretty awful.  </li>
            <li>I have thick, but fairly damaged long hair.  </li>
            <li>This product is just what my hair needed, the Dumb Blonde was great but Resurrection is just the WHOLE package for my long hair.</li>
            <li>but the conditioner was too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li>Not too heavy on fine hair.</li>
            <li>Your hair is so healthy, it&#x27;s actually hard to style!&amp;#34;, my hairstylist says.  </li>
            <li>If you put too much conditioner near your scalp of course you will somewhat oily hair the next day.</li>
            <li>After using the shampoo and conditioner just once, my hair screaming at me thank you!!!!It was soft and curly again and my ends looked refreshed..</li>
            <li>This shampoo and conditioner have made my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going with pureology nanoworks because I sampled the stuff ONCE during the time I was using this Tigi product and the pureology fixed (with ONE time of trying it)</li>
            <li>Even my not-so-observant boyfriend commented that my hair feels really soft.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;d helped my bleach my blonde roots the day before and not knowing much about girls hair asked \\&quot;Is</li>
            <li>When speaking with my stylist she commented that my hair felt very sticky, and felt as though I had enormous product &amp;#34;build up.&amp;#34; I told her I was using Bed Head - and she asked me if I had bought it in a salon, or at a discount retailer.</li>
            <li>Extremely soft, shiny and no frizz.  </li>
            <li>Only problem I notice is your cant use it to much cause it drys out your scalp.</li>
            <li>Despite many of the negative reviews I decided to give this stuff a try.  </li>
            <li>I used!My hair is soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>It was soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li>Keeps my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not heavy in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Makes my hair soft and brings out my natural curls.</li>
            <li>I had some pumps from my old ones...</li>
            <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Resurrection is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li>I also have a bit of natural wave to my hair, and it&#x27;s on the dryer side.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair...</li>
            <li>After spending hundreds of dollars on hair products that don&#x27;t work i have finally found something that really has repaired my hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really sensitive to smell and dont even want to use shampoos that dont have any scent to it....</li>
            <li>Leaves your hair feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>I tried their green bottle Re-energize (only because my local discount salon had a great sale, and it&#x27;s the only one they had), and it wasn&#x27;t nearly moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li>(I have naturally curly, highlighted hair.)</li>
            <li>how soft my hair is when it dries.</li>
            <li>Made my hair feel soft and shiny without looking greasy.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li>I dye my hair frequently and completely bleach it 2-3 times a year.  </li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t believe how soft it feels.  </li>
            <li>wow.</li>
            <li>Normally it is thick and a more cream color.  </li>
            <li>I mean, everyone was commenting on how healthy my hair looked.</li>
            <li>But it seems to be back to normal!</li>
            <li>Took the product a little longer to arrive than I expected, but I LOVE the product and the price is pretty similar to what I pay in my salon.</li>
            <li>Leaves my hair pretty dry.</li>
            <li>and I still have a half a bottle full of each.</li>
            <li>I have tried several different shampoo and conditioners and this one really does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li>It coats your hair and makes it feel pretty waxy which lasts for several days afterwards even after washing with a different shampoo.</li>
            <li>you are willing to risk it and buy the product I would definitely only use it once a week or so and use a different shampoo in between each use to avoid a major waxy buildup.</li>
            <li>This really weighed my hair down and my curls just didn&#x27;t sit right after using it, they became stringy and flat.</li>
            <li>Although I don&#x27;t care for the smell, it makes my very curly, coarse, and colored hair so soft that I would definitely buy over and over.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos, and besides the super expensive 25 dollar a bottle ones, this one works so well!</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting much until I started seeing my hair dry</li>
            <li>I would definitely purchase this product again considering I got about twice as much product as I had with BioSilk Silk Therapy shampoo &amp; conditioner, for the same price</li>
            <li>Have used this exact line for many years - works extremely well with my thick, course, highlighted platinum blonde hair.</li>
            <li>I went 8 months without a hair cut and barely had any split ends!</li>
            <li>This restores shine to my hair like no other shampoo/conditioner has.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m always surrounded by humidity and my hair barely frizzed!</li>
            <li>My stylist even noticed my hair seemed to be in better shape than usual!!</li>
            <li>Second, it leaves my hair SO SOFT.</li>
            <li>TIGI&#x27;s Urban antidotes offers 3 levels of hair rescuing combos like this.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and shiny and helps my highlights last.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve colored my hair for years and recently fried it completely after perming it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a natural blonde</li>
            <li>My hair (at the time, i recently cut off 14 inches and donated it) was so soft, and silky.</li>
            <li>I have always liked the Bed Head line of products; however, this particular shampoo and conditioner makes my hair dry, brittle and difficult to comb through.  </li>
            <li>I would like to point out to the customers who say this combo is leaving any kind of residue on their hair, its probably the wrong level product for you.</li>
            <li>Neither product weighs it down or seemed to heavy, despite being their most moisturizing combos in their spectrum.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it, I showered in our finished basement and my mom came down to do laundry an hour after my shower</li>
            <li>Packaging was more than I expected, well done brand names for less!!</li>
            <li>Bad me!&lt;br /&gt;Since using this the few problem pieces of hair that were becoming the texture of cotton candy are noticeably healthier; they feel and look much better!</li>
            <li>Totally thrilled, and would recommend it to anyone as crazy as myself who needs a serious hair intervention. :)</li>
            <li>My hair was a bit dry and breaking from the chlorine in the city water where I live now, and I color it every three months as well.  </li>
            <li>Next time a stylist insists on a complete process in one sitting, I will spend the extra money and tell her to take her time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>However if your hair is not completely dry, frizzy, or chemically damaged I would avoid this and try &amp;#34;moisture manic&amp;#34; by bed head.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s overall OK , not great.</li>
            <li>This set cleans your hair but does not dry it out.</li>
            <li>It does not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li>Does not leave your hair dry, flaky, a little goes a long way &amp; washes out easily.</li>
            <li>Comes to find out that it was extremely well packed in bubble wrap with secure with heavy duty tape around the spouts to ensure no leaks happen.</li>
            <li>I leave the conditioner in for at least 3 minutes then rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li>They are still dry and frizzy from coloring over two months ago (professionally done) and winter weather.</li>
            <li>It was definitely worth a try though, not a complete waste.</li>
            <li>You can still find Moisture Maniac and Self Absorbed online, but at a higher price than the Urban Antidotes line, unfortunately.</li>
            <li>Everyone is always asking what my secret is, to having such long, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>It smells fantastic and has given my dry, thick, wavy hair a make over.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other very expensive brands and they have not been great at all.  </li>
            <li>I have fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li>I have EXTREMELY thick, dry, coarse hair, exacerbated by using cheap Herbal Essences shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner is very heavy, but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>

            <li> Smells great, and makes your hair smooth.</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Also it smells so amazing.</li>
            <li> The conditioner doesn&#x27;t quite smell as nice as the shampoo</li>
            <li> I love TIGI products, they smell great and keep my hair looking healthy.</li>
            <li> Tigi Bed Head Resurrection is the absolute best I have ever used!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> It smells really nice.</li>
            <li> It conditions nicely.  </li>
            <li> so that is really nice too.</li>
            <li> Came in on time and was packaged nicely.</li>
            <li> but the smell is kind of funky cherry.  </li>
            <li> It smells great, nice and light and does not cause my color to fade at all.</li>
            <li> Told me she really liked the&lt;br /&gt;way</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t &amp;#34;Resurrect&amp;#34; anything, it will just do more harm than good.</li>
            <li> The smell lasts on the hair, which is nice.</li>
            <li> It has a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> I keeps my hair looking nice.</li>
            <li> I absolute love my shampoo conditioner!!!!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner to use at the salon, it smells so good, everyone asks what it is.</li>
            <li> It is the absolute best!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> i really liked the scent of this shampoo i have use it a couple of time</li>
            <li> ok but not as good as fekkai shampoo and conditiones.</li>
            <li> the conditioner in this particular line worked WONDERFUL on my hair.</li>
            <li> Love love this product smells good</li>
            <li> the scent is very strong.</li>
            <li> Comes with pumps, so very easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Love it! :)</li>
            <li> smells good, cleans fine,</li>
            <li> I can tell right away the difference!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very excited to use it again and see a greater improvement on the look and feel of my hair!</li>
            <li> My daughter has super think hair for a 4 year old &amp; this is the best thing I&#x27;ve used on her hair to help with tangles &amp; static control!!</li>
            <li> I notified Amazon, and I was able to get a refund on this product which is amazing.</li>
            <li> My hair smells wonderful and is so soft after using this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> and it made my hair so soft and smells great!!!</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and so flawless!</li>
            <li> I started using this with a weekly condition treatment and my hair is so soft and awesome.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling shampoo/conditioner I have ever used and it makes my hair silky soft.</li>
            <li> The shampoo lathered wonderfully and the conditioner was very creamy and made it easy to untangle my hair in the shower.</li>
            <li> stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had very fine hair</li>
            <li> I really experienced great results in short time.</li>
            <li> The smell of this one is strong (candy smell), it&#x27;s not bad and it lingers which is great.</li>
            <li> so I came on here and bought me some lol who doesn&#x27;t want silky soft sexy hair that smells so good that you might need a bodyguard</li>
            <li> It smells good and my hair looks shiny and full.  </li>
            <li> I bought this because it had good (and true) reviews and was $20 (better than you can get it in a salon during a sale- trust me).</li>
            <li> but if you don&#x27;t have that I&#x27;m sure it will work fine!</li>
            <li> and i am also a huge fan of the pump!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s lessening that more and more.</li>
            <li> I feel eventually I won&#x27;t have any more issues with it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I assure you that using that  will be waaaay more effective.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I bleach my roots almost every month and straighten my hair every two days and while using this shampoo, the damage has not increased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have refused to cut it because I love the length and don&#x27;t have the strength to part with it</li>
            <li> I have never been more impressed with shampoo and conditioner in my entire life!</li>
            <li> It makes it so much more manegable</li>
            <li> Would suggest they pack the boxes with more padding to prevent this from happening.</li>
            <li> Resurrection is now my favorite bed head out of them all ...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been really pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Not only does my hair smell wonderful</li>

            <li> It sure does make a difference.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay...</li>

            <li> We love this product.</li>
            <li> Im in love with this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I could have saved $$ and stuck to dove shampoo and my hair would have been in a better condition.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Starting off the price is</li>
            <li> I love Bed Head products.  </li>

            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner set..</li>
            <li> I used to love Pureology but just can&#x27;t afford it.  </li>
            <li> :3</li>
            <li> I bought this Bed Head shampoo and conditioner at the recommendation of the girl who cuts my hair, and all I can say is that I have been extremely pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> so I just make  sure to keep it about an inch away</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and really love the price I get them for.</li>
            <li> and it has more of a shine or glow to it than it used to.</li>
            <li> The price on here was also better than I could find in stores</li>
            <li> The conditioner also had a more chemical smell to it.</li>
            <li> Love the product, however packaging was a problem.  </li>
            <li> It repairs my hair better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> &#x3D;)</li>

            <li> and so glad I did.</li>
            <li> I like the Tigi Bed Head Level 2 much better for my hair type (finer hair, but a lot of it).  </li>
            <li> This product works wonders and is way better.</li>
            <li> I gave the rest to my mother and she loves it! :)</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Even better than the level two set.</li>
            <li> and I like the Level 2 RECOVERY set much better since it leaves my hair more weightless.</li>
            <li> Love the product!&lt;br</li>
            <li> its much more softer  and smoother</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair healthy and shiny</li>
            <li> ( I guess I don&#x27;t leave my hair a chance to get better :))</li>
            <li> my review helped! :)</li>
            <li> It feels softer, stronger and looks really healthy too.</li>
            <li> This duo leaves my hair feeling light and silky!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve been in love ever since.</li>
            <li> and I love the smell.</li>
            <li> so I need all the help I can get and this worked so much better</li>
            <li> I love the scent and it lasted me about 3 months</li>
            <li> I would stick with the Blue Recovery brand as it smells SOOOOOOOOO AWESOME!!!!</li>
            <li> I use mostly Bed Head hair products.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  </li>
            <li> but you get more than you pay for</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this to me after I thought I had damaged my hair from a summer of enjoying the pool.  </li>
            <li> I love the conditioner.</li>
            <li> After just one use, I can tell my hair feels much better.</li>

            <li> It is perfect for constant tangle problems.</li>
            <li> Well, I love them.</li>
            <li> For years, I have been using Matrix Sleek Look (which I still love), but was looking for another brand to try.</li>
            <li> I love BedHead, so to get this set</li>
            <li> Love this product.</li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> But received and conditioner top had came off and a lot of the conditioner had leaked out</li>
            <li> The S &amp; C seems more watery than before, the formulas used to be more concentrated.  </li>
            <li> It made my hair look better.</li>
            <li> looks healthy despite having been bleached.</li>

            <li> It smells great and leaves my hair feeling very soft, however both bottles are damaged.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner for people with dry hair!</li>
            <li> For damaged or very dry hair the Tigi collection is excellent to rebuild strength in your hair.</li>
            <li> This product works very good and definitely helps your hair.</li>
            <li> I give this a high rating because it smells great, works great, and the conditioner does help make hair feel soft and smooth.</li>

            <li> smells great and keeps my hair soft</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner combo smells really good, but for some reason made my scalp very itchy.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good packaging.  </li>
            <li> need to use a whole lot for a good wash.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes it feel soft and silky again, and the apple scent is very nice too.</li>
            <li> It reminds me of cotton candy, which is unique for a shampoo, since most tend to just smell like flowers or something.</li>
            <li> True story!</li>
            <li> Keeps my hair from frizzing up everywhere, looking shiny, and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Overall an excellent product and worth the price.</li>
            <li> Easy to manage.</li>
            <li> so it gets damaged easily.</li>
            <li> great!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair silky and easy to brush and manage</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to use it again and get my hair smooth, tangle free, shiny and healthy.</li>
            <li> First, it smells AMAZING.</li>
            <li> I tried this product, which smells amazing by the way, and literally just after the first use my husband and my coworkers commented on how shiny my hair looked.  </li>
            <li> The first day I used this four of my coworkers noticed and commented on how nice my hair looked.</li>
            <li> I love the sweet smell and</li>
            <li> Not my favorite of the Bed Head line, but not bad.</li>
            <li> Great product rinse clean and keeps hair soft</li>
            <li> :)  Very fast shipping :)</li>
            <li> I have a lot of fine hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it.</li>
            <li> The product seems to work fine despite the smell, but I am now on the fence about purchasing shampoo and conditioner online again.</li>
            <li> When I switched back, my hair felt wonderful from the first wash.</li>
            <li> love the product and how quick is was shipped to me.</li>
            <li> and I am very happy with &amp;#34;resurrection&amp;#34; A great deal lasts almost 2 months and my hair goes down to the lower of my back...</li>
            <li> It smelled awesome (like a combo of sweet tarts and mango), and always left my hair very silky and healthy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE it and have noticed my hair feeling so much healthier already!!</li>
            <li> I notice I huge difference on the days</li>
            <li> , I noticed a huge difference.  </li>
            <li> I got some tips at the salon and online and one that stood out was get a sulfate free shampoo.</li>
            <li> I had to giggle at this point as her &amp;#34;pet head&amp;#34; by tigi shampoo was indeed sulfate free.</li>
            <li> Overall great product.</li>
            <li> It smells like nail polish remover or cheap hand sanitizer (with a rotten fruit scent to it).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m constantly having to cut it to keep the style and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair smooth and revived/resurrected.  </li>
            <li> My hair is much soft and bright now.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and my hair is extremely soft, has more body to it and is a lot stronger more healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> My hair was silky smooth.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is great to put in and leave in for 10-15 minutes if you need a deep conditioning.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> which I enjoy, even though I am not a girly girl.</li>
            <li> Overall I would say this is a great shampoo and conditioner set if your hair has been fried by heat styling tools, chemicals, or is</li>
            <li> It smells AMAZING and really makes your hair shine.</li>
            <li> This one is great for hair that needs extra moisture.</li>
            <li> I was really happy with the product because of the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price, did what it said :-)</li>
            <li> my hair just smells FANTASTIC.</li>
            <li> Great price for the same product.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the smell, I just hope the conditioner will start to actually smooth my ends.</li>
            <li> My hair has very little fallout now, is so easy to comb, and styles beautifully!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very worth it if you lighten your hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sulfate free, but it still lathers decently which is nice.</li>
            <li> It is super easy to brush out my hair after washing.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, works decently.</li>
            <li> I was talking to my grand daughter about needing some good shampoo for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> Worth it!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a unique, tropical smell that I adore.</li>
            <li> Its worth it if your are feeling discouraged!</li>
            <li> After the first wash, my hair was noticeably softer and more manageable.  </li>
            <li> First off let me start on how much I love the scent.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried the first couple of times I used it because my hair was frizzy and didn&#x27;t feel that great, but I kept using it and after the 3rd time of using it, my hair started to feel awesome.</li>
            <li> Fast and easy delivery as well!</li>
            <li> Love this set and how soft and smooth it makes my hair!</li>
            <li> AND HONESTLY, FOR THE SAME PRICE, ID RATHER IT SMELL BETTER.</li>
            <li> they smell fantastic and really have made my hair so much better.</li>
            <li> great shampoo for dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> Bought product on Amazon as it was less than at salon, love Love LOVE the results!</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> So far I love this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I just tried it and my hair was silky smooth, shiny, easy to manage for the first time in my life</li>
            <li> Great product for dry, damaged hair!</li>
            <li> this is great for keeping your hair from breaking and being dry!  </li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and brittle and this shampoo and conditioner made my hair look great.</li>
            <li> this stuff smells amazing and my hair is so soft and shiny</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner for my thick wavy hair out there.</li>
            <li> They both smell like strawberries, which is ok, but the shampoo and conditioner are very watery.  </li>
            <li> Love it really does resurrect your hair.</li>
            <li> If it was actually tigi it would have been good, however, proconcepts shipped something else.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this brand since I went blond last summer.</li>
            <li> Makes my hair nice and soft.</li>
            <li> Smells good, my hair feels softer already after only one wash</li>
            <li> Please make sure that you order from Amazon or get an order that is fulfilled by Amazon because then you KNOW you are getting the real deal.</li>
            <li> Way to sweet for me.  </li>
            <li> but product is good enough to overlook the scent.</li>
            <li> and i continue to use it because i love it that much.</li>
            <li> so they mostly use products that really work.</li>
            <li> Based on the way it makes my hair feel, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s true.</li>
            <li> I know she is going to love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> After 6 months of continued use I consistently only have good hair days.</li>
            <li> Surprisingly, I LOVE this; it really works for</li>
            <li> It has the yummy, sweet fruity/candy smell you&#x27;d anticipate from Tigi and doesn&#x27;t leave any film or cause greasiness, which is often a problem I experience with moisturizing/hydrating/repairing products.</li>
            <li> It could of been a fluke, but when I got my package, the bag that it came in was full of shampoo.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not bad either.  </li>
            <li> I will never change for other products because they are really efficient and my hair are smooth and smells very good.</li>
            <li> Not only does it smell great (which is good for my sensitive sinuses), but it conditions my hair well and leaves it feeling very soft.</li>
            <li> I assumed it was because the product just wasn&#x27;t the right fit for my hair.</li>
            <li> I use two pumps of each on my middle of the back length hair and it is the perfect amount.</li>
            <li> The shampoo does have a mild form of sulfate, so beware if you have a keratin treatment or color-treated hair.</li>
            <li> These arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for two washes and already it is soft, smooth and tangle free!</li>
            <li> Came fast, smelled good, made my hair super soft and glossy.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this my hair gets super tangly.</li>
            <li> It smells great and has left my hair feeling much softer after just a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> I have liked other bed head products better.</li>
            <li> with this conditioner it detangles my hair easy without  using a large amount....</li>
            <li> Realizing that it was liking quite dry &amp; lifeless, I started shopping for something that got good reviews to help.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> this product (shampoo &amp; conditioner) has really saved me!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo I has tried so far!</li>
            <li> After using this set the Tigi Resurrection left my hair very soft and smelling great.  </li>
            <li> For fine hair that has been bleached, the shampoo and conditioner are very moisturizing</li>
            <li> I wish the conditioner felt a little more moisturizing in the shower as I have to apply an extra pump to get it worked through the ends, but it&#x27;s very light weight as smells good.</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> but I have to say, after a few weeks of using it my hair feels great</li>
            <li> It smells amazing ( almost like berries) which we both love, and it left her hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Ive been using this for about a few weeks now every day and my hair feels great.</li>
            <li> but I just had to laugh and check a bottle in the my cupboard....</li>
            <li> You only smell the shampoo which smells fruity and nice.</li>
            <li> This shampoo can make the most damaged hair soft.</li>
            <li> I Love how silky soft it makes my hair..  </li>
            <li> Honestly it is the only thing I will ever use.</li>
            <li> it also makes my hair much more manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> I love how soft it makes my hair</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, and healthy because of this.</li>
            <li> After 1-2 weeks, my hair completely changed for the better.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> She was delighted and very satisfied.would definitely continue purchasing.</li>
            <li> and i will say i loved how it felt wet and</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner so far.  </li>
            <li> And after using both products for the first time, my hair was super soft and had BODY to it again - I was able to style it for the first time in almost a week!</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products and I was so glad to find it at such a decent price.</li>
            <li> I got it today and washed my hair immediately and had high expectation because of all the good reviews I read prior to purchasing this product.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t argue with results right?</li>
            <li> I tried this product because the price was right.  </li>
            <li> and she is right</li>
            <li> She mentioned that people tend to shampoo and wash it right out, which doesnt help the hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;-Dont</li>
            <li> I normally purchase in store, but Amazon was such a good deal.</li>
            <li> I really do like the scent, but i wish it were more lasting and strong.</li>
            <li> it fades pretty quickly, and that the conitioner is too strong to use near my scalp</li>
            <li> It left my hair nice, soft and frizz free.  </li>
            <li> , I have long naturally straight blonde hair, I used the kind in the blue bottle I loved it!</li>
            <li> Easy enough to clean up</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and easy to comb after using the conditioner.  </li>
            <li> It feels strong again to the point of being almost like my natural hair.</li>
            <li> Next to my beloved L&#x27;anza shampoos/conditioners, this one has become an unexpected favourite.</li>
            <li> These have a convenient little squirt top that keeps you from using too much and it has a strong smell (like girl!)</li>
            <li> The smell was a bit disconcerting the first time I used it, but it makes my hair unbelievably soft and easy to manage.  </li>
            <li> The smell is very intense.</li>
            <li> That I had it lifted to a very light blonde!!</li>
            <li> Came home to realize the product was very very very expired - and the reason for my hairs yucky feel was in fact because Amazon had sold me an expired</li>
            <li> , however I expected my hair to stay in better condition/not so dry since my stylist told me these were best to use after coloring to keep my hair from being dry and to hold the color.</li>
            <li> I now absolutely LOVE the color but initially, I was embarrassed because of the damage.</li>
            <li> When I first received it, the shampoo and conditioner both smelled like strawberries, but about two weeks in, the conditioner started to smell funny.</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised.</li>
            <li> , I can run my fingers through it...without having to brush it first</li>
            <li> Finally, my hair is silky, shiny, and so much more manageable.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> Never rinse with hot water.</li>
            <li> Have been fan since first time  </li>
            <li> Have been using them for several years now  : )</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is very nourishing!</li>
            <li> this shampoo does exactly what it says it will.</li>
            <li> Really yucky stuff!</li>
            <li> First of all, it smells like candy; I could smell it before I had even taken the plastic off of it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for 6 months now</li>
            <li> You get exactly what you pay for and it does what it says.</li>
            <li> leaves hair silky and shiny :) .. I believe this is the fourth time that I&#x27;ve bought them.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping!  </li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner does exactly what It says.</li>
            <li> It keeps it healthy and keeps my fragile ends from splitting therefore, my hair looks longer and healthier.</li>
            <li> My hair might have been pretty when it was made up and curled</li>
            <li> and I probably won&#x27;t need to buy more until next month!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching and coloring my hair for a decade, and this is the only shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve tried that makes it feel healthy and manageable again.</li>
            <li> Now I look like an after ;)</li>
            <li> do i looked here sure enough here</li>
            <li> Within the first use, my hair was restored to youthful, bouncy, silky hair.</li>
            <li> I noticed the change the first i used it</li>
            <li> I read reviews they were pretty even on the likes and dislikes,  </li>
            <li> I think I am more in the middle.  </li>
            <li> Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it leaves a build up on scalp if used too many days on a row</li>
            <li> I am extremely pleased with this shampoo/conditioner, especially since I thought I might have to cut my hair.</li>
            <li> this shampoo and conditioner is always consistent never had any issues out of it.</li>
            <li> I have finally found another shampoo/conditioner that I absolutely love.</li>
            <li> I was worried I&#x27;d have to go shorter soon, but I won&#x27;t have to get more than a trim next time thanks to Resurrection!</li>
            <li> Her hair looks and feels so much healthier!</li>
            <li> so many different things and nothing seems to work.</li>
            <li> Also, I have naturally semi wavy-semi straight, baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> Hair feels, clean, soft and managable.</li>
            <li> The Bed Head Level 2 (blue bottles) really moisturized my hair much better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many, and I mean many, shampoos on the market.</li>
            <li> It has made my hair super soft after 3 uses!</li>
            <li> She was positive it was either expired or a knock-off product.</li>
            <li> I will never buy hair products online unless I&#x27;m 100% positive they are licensed retailers.  </li>
            <li> (I really couldn&#x27;t do this before, the split ends tend to make my hair pretty gnarly and tangled.)</li>
            <li> Exactly as the picture and the quality is really good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> If you liked Self Absorbed, then the equivalent replacement would be Urban Antidotes Recovery (blue bottle).</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my dry hair soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li> I love the way it smells and it helps my hair which is really dry.</li>
            <li> my hair became super soft after each shower and stayed that way no matter in what weather.</li>
            <li> It smells like candy and leaves my hair super soft.</li>
            <li> Smells great, no more tangles, and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> but eventually I realized my hair smelled funny after it was dried, kind of like a burnt..smell</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
            <li> so I had to use strong and a lot of bleach to lift the color of my entire head to a light brown/bright blonde color).</li>
            <li> clean and light moisturizer that leaves hair noticeably healthy-looking, shiny, and doesn&#x27;t feel weighted down even after sleeping on it.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t really transfer to your hair.</li>
            <li> Shampoo and Conditioner really made my scalp breakout with bumps and became very irritated-</li>
            <li> Did not like it at all - Very Chemical</li>
            <li> It is still noticeably damaged but not as much as without.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my hair type.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need to use much of it.  </li>
            <li> My hair is so much shinier &amp; smoother than its ever been.</li>
            <li> This product works well, and is very moisturizing for the hair.</li>
            <li> My hair grows really fast with this.</li>
            <li> Smells absolutely devine of pomegranate.</li>
            <li> A real Resurrection of chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> this product and thanks Bed Head for making such an amazing shampoo and conditioner that brought my hair back to life.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;N</li>
            <li> I have sun-damaged hair and this does very well to restore strength and body.</li>
            <li> However, this does not moisturize my hair as much as Moisture Maniac.</li>
            <li> AND I am very picky about my shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s light on your hair, especially for us fine-hair people.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> I am really please with the product.  </li>
            <li> your hair looks really nice!&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have really picky hair.</li>
            <li> I have a really picky scalp that hates &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo like Garnier, or Pantine.</li>
            <li> this product works well and was shipped fast.</li>
            <li> definitely received the genuine product.</li>
            <li> I have straight medium length hair</li>
            <li> Bummer I have so much of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Received fast from seller.  </li>
            <li> And it really made a difference.</li>
            <li> At Ulta you will pay this much for just one bottle of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It really does wonders for me together.</li>
            <li> much worse.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t have the whole :</li>
            <li> My hair stylist of 4 years saw me go through the whole &amp;#34;dying-puffy-no-moisture-falling</li>
            <li> I think it was because the whole shipping/processing fee, ehhhh</li>
            <li> I have so much frizz</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair/ highlighted, and she straightens it.  </li>
            <li> Product as described and VERY affordable price.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner leaves my hair really silky, too.</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> This works really well on my overly processed hair.</li>
            <li> I was very displeased..</li>
            <li> I really like this product.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t really have any complaints</li>
            <li> I have done so much to my hair</li>
            <li> So I use developer and the dye--the whole enchilada.</li>
            <li> My hair gets a workout &amp; this really seems to make a difference.</li>
            <li> I absolutely give the credit it to this shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel very waxy.  </li>
            <li> Makes hair silky smooth but didn&#x27;t notice extra volume.</li>
            <li> Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I actually really really do.</li>
            <li> I really recommend it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d probably give them another shot just because I like the product so much.</li>
            <li> I have had a few people at work or even in crowded bars ask what kind of shampoo I use because it smells</li>
            <li> However, the smell is just blah and more chemically (not awful, but not great.</li>
            <li> and it dried out nicely.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair and this did nothing for it except weigh it down and make it super oily and dull.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  </li>
            <li> I have very fine hair that has to be washed every day, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and keeps it moisturized.</li>
            <li> Normally, I do not like Tigi products - sure, they have uber cute packaging and smell fantastic, but they typically just don&#x27;t perform well enough to be a go-to for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I love these liter sizes, because they last months (even for long hair) and are a better value than the regular bottle sizes.</li>
            <li> amazing on my over processed bleach blonde hair, makes it smooth and soft without weighing it down</li>
            <li> I feel like this shampoo is gentle enough but also gets my hair clean without leaving it feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and wear it long and straight.</li>
            <li> It smelled relatively the same, but it was VERY strong compared to the store product which made it burn my nose a bit.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know if I would say it is that much better than all of the other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, but it does make my hair soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> i think i will eep using it a little more and see if it rescues my fantasy color hair, but the first impression so far is just a little better than ok, i think the john frieda shampoos are same as this one</li>
            <li> I have wavey/curly hair that can get frizzy and dry easily.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo we have found that helps the dandruff and keeps her hair looking shining and clean.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is not as soft like many other conditioners, but it adds enough softness to the hair making combing easy -</li>
            <li> so I do needto pump it a good 2-3 times, but when I did have short hair, it was like a pump and a half??</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use this product tonight when I wash my hair; came fully packaged and wrapped up really good; a little leakage, but only a small amount, not enough to fuss about; smells great</li>
            <li> I have bleached curly hair, so I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to products that might be drying, and this isn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> Pretty surprised.</li>
            <li> It smells great, but I think it should be used more for a person who wants that dramatic hairstyle everyday.  </li>
            <li> I live by the beach, so the wind murders it every day of my life!</li>
            <li> I have a combination of dry/oily 3A curly hair (oily on the scalp and dry at the ends) and I can tell that it&#x27;s going to make a huge difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> Love the brand, will try a different bead head shampoo the next time.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo I have tried that actually made a noticeable difference the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li> My niece wanted some for Christmas and the local salon was out of it, so luckily found it online here and ordered it.</li>
            <li> Now, TIGI Head Resurrection is my main go-to for hair product.</li>
            <li> It works really good on my super way dry chemically treated thick hair.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> so I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and bought this, with high hopes and fingers crossed.</li>
            <li> There is another product that I highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly suggest this set.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.  </li>
            <li> When I say significant, I mean I lost a good inch off of my ends due to breakage, and what hair I managed to salvage was gummy and was snapping like rubber bands.</li>
            <li> But in an attempt to change it back to my natural colour once and for all, I incurred some significant damage.</li>
            <li> was working overseas in Korea for the past 4-5 years, and most of the Korean hair salons are very high end.</li>
            <li> It has made a major difference in the health of my hair!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair is soft and shiny again, and feels and looks much healthier.</li>
            <li> I know this shampoo is expensive, but it works great.</li>
            <li> Normally.  </li>
            <li> Finally, a shampoo and conditioner that is definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> I love this set because it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my hair</li>
            <li> Great for my thick curly dry hair</li>
            <li> I use a blow dryer and flat iron on my hair, but I have to say after using this shampoo and conditioner daily my hair is healthy and soft.</li>
            <li> The products weigh my hair down and the smell is just TOO strong.</li>
            <li> My hair is totally white and sometimes or rather very dry this shampoo adds body, oil and love the aroma</li>
            <li> I switched for a little over a month to a different brand my friend wanted me to try, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel as amazing as this one did.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it is a little more watery than what I am used to with Sleek Look, but that isn&#x27;t really a problem and just means that I leave a little more conditioner on my hair.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new, quality shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s like I have new hair.  </li>
            <li> I live in Florida</li>
            <li> My hair feels like new.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have severely damaged hair, I just live in a super dry climate that beats the hell out of my hair and skin.</li>
            <li> it also came a day earlier than the expected shipped date; thats why it deserves 5 stars &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> Fantastic product...now me and my 2 daughters use this...and I was paying the same amount for much smaller bottles!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I only gave it 4/5 stars because I have used Sebastian Drench in the past and liked that a little bit better.</li>
            <li> HIGHLY recommend Clear Shampoo over this product</li>
            <li> They leave it feeling very soft, probably softer than its ever been</li>
            <li> , conditioner combo makes hair very soft &amp; shiny.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wash my hair with sulfate shampoos but this is my favorite duo.</li>
            <li> I did not notice a difference for about three washes, but after that, WOW!</li>
            <li> My husband, my siblings, even my cousin who is a professional hair dresser kept grabbing it and saying &amp;#34;wow!</li>
            <li> I have used many various shampoos and conditioners from several different brands.</li>
            <li> My hair is shoulder length, fine and slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and it leaves them soft and smelling all fruity!</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it smells a little sweet for my tastes luckily</li>
            <li> , It is a little strong in the shower, but once your hair dries it has a softer sent that lasts</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t going to hold my breath, have tried a whole bunch of \\&quot;nice\\&quot; shampoos in the past and they&#x27;ve been fine</li>
            <li> The size of the bottle was huge and the price was much less than at retail stores.</li>
            <li> The seller was great- super fast shipping, but the product (Tigi&#x27;s fault) was pretty awful.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, but fairly damaged long hair.  </li>
            <li> This product is just what my hair needed, the Dumb Blonde was great but Resurrection is just the WHOLE package for my long hair.</li>
            <li> but the conditioner was too heavy for my fine hair.</li>
            <li> Not too heavy on fine hair.</li>
            <li> Your hair is so healthy, it&#x27;s actually hard to style!&amp;#34;, my hairstylist says.  </li>
            <li> If you put too much conditioner near your scalp of course you will somewhat oily hair the next day.</li>
            <li> After using the shampoo and conditioner just once, my hair screaming at me thank you!!!!It was soft and curly again and my ends looked refreshed..</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner have made my hair so soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going with pureology nanoworks because I sampled the stuff ONCE during the time I was using this Tigi product and the pureology fixed (with ONE time of trying it)</li>
            <li> Even my not-so-observant boyfriend commented that my hair feels really soft.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;d helped my bleach my blonde roots the day before and not knowing much about girls hair asked \\&quot;Is</li>
            <li> When speaking with my stylist she commented that my hair felt very sticky, and felt as though I had enormous product &amp;#34;build up.&amp;#34; I told her I was using Bed Head - and she asked me if I had bought it in a salon, or at a discount retailer.</li>
            <li> Extremely soft, shiny and no frizz.  </li>
            <li> Only problem I notice is your cant use it to much cause it drys out your scalp.</li>
            <li> Despite many of the negative reviews I decided to give this stuff a try.  </li>
            <li> I used!My hair is soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> It was soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> Keeps my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not heavy in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Makes my hair soft and brings out my natural curls.</li>
            <li> I had some pumps from my old ones...</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Resurrection is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have naturally wavy hair</li>
            <li> I also have a bit of natural wave to my hair, and it&#x27;s on the dryer side.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair feel soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair...</li>
            <li> After spending hundreds of dollars on hair products that don&#x27;t work i have finally found something that really has repaired my hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really sensitive to smell and dont even want to use shampoos that dont have any scent to it....</li>
            <li> Leaves your hair feeling soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> I tried their green bottle Re-energize (only because my local discount salon had a great sale, and it&#x27;s the only one they had), and it wasn&#x27;t nearly moisturizing enough.</li>
            <li> (I have naturally curly, highlighted hair.)</li>
            <li> how soft my hair is when it dries.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel soft and shiny without looking greasy.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft.</li>
            <li> I dye my hair frequently and completely bleach it 2-3 times a year.  </li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t believe how soft it feels.  </li>
            <li> wow.</li>
            <li> Normally it is thick and a more cream color.  </li>
            <li> I mean, everyone was commenting on how healthy my hair looked.</li>
            <li> But it seems to be back to normal!</li>
            <li> Took the product a little longer to arrive than I expected, but I LOVE the product and the price is pretty similar to what I pay in my salon.</li>
            <li> Leaves my hair pretty dry.</li>
            <li> and I still have a half a bottle full of each.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different shampoo and conditioners and this one really does what it claims to do!</li>
            <li> It coats your hair and makes it feel pretty waxy which lasts for several days afterwards even after washing with a different shampoo.</li>
            <li> you are willing to risk it and buy the product I would definitely only use it once a week or so and use a different shampoo in between each use to avoid a major waxy buildup.</li>
            <li> This really weighed my hair down and my curls just didn&#x27;t sit right after using it, they became stringy and flat.</li>
            <li> Although I don&#x27;t care for the smell, it makes my very curly, coarse, and colored hair so soft that I would definitely buy over and over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos, and besides the super expensive 25 dollar a bottle ones, this one works so well!</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting much until I started seeing my hair dry</li>
            <li> I would definitely purchase this product again considering I got about twice as much product as I had with BioSilk Silk Therapy shampoo &amp; conditioner, for the same price</li>
            <li> Have used this exact line for many years - works extremely well with my thick, course, highlighted platinum blonde hair.</li>
            <li> I went 8 months without a hair cut and barely had any split ends!</li>
            <li> This restores shine to my hair like no other shampoo/conditioner has.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m always surrounded by humidity and my hair barely frizzed!</li>
            <li> My stylist even noticed my hair seemed to be in better shape than usual!!</li>
            <li> Second, it leaves my hair SO SOFT.</li>
            <li> TIGI&#x27;s Urban antidotes offers 3 levels of hair rescuing combos like this.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and shiny and helps my highlights last.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve colored my hair for years and recently fried it completely after perming it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde</li>
            <li> My hair (at the time, i recently cut off 14 inches and donated it) was so soft, and silky.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Bed Head line of products; however, this particular shampoo and conditioner makes my hair dry, brittle and difficult to comb through.  </li>
            <li> I would like to point out to the customers who say this combo is leaving any kind of residue on their hair, its probably the wrong level product for you.</li>
            <li> Neither product weighs it down or seemed to heavy, despite being their most moisturizing combos in their spectrum.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I showered in our finished basement and my mom came down to do laundry an hour after my shower</li>
            <li> Packaging was more than I expected, well done brand names for less!!</li>
            <li> Bad me!&lt;br /&gt;Since using this the few problem pieces of hair that were becoming the texture of cotton candy are noticeably healthier; they feel and look much better!</li>
            <li> Totally thrilled, and would recommend it to anyone as crazy as myself who needs a serious hair intervention. :)</li>
            <li> My hair was a bit dry and breaking from the chlorine in the city water where I live now, and I color it every three months as well.  </li>
            <li> Next time a stylist insists on a complete process in one sitting, I will spend the extra money and tell her to take her time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> However if your hair is not completely dry, frizzy, or chemically damaged I would avoid this and try &amp;#34;moisture manic&amp;#34; by bed head.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s overall OK , not great.</li>
            <li> This set cleans your hair but does not dry it out.</li>
            <li> It does not dry out my hair.</li>
            <li> Does not leave your hair dry, flaky, a little goes a long way &amp; washes out easily.</li>
            <li> Comes to find out that it was extremely well packed in bubble wrap with secure with heavy duty tape around the spouts to ensure no leaks happen.</li>
            <li> I leave the conditioner in for at least 3 minutes then rinse with cool water.</li>
            <li> They are still dry and frizzy from coloring over two months ago (professionally done) and winter weather.</li>
            <li> It was definitely worth a try though, not a complete waste.</li>
            <li> You can still find Moisture Maniac and Self Absorbed online, but at a higher price than the Urban Antidotes line, unfortunately.</li>
            <li> Everyone is always asking what my secret is, to having such long, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> It smells fantastic and has given my dry, thick, wavy hair a make over.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other very expensive brands and they have not been great at all.  </li>
            <li> I have fine thin hair.  </li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick, dry, coarse hair, exacerbated by using cheap Herbal Essences shampoos and conditioners.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner is very heavy, but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> I recently ombred my hair and at first my hair was a little dry, but didn&#x27;t have that fried-bleaching hair.</li>
            <li> , Fekkai is a winner for me, but this seemed to be a good inversion, not so much, also one of the bottles came open and there was a mess in the box, the pump doenst help, because of the movements on the shipping got spilled :(</li>
            <li> Just like the other reviews hair is soft not brittle</li>
            <li> I also flat iron my hair daily</li>
            <li> But it is very expensive at my local store so when I saw this deal I was very excited!</li>
            <li> I was really excited especially due to previous reviews.</li>
            <li> This leaves my hair a little damaged normally.  </li>
            <li> After missing a few appointments, I tried John Frieda&#x27;s Blonde spray to try and buy myself a few more weeks.</li>
            <li> A little bit of both goes a long way, so I won&#x27;t have to buy a new set anytime soon!</li>
            <li> :straight slick hair::</li>
            <li> A tiny bit of this stuff goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have long hair and this is the only shampoo and conditioner I can use on my hair.</li>
            <li> This should last a long time.</li>
            <li> I live in a climate where there is little to no humidity.</li>
            <li> I found I can get away with using this shampoo once every week or so, definitely not as my main shampoo and conditioner and definitely not back to back.</li>
            <li> This combination has made my hair so soft, without weighing down my curls.</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and in the middle of my back.</li>
            <li> I am a die hard fan of Brunette Goddess (the old formula) specially because of the smell (cookies), so it&#x27;s hard to beat it.  </li>
            <li> The only inconvenient is that my oily hair turns more oilier</li>
            <li> The problem is that it seems that the next wash without it my hair is going to become dry again.</li>
            <li> A week later it started to get tangled, brittle, and extremely dry to the point</li>
            <li> ; in a shampoo commercial because my hair was so dry and damaged.</li>
            <li> and it left my ends dry.</li>
            <li> I also color my hair occasionally, and swim almost daily (but don&#x27;t get my hair wet in the pool often).</li>
            <li> The bottle either came loose during shipping or it was never properly tightened.</li>
            <li> also have trouble with the fact that my hair gets greasy in less then 24 hours, and after having my first baby I had a lot of problems with hair loss.</li>
            <li> After dying and re-dying my hair for months on end, I amassed some pretty seriously damaged hair and plenty of split ends.</li>
            <li> After giving it to my husband who has thick, wavy hair and will truly use just about anything, he also stopped using it after a few weeks saying it made his hair super oily and flat.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Depending on how long this lasts the household and if I can keep getting it close to this price I will keep purchasing it.</li>
            <li> I wonder how the blue and green bed heads are if they work the same or differently?!?!?</li>
            <li> If i had known it would take this long</li>
            <li> the product tookk a long time to arrive.</li>
            <li> It left my hair looking oily and wet.</li>
            <li> It untangles my long tresses.  </li>
            <li> The bottles were much bigger than I expected, so I know I&#x27;ll be getting lots of use out of them.</li>
            <li> but it took to long to get here</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t say that I would recommend it for long term use.</li>
            <li> (I have long hair).</li>
            <li> condition does not say how long you should leave it on your hair.</li>
            <li> I definitely would not purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, but no thanks</li>
            <li> They have lasted for a long time.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is thick, but I didn&#x27;t really like the smell.</li>
            <li> When the product arrived, the shampoo lid was not completely on, so nearly half of the product was all over the place and was wasted.</li>
            <li> I had extremely damaged hair from a bleaching incident last year and have tried everything.  </li>
            <li> well buy again never going back to any other shampoo conditioner</li>
            <li> I have very long hair, just a couple inches from my butt.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is just what my thirsty dry hair needed.</li>
            <li> My frizzy dry hair is gone.</li>
            <li> After I blow dry my hair, it begins to appear greasy when I use these products.  </li>
            <li> My hair was extremely dry.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple years now, and it is my go-to shampoo and conditioner when my hair starts to feel dry.</li>
            <li> so it has always been dry feeling and a pain to deal with.</li>
            <li> have dry, dye, britle hair, split ends</li>
            <li> I used to use Redken and paul mitchel for my frizzy, damaged and dry hair.</li>
            <li> Recommended to anyone with dry and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair feel a bit like straw, but softens after you brush and blow dry.  </li>
            <li> Makes dry curly hair manageable</li>
            <li> Btw, I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair and it&#x27;s chemically treated.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> It has a little bit of damage, but has been pretty dull and dry.  </li>
            <li> It does keep my hair soft and managable, but it is dryer than usual.</li>
            <li> This shampoo breathes life into my completely dried hair making it soft, supple and shiny without the need for other products.</li>
            <li> Then after that, I stuck to red and the dye that I use has bleach in it as well because it is made specifically for dark hair.</li>
            <li> My hair had become straw like and brittle due to coloring and flat ironing.  </li>
            <li> After a long days work my hair is normally so wet</li>
            <li> I have pretty thin hair</li>
            <li> makes my long hair come to life!!</li>
            <li> Getting my hair cut definitely helped clear out some of the mess, but I still needed something to really bring my hair back to life and the shampoos and conditioners I had been using weren&#x27;t cutting it</li>
            <li> After moving to a dry area after living in a humid area for quite a few years, I noticed my usual product wasn&#x27;t working on my hair very well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to say that it restored my hair back to health because if I stopped using it, it goes back to looking dull and flat.</li>
            <li> Not only did this shampoo and conditioner restore some very dry hair, but it also calmed my scalp down which had been irritated by another shampoo (no names mentioned).</li>
            <li> Gives my hair so much life that it&#x27;s hard to straighten it sometimes!</li>
            <li> and I still have almost half the bottle left!</li>
            <li> Check out other pricing on other sites, it is double the price.</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair were FRIED and just after the second wash with this shampoo/conditioner, they look and feel less damaged and</li>
            <li> Resurrect your hair, but you have to understand that mean your hair has to be long dead for it to have a positive effect.</li>
            <li> It was getting very dry and brittle and seemed to be breaking or falling out.</li>
            <li> A comb will actually go thru my long thick coarse hair using this shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
            <li> You only have to use a little bit</li>
            <li> I have naturally red hair and decided to go a little bit lighter for the summer</li>
            <li> Made my highlight a little bit red, but does make your hair feel good.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but it did the job left a little residue but with my hair</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something a little different.  </li>
            <li> hair is thick, coarse, wavy and is naturally jet black, but coloured copper red every 6 weeks with 40 volume developer on the root and 20 on the ends; I never let it air dry and to make matters worse, I flat iron daily.</li>
            <li> This lasts a long time a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I bought this due to dry, frizzy, damaged hair...</li>
            <li> Even if you use this once a week and other shampoo and conditioner the rest of the week, this makes your scalp dry and flaky and itchy.</li>
            <li> Try this if you have dry hair due to colors and highlights.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair so soft and hardly any flyaways,</li>
            <li> well the bleach that we put in dried out my hair and made it very brittle, dull and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;Suffice</li>
            <li> Air dried out of the shower it is a frizzy mess; a beast, if you will that I must gently battle with to tame.</li>
            <li> have used Anti-Dote, Colour Goddess, Oatmeal and Honey and the even more expensive (at least in salon)</li>
            <li> Expected delivery date:</li>
            <li> Brings your hair back from the dead.</li>
            <li> Only a few weeks of using Resurrection.  </li>
            <li> or i would get in big trouble.  </li>
            <li> I  always seem to be missing my local liter sales for shampoo and conditioner</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times</li>
            <li> which made the bottle last for a few months!&lt;br /&gt;-Def. helps with colored hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;-Will</li>
            <li> Then I used the conditioner and used the Pro Wet brush and</li>
            <li> The color was not the same shiny white as the store purchase, it had an orange tint and wasn&#x27;t as thick.</li>
            <li> Be careful, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have bleached thick long hair and it was the only thing that used to keep it from feeling brittle or getting frizzy.</li>
            <li> If your hair isn&#x27;t on its last leg then try something a little less concentrated.</li>
            <li> Other products left my hair with a weird residue/heavy feeling, or completely stripped and dry.</li>
            <li> I was sad to find out that that line was canceled (including Self Absorbed, which was a step down moisturizing-wise).</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> then other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> anyway I has to Wash it every other day.</li>
            <li> amaizng bed head usually runs around 18 bucks for one bottle, but on amazon it&#x27;s only 23 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I washed my hair with it two days later and even with using a small amount</li>
            <li> I got this set in the hopes that it would help with my extremely frizzy, color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I ordered these after reading some of the other reviews.</li>
            <li> I also color my hair and the shampoo has not affected my hair color like other shampoos</li>
            <li> My hair is strange, if I don&#x27;t switch shampoos every so often, my hair becomes heavy and listless.  </li>
            <li> The color seems to stay sharp with this regimen too.</li>
            <li> I usually buy it from a big retail chain</li>
            <li> I feel like my hair is a little dry.</li>
            <li> price on this is actually quite a steal, typically you&#x27;ll pay that just for the shampoo in this size, maybe a little less at Target.</li>
            <li> I also noticed the same usual volume of TIGI, it doesn&#x27;t weight hair down.  </li>
            <li> I have very long hair &amp; of course we all know how hard it is to maintain long hair.</li>
            <li> About a year ago I bleached my hair all the way to platinum blonde within a week - bad idea - because I&#x27;m super impatient.</li>
            <li> It left my hair greasy and dull.</li>
            <li> Bad fit.</li>
            <li> It is sort of a fake cherry candy store smell and can be really overbearing.</li>
            <li> I have naturall dark hair.</li>
            <li> I also know that there are sometimes negative reviews on this, but everyone has different hair, and this works for me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that since TIGI changed their packaging, it seems they changed their formula too.</li>
            <li> I am white, my hair is thick and is prone to looking oily after one day.</li>
            <li> The products left my thick, wavy hair feeling waxy, flat and hard to brush.</li>
            <li> my hair is naturally curly, dry and is difficult to detangle.....</li>
            <li> and it does not weigh my hair down at all.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either.</li>
            <li> Well....it did not let me down.</li>
            <li> I bought the CATWALK brands and this beat them hands down.</li>
            <li> Does not require as much to wash hair unless really dirty and even then it is still not much compared to other products.</li>
            <li> A handful of times I have ran out over the past few years, and I have had to use something different for a few days.</li>
            <li> However, when I use it, my hair does feel slightly healthier.</li>
            <li> I shed less</li>
            <li> So i used this shampoo for about a week and a half</li>
            <li> I checked the bottle for an expiration date as someone in another shampoo review mentioned having received an expired product (previously it had never occurred to me that shampoo/conditioner could expire) but couldn&#x27;t find one.</li>
            <li> I have medium/fine hair with slight wave and this has eliminated my need for a heat protectant.</li>
            <li> (I have originally black hair</li>
            <li> I found it here for way less money.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;it even helps my frizz lay down a little</li>
            <li> I have really long, thick and wavy hair, which means I get tangles and frizz all of the time.</li>
            <li> I have been using cheaper products that made my hair feel dry and dull.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair really clean, only bad thing about that is my hair is really thin</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s frizzy and dry lately &amp; with just ONE wash &amp; condition</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that tends to dry out at the ends, while my scalp gets oily.</li>
            <li> I combine the conditioner with the dumb blonde reconstructor.  </li>
            <li> so I have a lot of little fly-a-ways now but mousse and hair spray help fix that.</li>
            <li> but I should have just asked for another set because that set was frozen after being left out in the snow storm and when it thawed out it felt very thick and the color was off</li>
            <li> A few notes to keep in mind for people on the fence:</li>
            <li> A few months ago I stumbled upon this shampoo</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair everyday</li>
            <li> waste of money</li>
            <li> It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> After using a few times I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> It will not make your hair feel as heavy or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> I read a few reviews saying they received an expired product, so</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait to see what the difference is in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my hair</li>
            <li> Terribly harsh shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian, I have thin hair</li>
            <li> The shampoo does have sulphates in it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s harsh at all.</li>
            <li> the way it felt when i blow dried it.</li>
            <li> I adore this shampoo on my poor hair that I have been dye-abusing for over ten years.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I have used this product everyday for a week and my hair does not seem to have improved.</li>
            <li> Waste.</li>
            <li> After MULTIPLE at-home bleachings and DIY hair colourings, my hair was extremely unhealthy..to say the very least!</li>
            <li> My hair had begun to feel like straw and look course, stiff and fuzzy no matter which conditioner I used.</li>
            <li> This shampoo helps tame my hair along with my styling products.</li>
            <li> The conditioner does doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any moisture and leaves my hair very dull and dry.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of conditioner because it kills the small amount of no volume that my hair has; but this doesnt kill it way too much.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner is supposed to fix hair that is dry, but from what my hair feels like, it made it worse.  </li>
            <li> : dry, unhealthy...</li>
            <li> It smells like candy and works wonders for hair that needs a little refreshment!</li>
            <li> can use just a little  and it will do the work!</li>
            <li> Then I found it on here for less then half the price!!!</li>
            <li> and it works just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> Not sure if that is what is going on here.</li>
            <li> I have bought it in the past.</li>
            <li> So if you were wondering about that...wonder no more.</li>
            <li> No additional products needed, no more serums, no more leave in conditioners.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> While  the conditioner is recommended for co-wash , this is an expensive product and you might want to only use as a co-wash once every couple weeks .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy from this seller again though.</li>
            <li> Which is a little thin,  a little curly which leads to frizzy.  </li>
            <li> I am a hair fanatic, I love Bed Head products but this just looked nasty on my hair</li>
            <li> My package was delivered wrong and left out in the cold for 2 days when I asked it not to be left.</li>
            <li> I have very unruly, dry, frizzy, unmanageable hair that was falling out, shedding, horribly!</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s hard to describe</li>
            <li> I straighten my hair every day which caused my hair to break and look dull.</li>
            <li> It was hard to find in Korea, too, so I dont know where to even look for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and when it dries it loses all of its oil.</li>
            <li> Common sense???</li>
            <li> My hair loses softness after using this product.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I found myself driving at least 30 miles to get it.  </li>
            <li> Well, it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore and after reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give these a try especially at this price.</li>
            <li> I also have REALLY thick hair.</li>
            <li> These 2 bottles lasted about 3 months (and i have thick hair).</li>
            <li> i have longer wavy thick hair.</li>
            <li> I have medium to thick shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thick, doesn&#x27;t tangle, &amp; smells like strawberries.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe it depends on your hair type, but for my fine hair this was seriously one of the worst shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> This was just disgusting, and the smell of it was so sweet smelling</li>
            <li> and I have had less breakage!!!</li>
            <li> I just wish it was less expensive, can&#x27;t afford to get it again for awhile...</li>
            <li> She is a swimmer and tried to dye her hair resulting in some seriously damaged hair.</li>
            <li> seems like the same stuff as in the stores at half the price... not too bad!</li>
            <li> Not a good experience for me.</li>
            <li> I did not used other very very expensive shock therapies.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly and porous hair</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not super crazy about the strawberry scent, but it isn&#x27;t terrible and I can live with it for these results!</li>
            <li> I got a bad highlight job that really burnt my hair bad...</li>
            <li> I have no problems with the quality of the shampoo/conditoner, however the pump on the shampoo was broken when it arrived and some of the shampoo had leaked all over the box.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s thin</li>
            <li> Ive never experienced a greasy feeling</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really thin</li>
            <li> The shampoo doesnt tangle my thin hair.</li>
            <li> My hair is thin</li>
            <li> not the least expensive</li>
            <li> so it dried out to the point where my conditioners like Oribe (very expensive) just didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> She says it fixed whatever bad bad thing her hairdresser did to her hair.  </li>
            <li> \\&quot;works\\&quot; but its not ideal.  </li>
            <li> It also helps me control the frizziness that comes with weak hair!</li>
            <li> Very thick &amp; moisturizing!</li>
            <li> The tape itself was a little difficult to take out, but with none of that nasty, annoying, displeasing tape residue left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the distributor/service/packaging, etc.</li>
            <li> will definitly be buying this over and over again, you can&#x27;t go wrong,</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years, but it is difficult to find in my area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this duo.</li>
            <li> It is slightly expensive but it is cheaper on here for the size than anywhere else.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this product lacks in quality.</li>
            <li> I a sort of used to that unfortunately.</li>
            <li> I was really skeptical about it</li>
            <li> No more frizz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about buying it because it was really expensive in Korea.</li>
            <li> I am a hair product addicted person!</li>
            <li> Way to expensive.</li>
            <li> I get sad when I travel</li>
            <li> just a little over price!!!!!</li>
            <li> The pump was broken :(</li>
            <li> It did not ressurect my weak bleached hair hair at all!!</li>
            <li> Totally disappointing.</li>
            <li> I was afraid to put my hair in water or to brush it out.</li>
            <li> and I was afraid that the bottles inside would have exploded for I could smell it already.</li>
            <li> I have wavy hair, that tends to frizz really bad when styling.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not frizzing nearly as bad during styling, but I can tell with each wash</li>
            <li> I purchased this online and received with a wierd bad odor to it.</li>
            <li> My daughter has dandruff really bad</li>
            <li> just is somewhat of a bad shape.</li>
            <li> Others had said they thought they got a bad bottle.</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell BAD like the reviews I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> It was so bad that I had to cut off around 12 inches.</li>
            <li> it made me sick..</li>
            <li> but I was disappointed as I&#x27;m lower on conditioner than shampoo.  </li>
            <li> Disappointed</li>
            <li> i was disappointed and figured it may have been because it wasn&#x27;t on the verge of dying just yet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was disappointed  :(</li>
            <li> I hate the smell and the texture.</li>
            <li> but it is a VERY unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> any other ive tried!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Try it out you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have horribly damaged bleached hair.</li>
            <li> Now I&#x27;m addicted....and almost out of conditioner :(....I give this product two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t awfully damaged</li>
            <li> smells horrible!</li>
            <li> However, the reason for 4 starts instead of 5 stars is that the conditioner smells AWFUL.  </li>
            <li> These made my hair feel awful</li>
            <li> If you buy this you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
            <li> It is awful....</li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is just what my thirsty dry hair needed. I have wavy hair, that tends to frizz really bad when styling. I got some tips at the salon and online and one that stood out was get a sulfate free shampoo. There are actually a ton of options for this but I just had to laugh and check a bottle in the my cupboard....my dog&#x27;s shampoo. I had to giggle at this point as her &amp;#34;pet head&amp;#34; by tigi shampoo was indeed sulfate free. I&#x27;ll tell you too, that stuff is so great for her. You can&#x27;t argue with results right? so I went looking for Bed head stuff for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on this is actually quite a steal, typically you&#x27;ll pay that just for the shampoo in this size, maybe a little less at Target. This is the level 3 repair, but plenty of others reviewed it as what they use on the regular now. I will be too, after just a few washes my hair feels so much healthier. The fiance tried it too, and his looks even better than mine! It&#x27;s not frizzing nearly as bad during styling, but I can tell with each wash it&#x27;s lessening that more and more. I feel eventually I won&#x27;t have any more issues with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Depending on how long this lasts the household and if I can keep getting it close to this price I will keep purchasing it. A few notes to keep in mind for people on the fence: It&#x27;s sulfate free, but it still lathers decently which is nice. The conditioner doesn&#x27;t quite smell as nice as the shampoo but it doesn&#x27;t really transfer to your hair. You only smell the shampoo which smells fruity and nice.</li>
            <li> Totally disappointing. I have fine hair and this did nothing for it except weigh it down and make it super oily and dull.&lt;br /&gt;I HIGHLY recommend Clear Shampoo over this product and I assure you that using that  will be waaaay more effective.&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it depends on your hair type, but for my fine hair this was seriously one of the worst shampoos I&#x27;ve ever used. After giving it to my husband who has thick, wavy hair and will truly use just about anything, he also stopped using it after a few weeks saying it made his hair super oily and flat.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have tried many, and I mean many, shampoos on the market. NONE of them gave the results promised. I had doubt about trying another one but so happy I did. I have wavey/curly hair that can get frizzy and dry easily. I farm, therefore must wash my hair almost every day. My frizzy dry hair is gone. I finally found a shampoo/conditioner that works!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Shampoo and Conditioner really made my scalp breakout with bumps and became very irritated- Did not like it at all - Very Chemical</li>
            <li> What this product won&#x27;t do: Fix the damage or restore you hair to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it will do: Protect from further damage, hydrate, and make a somewhat noticeable difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have horribly damaged bleached hair. About a year ago I bleached my hair all the way to platinum blonde within a week - bad idea - because I&#x27;m super impatient. I now absolutely LOVE the color but initially, I was embarrassed because of the damage. A few months ago I stumbled upon this shampoo and I have noticed a difference when using it compared to using others. I don&#x27;t want to say that it restored my hair back to health because if I stopped using it, it goes back to looking dull and flat. However, when I use it, my hair does feel slightly healthier. It is still noticeably damaged but not as much as without. I bleach my roots almost every month and straighten my hair every two days and while using this shampoo, the damage has not increased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have refused to cut it because I love the length and don&#x27;t have the strength to part with it and I think this shampoo has helped me from having to do that. I also have REALLY thick hair.</li>
            <li> Works really well for my hair type.  You don&#x27;t need to use much of it.  Smells great!</li>
            <li> I used this stuff once before and I knew I had to have it! I&#x27;m a big guy and I sweat a lot in a 120 degree mechanics shop.  After a long days work my hair is normally so wet and when it dries it loses all of its oil. I go home now and take a shower and when my hair dries it&#x27;s perfect. Not oily but the moisture is back in my hair! I have longer hair for a man but one pump of each gets the job done so it should last me over 2-3 months! I have never been more impressed with shampoo and conditioner in my entire life! Plus it smells wonderful! I wonder how the blue and green bed heads are if they work the same or differently?!?!?</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner for my thick wavy hair out there. It makes it so much more manegable then other shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo, it smells good, and works great. Won&#x27;t ever use anything else again. Highly recommend using this product.</li>
            <li> my fav!!! great price!</li>
            <li> ok, good product, good price, I recommend</li>
            <li> Smells fantastic works great</li>
            <li> This shampoo can make the most damaged hair soft. If you&#x27;re despairing of the condition of your hair, this is what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
            <li> The conditioner is definitely expired. When I first received it, the shampoo and conditioner both smelled like strawberries, but about two weeks in, the conditioner started to smell funny. I didn&#x27;t realize it so I kept using it, but eventually I realized my hair smelled funny after it was dried, kind of like a burnt..smell, it&#x27;s hard to describe but it is a VERY unpleasant smell. I notified Amazon, and I was able to get a refund on this product which is amazing.</li>
            <li> Love the product and the price!</li>
            <li> So this was on sale at Ulta, and I had heard alot of good things about bed head so I decided to try it. SO SO SO HAPPY THAT I DID..I straighten my hair every day which caused my hair to break and look dull.After using the shampoo and conditioner just once, my hair screaming at me thank you!!!!It was soft and curly again and my ends looked refreshed.. Now I&#x27;m addicted....and almost out of conditioner :(....I give this product two thumbs up!!</li>
            <li> Worked for awhile - can&#x27;t use this brand anymore.</li>
            <li> I have no problems with the quality of the shampoo/conditoner, however the pump on the shampoo was broken when it arrived and some of the shampoo had leaked all over the box.  Easy enough to clean up and I rigged the pump so it \\&quot;works\\&quot; but its not ideal.  Would suggest they pack the boxes with more padding to prevent this from happening.</li>
            <li> I Love Bed Head!  I tried this product because the price was right.  I Love how silky soft it makes my hair..  Resurrection is now my favorite bed head out of them all ... and they are all pretty good. :)  Very fast shipping :)</li>
            <li> Exactly as advertised. Loved it and quick delivery!!</li>
            <li> I have been using tigi&#x27;s bed head-dumb blonde shampoo &amp; conditioner for about a year. I read the reviews for Resurrection &amp; decided to give it a try, I was so glad I did! I have very long hair &amp; of course we all know how hard it is to maintain long hair. This product is just what my hair needed, the Dumb Blonde was great but Resurrection is just the WHOLE package for my long hair. My hair is so much shinier &amp; smoother than its ever been. I love TIGI products, they smell great and keep my hair looking healthy. Bed Head-after party, smoothing cream &amp; Bed Head-headrush, shine adrenaline mist are my all time faves.</li>
            <li> I have tried several different shampoo and conditioners and this one really does what it claims to do! Love it!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner have made my hair so soft and shiny. The smell is great too. Overall great product.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner set works great.  My only issue is that the liters don&#x27;t come with the pumps.  Be careful, a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> The seller was great- super fast shipping, but the product (Tigi&#x27;s fault) was pretty awful.  This shampoo/conditioner is supposed to fix hair that is dry, but from what my hair feels like, it made it worse.  They both smell like strawberries, which is ok, but the shampoo and conditioner are very watery.  I tried to give it a chance and ended up going through the bottles to the end to make sure it had enough time to work, but unfortunately my hair just feels like straw afterward.  I&#x27;m going with pureology nanoworks because I sampled the stuff ONCE during the time I was using this Tigi product and the pureology fixed (with ONE time of trying it) the dryness problem that the tigi product caused.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with the distributor/service/packaging, etc. I just don&#x27;t like the product. It left my hair greasy and dull.</li>
            <li> I tried this product when my daughter bought it in a smaller size from Ulta. I loved it. I have color in my hair and it has not faded in the month that I have been using it. It makes my hair soft and easy to comb after using the conditioner.  The size of the bottle was huge and the price was much less than at retail stores. It comes with a bottle of shampoo and a bottle of conditioner. It smells great and gives my hair lots of body and shine. I would recommend this product to anyone that has damaged hair.</li>
            <li> This product works well, and is very moisturizing for the hair. The smell is very intense. It is sort of a fake cherry candy store smell and can be really overbearing.</li>
            <li> These products are exellent! I will buy them again. They are justas good as the ones selling at beauty salons.</li>
            <li> Working out &amp; daily styling has wreaked havoc on my hair! Realizing that it was liking quite dry &amp; lifeless, I started shopping for something that got good reviews to help. After doing my research, I decided on Bed Head Resurrection. I&#x27;ve been really pleased with it. The smell is wonderful &amp; it leaves my hair feeling &amp; looking so much better than it did before.</li>
            <li> After dying and re-dying my hair for months on end, I amassed some pretty seriously damaged hair and plenty of split ends. Getting my hair cut definitely helped clear out some of the mess, but I still needed something to really bring my hair back to life and the shampoos and conditioners I had been using weren&#x27;t cutting it, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  Not only does my hair smell wonderful, I can run my fingers through it...without having to brush it first (I really couldn&#x27;t do this before, the split ends tend to make my hair pretty gnarly and tangled.) Finally, my hair is silky, shiny, and so much more manageable. I would definitely purchase this product again considering I got about twice as much product as I had with BioSilk Silk Therapy shampoo &amp; conditioner, for the same price and it works just as well, if not better.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews, but this product is amazing. I have been using cheaper products that made my hair feel dry and dull. I straighten my hair everyday so i needed something that would get rid of damage and dryness. These 2 bottles lasted about 3 months (and i have thick hair). You only have to use a little bit and it works wonders. It smells great and my hair feels great! I would highly recommend this product!!!!!</li>
            <li> Smells like strawberries. Makes my hair feel like silk. Not greasy or oily. Good quality. I use it on my baby&#x27;s hair and it makes her smell delicious. I just wanna gobble her up!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo. I have waves hair that can get fuzzy. This shampoo helps tame my hair along with my styling products.</li>
            <li> Was supposed to be 1 shampoo and 1 conditioner set.  Instead I received 2 shampoos and no conditioner.  Buying the conditioner by itself is more expensive, but I guess that is what I will have to do.  I don&#x27;t know if it was just my order...that got goofed up with 2 shampoos instead of one shampoo and one conditioner.....but I was disappointed as I&#x27;m lower on conditioner than shampoo.  Love this shampoo and conditioner set...just wished I&#x27;d gotten what I thought I was getting as described....and not just 2 shampoos.  ....now I&#x27;m searching for conditioner to buy 2 of...</li>
            <li> Great Product! Great Price! Fast Shipping!</li>
            <li> I have used this product for several years.  This bottle was very different.  The conditioner was runny and white.  Normally it is thick and a more cream color.  Seems like a different product.  Disappointed</li>
            <li> Love this set and how soft and smooth it makes my hair! Fast and easy delivery as well!</li>
            <li> The products weigh my hair down and the smell is just TOO strong. Especially the conditioner. It smells like nail polish remover or cheap hand sanitizer (with a rotten fruit scent to it). The first time I used it, I showered in our finished basement and my mom came down to do laundry an hour after my shower and she said she could still smell it. The products left my thick, wavy hair feeling waxy, flat and hard to brush. I showed it to my hair stylist who initially recommended it and she almost dropped it. The smell stung her nose. She was positive it was either expired or a knock-off product. I will never buy hair products online unless I&#x27;m 100% positive they are licensed retailers.  I hope amazon looks into this.</li>
            <li> Tigi Bed Head Resurrection is the absolute best I have ever used!!! I have very unruly, dry, frizzy, unmanageable hair that was falling out, shedding, horribly! Until my stylist recommended this set. My hair has very little fallout now, is so easy to comb, and styles beautifully!! I HIGHLY recommend this product!!! And it smells awesome!!!! Try it for yourself!!! It has made a major difference in the health of my hair!!!! I just LOVE it!!!!!!! Five stars!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Best shampoo ever.  I work in the desert and my hair actually still feels like hair even with Ropu water!!</li>
            <li> I love this product my beautician recommended and uses on my hair. My hair grows really fast with this. I&#x27;m constantly having to cut it to keep the style and it smells great.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Keeps my hair from frizzing up everywhere, looking shiny, and easy to manage. Smells good too!</li>
            <li> My hair smells wonderful and is so soft after using this shampoo and conditioner. I struggled with a good shampoo and conditioner in humidity and I am very happy with &amp;#34;resurrection&amp;#34; A great deal lasts almost 2 months and my hair goes down to the lower of my back...</li>
            <li> I love this product. Honestly it is the only thing I will ever use. I was buying it from the beauty salon. Then I found it on here for less then half the price!!! I couldn&#x27;t resist. The people I go to for my hair cuts can tell a difference. I went 8 months without a hair cut and barely had any split ends! It sure does make a difference. Oh, and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay... Leaves my hair pretty dry.</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner and smells wonderful.  Leaves hair smooth and revived/resurrected.  A comb will actually go thru my long thick coarse hair using this shampoo and conditioner.  Smells absolutely devine of pomegranate. 5 thumbs up</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner! I have pretty thin hair and it does not weigh my hair down at all. Great price also.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> A real Resurrection of chemically treated hair. I really experienced great results in short time. My hair know don&#x27;t need to use treatments but only these two products. The only inconvenient is that my oily hair turns more oilier but I don&#x27;t matter cause anyway I has to Wash it every other day. It worked for me. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Loved it my hair color lasts longer</li>
            <li> Was looking for a new, quality shampoo and conditioner and I read the reviews for these and thought I&#x27;d give them a go...I wasn&#x27;t going to hold my breath, have tried a whole bunch of \\&quot;nice\\&quot; shampoos in the past and they&#x27;ve been fine but I have to say, after a few weeks of using it my hair feels great and I love it! Even my not-so-observant boyfriend commented that my hair feels really soft. He&#x27;d helped my bleach my blonde roots the day before and not knowing much about girls hair asked \\&quot;Is it because of the bleach we put on yesterday?!\\&quot; Ahhhh!  Anyway, need I say more? A great Shampoo/conditioner combo!!</li>
            <li> got this for my wife for christmas and she loves it.&lt;br /&gt;I use it also when she&#x27;s not looking.&lt;br /&gt;Would reccommend this product.</li>
            <li> Both bottles were open and leaked in the box</li>
            <li> Some of the best product on the market! I notice I huge difference on the days I haven&#x27;t used it! Worth it!</li>
            <li> I have naturally red hair and decided to go a little bit lighter for the summer well the bleach that we put in dried out my hair and made it very brittle, dull and lifeless.&lt;br /&gt;Suffice to say I tried a bunch of various shampoos and conditioners and this was the ONLY one that worked at all. It brought my hair back to life, would never go back to using anything else again!&lt;br /&gt;Love this product and thanks Bed Head for making such an amazing shampoo and conditioner that brought my hair back to life.&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely&lt;br /&gt;N</li>
            <li> good price! i have longer wavy thick hair. this stuff smells amazing (lots of compliments) and the smell lasts which i like. it also makes my hair much more manageable and soft.</li>
            <li> Have ordered this twice now for use by my teenage daughter and I. We both love the smell and shiny look of our hair afterwards. Our hairstylist uses this product on our hair but I won&#x27;t buy it from him because he overcharges. This is a good quality product for the price. Does not leave your hair dry, flaky, a little goes a long way &amp; washes out easily. My husband constantly tells me my hair smells awesome (even from distance) &amp; looks fabulous.</li>
            <li> Great transaction. Love this product!  I have naturall dark hair. That I had it lifted to a very light blonde!! It has made a world of difference to my over processes hair</li>
            <li> I love this product! It smells wonderful! I have noticed since using it I shed less which is a great feature in my opinion!</li>
            <li> I bought this product on the suggestion of a trusted source. When I received the product, I was eager to see its results but found my hair became sticky and waxy from use. I assumed it was because the product just wasn&#x27;t the right fit for my hair. When speaking with my stylist she commented that my hair felt very sticky, and felt as though I had enormous product &amp;#34;build up.&amp;#34; I told her I was using Bed Head - and she asked me if I had bought it in a salon, or at a discount retailer. Then she told me, likely the product is expired and has been sitting on a shelf somewhere for years. Came home to realize the product was very very very expired - and the reason for my hairs yucky feel was in fact because Amazon had sold me an expired product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TLDR: Don&#x27;t buy health and beauty products on Amazon - you cant tell if they are expired.</li>
            <li> I had extremely damaged hair from a bleaching incident last year and have tried everything.  I started using this about 2 weeks ago and it&#x27;s like I have new hair.  Extremely soft, shiny and no frizz.  I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> The shampoo is great. It smells really nice. It reminds me of cotton candy, which is unique for a shampoo, since most tend to just smell like flowers or something. I have had a few people at work or even in crowded bars ask what kind of shampoo I use because it smells so nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if I would say it is that much better than all of the other shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, but it does make my hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller itself is not that great. I bought the shampoo/conditioner on Wednesday, May 23rd. Today I got an email saying my order has shipped. Expected delivery date: June 18th, 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously?! That&#x27;s almost a month to ship. What&#x27;s going on? If i had known it would take this long I would not have bought it, or I would&#x27;ve bought it from a different seller. Just a warning to those who need shampoo/conditioner sooner than in a month.</li>
            <li> Purchased Bed Head Resurrection Shampoo/Conditioner because my hair is severely damaged. This stuff is wonderful. It has revitalized my hair so that I need fewer trims to remove damaged areas. Highly recommended!!!</li>
            <li> I just got this set today and let me tell you i love it! The smell is delicious. Sorta candy like. I noticed a difference in my hair as soon as i washed it. I reccomend this set and this seller!</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo for my daughters and they couldn&#x27;t stop talking about how great it smells and how good it makes their hair feel, so I bought it for myself too and just loved it. It feels as if it&#x27;s repairing my hair. Hair feels, clean, soft and managable. We love this product.</li>
            <li> I damaged my hair from over processing...this product (shampoo &amp; conditioner) has really saved me!! It smells great, works miracles! I love Bed Head products and this just confirms they have great products! If you need some TLC for your locks...this is the product for you!!!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!!! Just buy the cheapest stuff you can find and I&#x27;m sure it will be much better than this overpriced product!!</li>
            <li> I have sun-damaged hair and this does very well to restore strength and body. It also helps me control the frizziness that comes with weak hair!</li>
            <li> I feel like the shampoo leaves a residue in my hair, so I don&#x27;t always use it. But the condition is lovely and they both smell great</li>
            <li> The smell was a bit disconcerting the first time I used it, but it makes my hair unbelievably soft and easy to manage.  Love the brand, will try a different bead head shampoo the next time.</li>
            <li> I use this shampoo to give my hair a break from my usual-which is pureology.  It conditions nicely.  I have fine thin hair.  It works well.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo I has tried so far! It leaves my hair so soft and hardly any flyaways, oh and it smells delicious and is affordable! I&#x27;ve tried other very expensive brands and they have not been great at all.  Try this!!</li>
            <li> Im in love with this shampoo. I used it once and it made my hair so soft and smells great!!!</li>
            <li> This product works very good and definitely helps your hair. Only problem I notice is your cant use it to much cause it drys out your scalp. Maybe use it once a week or every 3rd wash depending on how often you wash you hair.</li>
            <li> I have always liked the Bed Head line of products; however, this particular shampoo and conditioner makes my hair dry, brittle and difficult to comb through.  After I blow dry my hair, it begins to appear greasy when I use these products.  I tried using them on and off for several weeks, always with the same results. I will not purchase again.</li>
            <li> Despite many of the negative reviews I decided to give this stuff a try.  IT IS WONDERFUL!! It smells fantastic and has given my dry, thick, wavy hair a make over. A tiny bit of this stuff goes a long way. I use two pumps of each on my middle of the back length hair and it is the perfect amount. I leave the conditioner in for at least 3 minutes then rinse with cool water. Never rinse with hot water. If you put too much conditioner near your scalp of course you will somewhat oily hair the next day. Common sense???</li>
            <li> LOVE! I have long hair and this is the only shampoo and conditioner I can use on my hair.</li>
            <li> the product tookk a long time to arrive. I believe the seller did not send it for about a week after placing the order. Also, I was quite dissapointed with the product! I could have saved $$ and stuck to dove shampoo and my hair would have been in a better condition. It did not ressurect my weak bleached hair hair at all!! waste of money</li>
            <li> it was was I was awaiting. Exactly as the picture and the quality is really good.&lt;br /&gt;I realy recomend it.</li>
            <li> Great product for dry, damaged hair! It smells like candy and works wonders for hair that needs a little refreshment!</li>
            <li> The product is really good for its price. My hair is much soft and bright now. The problem is that it seems that the next wash without it my hair is going to become dry again. The hydration doesn&#x27;t seem very deep. But for the price, it does a great job! Just don&#x27;t expect to pay the price of this product and have a hair treatment like if you&#x27;re using Kerastase or Redken.</li>
            <li> I am so in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Starting off the price is amaizng bed head usually runs around 18 bucks for one bottle, but on amazon it&#x27;s only 23 bucks.&lt;br /&gt;I dye my hair A LOT, my hair starting to get brittle and lifeless. I also flat iron my hair daily it&#x27;s thin and i used no heat protectent.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing, It is a little strong in the shower, but once your hair dries it has a softer sent that lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping took the amount of time it said.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now and my hair is extremely soft, has more body to it and is a lot stronger more healthy hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will definitly be buying this over and over again, you can&#x27;t go wrong,</li>
            <li> I love Bed Head products.  Normally.  However, this does not moisturize my hair as much as Moisture Maniac. It does keep my hair soft and managable, but it is dryer than usual.</li>
            <li> I have used this shampoo and conditioner for over a year or two now.  I love the way it smells and it helps my hair which is really dry.</li>
            <li> Have been fan since first time  I used!My hair is soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;My family loves it and soon will order more!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair loses softness after using this product. Bad fit. Would not buy it again.</li>
            <li> WOW!!!  I was a bit apprehensive about trying another shampoo and conditioner, but I decided to purchase both of them.  My hair was extremely dry.  After using the shampoo and conditioner just once, I was amazed at how my hair responded!!!  It was soft and shiny.  Finally, a shampoo and conditioner that is definitely worth the money.  I have already told two friends about it.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I read a review about how a girls hair got greasy after one day and this seemed to help. I am white, my hair is thick and is prone to looking oily after one day. I used this product the first time and loved it. My hair was silky smooth. I washed my hair with it two days later and even with using a small amount I couldn&#x27;t get all of the product to rinse out of my hair. It left my hair looking oily and wet. I had to use another shampoo to get it all out. I found I can get away with using this shampoo once every week or so, definitely not as my main shampoo and conditioner and definitely not back to back. It was a waste of my money.</li>
            <li> This Bed Head product is the best I have ever used! Lots of suds in the shampoo! Keeps my hair soft and manageable</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner set! Worked well on my hair. Will purchase again!</li>
            <li> Love it really does resurrect your hair. I will definitely buy again. Brings your hair back from the dead. Superb!</li>
            <li> LOVE these products!  Have been using them for several years now  : )</li>
            <li> If it was actually tigi it would have been good, however, proconcepts shipped something else.  The conditioner became yellow after some time and smelled like nail polish remover!  Don&#x27;t buy from proconcepts!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything.  This stuff is like silk amazingness!  I have a lot of fine hair.  It&#x27;s not heavy in my hair.  It untangles my long tresses.  It smells so good, too!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this online and received with a wierd bad odor to it. To my suprise I found out that all people who sell this product are not licensed by Tigi to sell. In the future I will find this product on sale and purchase at the salon in Wal-Mart. They have great sales and are licensed by the company. Not a good experience for me.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it. I feel like this shampoo is gentle enough but also gets my hair clean without leaving it feeling greasy. Love the smell too!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner! First, it smells AMAZING. it&#x27;s a unique, tropical smell that I adore. Second, it leaves my hair SO SOFT. I have used countless hair shampoos/conditioners/other products and I feel like this one had the biggest effect on my hair. Also my sister uses it and she has different hair than I do, and she loves it as well! Overall an excellent product and worth the price. I have had it for 2 months and I still have almost half the bottle left! Very awesome</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a number of years, but it is difficult to find in my area. Therefore, I found myself driving at least 30 miles to get it.  Not only did I find it convenient to purchase through Amazon, the cost was substantially lower than what I had been paying.  The product is terrific for my color-treated/heat-processed hair., providing unsurpassed shine, silkiness, and manageability.  I will be ordering again.</li>
            <li> Once upon a time, I went into my salon to get my hair cut.  &amp;#34;Wow!  Your hair is so healthy, it&#x27;s actually hard to style!&amp;#34;, my hairstylist says.  What was my trick?  Only a few weeks of using Resurrection.  True story!</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and in the middle of my back. This shampoo and conditioner is very nourishing! I love it! I will never go back to anything else. I don&#x27;t even have to put Moroccan oil in anymore!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for a while. I love how soft it makes my hair, It&#x27;s so nice and smooth.</li>
            <li> Your hair will thank you! This is my favorite shampoo &amp; conditioner of all time. If your hair is fried this is what you need. Its called resurrection for a reason.&lt;br /&gt;  I would like to point out to the customers who say this combo is leaving any kind of residue on their hair, its probably the wrong level product for you. TIGI&#x27;s Urban antidotes offers 3 levels of hair rescuing combos like this. Resurrection is the strongest, most protein packed option. If your hair isn&#x27;t on its last leg then try something a little less concentrated. Just like your body, your hair can be over medicated.</li>
            <li> My daughter has dandruff really bad but she also has oily hair.  This is the only shampoo we have found that helps the dandruff and keeps her hair looking shining and clean.  I will continue to order this from Amazon because in the salon I was paying $70 a bottle.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner for people with dry hair! It makes my hair soft and shiny and helps my highlights last.</li>
            <li> This is the first shampoo I have tried that actually made a noticeable difference the first time I used it.  Definitely making my hair softer and shinier. Even my husband commented on it after using it on his hair.  Smells good too!</li>
            <li> This is great. I wish the conditioner felt a little more moisturizing in the shower as I have to apply an extra pump to get it worked through the ends, but it&#x27;s very light weight as smells good.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner set.. It does an excellent job of moisturizing my hair and it smells great! AND I am very picky about my shampoos and conditioners.</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have found for my hair.  Which is a little thin,  a little curly which leads to frizzy.  I used to love Pureology but just can&#x27;t afford it.  I tried this and can&#x27;t believe it actually knocked pureology off it&#x27;s pedestal.</li>
            <li> I Absolutely LOVE this product! I just wish it was less expensive, can&#x27;t afford to get it again for awhile...Bummer!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t speak from personal experience on this product, as it is my wife&#x27;s and i am not allowed to use it or i would get in big trouble.  That being said, she LOVES it.  She says it fixed whatever bad bad thing her hairdresser did to her hair.  And it smells good, which is always a plus.  Yay shampoo!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple years now, and it is my go-to shampoo and conditioner when my hair starts to feel dry. It&#x27;s light on your hair, especially for us fine-hair people. The conditioner is great to put in and leave in for 10-15 minutes if you need a deep conditioning. My hair instantly feels and looks healthier just after one use. I highly recommend this shampoo and conditioner!</li>
            <li> Love the shampoo! Smell so great and make my hair so silky!</li>
            <li> So i used this shampoo for about a week and a half and i did not realize any difference. i was disappointed and figured it may have been because it wasn&#x27;t on the verge of dying just yet. but after two week of using it, something completely awesome happeed! my hair became super soft after each shower and stayed that way no matter in what weather. :3 It works really good on my super way dry chemically treated thick hair. and it smells amazing too!! i would def reccommend to someone with damaged hair</li>
            <li> Makes my hair so soft and so flawless! You&#x27;re not wasting your money here! I would suggest this to everyone!</li>
            <li> I was excited to try this product after all the positive reviews. After using a few times I don&#x27;t notice any difference in my hair. This shampoo leaves my hair feeling no different from Dove or another cheaper shampoo. I&#x27;m disappointed.</li>
            <li> Warning! this shampoo does exactly what it says it will. Resurrect your hair, but you have to understand that mean your hair has to be long dead for it to have a positive effect. I bleach my hair and use a lot of heat styling. Air dried out of the shower it is a frizzy mess; a beast, if you will that I must gently battle with to tame. This shampoo breathes life into my completely dried hair making it soft, supple and shiny without the need for other products. However if your hair is not completely dry, frizzy, or chemically damaged I would avoid this and try &amp;#34;moisture manic&amp;#34; by bed head. It will not make your hair feel as heavy or &amp;#34;greasy&amp;#34;. Ive never experienced a greasy feeling I just am at a lost for another descriptive word. Good night all</li>
            <li> This is one of the best shampoo and conditioner ever! It will work miracles on your hair! Would recommend to anybody!</li>
            <li> After MULTIPLE at-home bleachings and DIY hair colourings, my hair was extremely unhealthy..to say the very least! But in an attempt to change it back to my natural colour once and for all, I incurred some significant damage. When I say significant, I mean I lost a good inch off of my ends due to breakage, and what hair I managed to salvage was gummy and was snapping like rubber bands. It felt like straw, and I couldn&#x27;t even brush it out. Really yucky stuff! I bought this Bed Head shampoo and conditioner at the recommendation of the girl who cuts my hair, and all I can say is that I have been extremely pleased with the results. First of all, it smells like candy; I could smell it before I had even taken the plastic off of it. The bottles were much bigger than I expected, so I know I&#x27;ll be getting lots of use out of them. And after using both products for the first time, my hair was super soft and had BODY to it again - I was able to style it for the first time in almost a week! Didn&#x27;t need to put in any leave in conditioner, products, or anything. Totally thrilled, and would recommend it to anyone as crazy as myself who needs a serious hair intervention. :)</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product. My hair looks great and it smells wonderful. The frizz is gone. Buy this!</li>
            <li> I was talking to my grand daughter about needing some good shampoo for my dry hair.  She told me about this shampoo so I ordered it and have been using it for several weeks and she is right this is great produce!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always loved this brand since I went blond last summer. Love it. Makes my hair nice and soft. Easy to manage. Although I found this same set a a Regis for only 25$. Might buy from there from now on. Also. Took a while to get here all the way from Florida.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair that tends to dry out at the ends, while my scalp gets oily. This combination has made my hair so soft, without weighing down my curls. My only problem is that it smells a little sweet for my tastes luckily it fades pretty quickly, and that the conitioner is too strong to use near my scalp so I just make  sure to keep it about an inch away and it&#x27;s great.</li>
            <li> Product works well but it was expired.</li>
            <li> Made my highlight a little bit red, but does make your hair feel good.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t like the amount of chemical on it though, it&#x27;s overall OK , not great.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo and really love the price I get them for. It smells great and leaves my hair feeling soft.</li>
            <li> Smells good, my hair feels softer already after only one wash and I am smitten with the price here on Amazon. I plan to reorder when I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have noticed a plastic smell in the conditioner. I checked the bottle for an expiration date as someone in another shampoo review mentioned having received an expired product (previously it had never occurred to me that shampoo/conditioner could expire) but couldn&#x27;t find one. Not sure if that is what is going on here. The product seems to work fine despite the smell, but I am now on the fence about purchasing shampoo and conditioner online again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m obsessed with this duo. My hair is soft, and healthy because of this. I switched for a little over a month to a different brand my friend wanted me to try, but it didn&#x27;t make my hair feel as amazing as this one did. When I switched back, my hair felt wonderful from the first wash. It was an instant improvement. I&#x27;ve been using it consistently for 6 months now and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> This set is great for my hair. I have natually curly/frizzy hair that I color so it has always been dry feeling and a pain to deal with. This shampoo and conditioner seem to work great for my hair. They leave it feeling very soft, probably softer than its ever been and it has more of a shine or glow to it than it used to. It also smells like watermelons or something so that is really nice too. The price on here was also better than I could find in stores so I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Came in on time and was packaged nicely. Great price. This is one of my favorite products and I was so glad to find it at such a decent price. Thank you!</li>
            <li> The shampoo smells great and works well but the conditioner was too heavy for my fine hair. The conditioner also had a more chemical smell to it. I won&#x27;t be buying this again. I have liked other bed head products better.</li>
            <li> Love the product, however packaging was a problem.  Packed in a box with a Bluetooth speaker I purchase at the same time and the lid came off banging around in the box and leaked all over inside the box.</li>
            <li> Love this product! Makes my hair soft and brings out my natural curls.</li>
            <li> I am really please with the product.  It makes my hair feel silky and smooth.</li>
            <li> Have used this exact line for many years - works extremely well with my thick, course, highlighted platinum blonde hair. Won&#x27;t ever change this product!!</li>
            <li> This shampoo/conditioner combo smells really good, but for some reason made my scalp very itchy. I was not a fan.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t wash my hair with sulfate shampoos but this is my favorite duo. It repairs my hair better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used before and it is a product I always go back to. It is slightly expensive but it is cheaper on here for the size than anywhere else. You get exactly what you pay for and it does what it says. My hair isn&#x27;t awfully damaged but I do use heat on it everyday so the extra strength care is very helpful.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner out there!!</li>
            <li> Hey so this is great stuff!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always had very fine hair and it has been difficult to find a shampoo and conditioner that makes my hair look silky and smooth (yes! Like the commercials) and I had just about given up. I bought this because it had good (and true) reviews and was $20 (better than you can get it in a salon during a sale- trust me). I did not notice a difference for about three washes, but after that, WOW! I mean, everyone was commenting on how healthy my hair looked. My husband, my siblings, even my cousin who is a professional hair dresser kept grabbing it and saying &amp;#34;wow! your hair looks really nice!&amp;#34; So ya! I am fully satisfied! These have a convenient little squirt top that keeps you from using too much and it has a strong smell (like girl!) which I enjoy, even though I am not a girly girl. Do buy it! Its worth it if your are feeling discouraged!</li>
            <li> It is one of the best hair products I&#x27;ve used in a while and this price is a very good deal compared to what you would pay in a hair salon. The shampoo does have a mild form of sulfate, so beware if you have a keratin treatment or color-treated hair. I have definitely notice a difference in the quality of my hair ever since I started using it.</li>
            <li> Works well but the smell is kind of funky cherry.  I guess the medicine theme&lt;br /&gt;Hair looks good though the end.</li>
            <li> Smells amazing and makes my dry hair soft and moisturized! I always buy this duo! I definitely recommend this product</li>
            <li> VERY GOOD PRODUCT THANK YOU</li>
            <li> I purchased the TiGi Bed Head Resurrection Shampoo and Conditioner set last year.  I read all the great reviews and wanted to try it for myself.  I received the 25.36 fl.oz. bottles.  This shampoo and conditioner set smells like strawberries.  After using this set the Tigi Resurrection left my hair very soft and smelling great.  Overall I would say this is a great shampoo and conditioner set if your hair has been fried by heat styling tools, chemicals, or is just is somewhat of a bad shape.</li>
            <li> This is a really good product however I have psoriasis on my scalp and this irritated it but if you don&#x27;t have that I&#x27;m sure it will work fine! It smells really good!</li>
            <li> I  always seem to be missing my local liter sales for shampoo and conditioner so I thought this would be a good deal. Unfortunately, this product lacks in quality. The conditioner does doesn&#x27;t seem to provide any moisture and leaves my hair very dull and dry.</li>
            <li> Greatest shampoo and conditioner available. Had ordered from another retailer and they were out of stock. These arrived quickly. Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
            <li> Not much different from the current product I have been using. Also, I do not like the fragrance at all.</li>
            <li> Awesome product. Awesome price. Smells like Skittles.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, curly and porous hair the conditioner in this particular line worked WONDERFUL on my hair. The shampoo wasn&#x27;t the greatest but it did the job left a little residue but with my hair I a sort of used to that unfortunately. The conditioner is 5 star shampoo would be the reason for the 4</li>
            <li> Got it on time! Smells amazing and leaves my hair so soft! Love it! :)</li>
            <li> This literally saved my hair!  It was stripping off and felt like straw for all the damage caused by bleaching and dyes....ItÂ´s VERY VERY GOOD.  Hair feels like silk.  I combine the conditioner with the dumb blonde reconstructor.  DO BUY!!!</li>
            <li> I have really picky hair. I love this product. It smells delicious too.  I would highly recommend this product. Great value</li>
            <li> I was visiting a friend in North Carolina and this was the shampoo in the bathroom. I tried it and I loved it. Now my daughter uses it as well.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use this product tonight when I wash my hair; came fully packaged and wrapped up really good; a little leakage, but only a small amount, not enough to fuss about; smells great &#x3D;) it also came a day earlier than the expected shipped date; thats why it deserves 5 stars &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> This a great product. It moisturizes even the driest of hair. Does not require as much to wash hair unless really dirty and even then it is still not much compared to other products. I have purchased the level 2 of this product and it lasted almost 4 months.This is great because you get a great product for a great price. Check out other pricing on other sites, it is double the price. This is great because, with children, luxury of a quality hair product is almost like gold.</li>
            <li> love it  this is great for keeping your hair from breaking and being dry!  just a little over price!!!!! but i like it better then any other ive tried!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> BEST SHAMPOO I HAVE EVER USED!!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have dry, dye, britle hair, split ends you name I have it. I just tried it and my hair was silky smooth, shiny, easy to manage for the first time in my life I did not used other very very expensive shock therapies. Only one word to describe it my hair CAME TO LIFE!!!!!!!!! THANKS!!!!!!!!!!!! I would defenitely recomend this set!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this set because it doesn&#x27;t feel heavy on my hair and it does a great job of conditioning my hair.</li>
            <li> Great deal on the pair!</li>
            <li> My hair needed some life put back into it and this product delivered! My hair feeld very healthy. My husband even uses the shampoo and his hair is thicker and youthful. I&#x27;m satisfied!</li>
            <li> great product, smells delicious. leaves hair silky and shiny :) .. I believe this is the fourth time that I&#x27;ve bought them. Recommended 100%</li>
            <li> smells horrible! would not use ever</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product. I have bought it in the past. It smells AMAZING and really makes your hair shine.</li>
            <li> Always use this shampoo and conditioner! Love this stuff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 5 years i&#x27;m using the shampoo and the conditionner with my highlighted hair. I will never change for other products because they are really efficient and my hair are smooth and smells very good.</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Fast Shipping!  Will definitely buy again.  Thank You</li>
            <li> Love this works great</li>
            <li> Great product but it took to long to get here and when it did the pumps where damaged on them.. Good thing I had some pumps from my old ones...</li>
            <li> This lasts a long time a little goes a long way. Lathers up really good and also smells really good. I prefer this over Joico k-pak.</li>
            <li> I have a really picky scalp that hates &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; shampoo like Garnier, or Pantine. I like the intensity of both the conditioner and the shampoo. The conditioner does a great job of hydrating while the shampoo removes any leftover residue from hair or product. I also know that there are sometimes negative reviews on this, but everyone has different hair, and this works for me. I have medium/fine hair with slight wave and this has eliminated my need for a heat protectant.</li>
            <li> I have EXTREMELY thick, dry, coarse hair, exacerbated by using cheap Herbal Essences shampoos and conditioners.  I decided to give this a try after reading great reviews.  After the first wash, my hair was noticeably softer and more manageable.  However, the reason for 4 starts instead of 5 stars is that the conditioner smells AWFUL.  I read a few reviews saying they received an expired product, so I&#x27;m wondering if I did, too.  However, even if it was expired, it doesn&#x27;t seem like it has changed its effectiveness.  Maybe I&#x27;m just sensitive to smells.</li>
            <li> this product works well and was shipped fast. love the product and how quick is was shipped to me. would purchase again!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended it to me &amp; all I have to say is great smell, great product &amp; excellent results,now my hair is finally happy :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all 3 levels of the urban antidotes. This one is great for hair that needs extra moisture. I have very fine hair that has to be washed every day, and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down and keeps it moisturized. It smells like strawberries and the scent is very strong. I could smell it in the mailbox through the bottles, plastic wrap, and box! But it smells very good.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner is the best ever</li>
            <li> This might be my favorite Bed Head Shampoo. And trust me when I say that I am a Toni and Guy product whore. Is that PC to say on Amazon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used Anti-Dote, Colour Goddess, Oatmeal and Honey and the even more expensive (at least in salon) S Factor Volumizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Resurrection is by far my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t even have severely damaged hair, I just live in a super dry climate that beats the hell out of my hair and skin. This restores shine to my hair like no other shampoo/conditioner has. It smells great, nice and light and does not cause my color to fade at all. So if you were wondering about that...wonder no more. Safe for color treated hair folks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely received the genuine product. Please make sure that you order from Amazon or get an order that is fulfilled by Amazon because then you KNOW you are getting the real deal. If you aren&#x27;t a prime member, suck it up and pay the shipping or go into Toni and Guy and buy it yourself.</li>
            <li> As always, Bed Head is the answer to my hair care.</li>
            <li> Quick shipping and great product!</li>
            <li> love this!  Great for my thick curly dry hair</li>
            <li> I bought this due to dry, frizzy, damaged hair... After 1-2 weeks, my hair completely changed for the better. No additional products needed, no more serums, no more leave in conditioners. This shampoo and conditioner does exactly what It says. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Great conditioner I would buy this again anytime.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping, good packaging.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it smells wonderful but it&#x27;s not bad either.  I have naturally wavy hair and it&#x27;s frizzy and dry lately &amp; with just ONE wash &amp; condition, I noticed a huge difference.  I was really skeptical about it but I read the reviews and decided to try it.  I am glad I did!  I can&#x27;t wait to see what the difference is in a few weeks.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my teenage daughter with waist length hair and a couple stripes of color in it. It smells amazing ( almost like berries) which we both love, and it left her hair soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I recently ombred my hair and at first my hair was a little dry, but didn&#x27;t have that fried-bleaching hair. A week later it started to get tangled, brittle, and extremely dry to the point I was afraid to put my hair in water or to brush it out. I panicked and looked up hair treatments from salon keratine treatments to mayonaise in-home hair treatment. I didn&#x27;t want to dish out $200-300 on a salon treatment nor did I want to put mayonaise in my hair... Yeah...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product for two washes and already it is soft, smooth and tangle free! It feels strong again to the point of being almost like my natural hair. I am so happy with this product and very excited to keep using it!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;in terms of the packaging... The box came incredibly beat up (this was by USPS... NOT THE SELLER!) and I was afraid that the bottles inside would have exploded for I could smell it already. Comes to find out that it was extremely well packed in bubble wrap with secure with heavy duty tape around the spouts to ensure no leaks happen. The tape itself was a little difficult to take out, but with none of that nasty, annoying, displeasing tape residue left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have over bleached hair... TRY THIS! :D</li>
            <li> After my first time using this shampoo/conditioner my hair felt and looked great! I&#x27;ve colored my hair for years and recently fried it completely after perming it. I tried tons of products and nothing worked so after reading the reviews on here I decided to try it and so glad I did. Instead of having to use tons of product each day I just use this and bed head curls amplifier.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s wounderful  my hair is thicker and growing!!  (I die my hair every month) my hair was. Breaking  it&#x27;s making my hair healthy again!!</li>
            <li> Really a great product! I have straight medium length hair and it&#x27;s really thin so it gets damaged easily. This product actually helped my hair grow. It keeps it healthy and keeps my fragile ends from splitting therefore, my hair looks longer and healthier. Leaves hair really clean, only bad thing about that is my hair is really thin so I have a lot of little fly-a-ways now but mousse and hair spray help fix that.</li>
            <li> I bought this shampoo elsewhere, but this is the same thing. My hair is curly, coarse, and frizzy. I live by the beach, so the wind murders it every day of my life! I&#x27;ve tried so many shampoos, and besides the super expensive 25 dollar a bottle ones, this one works so well! My hair is softer and shinier, the curls are more defined and they BOUNCE again! Other products left my hair with a weird residue/heavy feeling, or completely stripped and dry. I feel like this product protects my already fragile strands. I will be buying again.</li>
            <li> came sooner than I thought.. Product works great</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t stand the smell.  Way to sweet for me.  Bummer I have so much of the stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I did like that it seemed to make my hair softer.  So there is one plus.</li>
            <li> Recieved today had it used on me at the salon smells amazing makes my long hair come to life!! Packaging was more than I expected, well done brand names for less!!</li>
            <li> clean and light moisturizer that leaves hair noticeably healthy-looking, shiny, and doesn&#x27;t feel weighted down even after sleeping on it.</li>
            <li> I like the Tigi Bed Head Level 2 much better for my hair type (finer hair, but a lot of it).  I also have a bit of natural wave to my hair, and it&#x27;s on the dryer side.  The Bed Head Level 2 (blue bottles) really moisturized my hair much better.</li>
            <li> Always loved this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years. I used to use Redken and paul mitchel for my frizzy, damaged and dry hair. This product works wonders and is way better.</li>
            <li> LEFT MY CURLY HAIR SPONGY</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner!!!</li>
            <li> I have noticed since using this conditioner that I have a ton of build up in my hair. I like the smell and the product overall but I have to strip my hair of the build up every couple weeks... probably will buy a different one next time.</li>
            <li> My wife tried the shampoo and conditioner at her sister&#x27;s house and loved it.  Told me she really liked the&lt;br /&gt;way her hair turned out.</li>
            <li> I got a bad highlight job that really burnt my hair bad...a salon suggest that I use bed head to reconstruct...Fantastic product...now me and my 2 daughters use this...and I was paying the same amount for much smaller bottles!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I got this set in the hopes that it would help with my extremely frizzy, color treated hair. It isn&#x27;t terrible, it smells absolutely wonderful, and it worked well for about a week or so. After that it just seemed to stop though. Maybe my hair got used to it or something, I don&#x27;t know. It was definitely worth a try though, not a complete waste. I gave the rest to my mother and she loves it! :)</li>
            <li> I can not tell you how good my hair smells and feels! this stuff smells amazing and my hair is so soft and shiny I love it. Although be careful when opening the package because on mine the pump was extended on the shampoo bottle and had shampoo squirted in the box because the pump had actually broken off the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Smells  so good  Great  products</li>
            <li> Even better than the level two set. Although I don&#x27;t care for the smell, it makes my very curly, coarse, and colored hair so soft that I would definitely buy over and over.</li>
            <li> I saw this on a stylist page on Instagram and she said that she uses this product on her clients so I came on here and bought me some lol who doesn&#x27;t want silky soft sexy hair that smells so good that you might need a bodyguard lol its good I&#x27;ll post picture so that you can see</li>
            <li> I use this all the time now. Gives my hair so much life that it&#x27;s hard to straighten it sometimes!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff on my hair!!</li>
            <li> Too heavy for my hair and I like the Level 2 RECOVERY set much better since it leaves my hair more weightless.</li>
            <li> seems like the same stuff as in the stores at half the price... not too bad!</li>
            <li> Excellent product....my hair is naturally curly, dry and is difficult to detangle.....with this conditioner it detangles my hair easy without  using a large amount....the scent could definitely be improved...but product is good enough to overlook the scent.</li>
            <li> This stuff smells incredible. Even before I opened the package, I could smell it.  It makes my hair feel soft and silky. I have naturally curly hair...so that means a lot to me! My hair is very dry and brittle and this shampoo and conditioner made my hair look great.</li>
            <li> Terribly harsh shampoo and conditioner. Even if you use this once a week and other shampoo and conditioner the rest of the week, this makes your scalp dry and flaky and itchy. I never had a problem with any of that until I used this shampoo and conditioner. I love Bed Head products, but not this one! It won&#x27;t &amp;#34;Resurrect&amp;#34; anything, it will just do more harm than good.</li>
            <li> best shampoo n conditioner... really made my hair strong.. smells so good.. and lasts forever! and i am also a huge fan of the pump!</li>
            <li> The shampoo/conditioner is great. It smells great.  Comes with pumps, so very easy to use.  Received fast from seller.  Great for fine hair for volume.</li>
            <li> Love the product!&lt;br /&gt;It was exactly what I expected!&lt;br /&gt;Arrived on time and in perfect condition!&lt;br /&gt;You can use just a little  and it will do the work!</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner are great for my hair which is over processed. I dye and bleach my hair every eight weeks. I use a blow dryer and flat iron on my hair, but I have to say after using this shampoo and conditioner daily my hair is healthy and soft. No more frizz!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I wanted my hair ombre, with platinum blonde at the bottom. (It was beautiful. It truly was, but oh the sensitivity!) My hair might have been pretty when it was made up and curled but Oh my god, It was crunchy. I read reviews and bought this, with high hopes and fingers crossed. And it really made a difference. I could brush my hair again. I did cut my hair because it needed it but I managed to save a lot of it.  Next time a stylist insists on a complete process in one sitting, I will spend the extra money and tell her to take her time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Saved my hair&lt;br /&gt;Smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Leaves hair silky and easy to brush and manage&lt;br /&gt;Is inexpensive on AMAZON. At Ulta you will pay this much for just one bottle of the shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;For awhile the price did inflate on here? But it seems to be back to normal! Hope it remains that way!&lt;br /&gt;^^^^ That&#x27;s the only con, everything else is fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW for all you fried ladies, I pair this with It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave in conditioner. It really does wonders for me together.</li>
            <li> I have only used it a few times but I can tell a difference since using it. its much more softer  and smoother and I have had less breakage!!!</li>
            <li> After spending hundreds of dollars on hair products that don&#x27;t work i have finally found something that really has repaired my hair and i continue to use it because i love it that much. works great for over processed breaking hair!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it even helps my frizz lay down a little</li>
            <li> The product I recieved looked, smelled, and felt very different from the same product purchased in store at Ulta. It smelled relatively the same, but it was VERY strong compared to the store product which made it burn my nose a bit. The color was not the same shiny white as the store purchase, it had an orange tint and wasn&#x27;t as thick. When I washed my hair with this product, which I only did once, I could feel it stripping my hair rather than coating it and protecting it.&lt;br /&gt;I believe that this product was either expired as some users have suggested or it is not the actual product at all. I&#x27;ve read that some sellers are bottling counterfeit product and selling it on Amazon, but I can&#x27;t say if that&#x27;s what&#x27;s happening here or not.&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I did use this same product from Ulta and I can&#x27;t say that I would recommend it for long term use. It coats your hair and makes it feel pretty waxy which lasts for several days afterwards even after washing with a different shampoo. This really weighed my hair down and my curls just didn&#x27;t sit right after using it, they became stringy and flat. I couldn&#x27;t even use regular mouse on it becuase it made the situation much worse.&lt;br /&gt;If you are willing to risk it and buy the product I would definitely only use it once a week or so and use a different shampoo in between each use to avoid a major waxy buildup.</li>
            <li> Great product. It&#x27;s lasted me 4 months with the big bottles and I probably won&#x27;t need to buy more until next month! I get a lot of compliments on how good my hair smells. It leaves my hair healthy and shiny</li>
            <li> Smells great and works well!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m asian, I have thin hair but I don&#x27;t have the whole ::straight slick hair:: look.&lt;br /&gt;I also have trouble with the fact that my hair gets greasy in less then 24 hours, and after having my first baby I had a lot of problems with hair loss. I also dye my hair (roots) all the time!! ( I guess I don&#x27;t leave my hair a chance to get better :))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was working overseas in Korea for the past 4-5 years, and most of the Korean hair salons are very high end. They only treat/sell customers what they think would be a profit for them so they mostly use products that really work. My hair stylist of 4 years saw me go through the whole &amp;#34;dying-puffy-no-moisture-falling out- hair&amp;#34; for a while and told me to switch between 2 shampoos. One of those 2 were the TIGI bed head resurrection shampoo in the red color. I was skeptical about buying it because it was really expensive in Korea. It was the same sized bottle as it is shown here, but the shampoo itself was almost 60 dollars. Now that I look back I think it was because the whole shipping/processing fee, ehhhh the price.. yes it was a rip off... BUT! I was really happy with the product because of the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m really sensitive to smell and dont even want to use shampoos that dont have any scent to it.... but trust me, this product smells awesome.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;m not a huge fan of conditioner because it kills the small amount of no volume that my hair has; but this doesnt kill it way too much.&lt;br /&gt;- THE SHAMPOO ITSELF without the conditioner is awesome. I use the conditioner mabye twice a week? The shampoo doesnt tangle my thin hair. Thats how good it is. My hair stylist was a well known one in korea; leave this shampoo in your hair for about 3-5 minutes without washing it out and it gives you a healthier shine. She mentioned that people tend to shampoo and wash it right out, which doesnt help the hair at all.&lt;br /&gt;-Dont need to use a whole lot for a good wash. I have longgggg hair so I do needto pump it a good 2-3 times, but when I did have short hair, it was like a pump and a half?? which made the bottle last for a few months!&lt;br /&gt;-Def. helps with colored hair as well.&lt;br /&gt;-Will kill frizz. I have so much frizz....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the product is great. There is another product that I highly recommend but I couldnt find it anywhere in the states. It was hard to find in Korea, too, so I dont know where to even look for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope my review helped! :)</li>
            <li> Ordered. And received just the shampoo bottle...</li>
            <li> I have been using the shampoo and conditioner makes for the last seven months and I still have a half a bottle full of each. You only need about a dime size amount and that goes along way. This is a great shampoo and conditioner mix. It has a great smell as well!!</li>
            <li> My daughter has very curly hair/ highlighted, and she straightens it.  This product is great and keeps her hair beautiful.</li>
            <li> Loooovvvveee, this deal. Great buy and the shampoo, conditioner combo makes hair very soft &amp; shiny. My daughter has super think hair for a 4 year old &amp; this is the best thing I&#x27;ve used on her hair to help with tangles &amp; static control!!</li>
            <li> Great product! Helps my hair continues to feel like hair despite dying it all the time! Also it doesn&#x27;t have a flowery smell to it which is great for me!</li>
            <li> very good products&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;very good products</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo! Leaves your hair feeling soft and moisturized.  I have seen a great difference in my hair since using this product.  Smells amazing!</li>
            <li> After moving to a dry area after living in a humid area for quite a few years, I noticed my usual product wasn&#x27;t working on my hair very well. It was getting very dry and brittle and seemed to be breaking or falling out. I also color my hair occasionally, and swim almost daily (but don&#x27;t get my hair wet in the pool often). After reading the reviews, I thought I would give this stuff a shot. I&#x27;m very happy with the results. My hair is soft and shiny again, and feels and looks much healthier. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down either. I&#x27;m not super crazy about the strawberry scent, but it isn&#x27;t terrible and I can live with it for these results!</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived but the conditioner was spilled and both items were covered in the stuff.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo/conditioner ever! Smells soooo good. I hope it&#x27;s always around!</li>
            <li> I lovvvvvve this shampoo/conditioner!!!! Besides the fact that it smells heavenly....my hair is a million times healthier than before. It feels softer, stronger and looks really healthy too. Buy ittttttt</li>
            <li> Excellent. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I am a hair product addicted person! I have used many various shampoos and conditioners from several different brands. I give this a high rating because it smells great, works great, and the conditioner does help make hair feel soft and smooth. I highly suggest this set.</li>
            <li> I have been using Bed Head&#x27;s Moisture Maniac for years. It smelled awesome (like a combo of sweet tarts and mango), and always left my hair very silky and healthy. I was sad to find out that that line was canceled (including Self Absorbed, which was a step down moisturizing-wise). I emailed the company to verify this, and they said Resurrection was the closest equivalent to Moisture Maniac. Based on the way it makes my hair feel, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s true. However, the smell is just blah and more chemically (not awful, but not great. I want my yummy smell back!!!). I have fine hair, and wear it long and straight. Neither product weighs it down or seemed to heavy, despite being their most moisturizing combos in their spectrum. It is super easy to brush out my hair after washing. If you liked Self Absorbed, then the equivalent replacement would be Urban Antidotes Recovery (blue bottle). I tried their green bottle Re-energize (only because my local discount salon had a great sale, and it&#x27;s the only one they had), and it wasn&#x27;t nearly moisturizing enough. You can still find Moisture Maniac and Self Absorbed online, but at a higher price than the Urban Antidotes line, unfortunately. I love these liter sizes, because they last months (even for long hair) and are a better value than the regular bottle sizes.</li>
            <li> Product as described and VERY affordable price.  This duo leaves my hair feeling light and silky! I have medium to thick shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff is awesome. It smells like candy and leaves my hair super soft. The shampoo does have sulphates in it, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s harsh at all. I have bleached curly hair, so I&#x27;m pretty sensitive to products that might be drying, and this isn&#x27;t. The conditioner leaves my hair really silky, too. The smell lasts on the hair, which is nice. I&#x27;ll definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> This shampoo and conditioner smells great, and my hair feels noticeably silkier after just using the shampoo. I only gave it 4/5 stars because I have used Sebastian Drench in the past and liked that a little bit better. I defiantly recommend this product, though.</li>
            <li> My hair was a bit dry and breaking from the chlorine in the city water where I live now, and I color it every three months as well.  This shampoo and conditioner makes it feel soft and silky again, and the apple scent is very nice too.</li>
            <li> Purchased as gift for my daughter.Excellent service. Excellent price. Thank you! She was delighted and very satisfied.would definitely continue purchasing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been bleaching and coloring my hair for a decade, and this is the only shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve tried that makes it feel healthy and manageable again.</li>
            <li> Pretty surprised. Did not expect to see such a drastic difference. Works on my colored and graying wire hairs! Yay!</li>
            <li> I really like it. I have not seen my hair come back yet but it&#x27;s getting there. Description: amazing-awesome-love it!</li>
            <li> These made my hair feel awful: dry, unhealthy... I think they plumped it up by roughing it up. It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> I was worried when I ordered these after reading some of the other reviews. Others had said they thought they got a bad bottle. Mine are great. My daughter and I share them. They smell nice, it lathers great. The smell stays with your hair. Idon&#x27;t have any negatives to write. It&#x27;s good stuff!</li>
            <li> Great shampoo and conditioner. Smells great, and makes your hair smooth.</li>
            <li> This works really well on my overly processed hair. I normally purchase in store, but Amazon was such a good deal. The last set I bought lasted 6 months with washing every two days. Not too heavy on fine hair.</li>
            <li> Best shampoo and conditioner anyone can use for any type hair.</li>
            <li> My hair dresser used this on me at her salon and I&#x27;ve been in love ever since. It lathers great and I love the smell. My hair is thin so I need all the help I can get and this worked so much better then my last shampoo!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser couldn&#x27;t tell I had a perm after using this shampoo/conditioner for a couple of weeks. I love the scent and it lasted me about 3 months (I have long hair).</li>
            <li> My brother said I looked like the &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; in a shampoo commercial because my hair was so dry and damaged. I started using this with a weekly condition treatment and my hair is so soft and awesome. Now I look like an after ;)</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ve tried others and I always come back to this one.</li>
            <li> This set cleans your hair but does not dry it out. Definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> It doesnt smell BAD like the reviews I&#x27;ve read. Ive been using this for about a few weeks now every day and my hair feels great. I was using the BLUE BOTTLES before this and they are damage level 2. I would stick with the Blue Recovery brand as it smells SOOOOOOOOO AWESOME!!!! AND HONESTLY, FOR THE SAME PRICE, ID RATHER IT SMELL BETTER. The damage level feels the same on my hair.</li>
            <li> Great quality ive ordered this product twice and am very happy with it i got to have my hair shampooed with this at hair salon when i asked what it was they gave me info i could not find it anywhere do i looked here sure enough here it was and its sealed when they send it to you!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a natural blonde but I still have always gotten highlights. After missing a few appointments, I tried John Frieda&#x27;s Blonde spray to try and buy myself a few more weeks. HUGE MISTAKE!!!! It&#x27;s been over a year since I ruined my hair and I&#x27;ve been paying for it ever since. I&#x27;ve tried every shampoo, mask, keratin treatments I could get my hands on. None of them helped. The first day I used this four of my coworkers noticed and commented on how nice my hair looked. They insisted that I had been to the salon and had something done but they just couldn&#x27;t put a finger on what it was.</li>
            <li> Smells nice, works decently. Not my favorite of the Bed Head line, but not bad. (I have naturally curly, highlighted hair.)</li>
            <li> I am a hair fanatic, I love Bed Head products but this just looked nasty on my hair, I have long naturally straight blonde hair, I used the kind in the blue bottle I loved it! This was just disgusting, and the smell of it was so sweet smelling it made me sick.. I was very displeased..</li>
            <li> My wife goes through this stuff like tis water so its great that its about 1/3 the cost on amazon. The product is as she says &amp;#34;Like OMG its like totally the best&amp;#34; I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> I use this product almost every day and I like it a lot.  It has a nice scent.  I use mostly Bed Head hair products.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is fantastic.  I even ordered some for my mom for Christmas, becuase I know she is going to love it as much as I do.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It has made my hair super soft after 3 uses! It smells really good too! Recommended to anyone with dry and brittle hair.</li>
            <li> My hair hasn&#x27;t looked or felt this great in years.  I love this product.  It smells good and my hair looks shiny and full.  I am so very glad I switched.</li>
            <li> I really like this product. I love the sweet smell and how soft my hair is when it dries. I was a little worried the first couple of times I used it because my hair was frizzy and didn&#x27;t feel that great, but I kept using it and after the 3rd time of using it, my hair started to feel awesome. I&#x27;m really happy  I kept using it. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
            <li> once you use this shampoo conditioner you will never use another. not the least expensive but you get more than you pay for</li>
            <li> My sister recommended this to me after I thought I had damaged my hair from a summer of enjoying the pool.  My hair had begun to feel like straw and look course, stiff and fuzzy no matter which conditioner I used. Within the first use, my hair was restored to youthful, bouncy, silky hair. I fell in love with my hair again! After 6 months of continued use I consistently only have good hair days. Every once in awhile I am in a situation where I have to use a difference conditioner and am always reminded of how incredible it is.  My hair is shoulder length, fine and slightly wavy.</li>
            <li> I highlighted my hair a couple times within 6 mos so it dried out to the point where my conditioners like Oribe (very expensive) just didn&#x27;t work. I also bought the beautiful color by Oribe which cost me $45 a bottle. Way to expensive. Then I saw this combo for $23 and wanted to give it a try. I got it today and washed my hair immediately and had high expectation because of all the good reviews I read prior to purchasing this product. Well....it did not let me down. Shampoo smelled great and had lots of moisture. Then I used the conditioner and used the Pro Wet brush and the brush slide on through my hair. This stuff is amazing. I love the conditioner. After just one use, I can tell my hair feels much better. I can&#x27;t wait to use it again and get my hair smooth, tangle free, shiny and healthy. Try this if you have dry hair due to colors and highlights. you won&#x27;t regret it. And you can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
            <li> amazing on my over processed bleach blonde hair, makes it smooth and soft without weighing it down</li>
            <li> Great price, excellent shampoo.</li>
            <li> So far I love this shampoo and conditioner! I noticed the change the first i used it and i will say i loved how it felt wet and the way it felt when i blow dried it. Love it!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner. I have curly hair and it leaves them soft and smelling all fruity!</li>
            <li> I have thick, but fairly damaged long hair.  I straighten my hair every day, but typically only wash it every couple days.  It has a little bit of damage, but has been pretty dull and dry.  I tried this product, which smells amazing by the way, and literally just after the first use my husband and my coworkers commented on how shiny my hair looked.  I love it!  I would definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product from a cosmetic store. It left my hair feeling healthier - smoother and softer. I ordered the Resurrection shampoo and conditioner combo because the product works well when used together. It smells refreshing and I use it every day. It does not dry out my hair. The conditioner is not as soft like many other conditioners, but it adds enough softness to the hair making combing easy - I have curly hair. I also color my hair and the shampoo has not affected my hair color like other shampoos have before. I will continue to purchase this item from the Bed Head line. My daughter also uses the product and she loves it. a</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something a little different.  My hair is strange, if I don&#x27;t switch shampoos every so often, my hair becomes heavy and listless.  I tried the Bed Head this time.  I read reviews they were pretty even on the likes and dislikes,  I think I am more in the middle.  It smells great, but I think it should be used more for a person who wants that dramatic hairstyle everyday.  It does make your hair feel a bit like straw, but softens after you brush and blow dry.  I keeps my hair looking nice.</li>
            <li> Not only did this shampoo and conditioner restore some very dry hair, but it also calmed my scalp down which had been irritated by another shampoo (no names mentioned). I cannot imagine using anything else on my hair.</li>
            <li> Made my hair feel soft and shiny without looking greasy.  The smell is wonderful, sort of a strawberry scent.  Only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it leaves a build up on scalp if used too many days on a row so I use a clarifying shampoo every couple of days.</li>
            <li> First off let me start on how much I love the scent. Very good price and a lot of product for the price. Leaves hair smooth and just better off than how it was before.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo/conditioner set. It makes my hair so soft. I will never not use bedhead products in the future.</li>
            <li> I have to buy this for my wife and daughter and they both love this product.  I can&#x27;t find it any cheaper anywhere else so I buy it on Amazon. Would recommend for sure.</li>
            <li> smells good, cleans fine, don&#x27;t really have any complaints, however I expected my hair to stay in better condition/not so dry since my stylist told me these were best to use after coloring to keep my hair from being dry and to hold the color. I feel like my hair is a little dry.</li>
            <li> Took the product a little longer to arrive than I expected, but I LOVE the product and the price is pretty similar to what I pay in my salon.</li>
            <li> smells great and keeps my hair soft</li>
            <li> Came fast, smelled good, made my hair super soft and glossy. Helped a bit with color loss too. Worth the price, did what it said :-)</li>
            <li> I dye my hair frequently and completely bleach it 2-3 times a year.  This leaves my hair a little damaged normally.  I started using this product and I can&#x27;t believe how soft it feels.  I highly recommend it.  The color seems to stay sharp with this regimen too.</li>
            <li> The pump was broken :(</li>
            <li> I know this shampoo is expensive, but it works great.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve only just used this product once today, but I can already see a difference in my hair! I have a combination of dry/oily 3A curly hair (oily on the scalp and dry at the ends) and I can tell that it&#x27;s going to make a huge difference in my hair. It looks healthier, shinier (but not oily), and more voluminous than it did before. I live in Florida so I&#x27;m always surrounded by humidity and my hair barely frizzed! The shampoo lathered wonderfully and the conditioner was very creamy and made it easy to untangle my hair in the shower. I&#x27;m very excited to use it again and see a greater improvement on the look and feel of my hair!</li>
            <li> My hair feels like new. I adore this shampoo on my poor hair that I have been dye-abusing for over ten years.</li>
            <li> Love Bed Head it makes my Hair Feel Great!</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t strong enough. I really do like the scent, but i wish it were more lasting and strong.</li>
            <li> love this shampoo and conditioner combo. Makes dry curly hair manageable</li>
            <li> Product is just great.</li>
            <li> I received this about 4 or 5 days ago and have used it twice since. I absolutely LOVE it and have noticed my hair feeling so much healthier already!! I have done so much to my hair: I&#x27;ve bleached the heck out of it when I went ombre (I have originally black hair so I had to use strong and a lot of bleach to lift the color of my entire head to a light brown/bright blonde color). Then after that, I stuck to red and the dye that I use has bleach in it as well because it is made specifically for dark hair. So I use developer and the dye--the whole enchilada. The ends of my hair were FRIED and just after the second wash with this shampoo/conditioner, they look and feel less damaged and my hair just smells FANTASTIC. I am extremely pleased with this shampoo/conditioner, especially since I thought I might have to cut my hair. This is saving it!!</li>
            <li> My hair is totally white and sometimes or rather very dry this shampoo adds body, oil and love the aroma</li>
            <li> I love the smell but yet have not seen the results for couple weeks now, my hair continues to look frizzy</li>
            <li> Great price for the same product.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t use this my hair gets super tangly. It is perfect for constant tangle problems.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this shampoo several times my hair has not improved. The  direction aren&#x27;t good. The cost is too much.&lt;br /&gt;The condition does not say how long you should leave it on your hair. I&#x27;m very disappointed with this product.</li>
            <li> I absolute love my shampoo conditioner!!!!! Worth the price!!!!!!!! Would do business with in the future, and would recommend to others.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite shampoo and conditioner to use at the salon, it smells so good, everyone asks what it is.</li>
            <li> I only used this once. I hate the smell and the texture. It is nobody&#x27;s fault.  I just wanted to see what it was like.  The delivery was excellent, but the product is not for me.  Thank you anyway!!!</li>
            <li> I like this shampoo/conditioner. A little bit of both goes a long way, so I won&#x27;t have to buy a new set anytime soon! I think my hair has grown faster since using it-- not to mention gotten softer to the touch!</li>
            <li> My hair gets a workout &amp; this really seems to make a difference. My stylist even noticed my hair seemed to be in better shape than usual!!</li>
            <li> Good stuff. this shampoo and conditioner is always consistent never had any issues out of it. use this shampoo and conditioner for years</li>
            <li> I used wen for years becasue I have bleached thick long hair and it was the only thing that used to keep it from feeling brittle or getting frizzy. Well, it just wasn&#x27;t cutting it anymore and after reading the reviews I thought I&#x27;d give these a try especially at this price. Well, I love them. I get sad when I travel and I dont have it with me. I&#x27;ll have to get travel bottles. they smell fantastic and really have made my hair so much better.</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product.  Everyone I talk to raves about it.  My niece wanted some for Christmas and the local salon was out of it, so luckily found it online here and ordered it.</li>
            <li> This is the best smelling shampoo/conditioner I have ever used and it makes my hair silky soft. Definitely buying this again.</li>
            <li> I have finally found another shampoo/conditioner that I absolutely love. I have really long, thick and wavy hair, which means I get tangles and frizz all of the time. For years, I have been using Matrix Sleek Look (which I still love), but was looking for another brand to try. My hair stylist friend suggested that it was always a good idea to use another brand every so often so that your hair doesn&#x27;t get build-up. When I stumbled on this one, I was ecstatic. Not only does it smell great (which is good for my sensitive sinuses), but it conditions my hair well and leaves it feeling very soft. The only thing is that it is a little more watery than what I am used to with Sleek Look, but that isn&#x27;t really a problem and just means that I leave a little more conditioner on my hair. Now, TIGI Head Resurrection is my main go-to for hair product.</li>
            <li> I love BedHead, so to get this set I was really excited especially due to previous reviews. I&#x27;ve used both for about a week now and I&#x27;d have to say that my roots are a lot shinier and softer, but the ends of my hair are unchanged. They are still dry and frizzy from coloring over two months ago (professionally done) and winter weather. I really enjoy the smell, I just hope the conditioner will start to actually smooth my ends.</li>
            <li> Great product rinse clean and keeps hair soft helps keep dye in hair longer too great price and great shipping will purchase again</li>
            <li> Normally, I do not like Tigi products - sure, they have uber cute packaging and smell fantastic, but they typically just don&#x27;t perform well enough to be a go-to for my hair type. Resurrection (Level 3) is an exception! Surprisingly, I LOVE this; it really works for me!!!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thick, coarse, wavy and is naturally jet black, but coloured copper red every 6 weeks with 40 volume developer on the root and 20 on the ends; I never let it air dry and to make matters worse, I flat iron daily. I know, I know, that&#x27;s a lot of damage!!!! Bad me!&lt;br /&gt;Since using this the few problem pieces of hair that were becoming the texture of cotton candy are noticeably healthier; they feel and look much better! I was worried I&#x27;d have to go shorter soon, but I won&#x27;t have to get more than a trim next time thanks to Resurrection! It comes in three different levels based on the amount of damage you have; I choose the maximum- level 3.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months. It has the yummy, sweet fruity/candy smell you&#x27;d anticipate from Tigi and doesn&#x27;t leave any film or cause greasiness, which is often a problem I experience with moisturizing/hydrating/repairing products. Next to my beloved L&#x27;anza shampoos/conditioners, this one has become an unexpected favourite.</li>
            <li> I saw this shampoo and conditioner at Ross for a really good price so I decided to try it out and I was so happy that I did! My hair (at the time, i recently cut off 14 inches and donated it) was so soft, and silky. I could run my hands through it with out any tangles! It also smells really good. And it makes your hair super healthy and wonderful. Try it out you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> Love this product. Just like the other reviews hair is soft not brittle</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the shampoo for a while I love it I usually buy it from a big retail chain I found it here for way less money.  But received and conditioner top had came off and a lot of the conditioner had leaked out</li>
            <li> I have frizzy, curly hair. The shampoo is great! it&#x27;s thick, doesn&#x27;t tangle, &amp; smells like strawberries. I feel like I could almost brush my hair without conditioner with this stuff. Very thick &amp; moisturizing! The conditioner is thick, but I didn&#x27;t really like the smell. I&#x27;d buy again though!</li>
            <li> I have used this product everyday for a week and my hair does not seem to have improved.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly suprised with this.  I am a die hard fan of Brunette Goddess (the old formula) specially because of the smell (cookies), so it&#x27;s hard to beat it.  The smell of this one is strong (candy smell), it&#x27;s not bad and it lingers which is great. My only complaint is that since TIGI changed their packaging, it seems they changed their formula too. The S &amp; C seems more watery than before, the formulas used to be more concentrated.  It took 4 pumps of conditioner to untangle my hair after shampoo. I wasn&#x27;t expecting much until I started seeing my hair dry and it dried out nicely. It left my hair nice, soft and frizz free.  I also noticed the same usual volume of TIGI, it doesn&#x27;t weight hair down.  Btw, I don&#x27;t blow dry my hair and it&#x27;s chemically treated.  Good product for good price.  This should last a long time.</li>
            <li> This is the only shampoo and conditioner I have used for 4 years!!! It&#x27;s the best!! I have very long hair, just a couple inches from my butt. I highlight it religiously every 5 weeks. Everyone is always asking what my secret is, to having such long, healthy hair. I absolutely give the credit it to this shampoo and conditioner. A handful of times I have ran out over the past few years, and I have had to use something different for a few days. I can tell right away the difference!!! Now... I DO NOT run out, I buy it in bulk. It is the absolute best!!!!! I cringe at the thought of them discontinuing it someday. If you buy this you will not be disappointed!!! It&#x27;s worth every penny!!!!</li>
            <li> Best smell ever. It made my hair look better. I bought the CATWALK brands and this beat them hands down. I will buy again</li>
            <li> It is awful....It makes my hair feel very waxy.  I definitely would not purchase it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks, but no thanks</li>
            <li> My hair loves it! Smells great, no more tangles, and leaves my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible. It left my scalp oily as if I hadn&#x27;t washed my hair in weeks and it left my ends dry. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> This is a product I often use but has become unavailable locally. I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. For damaged or very dry hair the Tigi collection is excellent to rebuild strength in your hair. While  the conditioner is recommended for co-wash , this is an expensive product and you might want to only use as a co-wash once every couple weeks . When my grandchildren visit this is the product I prefer to use when co-washing their hair. . For fine hair that has been bleached, the shampoo and conditioner are very moisturizing and I&#x27;ve had stylists state my hair looks healthy despite having been bleached. I firmly believe this shampoo and conditioner are responsible for that.</li>
            <li> I live in a climate where there is little to no humidity. This product works so well. I love the way my hair looks and feels. I will definitely buy this again!</li>
            <li> Great price for the duo. My damaged hair is finally smooth again! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> great shampoo for dry damaged hair</li>
            <li> Favorite shampoo and conditioner! Bottle last several months. Smells great.</li>
            <li> Love love this product smells good repaired my hair well buy again never going back to any other shampoo conditioner works wonders</li>
            <li> i really liked the scent of this shampoo i have use it a couple of time and it leaves my hair ok but not as good as fekkai shampoo and conditiones. i think i will eep using it a little more and see if it rescues my fantasy color hair, but the first impression so far is just a little better than ok, i think the john frieda shampoos are same as this one, Fekkai is a winner for me, but this seemed to be a good inversion, not so much, also one of the bottles came open and there was a mess in the box, the pump doenst help, because of the movements on the shipping got spilled :( i will keep you posted after more use of this product. 1 pump s enough of the shampoo for my shoulder lenght hair, but i need 2 or 3 of the conditioner.</li>
            <li> The product itself is very nice. It smells great and leaves my hair feeling very soft, however both bottles are damaged. When the product arrived, the shampoo lid was not completely on, so nearly half of the product was all over the place and was wasted. The top of the conditioner does not work at all. It won&#x27;t stay open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I could, I&#x27;d go back and order from somewhere else.</li>
            <li> Love the smell. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair feeling dry.</li>
            <li> Makes hair silky smooth but didn&#x27;t notice extra volume. Happy with product.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter. This product was recommended for her hair. She is a swimmer and tried to dye her hair resulting in some seriously damaged hair. Bought product on Amazon as it was less than at salon, love Love LOVE the results! Her hair looks and feels so much healthier!</li>
            <li> This is an amazing shampoo/conditioner! I&#x27;ve been trying to get my hair back up to par for the longest time. I&#x27;ve tried so many different things and nothing seems to work. I got these and wow. I am in love. They have made my hair so silky and bouncy. It just looks amazingly healthy. Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I actually really really do. It does have a semi fruit smell, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s pungent or over powering. I like it. I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since I was about 13 (so for 13 years now) and it has taken some massive abuse. Lots of bleaching, funky color dying, etc. It was so bad that I had to cut off around 12 inches. This has done wonders though. I really recommend it. I&#x27;m not sure if I would buy from this seller again though. It could of been a fluke, but when I got my package, the bag that it came in was full of shampoo. The bottle either came loose during shipping or it was never properly tightened. Around 1/4th of my bottle was dumped into the bag. Waste. Oh well though. I&#x27;d probably give them another shot just because I like the product so much. Also, I have naturally semi wavy-semi straight, baby fine hair.</li>
            <li> This shampoo is very worth it if you lighten your hair. It helps bring back life. Also it smells so amazing.</li>
            <li> This is a good price for these jumbo bottles. They have lasted for a long time. The conditioner is very heavy, but doesn&#x27;t weigh my fine hair down.</li>
            <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner so far.  My hair had become straw like and brittle due to coloring and flat ironing.  It smells great and has left my hair feeling much softer after just a couple of uses.</li>
            <li> I only use this shampoo and conditioner. But it is very expensive at my local store so when I saw this deal I was very excited! My package was delivered wrong and left out in the cold for 2 days when I asked it not to be left. So Amazon refunded my money but I should have just asked for another set because that set was frozen after being left out in the snow storm and when it thawed out it felt very thick and the color was off so I had to throw both out and I was disappointed  :(</li>
