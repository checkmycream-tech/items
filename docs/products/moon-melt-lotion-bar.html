            <li>After having found I can purchase it though Amazon, and use it liberally, nails, hands feet, arms, legs, and my skin is so much better.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Wish it were in a dispenser (like a deodorant) or a push-up popsicle, so I could hang on to it better.</li>

            <li>So much easier than cream or lotion, and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li>This lotion bar is very good for moistening and softening skin, especially on the backs of your hands.</li>
            <li>It also has a lovely light scent.  </li>

            <li>It is wonderful for dry skin and has a light (honey-almond) scent to it.</li>
            <li>And since I love their project so much I was thrilled to see that they also sold online at Amazon.com.</li>
            <li>, this is fabulous, I can use it anywhere (even on a plane), and I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaks or drying out, or too strong of a scent, or ingredients that are drying.</li>
            <li>I just love the ingredients, so pure and moisturizing, it&#x27;s sure to help her skin and who knows, hopefully bring a smile when she sees it in her care package!</li>
            <li>I bought this because so many others loved it, and I wanted something organic to curb my dry shins and feet.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough amazing things about it!</li>
            <li>(thinking earth friendly)</li>
            <li>The scent is very pleasant and not strong at all.</li>
            <li>Great for hands, nails, cuticle, feet and dry heels.</li>
            <li>Great for cracked skin and dry cuticles.  </li>
            <li>The skin does look a bit greasy right after the application; however, it absorbs all of the lotion and looks gorgeous and feels super soft.</li>
            <li>Great for my rough feet in summer</li>
            <li>I keep mine near a sink, hold it in my hands for a couple of minutes kind of easing it around, and</li>
            <li>But this just sits on top of my skin, and is very greasy to me.</li>
            <li>Use your &#x27;lotion&#x27; when you want a quick fix.</li>
            <li>It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin and cuticles, but it kinda smells like play doh at first.</li>
            <li>It is worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>First I thought it was kind of pricey; however, I was intrigued by the idea of a solid piece of lotion.</li>
            <li>Only thing better would be replacement bars in foil or paper, so</li>
            <li>I first purchased in Washington at a flea market and have been buying it ever since.  </li>
            <li>this is great, but other than that I shall stick to regular lotion.</li>
            <li>Only with they&#x27;d bring back the original Lip Treat:)</li>
            <li>There is something nice and calming about holding the lotion bar in your hands, having it melt a little and rubbing it in.</li>
            <li>It really stays on.  </li>
            <li>and I think this product really helps lighten them.  </li>
            <li>I stumbled upon this lotion bar at Whole Foods.</li>
            <li>I have very clammy palms and</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this lotion bar.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m on board with most of the other reviewers so far.  </li>
            <li>I can get right back to work on my computer or phone and not feel greasy.</li>
            <li>I had bought one from them in the pacific northwest when I used to live there.</li>
            <li>I got this item as a gift, and though I had never liked the &#x27;bar lotions&#x27; so much, I began using this one and am pleased as punch.  </li>
            <li>this product has gotten rid of my dry skin and cracked feet the bar is so nice and much easier than thick creams.</li>
            <li>It makes my dry feet stay soft.</li>

            <li> Great products for chapped cuticles</li>
            <li> I love this lotion.  It really stays on.  Very light scent (lemon)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on board with most of the other reviewers so far.  I got this item as a gift, and though I had never liked the &#x27;bar lotions&#x27; so much, I began using this one and am pleased as punch.  Read the little box the tin comes in and follow their suggestions for use...I keep mine near a sink, hold it in my hands for a couple of minutes kind of easing it around, and sure enough, the bar softens deliciously. At first it seems a little thick, but within five minutes it has absorbed and will stay that way even through a washing or two. Don&#x27;t expect this stuff to work like &#x27;lotion.&#x27;  It doesn&#x27;t, and is likely what kept me from using the bar stuff before now.  Use your &#x27;lotion&#x27; when you want a quick fix. This item works at leisure time  around the house and hunkered down like I am now in TN single digit temps.  And it has helped my often irritated cuticles immensely.  I love this company.  Only with they&#x27;d bring back the original Lip Treat:)</li>
            <li> As a massage therapist, I am constantly washing my hands.  Dry cuticles plague me, this is fabulous, I can use it anywhere (even on a plane), and I don&#x27;t have to worry about leaks or drying out, or too strong of a scent, or ingredients that are drying. Rubbing a little extra into my cuticles helps keep them from splitting and snagging.</li>
            <li> Just bought this cream for a friend undergoing chemo treatments. I just love the ingredients, so pure and moisturizing, it&#x27;s sure to help her skin and who knows, hopefully bring a smile when she sees it in her care package!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this bar, smells great and softens skin.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product while my family and I were on vacation in Seattle, WA. I bought mine at Pike&#x27;s Place Market where Moon Valley Organics had a kiosk set up. I love this lotion bar! It is non-greasy and absorbs quickly into my skin. I can get right back to work on my computer or phone and not feel greasy. It is wonderful for dry skin and has a light (honey-almond) scent to it. I highly recommend this lotion bar. It&#x27;s even better because it is organic.</li>
            <li> I use it on my feet at night, then put socks on. So much easier than cream or lotion, and it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I noticed some dark spots, on my face and I think this product really helps lighten them.  I like not using harsh products when it can be avoided especially on my face.</li>
            <li> Lasted me for over a year. I have it at my desk at work and use it Mon-Fri once a day (more in winters).&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hands feel great after use. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best hand/feet bar I have ever used. Great for hands, nails, cuticle, feet and dry heels. It even promotes the growth and strength of my nails. I have tried a lot of salves, hand cream and ointments. Nothing is as effective as this.  I prefer the Lemon-Vanilla fragrance.</li>
            <li> I stumbled upon this lotion bar at Whole Foods. First I thought it was kind of pricey; however, I was intrigued by the idea of a solid piece of lotion. I was advised at the store to give it a try, and if I did not like it, I could always return it (that&#x27;s their policy to keep the customer happy). Well, I thought I had nothing to lose. I bought it. And I am happy that I did. The skin does look a bit greasy right after the application; however, it absorbs all of the lotion and looks gorgeous and feels super soft. The scent is very pleasant and not strong at all. Love this lotion bar! It is worth every penny. Totally recommend it!!!</li>
            <li> I love this lotion bar. It&#x27;s a staple in my purse. I love the feel of it and the smell.</li>
            <li> Love it!! Wonderful light scent, smooth even absorption, delightful design. My skin is super sensitive, cant use many moisturizers, but this is wonderful! Only thing better would be replacement bars in foil or paper, so I dont have a ton of empty tins. (thinking earth friendly)</li>
            <li> I use it daily as a moisturizer actually anywhere on my body.  Before going to sleep at night, I sink my fingernails into the bar to get some under my nails to moisturize them.  I also massage my cuticles and hands.  My nails have ceased to flake and peel the way they used to. - I&#x27;ve given them as gifts to my friends who have been equally captivated by the product.</li>
            <li> I bought this lotion bar in Seattle some years ago and have used it regularly, especially through the winter.  Great for cracked skin and dry cuticles.  So glad to find it online and ordered it for myself and for gifts.  It also has a lovely light scent.  Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product has gotten rid of my dry skin and cracked feet the bar is so nice and much easier than thick creams. Can&#x27;t say enough amazing things about it!</li>
            <li> Moon valley organics is a great company, I completely adore their lotion bar. I had bought one from them in the pacific northwest when I used to live there. And since I love their project so much I was thrilled to see that they also sold online at Amazon.com. So I have since then purchased several extras. There is something nice and calming about holding the lotion bar in your hands, having it melt a little and rubbing it in. I recommend trying this product for anybody who likes to have high-quality hand lotions.</li>
            <li> This lotion bar is very good for moistening and softening skin, especially on the backs of your hands.</li>
            <li> Love this product.  It makes my dry feet stay soft.</li>
            <li> it was a gift for a friend..I had some and she was always using it.. so I found that Amazon carried it.. and she is as happy as a bug in a rug..&lt;br /&gt;Thank-you Amazon!!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  I first purchased in Washington at a flea market and have been buying it ever since.  Great for my rough feet in summer</li>
            <li> Love it! I have very clammy palms and this lotion sinks right in without leaving a grease slick. It hydrates my burning, chapped hands from working in the health care industry. It&#x27;s tin case is very handy to keep in my purse or scrub pocket.</li>
            <li> I have used this lotion bar, since my husband gave it to me, after having gone to Seattle on a business trip. I was very careful to use it, due to living in Japan, and being afraid I couldn&#x27;t get more. After having found I can purchase it though Amazon, and use it liberally, nails, hands feet, arms, legs, and my skin is so much better. This stuff is great! It keeps calluses away, and cuticles too. I would dip daily in it if I could.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have already given it to three friends and must purchase more for myself! Wonderful. My hands were softer after one use.</li>
            <li> Love his this works!  Very nice product!  Makes skin feel like silk!</li>
            <li> Love this lotion! Wish it were in a dispenser (like a deodorant) or a push-up popsicle, so I could hang on to it better.</li>
            <li> I bought this because so many others loved it, and I wanted something organic to curb my dry shins and feet. But this just sits on top of my skin, and is very greasy to me. If I want that glistening leg look for when I go out this is great, but other than that I shall stick to regular lotion.</li>
            <li> Love this bar. I keep it nearby the sink (kitchen and bath) and apply it after drying my hands, or before doing dishes. Also, it helps keep those cuticles in line.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin and cuticles, but it kinda smells like play doh at first.</li>
