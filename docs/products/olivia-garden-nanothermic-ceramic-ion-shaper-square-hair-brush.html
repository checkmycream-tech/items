            <li>I thought it was going to be smaller than it is, but it works fine, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li>It really works well and smooths the hair nicely.  </li>
            <li>Hair looks shiny and feels smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the brush three times so far and have loved it every time</li>
            <li>and also get its work done super</li>
            <li>This really does save your hair - and is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>the materials used  by olivia garden seem very good because I could dry my hair faster  and easier and could round  it nicely.</li>
            <li>so I had to write a review about it (something I rarely do).</li>
            <li>The only problem I have with this brush is that the top gets very hot and could burn.  </li>
            <li>It is very easy to work with bought the larger one and didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li>When i blow out my hair is makes my hair smooth and soft...</li>
            <li>I love that the air circulates through it as well as around it, and I like the extra bit of lift that I get from the squared off edges.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t love that it&#x27;s square, instead of round but overall a good brush that lasts.</li>
            <li>It really seems to work and the hair style lasted for quite a while!</li>
            <li>It also does not do as good of a job with the ends as a round brush.  </li>
            <li>but I use it on the warm setting not hot.</li>
            <li>I liked the iTools Blue Wave round (square) brush WAY better</li>
            <li>I had never been able to get the hang of the twirl and blow dry like my hairdresser does, but I bought this brush</li>
            <li>It really does the job.</li>
            <li>I usually put the hair dryer on the highest heat setting which makes the top of the brush very hot.  </li>
            <li>This brush really cuts down on static electricity when I am blow-drying my hair.  </li>
            <li>I noticed that my hairstylist uses a brush that loos like this, with the square barrel, and she always gets more lift in my fine thin hair than I do at home.</li>
            <li>I still highly recommend the brush.</li>
            <li>The Olivia Garden round brush I have was a much better purchase.</li>
            <li>It has a lot better grip than round brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>Easy to grip, doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, and seems to help dry my thick hair more quickly than other brushes.</li>
            <li>I have a professional hair dryer</li>
            <li>This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this brand, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Also, you have to be careful using it because when it gets too hot</li>
            <li>Smooths it right down.</li>
            <li>My hair is abundant,  thick and not easy to brush</li>
            <li>Where I find that it fails a little is that the lack of stiffness in the bristles and/or the shortness in their length make it hard for them to grasp my baby fine blond hair so that I can get a good wrap on it when blow</li>

            <li> Great for grabbing hair during a blow out! Very happy with this purchase, but I was hoping it would reduce static a little bit more. Oh well! Still a very good brush, and I would definitely buy more from this brand.</li>
            <li> the first time i feel my hair is shining!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! and also get its work done super fast!&lt;br /&gt;i started to find a good brush since i was 12, and now i&#x27;m 18 finally found a great one.</li>
            <li> This is the only brush that I seem to easily use!!! It makes doing a blowout on your own head so easy!!!</li>
            <li> Best blow dry brush ever! I noticed that my hairstylist uses a brush that loos like this, with the square barrel, and she always gets more lift in my fine thin hair than I do at home. So I went on Amazon and searched for a brush with a squared barrel and gold in color like hers. This was it! Now I get the same results that she gets! I was amazed at the difference a brush could make.</li>
            <li> Excellent hair brush.  It really works well and smooths the hair nicely.  This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this brand, and highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I like the brush but I have long hair so it gets caught up in the handle...and snags my hair. Poor design! in case you&#x27;re wondering how long my hair is...it&#x27;s about 10 inches past my shoulders.</li>
            <li> Love the bristles and the way you can use this brush to part your hair as well.  5***</li>
            <li> I had never been able to get the hang of the twirl and blow dry like my hairdresser does, but I bought this brush and I love the way it works--I can style it with a bit of lift or lying close to my head if I like.  I thought it was going to be smaller than it is, but it works fine, I&#x27;m quite happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have very thin hair about shoulder length. I bought this brush because of all the great reviews and hoping to get some volume. I&#x27;ve had it only a short period of time. Within 2 months the bristles are melted. I have a professional hair dryer but I use it on the warm setting not hot. Also, you have to be careful using it because when it gets too hot the end of the brush can burn you. I&#x27;ve burned my neck a few times. It has a sectional pick in the handle that doesn&#x27;t come out no matter how many times I&#x27;ve tried to use it. Needless to say I am not happy with this product and now I need to buy another brush. I feel like I wasted my money.</li>
            <li> When i blow out my hair is makes my hair smooth and soft...</li>
            <li> Love this brush.  My hair stylist recommend it to me and it is wonderful!</li>
            <li> Easy to hold &amp; doesn&#x27;t tangle hair. My hair stylist says it&#x27;s her favorite brush. I bought two of these.</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and this square brush is amazing!  It is very easy to work with bought the larger one and didn&#x27;t like it as much.</li>
            <li> Easy to grip, doesn&#x27;t damage my hair, and seems to help dry my thick hair more quickly than other brushes.</li>
            <li> the Square brush does not style my hair as well as the round brushes do. The Olivia Garden round brush I have was a much better purchase.</li>
            <li> Almost perfect. I love that the air circulates through it as well as around it, and I like the extra bit of lift that I get from the squared off edges. Where I find that it fails a little is that the lack of stiffness in the bristles and/or the shortness in their length make it hard for them to grasp my baby fine blond hair so that I can get a good wrap on it when blow dyring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no problem at all with the rubber handle snagging my hair - but then again, I do not have long hair. It is a good quality brush and I recommend it - - - just wish the bristles were a hair *snicker*  longer.</li>
            <li> Best brush ever for curly/wavy hair. Smooths it right down.</li>
            <li> This brush did weird things to my hair -- I had creases in my hair! I liked the iTools Blue Wave round (square) brush WAY better and it was almost half the price of this Olivia nano thermic brush! Too late to return it since I used it but it sucks that I wasted $25+ on a brush that makes creases on my hair!</li>
            <li> This brush is not for longer hair because of its size and because it is square.  My hair is a couple of inches below shoulders, and the brush gets caught in the hair.  It also does not do as good of a job with the ends as a round brush.  However, the brush technology does make the hair smoother and shinier.  I will be ordering a bigger round brush in the same brand and giving this one to my mom, whose hair is above shoulder.</li>
            <li> This really does save your hair - and is so easy to use. I&#x27;m actually getting another and one of my mom as well.</li>
            <li> Ordered the wrong thing by accident.</li>
            <li> I was very curious about the square shape of this brush.&lt;br /&gt;It was a very good surprise. It has a lot better grip than round brushes.&lt;br /&gt;Also the materials used  by olivia garden seem very good because I could dry my hair faster  and easier and could round  it nicely. My hair is abundant,  thick and not easy to brush so it is a good evidence of it&#x27;s efficiency</li>
            <li> This brush really cuts down on static electricity when I am blow-drying my hair.  It is easy to use to form waves.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t love that it&#x27;s square, instead of round but overall a good brush that lasts.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this brush. I recently purchased the 1 1/2 size. I have thick, wavy/curly hair just above shoulder length and like to have the option to blow dry it straight or style it differently once in a while. It usually takes me forever to do. With this brush (and the BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer) I&#x27;ve been able to style my hair the way it is done by my hairdresser and in a shorter period of time than ever. I&#x27;ve used the brush three times so far and have loved it every time so I had to write a review about it (something I rarely do). There are no fly away hairs and the hair does not get caught in the handle. Hair looks shiny and feels smooth. It really seems to work and the hair style lasted for quite a while! My mother who is visiting loved it too. She has short hair so I just ordered a smaller size for her to take back home.  The only problem I have with this brush is that the top gets very hot and could burn.  I usually put the hair dryer on the highest heat setting which makes the top of the brush very hot.  I hope the makers can do something about that when they develop a newer model. I still highly recommend the brush. It really does the job.</li>
