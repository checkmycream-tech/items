            <li> Kit was impressive. Ink was disappointing.  Colors are faded even when freshly tattooed.</li>
            <li> the ink didn&#x27;t agree with me so after it all I came back out of my leg I switched to name brand inks. everything else was great.</li>
            <li> It was great everything was awesome the guns worked real good and it&#x27;s a perfect kit for starters</li>
            <li> Its all there works great very nice merchandise</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very particular about ratings. When I buy items, I always check. This tattoo kit has been amazing. It comes with just about everything and has made us a lot of money. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Package came with no problems till I opened it up and one of the tattoo guns was broken into</li>
            <li> Very nice set with a bunch of really cool guns. However the power supply doesn&#x27;t work properly and the case was dented, or else I would give it a five stars. Overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Excellent buy...way more items than seller could ever fit into any pic...everything is awesome and works great!</li>
            <li> Power supply did not work. Friends came and helped rig it up to operate. Should not be selling it if power supply does&#x27;t work. This is suppose to be new!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> We bought the tattoo starter kit about a 1 1/2 months or so ago and everything was great for about 2 tattoos then the power supply went on it, so we already had to buy a new power supply.</li>
            <li> I thought it was to good to be tru but took the risk anyway I said to myself &amp;#34;I can return it if it was a bad deal but I will say that the ai model is out of control and</li>
            <li> The disc to learn how to do tattoos does not work. I don&#x27;t know why???</li>
            <li> this was a gift for a family member and they love it!</li>
            <li> Well packaged, very nice set!  Quite pleased!</li>
            <li> The DVD isn&#x27;t a video. It&#x27;s just a slideshow of pictures, not very &amp;#34;instructional&amp;#34;. But overall great product/quality.</li>
