            <li>Heat does not travel and it is great at protecting things around while you do your hair.</li>
            <li>it does a great job for that.  </li>
            <li>The stand has a great angle for use, it&#x27;s stable and protects all surfaces that the iron is used on.</li>
            <li>This is a great addition to my crowded bathroom sink.  </li>

            <li>Its very strong!</li>
            <li>It holds it and doesn&#x27;t melt (like cheap acrylic ones will) and very wonderful  </li>
            <li>They also have a good rubber coating on their bases, which also helps keep them from sliding around as well as protecting the vanity surface from getting scratched.  </li>
            <li>This is a good heavy-duty product.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Definitely a good purchase</li>

            <li>I do my mom&#x27;s hair twice a week, and this holder makes the job easy peasy!</li>
            <li>&quot; It is not expensive, great looking, and convenient.  </li>
            <li>Great item for those hot curling irons and wands.</li>
            <li>Great holder for keeping hot irons off counters and off flammable materials.</li>
            <li>Exactly what i needed, and at a great inexpensive price.</li>
            <li>I ALREADY HAVE A GREAT HOLDER FOR 2 IRONS, BUT I NEEDED SOMETHING QUICK AND EASY TO GET OUT FOR THE USE OF ONE IRON.</li>
            <li>AND THE PRODUCT IS SUPER STURDY!!</li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS GOOD AND THE SHIPPING WAS QUICK.</li>
            <li>Keeps your curling iron from burning your rags or table top.  </li>
            <li>I love this curling iron holder.  </li>
            <li>Guess I&#x27;ll have to buy another : )&lt;</li>
            <li>From Anne: love it.</li>
            <li>Simple idea that is wonderful for controlling clutter on bathroom counter top and lessening chance of fire.  </li>
            <li>I bought two and wished I had bought more.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li>However it&#x27;s better than using nothing at all.</li>
            <li>I cant imagine not having it now, I love it.</li>
            <li>IT SAVES THE WOOD ON THE TOP OF MY VANITY</li>
            <li>Holds my iron so secure!</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Girls love it.</li>
            <li>Perfect for keeping heat further from the counter top.</li>
            <li>from burning the counter top</li>
            <li>So glad I purchased this</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I love this and am SO glad I bought it.</li>
            <li>Love it although it is too cumbersome to travel with.</li>
            <li>How ingenious.</li>
            <li>Love this.</li>
            <li>Would work for any size and most styles.</li>
            <li>Makes using my curling safe and convenient.</li>
            <li>I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li>Keeps iron from burning the counter top and is so easy to use and store.</li>
            <li>use it all the time works great and is not too big, very cool!</li>
            <li>I think that this will be a better fit for the 2\\&quot; iron.</li>
            <li>THE PRICE IS RIGHT TOO!!</li>
            <li>Cool Curling Iron Holder!</li>
            <li>Stable, functional and cool!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t move easily.</li>
            <li>Seems like it could be a bit more stable when taking the iron in and out but overall I am happy with it.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>may go through and touch the counter, but this can easily be avoided if it&#x27;s placed correctly.  </li>
            <li>I use the 1.5\\&quot; ceramic Chi curling iron and it fits easily into the holder.  </li>
            <li>This is perfect for a house with girls, no more smelly rooms from a curling iron melting or burning a table top, towel, or floor.  </li>
            <li>Fits the flat iron perfectly and keeps it from damaging floor, furniture when hot.  </li>
            <li>These are just the greatest little holders.</li>
            <li>This really comes in handy.</li>
            <li>The Scalpmaster Hair Dryer Holder will also work great for larger barreled curling irons.</li>
            <li>If you just set your iron on the counter it doesn&#x27;t always stay securely where it&#x27;s placed.</li>
            <li>it is very useful in my salon.</li>
            <li>Very handy, use it daily</li>
            <li>AND I CAN PUT IT AWAY VERY QUICKLY, WITHOUT IT BEING VERY HOT AFTER THE USAGE.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take much room and is easy to just stick the iron in there without worrying about the iron touching anything or burning my dressing table.</li>
            <li>Best thing every made for holding a hot curling iron &amp; letting it cool down</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much easier to throw the curling wand in here than trying to balance it and make sure the heat doesn&#x27;t touch any surface.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up much room and keeps it safely off of my countertop.</li>
            <li>I love this thing almost as much as the curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>MY MAKEUP VANITY DOES NOT HAVE THAT MUCH SPACE ON THE TOP</li>
            <li>AND YOU CAN LEAVE IT IN THE HOLDER TO COOL OFF.  </li>
            <li>I really like the holder because it keeps your iron securely where it&#x27;s placed and is easy to pick up.  </li>
            <li>Nothing super fancy, just a good solid value that does what it was made for.</li>
            <li>I could never figure out a way to quickly put it away without waiting 30 minutes or so for it to cool off.</li>
            <li>PERFECT little tool for getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too big and will fit nicely on her sink area.</li>
            <li>Irons get very hot, and sometimes we forget to turn them off when we leave out.</li>
            <li>We bought these hair curler iron holders when we got a new simulated granite (plastic) bathroom vanity top.  </li>
            <li>Also, the metal feels very sturdy, and easily stays up</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, as long as you are using this ONLY for something that fits inside the spiral, this product is perfect, and I would buy it again if I ever lost this one!</li>
            <li>It is very stable and strong.</li>
            <li>All around excellent product I can see lasting for a Very long time.</li>
            <li>I have a 1 1/2&amp;#34; barrel curling iron and it fits great, but the barrel just doesn&#x27;t go all the way to the end of the silver coil -- it sits up just a little bit.</li>
            <li>I have even used it to hold my flat iron today because it was more convenient and it worked fine too.</li>
            <li>I would love this item IF the sharp edge at the top of the holder hadn&#x27;t scratched the heck out of my curling wand.  </li>
            <li>My curling wand gets super hot and this holds my heaviest wand attachment.</li>
            <li>Now I have them right</li>
            <li>This stand was the right price and the right solution for us.</li>
            <li>WHEN I RECENTLY PURCHASED SOME NEW CURLING IRONS, IT DID NOT HAVE A GOOD RESTING PIECE FOR THE COUNTER</li>
            <li>And easy enough to fit in a cabinet or leave out.</li>
            <li>Does not hold a 2” diameter curling iron safely; as the barrel of the iron just barely inserts into the holder.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>I have a heat-proof silicone mat which works fine, but takes up a lot of precious counter space and still wouldn&#x27;t keep it out of the way of a curious cat or child.</li>
            <li>This a great little gizmo that really makes it easier when using a curling iron.  </li>
            <li>Liked it so much i purchased another on for my second size iron.</li>
            <li>It was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>AND THIS ONE IS A REAL WINNER!</li>
            <li>I really like it!</li>
            <li>This was exactly what I was looking for to prevent the cord pulling the curling iron off the counter while I&#x27;m sitting there doing my hair in front of the mirror, and it burning my leg or landing on my foot.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the overall quality and functionality of the product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a curling iron for years and there&#x27;s always the issue of where to set the hot iron between curls and after I&#x27;ve finished.</li>
            <li>exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hot curling irons burning up anything.</li>
            <li>I love this thing I only wish they had one that folded up&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This holder keeps the hot end contained and away from you.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical when I first purchased this product, but I am amazed by how wonderfully it works!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It holds the hot iron safely with the handle up - ready to be picked up for the next curl.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t fit as far down, but the product is balanced nicely and so it won&#x27;t tip.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s pretty much as pictured but did surprise me that it was as large/heavy duty as it appeared when first opening the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to get the curling iron in and out while I am using it and holds it securely while it cools down.  </li>
            <li>She has long hair and when she uses it to curl her hair it come out lovely.</li>
            <li>NICE AND HEAVY BUT NOT DIFFICULT TO MOVE.</li>
            <li>It is rather large and space consuming however for me.</li>
            <li>I was concerned that the larger curling iron, the 1.5 and the 2&amp;#34; one, would not work well with this item, but they both did fine with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very good for preventing burning the wrong things, like your hands and/or the table.</li>
            <li>However, she likes it so much she uses it in her bathroom.  </li>
            <li>It securely holds the different sized curling rods that I use, and keeps them from burning anything.</li>
            <li>SO MUCH</li>
            <li>Yes it&#x27;s very sterdy and holds my tools as needed.</li>
            <li>I was looking for a way to store my curling iron out of sight after I was done getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li>They also hold both irons securely and are weighted enough that they stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really have a bathroom counter , I needed this.</li>
            <li>I like it but decided it takes up too much space on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li>I still put a heat mat under it as a really skinny iron</li>
            <li>This is very sturdy &amp; well made.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really a helping hand.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>IT IS VERY STURDY</li>
            <li>I NOTICE WHEN I PURCHASE FROM AMAZON, MY ITEMS ARRIVE FAST.</li>
            <li>This holder is very stable.</li>
            <li>It is nice and heavy and holds my curling iron without the slightest chance of tipping over.  </li>
            <li>My problem was always that I don&#x27;t really have much room to set down a hot iron without touching anything</li>
            <li>It is stylish if you want to leave it out, it is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t move on the counter due to the rubberized coating on the bottom, and I can now put the iron under the bathroom sink knowing it won&#x27;t burn anything.</li>
            <li>The only real drawback is that they take up a bit of counter top real-estate and they cannot easily be used for travel since they do not fold up &amp; they are heavy!</li>
            <li>I love that I never have to worry about my curling iron falling while putting it down, or tipping over the holder.</li>
            <li>This curling iron holder is a perfect solution for \\&quot;what to do with the cord, outlet on wrong side, not enough space, etc.\\</li>
            <li>It looks good and is heavy enough to always stay upright, but not ridiculously so.</li>
            <li>I can highly recommend it and one day I will knock out all those pedestal sinks and put in true storage!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>This holder keeps the iron very secure and saves me from burning myself everyday.</li>
            <li>I would highly recomend</li>
            <li>the base is nice and heavy and very sturdy and works perfect.</li>
            <li>(Brocato flat iron 1&amp;#34;) after I received the first one for my curling iron.  </li>
            <li>so this works so much better and safer if there are little ones around.</li>
            <li>It is very convenient when you need to use both hands to get the next lock of hair ready to curl since the iron is held at a very convenient angle for picking up.  </li>
            <li>Totally worth the low cost.</li>
            <li>I have a really skinny flat iron and a really wide one, and it keeps both from touching the counter.  </li>
            <li>Overall I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of my little stand!</li>
            <li>how did i live without this???</li>
            <li>The plastic covering on mine was cut near the bottom opening of the older, so I didn&#x27;t have any problems with my iron making contact with and burning it.  </li>
            <li>I love  this little gadget!  </li>
            <li>, IT LOOKS VERY PROFESSIONAL</li>
            <li>This is sturdy and hold several sizes of hot irons.  </li>
            <li>They are currently laying their hot irons on potholders from the kitchen.  </li>
            <li>love it and no more scorching dresser</li>
            <li>wow!</li>
            <li>This has solved the ever present problem of where to place a hot iron while curling my hair or to let it cool down.</li>
            <li>It works great and will not fall over, which I was afraid of.</li>
            <li>It is very well-balanced, such that the curling iron does not fall over.</li>
            <li>Only the very tip with the grip fits in.  </li>
            <li>Sitting it down on the counter to heat, use, and cool is out of the question.  </li>
            <li>so it holds my large flat iron on my pedestal bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s simple construction, doesn&#x27;t look too bad either, and works really nicely without taking up a huge amount of space on the counter.</li>
            <li>The only drawback that I can see is that the cord could still possibly touch the hot side of the iron if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>I also left my curling iron on accidentally when I left before, and felt it was much safer in this.</li>
            <li>one small minus is that it barely fits the 2\\&quot; curling iron that I use most often.  </li>
            <li>The price was right and the item was received well within the expected time period and the product was in the expected condition.  </li>
            <li>The metal coil it sits in does get hot, but the base doesn&#x27;t even get warm.</li>
            <li>My regular curling irons have always had a little kick-stand of sorts, but my daughter&#x27;s wand curler just looks like it wants to roll around and burn something.</li>
            <li>The metal is super thick and sits very flat.</li>

            <li> where I need them at all times and they look great in this holder.</li>
            <li> Heat does not travel and it is great at protecting things around while you do your hair.</li>
            <li> it does a great job for that.  </li>
            <li> The stand has a great angle for use, it&#x27;s stable and protects all surfaces that the iron is used on.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to my crowded bathroom sink.  </li>

            <li> They also have a good rubber coating on their bases, which also helps keep them from sliding around as well as protecting the vanity surface from getting scratched.  </li>
            <li> This is a good heavy-duty product.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Definitely a good purchase</li>

            <li> I ALREADY HAVE A GREAT HOLDER FOR 2 IRONS, BUT I NEEDED SOMETHING QUICK AND EASY TO GET OUT FOR THE USE OF ONE IRON.</li>
            <li> AND THE PRODUCT IS SUPER STURDY!!</li>

            <li> I love this curling iron holder.  </li>
            <li> Guess I&#x27;ll have to buy another : )&lt;</li>
            <li> From Anne: love it.</li>
            <li> Simple idea that is wonderful for controlling clutter on bathroom counter top and lessening chance of fire.  </li>
            <li> I bought two and wished I had bought more.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this.</li>
            <li> However it&#x27;s better than using nothing at all.</li>
            <li> I cant imagine not having it now, I love it.</li>
            <li> IT SAVES THE WOOD ON THE TOP OF MY VANITY</li>
            <li> Holds my iron so secure!</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Girls love it.</li>
            <li> Perfect for keeping heat further from the counter top.</li>
            <li> from burning the counter top</li>
            <li> So glad I purchased this</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I love this and am SO glad I bought it.</li>
            <li> Love it although it is too cumbersome to travel with.</li>
            <li> How ingenious.</li>
            <li> Love this.</li>
            <li> Would work for any size and most styles.</li>
            <li> Makes using my curling safe and convenient.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> Keeps iron from burning the counter top and is so easy to use and store.</li>
            <li> use it all the time works great and is not too big, very cool!</li>
            <li> I think that this will be a better fit for the 2\\&quot; iron.</li>
            <li> THE PRICE IS RIGHT TOO!!</li>
            <li> Cool Curling Iron Holder!</li>
            <li> Stable, functional and cool!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t move easily.</li>
            <li> Seems like it could be a bit more stable when taking the iron in and out but overall I am happy with it.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> may go through and touch the counter, but this can easily be avoided if it&#x27;s placed correctly.  </li>
            <li> I use the 1.5\\&quot; ceramic Chi curling iron and it fits easily into the holder.  </li>
            <li> This is perfect for a house with girls, no more smelly rooms from a curling iron melting or burning a table top, towel, or floor.  </li>
            <li> Fits the flat iron perfectly and keeps it from damaging floor, furniture when hot.  </li>
            <li> These are just the greatest little holders.</li>
            <li> This really comes in handy.</li>
            <li> The Scalpmaster Hair Dryer Holder will also work great for larger barreled curling irons.</li>
            <li> If you just set your iron on the counter it doesn&#x27;t always stay securely where it&#x27;s placed.</li>
            <li> it is very useful in my salon.</li>
            <li> Very handy, use it daily</li>
            <li> AND I CAN PUT IT AWAY VERY QUICKLY, WITHOUT IT BEING VERY HOT AFTER THE USAGE.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take much room and is easy to just stick the iron in there without worrying about the iron touching anything or burning my dressing table.</li>
            <li> Best thing every made for holding a hot curling iron &amp; letting it cool down</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so much easier to throw the curling wand in here than trying to balance it and make sure the heat doesn&#x27;t touch any surface.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take up much room and keeps it safely off of my countertop.</li>
            <li> I love this thing almost as much as the curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> MY MAKEUP VANITY DOES NOT HAVE THAT MUCH SPACE ON THE TOP</li>
            <li> AND YOU CAN LEAVE IT IN THE HOLDER TO COOL OFF.  </li>
            <li> I really like the holder because it keeps your iron securely where it&#x27;s placed and is easy to pick up.  </li>
            <li> Nothing super fancy, just a good solid value that does what it was made for.</li>
            <li> I could never figure out a way to quickly put it away without waiting 30 minutes or so for it to cool off.</li>
            <li> PERFECT little tool for getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too big and will fit nicely on her sink area.</li>
            <li> Irons get very hot, and sometimes we forget to turn them off when we leave out.</li>
            <li> We bought these hair curler iron holders when we got a new simulated granite (plastic) bathroom vanity top.  </li>
            <li> Also, the metal feels very sturdy, and easily stays up</li>
            <li> /&gt;That being said, as long as you are using this ONLY for something that fits inside the spiral, this product is perfect, and I would buy it again if I ever lost this one!</li>
            <li> It is very stable and strong.</li>
            <li> All around excellent product I can see lasting for a Very long time.</li>
            <li> I have a 1 1/2&amp;#34; barrel curling iron and it fits great, but the barrel just doesn&#x27;t go all the way to the end of the silver coil -- it sits up just a little bit.</li>
            <li> I have even used it to hold my flat iron today because it was more convenient and it worked fine too.</li>
            <li> I would love this item IF the sharp edge at the top of the holder hadn&#x27;t scratched the heck out of my curling wand.  </li>
            <li> My curling wand gets super hot and this holds my heaviest wand attachment.</li>
            <li> Now I have them right</li>
            <li> This stand was the right price and the right solution for us.</li>
            <li> WHEN I RECENTLY PURCHASED SOME NEW CURLING IRONS, IT DID NOT HAVE A GOOD RESTING PIECE FOR THE COUNTER</li>
            <li> And easy enough to fit in a cabinet or leave out.</li>
            <li> Does not hold a 2” diameter curling iron safely; as the barrel of the iron just barely inserts into the holder.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I have a heat-proof silicone mat which works fine, but takes up a lot of precious counter space and still wouldn&#x27;t keep it out of the way of a curious cat or child.</li>
            <li> This a great little gizmo that really makes it easier when using a curling iron.  </li>
            <li> Liked it so much i purchased another on for my second size iron.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> AND THIS ONE IS A REAL WINNER!</li>
            <li> I really like it!</li>
            <li> This was exactly what I was looking for to prevent the cord pulling the curling iron off the counter while I&#x27;m sitting there doing my hair in front of the mirror, and it burning my leg or landing on my foot.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the overall quality and functionality of the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a curling iron for years and there&#x27;s always the issue of where to set the hot iron between curls and after I&#x27;ve finished.</li>
            <li> exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hot curling irons burning up anything.</li>
            <li> I love this thing I only wish they had one that folded up&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This holder keeps the hot end contained and away from you.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first purchased this product, but I am amazed by how wonderfully it works!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It holds the hot iron safely with the handle up - ready to be picked up for the next curl.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t fit as far down, but the product is balanced nicely and so it won&#x27;t tip.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty much as pictured but did surprise me that it was as large/heavy duty as it appeared when first opening the package.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to get the curling iron in and out while I am using it and holds it securely while it cools down.  </li>
            <li> She has long hair and when she uses it to curl her hair it come out lovely.</li>
            <li> NICE AND HEAVY BUT NOT DIFFICULT TO MOVE.</li>
            <li> It is rather large and space consuming however for me.</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the larger curling iron, the 1.5 and the 2&amp;#34; one, would not work well with this item, but they both did fine with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very good for preventing burning the wrong things, like your hands and/or the table.</li>
            <li> However, she likes it so much she uses it in her bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It securely holds the different sized curling rods that I use, and keeps them from burning anything.</li>
            <li> SO MUCH</li>
            <li> Yes it&#x27;s very sterdy and holds my tools as needed.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a way to store my curling iron out of sight after I was done getting ready in the morning.</li>
            <li> They also hold both irons securely and are weighted enough that they stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really have a bathroom counter , I needed this.</li>
            <li> I like it but decided it takes up too much space on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> I still put a heat mat under it as a really skinny iron</li>
            <li> This is very sturdy &amp; well made.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a helping hand.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> IT IS VERY STURDY</li>
            <li> I NOTICE WHEN I PURCHASE FROM AMAZON, MY ITEMS ARRIVE FAST.</li>
            <li> This holder is very stable.</li>
            <li> It is nice and heavy and holds my curling iron without the slightest chance of tipping over.  </li>
            <li> My problem was always that I don&#x27;t really have much room to set down a hot iron without touching anything</li>
            <li> It is stylish if you want to leave it out, it is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t move on the counter due to the rubberized coating on the bottom, and I can now put the iron under the bathroom sink knowing it won&#x27;t burn anything.</li>
            <li> The only real drawback is that they take up a bit of counter top real-estate and they cannot easily be used for travel since they do not fold up &amp; they are heavy!</li>
            <li> I love that I never have to worry about my curling iron falling while putting it down, or tipping over the holder.</li>
            <li> This curling iron holder is a perfect solution for \\&quot;what to do with the cord, outlet on wrong side, not enough space, etc.\\</li>
            <li> It looks good and is heavy enough to always stay upright, but not ridiculously so.</li>
            <li> I can highly recommend it and one day I will knock out all those pedestal sinks and put in true storage!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> This holder keeps the iron very secure and saves me from burning myself everyday.</li>
            <li> I would highly recomend</li>
            <li> the base is nice and heavy and very sturdy and works perfect.</li>
            <li> (Brocato flat iron 1&amp;#34;) after I received the first one for my curling iron.  </li>
            <li> so this works so much better and safer if there are little ones around.</li>
            <li> It is very convenient when you need to use both hands to get the next lock of hair ready to curl since the iron is held at a very convenient angle for picking up.  </li>
            <li> Totally worth the low cost.</li>
            <li> I have a really skinny flat iron and a really wide one, and it keeps both from touching the counter.  </li>
            <li> Overall I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of my little stand!</li>
            <li> how did i live without this???</li>
            <li> The plastic covering on mine was cut near the bottom opening of the older, so I didn&#x27;t have any problems with my iron making contact with and burning it.  </li>
            <li> I love  this little gadget!  </li>
            <li> , IT LOOKS VERY PROFESSIONAL</li>
            <li> This is sturdy and hold several sizes of hot irons.  </li>
            <li> They are currently laying their hot irons on potholders from the kitchen.  </li>
            <li> love it and no more scorching dresser</li>
            <li> wow!</li>
            <li> This has solved the ever present problem of where to place a hot iron while curling my hair or to let it cool down.</li>
            <li> It works great and will not fall over, which I was afraid of.</li>
            <li> It is very well-balanced, such that the curling iron does not fall over.</li>
            <li> Only the very tip with the grip fits in.  </li>
            <li> Sitting it down on the counter to heat, use, and cool is out of the question.  </li>
            <li> so it holds my large flat iron on my pedestal bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s simple construction, doesn&#x27;t look too bad either, and works really nicely without taking up a huge amount of space on the counter.</li>
            <li> The only drawback that I can see is that the cord could still possibly touch the hot side of the iron if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> I also left my curling iron on accidentally when I left before, and felt it was much safer in this.</li>
            <li> one small minus is that it barely fits the 2\\&quot; curling iron that I use most often.  </li>
            <li> The price was right and the item was received well within the expected time period and the product was in the expected condition.  </li>
            <li> The metal coil it sits in does get hot, but the base doesn&#x27;t even get warm.</li>
            <li> My regular curling irons have always had a little kick-stand of sorts, but my daughter&#x27;s wand curler just looks like it wants to roll around and burn something.</li>
            <li> The metal is super thick and sits very flat.</li>
            <li> Very stable, not easy to tip over.  </li>
            <li> Also, the base is pretty big, and I think any normal person would think it&#x27;s ok to set something down on it.  </li>
            <li> It never moves or tips over, and holds small to large curling irons.  </li>
            <li> I have used this for my flat iron and spiral and wand.</li>
            <li> My wife needed a reliable stand for the flat iron</li>
            <li> This holder holds her &amp;#34;CHI&amp;#34; flat iron like it was made for it.</li>
            <li> you use a curling iron or flat iron or know someone who does, you&#x27;ll probably like this a lot.</li>
            <li> I had been using a plastic flat iron holder to hold my curling iron</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in a house where the bathrooms have pedestal sinks.  </li>
            <li> No more worrying about my iron being too hot to set down.</li>
            <li> Finally something that works to hold my nume wand that falls off the counter or turns due to the swivel cord in all sorts directions, resulting in tendency to grab the hit part.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend either or both of these products for space saving, heavy duty convenience, especially if you have limited space to spare for these items.</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my curing wand because I have limited bathroom space.  </li>
            <li> The plastic covering on the base appears to effectively prevent the holder from sliding whenever you remove or park your iron.  </li>
            <li> They are heavier that other holders we&#x27;ve looked at, heavy enough to keep the irons in place so the wires do not pull them around.  </li>
            <li> These two items are a life saver to me since they take up little room, are heavy enough never to tip over, and hold my hair dryer and curling iron out of my way and off the limited dresser space.  </li>
            <li> I HAVE THIS ON MY WOOD DRESSER, LOTS OF OTHER STUFF AROUND IT, AND IT HAS NOT TILTED OR FALLEN OVER AT ALL.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t harm the other wands or irons</li>
            <li> Going to order another for my other daughter.</li>
            <li> But I think that is due to the odd shape of the wand.</li>
            <li> I hate the cluttered look of a vanity counter top with a hundred things on it.</li>
            <li> Also, I don&#x27;t know why I was expecting the base to be bigger, but it does not actually take up much room on my counter, which is another plus.</li>
            <li> What if you just absent-mindedly set your curling iron down and it burns the plastic?  </li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t need to worry about accidentally burning my house down.</li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t even worry about it tipping over) and because the bottom is coated, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my counters as it pick it up and set it down.</li>
            <li> Wish it took up less counter room</li>
            <li> I set my straightener on the base the first time I used this, and it almost instantly melted the plastic that covers the bottom, which did not impress me.  </li>
            <li> No more burnt counter tops or other stuff on my counter.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little too bulky.  </li>
            <li> It is a little heavy, so it will not tip over.</li>
            <li> Heavy and Sturdy.  </li>
            <li> (The irons can slip off of a potholder, this holds them in one place firmly.)    </li>
            <li> Heavy construction</li>
            <li> I was using a jar candle holder to precariously balance my curling iron everyday.  </li>
            <li> Heavy duty and will stay put with curling iron in it.</li>
            <li> It was all dusty and gross.</li>
            <li> I have it on a narrow edge of the counter, beside the sink and it moves around a bit, but I think that is because the sink gets in the way.  </li>
            <li> if you&#x27;re reading this: Please make the base in other colors such as white at the very least, and pink, yellow, . . .</li>
            <li> Needless to say, a few burns were received from it slipping off and falling down.  </li>
            <li> no more brown burn marks on the sink.</li>
            <li> No more burns</li>
            <li> This holder makes life 100x easier - no more worries about my iron singeing whatever surface it&#x27;s resting on.  </li>
            <li> Came missing black plastic peice and was dusty</li>
            <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t look for this a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;KittyS</li>
            <li> I was a little annoyed because although the price of the product was low, the shipping was disproportionately expensive and it took a looooong time to get to my house - at least a couple of weeks.</li>
            <li> the stands on those things hardly work.  </li>
            <li> The base is completely covered in a rubberized material which keeps the holder firmly in place on your counter.</li>
            <li> I always hated setting a hot iron on the counter</li>
            <li> Base isn&#x27;t heavy enough to keep iron from falling over</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I noticed is that is skidded up my pearl curling wand.</li>
            <li> and I was having a hard time not burning my counters (and fingers!)</li>
            <li> Not one complaint yet!</li>
            <li> only reason I did not give this product 5 stars was because of the base.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice until it was too late.</li>
            <li> (but it doesn&#x27;t collapse at the wrong time either)  </li>
            <li> so I have been unable to return product!</li>
            <li> In the end, decided to give 4 stars, because I think that the base is a flaw in the design.  </li>
            <li> I also did not see a warning for the base.  </li>
            <li> It is an upright metal coil on a rubber-coated base.  </li>
            <li> The base measures 4\\&quot; x 8\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> As described.  Keeps your curling iron from burning your rags or table top.  Heavy and Sturdy.  I would suggest you get this if you curl your hair a lot.  Irons get very hot, and sometimes we forget to turn them off when we leave out.</li>
            <li> It was exactly what I needed. Not one complaint yet! I use it every time I curl my hair. It&#x27;s so much easier to throw the curling wand in here than trying to balance it and make sure the heat doesn&#x27;t touch any surface.</li>
            <li> I love this curling iron holder.  It holds it and doesn&#x27;t melt (like cheap acrylic ones will) and very wonderful  THE PRICE IS RIGHT TOO!!</li>
            <li> I bought one for me and one for my mother-in-law so she would keep it in her guest bathroom - that way I&#x27;d have one there when visiting.  However, she likes it so much she uses it in her bathroom.  Guess I&#x27;ll have to buy another : )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s pretty much as pictured but did surprise me that it was as large/heavy duty as it appeared when first opening the package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer if you&#x27;re reading this: Please make the base in other colors such as white at the very least, and pink, yellow, . . .</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my daughter, she loves i. Excellent quality.</li>
            <li> From Anne: love it. no more brown burn marks on the sink. and no worries the house goes up in flames if you forgot to turn off or unplug your iron.</li>
            <li> I use this product a lot, and it works great!!  It securely holds the different sized curling rods that I use, and keeps them from burning anything. Also, the metal feels very sturdy, and easily stays up right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I did not give this product 5 stars was because of the base.  I set my straightener on the base the first time I used this, and it almost instantly melted the plastic that covers the bottom, which did not impress me.  I was hoping I could use it for my straightener and my rods, but I can only use it for the rods.  I had to think about whether or not to take a star off for this, since this is for curling irons/rods, and not for straighteners. In the end, decided to give 4 stars, because I think that the base is a flaw in the design.  What if you just absent-mindedly set your curling iron down and it burns the plastic?  That can easily happen! Also, the base is pretty big, and I think any normal person would think it&#x27;s ok to set something down on it.  I also did not see a warning for the base.  Maybe it was in there, but I did not notice it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, as long as you are using this ONLY for something that fits inside the spiral, this product is perfect, and I would buy it again if I ever lost this one!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m currently in a house where the bathrooms have pedestal sinks.  This holder prevents the curling iron from dropping off a mini counter and hitting the floor.  It&#x27;s made of metal and so there is no worry about melting or fire.  And best of all, it saves space and the curling iron because it stores the iron at an angle.  I can highly recommend it and one day I will knock out all those pedestal sinks and put in true storage!</li>
            <li> This curling iron holder is a perfect solution for \\&quot;what to do with the cord, outlet on wrong side, not enough space, etc.\\&quot; It is not expensive, great looking, and convenient.  Love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Now I don&#x27;t need to worry about accidentally burning my house down.</li>
            <li> Came missing black plastic peice and was dusty</li>
            <li> Simple idea that is wonderful for controlling clutter on bathroom counter top and lessening chance of fire.  Don&#x27;t have to worry now about whether or not I turned off the curling iron.</li>
            <li> Works great. Nicely made. Great value.</li>
            <li> I would love this item IF the sharp edge at the top of the holder hadn&#x27;t scratched the heck out of my curling wand.  Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t notice until it was too late.</li>
            <li> Great item for those hot curling irons and wands. I love it!</li>
            <li> This has solved the ever present problem of where to place a hot iron while curling my hair or to let it cool down. Perfect</li>
            <li> I HAVE THIS ON MY WOOD DRESSER, LOTS OF OTHER STUFF AROUND IT, AND IT HAS NOT TILTED OR FALLEN OVER AT ALL. NICE AND HEAVY BUT NOT DIFFICULT TO MOVE. WOULD DEF BUY ANOTHER ONE IF NEEDED</li>
            <li> i have finally stopped burning my carpet.. i take turns with whatever im using at the time (straightener or curler)</li>
            <li> We bought these hair curler iron holders when we got a new simulated granite (plastic) bathroom vanity top.  We wanted something to protect it from the irons.  These units work great.  They are heavier that other holders we&#x27;ve looked at, heavy enough to keep the irons in place so the wires do not pull them around.  They also have a good rubber coating on their bases, which also helps keep them from sliding around as well as protecting the vanity surface from getting scratched.  This is a good heavy-duty product.  The only real drawback is that they take up a bit of counter top real-estate and they cannot easily be used for travel since they do not fold up &amp; they are heavy!</li>
            <li> This is a great product for holding your curling iron. I am very pleased with this product. It doesn&#x27;t take up much room and keeps it safely off of my countertop.</li>
            <li> Totally awesome! I bought two and wished I had bought more. I have used this for my flat iron and spiral and wand. It has never tipped over! Love it!</li>
            <li> This is sturdy and hold several sizes of hot irons.  I have a really skinny flat iron and a really wide one, and it keeps both from touching the counter.  It is an upright metal coil on a rubber-coated base.  It doesn&#x27;t fold or get any smaller.  (but it doesn&#x27;t collapse at the wrong time either)  I am considering getting some for my sisters.  They are currently laying their hot irons on potholders from the kitchen.  (The irons can slip off of a potholder, this holds them in one place firmly.)    The only drawback that I can see is that the cord could still possibly touch the hot side of the iron if you are not careful.  I would still recommend it though.</li>
            <li> awesome so convenient</li>
            <li> I bought one of those no-clip curling irons - the type you wind your hair around and hold - and bought this to go with it.  I love this thing almost as much as the curling iron!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks just fine to leave on the sink and is perfect in terms of function!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this. My curling wand gets super hot and this holds my heaviest wand attachment. The metal is super thick and sits very flat. It doesn&#x27;t move easily. I am so glad I put in the investment for this!</li>
            <li> One of the best things I have bought.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Finally something to hold my curling wands without burning up a towel or resting the appliance on my counter . The only thing with this is that it depends on what counter you put it on because it may slide a bit. For someone like me that dies hair often , this may be an issue at times . However it&#x27;s better than using nothing at all.</li>
            <li> It is well balanced.&lt;br /&gt;Holds the curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;It fits on the shelf in my closet&lt;br /&gt;Helps to keep the cord from getting tangled around the curling iron.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST have if you style your hair often.  For the cost, it cannot be beat.  I don&#x27;t know why I haven&#x27;t had one of these since I was 13!</li>
            <li> Great it hasn&#x27;t tipped over at all. Gets the job done.</li>
            <li> This works really good!  It is nice and heavy and holds my curling iron without the slightest chance of tipping over.  This is a really nice quality item.</li>
            <li> So convenient, this is one of those things you didnt know you needed until you buy it. I cant imagine not having it now, I love it. I always hated setting a hot iron on the counter so this works so much better and safer if there are little ones around. Great product!</li>
            <li> Nice to see someone created what I&#x27;ve been looking for.  It&#x27;s very handy and this will prevent your curling iron from rolling off or burning the counter.</li>
            <li> OK, ALL YOU NEAT FREAKS OUT THERE!! THIS IS A MUST HAVE FOR YOU.  I ORDERED IT FOR MY DAUGHTER AND ENDED UP LOVING IT SO MUCH THAT I PURCHASED THE UNIT THAT HOLDS THE BLOW DRYER TOO!!! MY MAKEUP VANITY DOES NOT HAVE THAT MUCH SPACE ON THE TOP AND THIS ITEM WAS PERFECT.  IT SAVES THE WOOD ON THE TOP OF MY VANITY AND YOU CAN LEAVE IT IN THE HOLDER TO COOL OFF.  I THOUGHT THAT I WOULD PUT IT AWAY AND IT WOULD LOOK CLUTTERED BUT JUST THE OPPOSITE, IT LOOKS VERY PROFESSIONAL AND IT SAVES LOTS OF SPACE AND THE PRODUCT IS SUPER STURDY!! I DID LOTS OF RESEARCH ON THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT AND THIS ONE IS A REAL WINNER! BRAVO SCALPMASTER!!!</li>
            <li> Holds my iron so secure! No more worrying about my iron being too hot to set down. Nice weight and well balanced.</li>
            <li> Heavy construction so it doesn&#x27;t tip EVER. I love it. 100% metal construction. Well balanced and yet it only takes up a smidge of space on your counter. Perfect!</li>
            <li> This is one of those things that I didn&#x27;t even know I needed, but I did.  It never moves or tips over, and holds small to large curling irons.  Even my Chi 1 1/2 inch curling iron fits, because it is tapered at the end, but that is as big as I would use it with.  If you have a larger one, get the model designed for a blow dryer and you&#x27;re set.  The best part is, and I repeat, it never moves around or tips over.  It is very stable and strong.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my wife for Christmas. It works great and will not fall over, which I was afraid of. It doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of space. Perfect to keep curling irions off the counter.</li>
            <li> Cool Curling Iron Holder! I bought this for my niece for Christmas. I really like it! It&#x27;s not too big and will fit nicely on her sink area. I will probably grab one for myself too!</li>
            <li> bought this for my wife to keep the curling iron in place when using or not. Works like a charm</li>
            <li> Bought this after daugther burned herself catching a falling curling iron. Girls love it. No more burns</li>
            <li> Best idea ever.  I was using a jar candle holder to precariously balance my curling iron everyday.  Needless to say, a few burns were received from it slipping off and falling down.  This holder keeps the iron very secure and saves me from burning myself everyday.</li>
            <li> This tools serves it&#x27;s purpose. it is very useful in my salon. Yes it&#x27;s very sterdy and holds my tools as needed. I would recommend this product to anyone just starting out this is a great investment tool!</li>
            <li> I wish I had this earlier, it keeps the curling wand off of the counter!</li>
            <li> I like this product. It prevents me from having burn marks on my counters. Seems like it could be a bit more stable when taking the iron in and out but overall I am happy with it. I also left my curling iron on accidentally when I left before, and felt it was much safer in this.</li>
            <li> Best thing every made for holding a hot curling iron &amp; letting it cool down</li>
            <li> Excellent. I would highly recomend</li>
            <li> I was looking for a way to store my curling iron out of sight after I was done getting ready in the morning. I hate the cluttered look of a vanity counter top with a hundred things on it. I could never figure out a way to quickly put it away without waiting 30 minutes or so for it to cool off. This product is awesome. It is stylish if you want to leave it out, it is sturdy and doesn&#x27;t move on the counter due to the rubberized coating on the bottom, and I can now put the iron under the bathroom sink knowing it won&#x27;t burn anything. Voila! Totally worth the low cost.</li>
            <li> This stand is great! I ordered another one for my straightener (Brocato flat iron 1&amp;#34;) after I received the first one for my curling iron.  I needed something for my vanity, shoving the irons in a vanity drawer was not working.  Now I have them right where I need them at all times and they look great in this holder. They also hold both irons securely and are weighted enough that they stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend this product. My regular curling irons have always had a little kick-stand of sorts, but my daughter&#x27;s wand curler just looks like it wants to roll around and burn something. This is the perfect solution. It stays standing and helps protects your skin and anything else on your vanity from rogue wand curlers.</li>
            <li> Stable, functional and cool!</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  Perfect for keeping heat further from the counter top.</li>
            <li> Holds 1.5 barrel perfectly.</li>
            <li> It works as it was claimed to and it keeps me from burning my counter.  Excellent product that solves my problem.</li>
            <li> Great holder for keeping hot irons off counters and off flammable materials. Heat does not travel and it is great at protecting things around while you do your hair. I haves used this with irons and wands that heat up to 450 degrees. The only bad thing I noticed is that is skidded up my pearl curling wand. But I think that is due to the odd shape of the wand. It didn&#x27;t harm the other wands or irons I used it with</li>
            <li> My wife needed a reliable stand for the flat iron so it would NEVER be necessary to lay it on the counter. This holder holds her &amp;#34;CHI&amp;#34; flat iron like it was made for it. It looks good and is heavy enough to always stay upright, but not ridiculously so. This stand was the right price and the right solution for us. I recommend it. Nothing super fancy, just a good solid value that does what it was made for.</li>
            <li> The holder keeps the curling iron in a perfect position and the cord no longer gets tangled on the drawer knob.  Sorry I didn&#x27;t look for this a long time ago.&lt;br /&gt;KittyS</li>
            <li> This really comes in handy. It&#x27;s very good for preventing burning the wrong things, like your hands and/or the table. It is very well-balanced, such that the curling iron does not fall over.</li>
            <li> No more burnt counter tops or other stuff on my counter. Holds my curling wand just perfectly. Just get it</li>
            <li> Heavy duty and will stay put with curling iron in it.</li>
            <li> Excellent - works well!</li>
            <li> I was concerned that the larger curling iron, the 1.5 and the 2&amp;#34; one, would not work well with this item, but they both did fine with it. They don&#x27;t fit as far down, but the product is balanced nicely and so it won&#x27;t tip. The metal coil it sits in does get hot, but the base doesn&#x27;t even get warm. This was exactly what I was looking for to prevent the cord pulling the curling iron off the counter while I&#x27;m sitting there doing my hair in front of the mirror, and it burning my leg or landing on my foot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s simple construction, doesn&#x27;t look too bad either, and works really nicely without taking up a huge amount of space on the counter. I&#x27;m thinking about getting a similar device for my blow dryer too, and just keeping the items out on the counter instead of putting them away like I&#x27;ve been doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a good purchase and I&#x27;m quite pleased with the overall quality and functionality of the product.</li>
            <li> works well...just wish it was a bit larger</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a curling iron for years and there&#x27;s always the issue of where to set the hot iron between curls and after I&#x27;ve finished. I have a heat-proof silicone mat which works fine, but takes up a lot of precious counter space and still wouldn&#x27;t keep it out of the way of a curious cat or child. This holder is the perfect solution and much safer for my home, where there are kids and cats around all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds the hot iron safely with the handle up - ready to be picked up for the next curl. The base is completely covered in a rubberized material which keeps the holder firmly in place on your counter. The base measures 4\\&quot; x 8\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a curling iron or flat iron or know someone who does, you&#x27;ll probably like this a lot.</li>
            <li> This stand is AWESOME! I don&#x27;t really have a bathroom counter , I needed this. Now I am no longer dropping my curling wand</li>
            <li> great christmas gift wife loved it  it  is havey and will hold your iron easily&lt;br /&gt;keep from burning the counter top</li>
            <li> My daughters 14 and loves this iron!  It is so easy to use, and the end results are amazing! Can&#x27;t beat the price either.</li>
            <li> I love  this little gadget!  It is solid and weighted so it holds my large flat iron on my pedestal bathroom sink.  I no longer worry about the iron damaging anything now that it has its own holder!  So glad I purchased this, this  is a great well made gadget!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> I love this iron holder! It&#x27;s well made and has never slipped off my bathroom counter...exactly what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> This is perfect for a house with girls, no more smelly rooms from a curling iron melting or burning a table top, towel, or floor.  Also perfect for keeping a cooling curling iron out of harms way.</li>
            <li> Great, good quality product and I love it. I will be ordering this again in the future.</li>
            <li> Exactly what i needed, and at a great inexpensive price. I don&#x27;t have to worry about my hot curling irons burning up anything. Liked it so much i purchased another on for my second size iron.</li>
            <li> Excellent metal curling iron holder that looks cool and gets the job done. I had been using a plastic flat iron holder to hold my curling iron and once I realized it was melting on the bottom I began searching for a safer and functional alternative. Enter Scalpmaster Curling Iron Holder. I love this and am SO glad I bought it. I love that I never have to worry about my curling iron falling while putting it down, or tipping over the holder. This thing is solid. It will not tip over and can hold up to a 2&amp;#34; wand. I have even used it to hold my flat iron today because it was more convenient and it worked fine too. Also, I don&#x27;t know why I was expecting the base to be bigger, but it does not actually take up much room on my counter, which is another plus. I will probably buy another to give to my sister. All around excellent product I can see lasting for a Very long time.</li>
            <li> Keeps the curling iron from burning surface.  Sturdy.</li>
            <li> These are just the greatest little holders. Keeps your curling iron off the counter and at an angle for easier use. I have a 1 1/2&amp;#34; barrel curling iron and it fits great, but the barrel just doesn&#x27;t go all the way to the end of the silver coil -- it sits up just a little bit. The Scalpmaster Hair Dryer Holder will also work great for larger barreled curling irons. PERFECT little tool for getting ready in the morning. Don&#x27;t have to stress out about whether or not you turned your curling iron off and if it&#x27;s marking your vanity. LOVE these products!</li>
            <li> I love this thing I only wish they had one that folded up&lt;br /&gt;I use it all the time works great and is not too big, very cool!</li>
            <li> Love it although it is too cumbersome to travel with. Item is just as described &amp; fits up to my 2\\&quot; iron</li>
            <li> Base isn&#x27;t heavy enough to keep iron from falling over</li>
            <li> I bought this to hold my curing wand because I have limited bathroom space.  it does a great job for that.  It is rather large and space consuming however for me.</li>
            <li> The item came in a smashed box that looked like it was sitting for 10yrs in the garbage.. It was all dusty and gross.</li>
            <li> The stand has a great angle for use, it&#x27;s stable and protects all surfaces that the iron is used on.</li>
            <li> I like it but decided it takes up too much space on my bathroom counter.</li>
            <li> Works great, doesn&#x27;t tip, makes my life so much easier!!</li>
            <li> Got this for my daughter so she wouldn&#x27;t leave her hair straightener on the desk or floor after use.  Fits the flat iron perfectly and keeps it from damaging floor, furniture when hot.  Very stable, not easy to tip over.  Does its job perfectly!  Going to order another for my other daughter.</li>
            <li> Sturdy holder that keeps the iron from laying on the counter &amp; burning things--esp. if you forget to turn it off for a time!</li>
            <li> How ingenious. Keeps the wand or the curling iron off the counter &amp; from dropping! So handy! Bottom weighted to keep from tipping.</li>
            <li> This is a great addition to my crowded bathroom sink.  It is easy to get the curling iron in and out while I am using it and holds it securely while it cools down.  I have it on a narrow edge of the counter, beside the sink and it moves around a bit, but I think that is because the sink gets in the way.  If I reposition it to a larger area, it is solid.  I have used it with several different sized irons and it works well with most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one small minus is that it barely fits the 2\\&quot; curling iron that I use most often.  Only the very tip with the grip fits in.  Still it has a good hold and the iron has never fallen out of the holder.  I just got the hair dryer holder, which is supposed to hold up to a 3\\&quot; diameter appliance.  I think that this will be a better fit for the 2\\&quot; iron.</li>
            <li> I purchased this hair dryer holder and the matching curling iron holder.  I liked them before I moved, but I love them now that I have moved and the space in my bathroom for my &amp;#34;necessities&amp;#34; is smaller than I am used to.  These two items are a life saver to me since they take up little room, are heavy enough never to tip over, and hold my hair dryer and curling iron out of my way and off the limited dresser space.  I especially like the curling iron holder since I never have to worry about burning anything on my dresser, or even if I leave the curling iron on until it automatically cuts off.  It is very convenient when you need to use both hands to get the next lock of hair ready to curl since the iron is held at a very convenient angle for picking up.  I would definitely recommend either or both of these products for space saving, heavy duty convenience, especially if you have limited space to spare for these items.</li>
            <li> I have to say my daughter loves it. She has long hair and when she uses it to curl her hair it come out lovely.</li>
            <li> This is a great product keeps your iron safe and keeps your bathroom counters from burnt marks</li>
            <li> Very handy, use it daily</li>
            <li> I really like the holder because it keeps your iron securely where it&#x27;s placed and is easy to pick up.  If you just set your iron on the counter it doesn&#x27;t always stay securely where it&#x27;s placed. (ex. if you bump the cord)  This holder keeps the hot end contained and away from you.  I still put a heat mat under it as a really skinny iron may go through and touch the counter, but this can easily be avoided if it&#x27;s placed correctly.  It is easier to put it in the holder correctly than incorrectly, so this shouldn&#x27;t be a problem.</li>
            <li> Stated that this holder “Accommodates curling irons with up to 2 inch barrels”. Does not hold a 2” diameter curling iron safely; as the barrel of the iron just barely inserts into the holder.&lt;br /&gt;Also, there was no paperwork included with the order so I have been unable to return product!</li>
            <li> A must have!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It holds my Remington curling wand so perfectly! Its very strong! I know it will last a life time! Very pleased!</li>
            <li> It does it&#x27;s job of holding the curling iron.  My iron is 1 1/4&amp;#34; and it fits with room to spare.  It&#x27;s just a little too bulky.  Wish it took up less counter room</li>
            <li> Love this. Keeps iron from burning the counter top and is so easy to use and store. Would work for any size and most styles.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I purchased a clipless curling rod set and I was having a hard time not burning my counters (and fingers!) with it. This holds the iron sturdy (I don&#x27;t even worry about it tipping over) and because the bottom is coated, it doesn&#x27;t hurt my counters as it pick it up and set it down. I was a little annoyed because although the price of the product was low, the shipping was disproportionately expensive and it took a looooong time to get to my house - at least a couple of weeks. Overall I have been very pleased with the quality and performance of my little stand!</li>
            <li> This is very sturdy &amp; well made. I sit on the floor to do my make up and hair, and this helps me keep my curling iron off the carpet. It fits my 2 in curling iron.&lt;br /&gt;awesome buy for the price</li>
            <li> I have a Bio Ionic iTools Style Winder Rotating Styling Curling Iron.  This is the fastest heating and hottest hair curler I&#x27;ve ever owned.  Sitting it down on the counter to heat, use, and cool is out of the question.  I purchased the Scalpmaster Curling Iron Holder for this reason and it works perfectly!  The price was right and the item was received well within the expected time period and the product was in the expected condition.  Very happy customer!!</li>
            <li> Finally something that works to hold my nume wand that falls off the counter or turns due to the swivel cord in all sorts directions, resulting in tendency to grab the hit part. This is so sturdy! And easy enough to fit in a cabinet or leave out.</li>
            <li> I love this product! The holder is weighted so that it doesn&#x27;t tip over while holding a curling or straightening iron. I plugin  my iron  to warm while it is in the holder, use my iron and then unplug while keeping the iron in the holder. No burn marks on the counter and no more having my curling wand fall on the floor while it is still hot.  I have a 1 1/2&amp;#34; curling wand and about the same size straightener.</li>
            <li> This is wonderful.  Which I had it sooner</li>
            <li> omg!!! this product puts an end to the scorch marks on the bathroom sink or whatever else you rest your curling irons on while you section off pieces to curl. i LOVE this item!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really a helping hand. I do my mom&#x27;s hair twice a week, and this holder makes the job easy peasy!</li>
            <li> Love this, great design, works great!  Makes using my curling safe and convenient.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical when I first purchased this product, but I am amazed by how wonderfully it works!  I&#x27;ve used a number of different curling irons over my lifetime and the stands on those things hardly work.  This holder makes life 100x easier - no more worries about my iron singeing whatever surface it&#x27;s resting on.  I use the 1.5\\&quot; ceramic Chi curling iron and it fits easily into the holder.  I have not once experienced any issues with the holder tipping over.  The plastic covering on the base appears to effectively prevent the holder from sliding whenever you remove or park your iron.  The plastic covering on mine was cut near the bottom opening of the older, so I didn&#x27;t have any problems with my iron making contact with and burning it.  Highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> WHEN I RECENTLY PURCHASED SOME NEW CURLING IRONS, IT DID NOT HAVE A GOOD RESTING PIECE FOR THE COUNTER ATTACHED TO THE IRON. I ALREADY HAVE A GREAT HOLDER FOR 2 IRONS, BUT I NEEDED SOMETHING QUICK AND EASY TO GET OUT FOR THE USE OF ONE IRON. I MUST REALLY SAY THIS CURLING HOLDER IS IDEAL. IT IS VERY STURDY AND I CAN PUT IT AWAY VERY QUICKLY, WITHOUT IT BEING VERY HOT AFTER THE USAGE. THE PRICE IS GOOD AND THE SHIPPING WAS QUICK. I NOTICE WHEN I PURCHASE FROM AMAZON, MY ITEMS ARRIVE FAST.</li>
            <li> works good no complaints.</li>
            <li> love it and no more scorching dresser</li>
            <li> This holder is very stable. It is a little heavy, so it will not tip over. I am pleased with it.</li>
            <li> This a great little gizmo that really makes it easier when using a curling iron.  My problem was always that I don&#x27;t really have much room to set down a hot iron without touching anything and this is perfect!  It doesn&#x27;t take much room and is easy to just stick the iron in there without worrying about the iron touching anything or burning my dressing table.</li>
            <li> wow! how did i live without this??? the base is nice and heavy and very sturdy and works perfect. would def recommend</li>
