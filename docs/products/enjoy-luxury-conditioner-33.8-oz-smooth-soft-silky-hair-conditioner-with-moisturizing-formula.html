            <li>I love all Enjoy products.</li>
            <li>I love Enjoy products and this conditioner is no exception.</li>
            <li>I fell in love with Enjoy hair products after this purchase and have recommended to my friends and family.</li>
            <li>I have used enjoy for many years.  </li>
            <li>Love these Enjoy products.</li>
            <li>Great for daily use for processed hair!</li>
            <li>If you want silky smooth this will do it.  </li>
            <li>Same consistency as the one I get from the salon great price.</li>
            <li>Overall, a good purchase - I will keep this conditioner in my rotation for sure.</li>
            <li>This conditioner also leaves my hair so smooth and soft, I&#x27;ve used many high end hair products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>They are worth the price!</li>
            <li>My hair always feels so soft and smells amazing.</li>
            <li>but more importantly it really does keep my hair color locked in.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it....</li>
            <li>Used Wen previously but like Enjoy better.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great too.</li>
            <li>My hair used to be really smooth and soft, however over the years it has started to feel more course</li>
            <li>Super smoothing.</li>
            <li>The scent is pleasant and not too obnoxiously &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; like some other products.</li>
            <li>A very good conditioner - may be a little to heavy for daily use, but leaves hair in great condition.  </li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too wild about the Enjoy shampoo I purchased with this, but this conditioner works well and leaves my hair silky and tangle-free.</li>
            <li>I have bought all types of expensive shampoos and this one is the best for my hair.</li>
            <li>This coniditioner makes my hair smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>my teen daughter uses this mostly.  </li>
            <li>(i am more grey too).  </li>
            <li>so I only use this one before I&#x27;m going out with my beau or some other person who will be touching my hair!!)</li>
            <li>haha.  </li>
            <li>I have  very curly hair.</li>
            <li>It is gentle on my color treated hair and the price on Amazon can not be beat in stores.  </li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo I would never use any other conditioner....</li>
            <li>I used Enjoy a long time ago and am just returning...</li>
            <li>The thick consistency allows it to coat the hair nicely without having to use too much of it.</li>
            <li>It softens my coarse hair and helps tremendously with combing out tangles.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my long fine hair feeling voluminous and silky soft.</li>
            <li>I was a very light blonde and went to dark with some blonde highlights, my hairdresser was almost certain the color wouldnt stick, but i used both the Shampoo and Conditioner from enoy and i went back in to add more highlights</li>
            <li>After using it few times I realized that I lose my hair more than normal.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I have never been able to use conditioner more than once a week because my hair is thick and it always weighs it down.  </li>
            <li>Especially my young daughter who was having such a hard time controlling her huge amount of hair!!</li>
            <li>This conditioner is by far in a class by itself.</li>
            <li>I was surprised there was not a pump included, but if you have one to use with it, problem solved.</li>
            <li>I like this product, a little pricey, but seems to be working well&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly, I will probably reorder</li>
            <li>It only takes a little bit and leaves your hair feeling clean and not heavy.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this conditioner!!!!</li>
            <li> Its seems to be the same that i buy from the salon!</li>
            <li> Great product my favorite conditioner!</li>
            <li> I love all Enjoy products. This is a bargain deal!</li>
            <li> This bottle has lasted me forever haha.  Great purchase</li>
            <li> Myself and my daughter have very curly, hard to manage hair. This product has helped us both. Especially my young daughter who was having such a hard time controlling her huge amount of hair!! Love this product</li>
            <li> The best moisturizing conditioner and not heavy.</li>
            <li> Great for daily use for processed hair!</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner. I&#x27;d use it every day, except my hair has a tendency to become &amp;#34;immune&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;tolerant&amp;#34; to conditioners I use too frequently, so I&#x27;m forced to alternate between this and a few others. None of the others are as good. My hair is very curly and unwieldy, and this helps tame it. I imagine it may be too heavy for less wild hair types, so watch out for that. This conditioner has neither protein nor moisture, so it doesn&#x27;t repair damage or moisturize. But it also doesn&#x27;t dry out your hair or turn it into a ball of frizzy fluff. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Purchased on a recommendation from a coworker.  On a visit to my chiropractor, she asked me what I was doing different to my hair.  I told her about this conditioner and she wanted the name.  This conditioner leaves my long fine hair feeling voluminous and silky soft.</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo I would never use any other conditioner.... This is the best!</li>
            <li> I love Enjoy products and this conditioner is no exception. I wasn&#x27;t too wild about the Enjoy shampoo I purchased with this, but this conditioner works well and leaves my hair silky and tangle-free. The thick consistency allows it to coat the hair nicely without having to use too much of it. The scent is pleasant and not too obnoxiously &amp;#34;perfumey&amp;#34; like some other products. Overall, a good purchase - I will keep this conditioner in my rotation for sure.</li>
            <li> My favorite conditioner! My hair always feels so soft and smells amazing. This conditioner is by far in a class by itself.</li>
            <li> I work in the desert and my hair has begun to act differently than ever before.  One week it&#x27;s frizzy and the next it&#x27;s greasy the day after washing.  I think it may be my water.  Anyway, I have never been able to use conditioner more than once a week because my hair is thick and it always weighs it down.  This conditioner is great!  It only takes a little bit and leaves your hair feeling clean and not heavy.  I fell in love with Enjoy hair products after this purchase and have recommended to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> This is a great body conditioner after exfoliation in addition to a great conditioner.</li>
            <li> Best Conditioner. It smells amazing but more importantly it really does keep my hair color locked in. I was a very light blonde and went to dark with some blonde highlights, my hairdresser was almost certain the color wouldnt stick, but i used both the Shampoo and Conditioner from enoy and i went back in to add more highlights and she was even amazed at how well the color stuck. This conditioner also leaves my hair so smooth and soft, I&#x27;ve used many high end hair products and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> A very good conditioner - may be a little to heavy for daily use, but leaves hair in great condition.  One thing to note - the bottles are big and really heavy.  I was surprised there was not a pump included, but if you have one to use with it, problem solved.</li>
            <li> DETANGLES! I have VERY long, thick hair - and I live by this conditioner. It is a must have. It detangles and smooths your hair.</li>
            <li> I like this product, a little pricey, but seems to be working well&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly, I will probably reorder</li>
            <li> I have  very curly hair. I have used enjoy for many years.  I try other products specifically for curly hair and I always go back to &amp;#34;Enjoy&amp;#34; products.  They are worth the price!</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever. Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.... Been using it for years and won&#x27;t use anything else</li>
            <li> The best shampoo on the market as far as I am concerned. It smells great and no sulfate. It is gentle on my color treated hair and the price on Amazon can not be beat in stores.  I have bought all types of expensive shampoos and this one is the best for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have straight but semi thick hair.  My hair used to be really smooth and soft, however over the years it has started to feel more course (i am more grey too).  This coniditioner makes my hair smooth and soft.  I have been using it for over a year now. I follow up with \\&quot;ITS A 10 MIRACLE LEAVE IN PLUS KERATIN\\&quot; which is helps me brush through while it is damp.[[ASIN:B005F4BH8A It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave -in Plus Keratin 10oz]]</li>
            <li> I have seriously damaged hair.  It seems to be a perfectly good conditioner, but not as &amp;#34;deep reaching&amp;#34; as I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> Love these Enjoy products. Shampoo and Conditioner both excellent products. Used Wen previously but like Enjoy better.&lt;br /&gt;Smells great too.</li>
            <li> Wonderful softness &amp; lift! Smells great too!</li>
            <li> my teen daughter uses this mostly.  I love the smell (like candy) but it is too heavy for me to use.  If you want silky smooth this will do it.  Makes a luxurious shaving cream too!</li>
            <li> After my hair stylist used this product on my hair, I purchased it. After using it few times I realized that I lose my hair more than normal. Thus, I did not like the product at all.</li>
            <li> I love this hair conditioner. It softens my coarse hair and helps tremendously with combing out tangles. Just Love it!</li>
            <li> I used Enjoy a long time ago and am just returning... I forgot how silky and luxurious it makes my hair feel. (I&#x27;ve been using organic products... so I only use this one before I&#x27;m going out with my beau or some other person who will be touching my hair!!)</li>
            <li> Same consistency as the one I get from the salon great price. Love it</li>
            <li> Best conditioner ever! Super smoothing.</li>
            <li> Perfect for my very long hair!</li>
