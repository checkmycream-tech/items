            <li>but I originally used it for my elbows and knees and it worked magic!</li>
            <li>Amira magic cream is the best my dark spot in face are gradually fading</li>
            <li>I have pretty amazing skin</li>
            <li>Even if this cream doesn&#x27;t lighten I am sold and will continue to forever buy this cream, it is soo light</li>
            <li>it is not greasy or heavy and is excellent under make up or alone.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>I have light skin as is</li>
            <li>This product is awesome ready for a second</li>
            <li>I am full Pilipino with a fairly light complexion.  </li>
            <li>I hope they never stop making it because my skin honestly cannot live without it.  </li>
            <li>I will be using this from now on, and by the way I didn&#x27;t care for the soap much though I will stay with Dove  and Amira Magic Cream.</li>
            <li>It smells great and has an iridescent hint to it that gives you a slight glow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pricey but trust, it&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
            <li>I used it twice a day and saw a difference within the first 7 days.</li>
            <li>I was skeptic at first</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone who wants softer and clearer skin!</li>
            <li>Really like this item.</li>
            <li>I gotta say, with continuous use - this really works.</li>
            <li>it really remove marks</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Not even a lighter gentle look&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
            <li>I would highly HIGHLY recommend it more than any other product.&lt;br</li>
            <li>A big bonus was that it made my skin SO smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>Now I just use it for soft skin and acne treatment which works REALLY</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is the authentic product.  </li>
            <li>In fact, it worked so well that I started using it on my face to lighten old acne scars (which it did).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting ready to purchase my second jar.</li>
            <li>yes yes yes.. finally something really works..</li>
            <li>only reason I gave this a 4 star is because I just received yesterday and don&#x27;t really know if it will lighten</li>
            <li>I like it and it really works, it helps clear some dark spot, pimples, blemishes and it clear some spot of age lines.</li>
            <li>, I believe my skin looks younger now than it did in my early 20s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really have a dark knees.</li>
            <li>I know it is too early to see if it will lighten and brighten but listen people after I used it my face had a slight cooling/tingling sensation and my skin felt ALIVE like it was saying thank you like</li>

            <li> This is a great whitening product! I really have a dark knees. My friends and even my mom and siblings always asks me if I have burned my knees cos&#x27; it really is dark! I tried different whitening creams but they just make my knees twice darker. By the way, I&#x27;m asian and a filipino. I have a tan skin color and my knees was thrice darker. But then when I tried using this product if works like magic! I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 3 weeks and it just keeps on getting fairer. My knees is almost the same color with my skin. I love this product and will keep on buying more!</li>

Even if this cream doesn&#x27;t lighten I am sold and will continue to forever buy this cream, it is soo light and it just absorbs into my faceand it is not greasy or heavy and is excellent under make up or alone.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I gave this a 4 star is because I just received yesterday and don&#x27;t really know if it will lighten and I don&#x27;t care besides my ambi cream I will be using this from now on, and by the way I didn&#x27;t care for the soap much though I will stay with Dove  and Amira Magic Cream.</li>
