            <li>I think this a great product.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m good.</li>
            <li>I love it and think it is great to do to make the nails look good for an event.</li>
            <li>used this before and really liked it</li>
            <li>some people even ask if these are my own nails.</li>
            <li>When I don&#x27;t have time to paint them but want them looking nice, I just do a tip</li>
            <li>it goes on very easy and with a good top coat</li>
            <li>ordered it and it was good and easy to use..</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just like with an eyeliner: with these pens one can draw a far more perfect line than with a paint-brush.</li>
            <li>Looks pretty great</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>After that I applied the pen, and then used a no chip top coat.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice bright white even with just one coat and applies extremely easily.</li>
            <li>Huge let-down</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t have your hands in water often though, shouldn&#x27;t be a huge problem.</li>
            <li>The pencil tip is good and easy to paint on nails but the white polish just doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>This french manicure white tip pen is a great solution for drawing perfect white tip lines.</li>
            <li>It takes a little practice (not that much) and it looks great!</li>
            <li>Well I bought this hoping a achieve an easy cute french manicure.</li>
            <li>I have a problem getting the right amount of whitener to the tip to apply on the end of my nails.</li>
            <li>only dislike is that it chips VERY easily.</li>
            <li>This was easy to apply and looked fabulous except when it cracked the next morning !</li>
            <li>then used one of those \\&quot;high shine\\&quot; nail buffers first to get everything smooth and shiny.</li>
            <li>I tried using nail guides first in the orly manicure kit.</li>
            <li>or in other words, if you can&#x27;t neatly use a texta, you won&#x27;t be able to neatly use this pen!</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a wonderful short term french manicure!!!</li>
            <li>so  much.</li>
            <li>Yahhh, not so much.</li>
            <li>This is much easier.</li>
            <li>I really had a problem opening the product.</li>
            <li>As a value-conscious consumer, I purchased the Sally Hansen French Manicure White Tip Pen hoping for a nice looking pedicure at home.</li>
            <li>that show you how to apply the rest of the french look and to clean up mistakes with a q-tip or synthetic brush.</li>
            <li>The white tip has to be covered with clear polish or it will wash off, and it does chip off easily.  </li>
            <li>sheer polish x 2 coats, they will last ages without chipping, and look fantastic!</li>
            <li>must be stored upside down as it will dry out more quickly than polish.</li>
            <li>I could never get the french manicure right with the stickers.</li>
            <li>it looks like I had them done professionally.</li>
            <li>make sure there is always enough white polish on the pen (use a small scrap of paper to dab it) and if you struggle to keep a neat line, practice at different angles, and holding the pen different ways until you find the easiest way for you to do it quickly and neatly.</li>
            <li>I found when I used it on my nails when they were short, they looked SO MUCH SHORTER because I could either a tiny, tiny tip...or make it thicker and sacrifice the rest of my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But this isn&#x27;t the case: the pen works until it is empty, and hardly leaves any chunks of dried polish, especially if you make sure you get the tip really wet, pressing it for half a minute on a paper to make it suck new fluid to the top.</li>

            <li> well the fine tip isn&#x27;t &#x27;fine&amp;#34; at all, it was more of a thick felt tip pen sort of tip , so that wasn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;ll do the same job as the traditional one..</li>
            <li> I do find that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like (3-4 days).</li>
            <li> My french manicures always used to look sloppy, I just couldn&#x27;t get the white tips right.</li>
            <li> Either it is too dry or there is too much fluid running out.  </li>
            <li> When I opened this package the nail pen was already open, and when i tried to use it, it was all dried up.</li>
            <li> What I got was clumpy thick tips that never dried.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a long time and sometimes when I bought it at stores it was dried out but this time&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> other than the fact that it states that it is a &amp;#34;traditional tip&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I have my hands in water a lot, and I have to fix/re-apply every other day or so.</li>
            <li> Total waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I was afraid the tip of the pen would block new fluid after use, because dried up polish is all over it.</li>
            <li> Now, that&#x27;s near-perfect, isn&#x27;t it - strict lines that even look like manifactured imitation nails!</li>
            <li> It chips less than half a day that I put it on.</li>
            <li> If you use the base coat first, then white tip, then</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Keep in mind, I had round,</li>
            <li> Also, let your nails grow out a bit and try it again if you disliked it before.</li>
            <li> I have found the only bad reviews are related to people&#x27;s inability to use it....</li>
            <li> The polish comes out of the pen so thin that it runs down into the crevice where the nail meets the skin.</li>
            <li> I also tried applying the product over a coat of clear polish, and it looked just as bad, going on splotchy, like trying to write on a slick surface with a marker.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t appear to be thick either.</li>
            <li> At first, I hated it.</li>
            <li> It was a mess and they peeled the base coat off.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!</li>
            <li> To not use a base coat.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed at it.</li>

            <li> Sister got this as a gift for me. I love it. It&#x27;s a nice bright white even with just one coat and applies extremely easily. Doesn&#x27;t appear to be thick either. I would get this again.</li>
            <li> used this before and really liked it</li>
            <li> looks  like a  great  idea...  not  so  much. I  followed  all  directions  and  ended  up  with  tips  so  blotchy I  removed  them.  on a  plus... I  used  out  to  write  my  address  on my  trash  can  since  my  neighbor  kept  taking  it...  works great</li>
            <li> I tried using nail guides first in the orly manicure kit. It was a mess and they peeled the base coat off. This was easy to apply and looked fabulous except when it cracked the next morning ! Huge let-down</li>
            <li> it work until you visit the nail salon</li>
            <li> Ugh! Well I bought this hoping a achieve an easy cute french manicure. Yahhh, not so much. What I got was clumpy thick tips that never dried. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> Have used it for a long time and sometimes when I bought it at stores it was dried out but this time&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it and it was good and easy to use..</li>
            <li> To not use a base coat. I prepped  my nails(clean, clip, file) then used one of those \\&quot;high shine\\&quot; nail buffers first to get everything smooth and shiny. After that I applied the pen, and then used a no chip top coat. Looks pretty great I think.</li>
            <li> must be stored upside down as it will dry out more quickly than polish.</li>
            <li> Wish they had the wider white French tip. The slim tip doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Brilliant! I have found the only bad reviews are related to people&#x27;s inability to use it....or in other words, if you can&#x27;t neatly use a texta, you won&#x27;t be able to neatly use this pen! If you use the base coat first, then white tip, then sheer polish x 2 coats, they will last ages without chipping, and look fantastic! TIP HINT: make sure there is always enough white polish on the pen (use a small scrap of paper to dab it) and if you struggle to keep a neat line, practice at different angles, and holding the pen different ways until you find the easiest way for you to do it quickly and neatly.</li>
            <li> other than the fact that it states that it is a &amp;#34;traditional tip&amp;#34; and i received a &amp;#34;fine tip&amp;#34; pen,it is great.. well the fine tip isn&#x27;t &#x27;fine&amp;#34; at all, it was more of a thick felt tip pen sort of tip , so that wasn&#x27;t bad, it&#x27;ll do the same job as the traditional one..</li>
            <li> What a great product! My french manicures always used to look sloppy, I just couldn&#x27;t get the white tips right. This french manicure white tip pen is a great solution for drawing perfect white tip lines. It&#x27;s just like with an eyeliner: with these pens one can draw a far more perfect line than with a paint-brush.

            <li> The white tip has to be covered with clear polish or it will wash off, and it does chip off easily.  Other than that it is a wonderful short term french manicure!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t flow well at all.  Either it is too dry or there is too much fluid running out.  Save your money.</li>
            <li> When I opened this package the nail pen was already open, and when i tried to use it, it was all dried up.</li>
            <li> At first, I hated it. Keep in mind, I had round, eggshell nails I kept VERY short. Once I actually started to grow my nails out...and filed them into a square shape...I LOVE it. When I don&#x27;t have time to paint them but want them looking nice, I just do a tip and I&#x27;m good. It&#x27;s SO much easier to apply with a square/squoval shape to your nail, vs round. Also, let your nails grow out a bit and try it again if you disliked it before. I found when I used it on my nails when they were short, they looked SO MUCH SHORTER because I could either a tiny, tiny tip...or make it thicker and sacrifice the rest of my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only dislike is that it chips VERY easily. I have my hands in water a lot, and I have to fix/re-apply every other day or so. If you don&#x27;t have your hands in water often though, shouldn&#x27;t be a huge problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed at it. It chips less than half a day that I put it on. The pencil tip is good and easy to paint on nails but the white polish just doesn&#x27;t stay. So don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
            <li> I could never get the french manicure right with the stickers. This is much easier. It takes a little practice (not that much) and it looks great! You can look up videos online that show you how to apply the rest of the french look and to clean up mistakes with a q-tip or synthetic brush. Chipping is not a problem if you apply topcoat daily ~ not a big deal. I do my nails once a week, and I save about $100/month on manicures.</li>
            <li> As a value-conscious consumer, I purchased the Sally Hansen French Manicure White Tip Pen hoping for a nice looking pedicure at home. What a disappointment! The polish comes out of the pen so thin that it runs down into the crevice where the nail meets the skin. I also tried applying the product over a coat of clear polish, and it looked just as bad, going on splotchy, like trying to write on a slick surface with a marker. Total waste of time and money!</li>
            <li> I think this a great product. it goes on very easy and with a good top coat it looks like I had them done professionally. I do find that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like (3-4 days). I am also washing my hands constantly as I work in the medical field and in and out of the operating room. I love it and think it is great to do to make the nails look good for an event.</li>
            <li> I have a problem getting the right amount of whitener to the tip to apply on the end of my nails. I really had a problem opening the product.</li>
