            <li>this wig is by far the best wig</li>

            <li>The wig I received was very high quality for the price - and it looked great with my Viking Halloween costume -</li>

            <li>I LOVE THIS COMPANY, X&amp;Y ANGEL.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>THANK YOU FOR SUCH AN WONDERFUL PRODUCT.....</li>
            <li>Love it and recommend to all.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve paid more for costume wigs.  </li>
            <li>love them both...</li>
            <li>I love it, is really beautiful and natural...</li>
            <li>This wig was soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom and a beautiful dirty-blondeish color.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really happy with it so far</li>
            <li>and it doesn&#x27;t lose a lot of hair like most cheap wigs do.</li>
            <li>While the hair is good quality, it isn&#x27;t so much toward the hairline where its sewn in.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easy to style.</li>
            <li>it came very quickly like 5 days i love it its so beautiful and long</li>
            <li>If you do decide to purchase it, I would strongly suggest contacting the vendor to ensure you&#x27;re getting what&#x27;s pictured and not some over-priced</li>

            <li>B005KO7NK6 Stunning beautiful long LIGHT BROWN curly wave wig full wigs jf010023]]</li>
            <li>You could certainly wear it with a costume..and look spectacular...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had my hair dresser shape it up for me, and you honestly cannot tell the difference between my real hair or the wig...</li>
            <li>its a cheaply made wig and isnt at all what it looks like.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the quality and the color is great but the bangs are really long</li>
            <li>I loved the color the fit the curls the softness and it feels so much like real hair.</li>
            <li>so it looks better and more natural.</li>
            <li>I have kind of a big head :-)</li>
            <li>Hardly any shedding, NO bald spots, perfect thickness and bouncy curls.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend!  :)</li>
            <li>I wore one of them last night and loved it.</li>
            <li>ever I loved it and it looks and feels real simply awsome</li>
            <li>Must have meant sweet.</li>
            <li>I guess that is the sweet part.</li>
            <li>Strangers will never no the difference, family and friends love the new look!  </li>
            <li>only thing that would make it more perfect is if it had little clips on the front of the wig, like some others do.</li>
            <li>Thnx for such a good product , cheap pric and fast shipping .....</li>
            <li>I found it here first!</li>
            <li>It was easy to shape up the bangs, and although it took a little while to style, that&#x27;s only because I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience, BUT the wig itself is wonderful.</li>
            <li>After I adjusted the size, it fit very well and didn&#x27;t fall off when I ran or did anything else.</li>
            <li>I love the hi lights it has, and the hair feels so soft..  </li>
            <li>the blonde color was nice</li>
            <li>What the heck gotta laugh.</li>
            <li>I brushed it out and that gave it more volume and made it look softer and more realistic.</li>
            <li>but my own hair is long</li>
            <li>When I ordered this wig it was to wear with an American Dream costume for Halloween with the added bonus of being able to wear it again as a fun change-it-up-day wig.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because I like the idea of being able to change my hair color constantly without the damage that dye jobs do.</li>
            <li>I look hot in it .....</li>
            <li>It is such a cute wig.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d be interested in knowing which vendor all the 5 star customers purchased theirs through, so leave a comment, please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Will definitely be purchasing more from this seller.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I bought this wig on May 30th and it arrived on June 8th which was pretty fast.</li>
            <li>Except for the wig is longer than my real hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Thanks so much....</li>
            <li>but no so much for going out.</li>
            <li>so it looks like your real hair-</li>
            <li>ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;love</li>
            <li>THAT MUCH.</li>
            <li>Everyone can&#x27;t believe how real it looks.</li>
            <li>/&gt;But, not only did the package come earlier than expected, but the wig itself is GORGEOUS!</li>
            <li>wont be worn daily, just for fun</li>
            <li>I really was expecting something special since all but two reviews were 5 stars, and the other two were 4 stars.</li>
            <li>and it fits me fine with room to adjust it larger or smaller.  </li>
            <li>I may be new to wigs, but I did my research by reading reviews and watching YouTube demos.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not as lifelike as the wife was expecting and the bangs are even longer than the picture...too long..</li>

            <li>So, don&#x27;t be surprised when you get a wig that is not ombre and has no bangs.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>The hair feels soft and natural.</li>
            <li>It has a natural gloss</li>

            <li>I would not be surprised.</li>
            <li>I bought the same wig in different colors and they have been worth every penny spent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Overall though, the hair is so realistic</li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that the bangs are more like side bangs</li>
            <li>I attempted to comb it with the wig comb that came with one of the other wigs, and I started at the bottom inch and ever so gently began working my way up.</li>

            <li>I had to trim the bangs because they were too long for my face, but after I brushed it out and put it on, it look natural!</li>
            <li>Since it&#x27;s not \\&quot;soft\\&quot; and just not even the quality of the wig that I only paid $8 for, I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be worth the trouble as I finally finished combing two, one inch sections.</li>
            <li>weird, obviously a wig, fabricated out of some kind of scratchy synthetic stuff \\&quot;wig.\\&quot;my head over.</li>

            <li> I bought this product because I like the idea of being able to change my hair color constantly without the damage that dye jobs do. I bought this wig on May 30th and it arrived on June 8th which was pretty fast. I enjoy the quality and the color is great but the bangs are really long so I had to cut them. Also, the length of the wig is really long so I had to trim that too. Overall though, the hair is so realistic and it&#x27;s not shiny so it looks better and more natural. You should buy a wig cap too because I&#x27;m not really a fan of the one they sent with it. I have kind of a big head :-) so I was happy that it still fit perfectly! Now I just have to get eyebrow pencil to blend my eyebrows in :-)</li>
            <li> This wig was and is fantastic! I was expecting like the caliber of a costume wig! Well it&#x27;s way, way more than that type of wig!! It feels and looks like human hair! I&#x27;ve had my hair dresser shape it up for me, and you honestly cannot tell the difference between my real hair or the wig... Except for the wig is longer than my real hair. Strangers will never no the difference, family and friends love the new look!  Highly, highly recommend!  :)</li>
            <li> Thnx for such a good product , cheap pric and fast shipping ..... I can use accessories with it .... Just love it ! I look hot in it .....yay:P</li>
            <li> I love the hi lights it has, and the hair feels so soft..  I had to cut the bangs, cause they were really long but if you wear it back futher no problem.. I&#x27;m really happy with it so far</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s beautiful! The only complaint I have is that the bangs are more like side bangs and I had to cut them. Still love the color and everything else though!</li>
            <li> This wig was soft as a baby&#x27;s bottom and a beautiful dirty-blondeish color. Will buy it again in the future. It also came like a week ahead of the estimated shipping time.</li>
            <li> I ordered this mid July and it said it would come around September 3rd. It came the first of August :D The color is AMAZING&lt;br /&gt;I love the tones of blond. The wig is great for every day use. IT is not too shiny or blah. It&#x27;s not my thickest wig but it is not so thin you can see the wig lace. I would recommend this wig for sure! Can&#x27;t wait to wear it out and about</li>
            <li> I ordered this wig i woulda thought it will arrive in two weeks it came very quickly like 5 days i love it its so beautiful and long i can brush it when it gets flat i wear it out get many stares for the price its a good deal i was iffy about it but you cant beat the price you get great quality i absolutely love this wig and will keep purchasing from this seller!!

            <li> I wore this to The Cure concert. It is such a cute wig. Everyone wanted to try it on and could not believe the price!</li>
            <li> This wig did not come with bangs, it was way too big for my head and just looked awful.  I am working on sending it back asap.</li>
            <li> I love it, is really beautiful and natural... the blonde color was nice e beautiful... l recommend it... really good made...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much....</li>
            <li> Looks just like picture! It was for a costume and looks terrific with it. wont be worn daily, just for fun</li>
            <li> When I ordered this wig it was to wear with an American Dream costume for Halloween with the added bonus of being able to wear it again as a fun change-it-up-day wig. I really was expecting something special since all but two reviews were 5 stars, and the other two were 4 stars. For reference, I purchased it through E-Tribe (and OMG, they&#x27;re now charging $50.99, Prime for it! Do NOT, I repeat, DO NOT purchase this through E-Tribe!!!)I paid $20.99 Prime for it, and thank goodness I can return it! I&#x27;d be interested in knowing which vendor all the 5 star customers purchased theirs through, so leave a comment, please!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About the wig I received from E-Tribe:&lt;br /&gt;1. The picture now (Oct. 25) is NOT the wig I received. Mine has bangs and highlights and is definitely blonde. They changed the picture about 3-4 days ago. So, don&#x27;t be surprised when you get a wig that is not ombre and has no bangs.&lt;br /&gt;2. Bangs are just funky. There&#x27;s all this matting underneath the three layers where they&#x27;re sewn in. I tried it on and had an impossible time trying to get them combed so that the cap or the fuzzy stuff didn&#x27;t show.&lt;br /&gt;3. I may be new to wigs, but I did my research by reading reviews and watching YouTube demos. I had also ordered [[ASIN:B005KO7NK6 Stunning beautiful long LIGHT BROWN curly wave wig full wigs jf010023]] and [[ASIN:B00DYG5MNM Eking HOT New Lady Hair Style Fashion Glamour Natural Fluffy Long Full Dark Brown Sexy Wave Wig Hair Curl Wigs + Wig Cap + Wig Comb]],plus two others that haven&#x27;t arrived yet. This X&amp;Y wig is described as \\&quot;soft\\&quot;... um, I guess that&#x27;s a subjective term, but it&#x27;s NOT what I&#x27;d call \\&quot;soft\\&quot;. Both of my other wigs are really soft. I wore one of them last night and loved it. It was easy to shape up the bangs, and although it took a little while to style, that&#x27;s only because I don&#x27;t have a lot of experience, BUT the wig itself is wonderful. This thing is not.&lt;br /&gt;4. I tried this thing on and it was a matted mess after all I did was flip my head over. I attempted to comb it with the wig comb that came with one of the other wigs, and I started at the bottom inch and ever so gently began working my way up. Since it&#x27;s not \\&quot;soft\\&quot; and just not even the quality of the wig that I only paid $8 for, I knew it wasn&#x27;t going to be worth the trouble as I finally finished combing two, one inch sections. At that point I took it off because I&#x27;m returning it.&lt;br /&gt;So... I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend this wig. If you do decide to purchase it, I would strongly suggest contacting the vendor to ensure you&#x27;re getting what&#x27;s pictured and not some over-priced weird, obviously a wig, fabricated out of some kind of scratchy synthetic stuff \\&quot;wig.\\&quot;my head over.

            <li> My wife loved the curls and the length of the wig. She wears it for her photo session and looks stunning. Awesome.</li>
            <li> i wore it a few times and i feel so fake. What the heck gotta laugh. laughter is good medicine.</li>
            <li> Fun wig, perfect for Halloween but no so much for going out. While the hair is good quality, it isn&#x27;t so much toward the hairline where its sewn in.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about purchasing a cheap wig- you know what they say: \\&quot;You get what you pay for.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, not only did the package come earlier than expected, but the wig itself is GORGEOUS! I had to trim the bangs because they were too long for my face, but after I brushed it out and put it on, it look natural! It has a \\&quot;scalp\\&quot; at the top so it looks like your real hair- and it doesn&#x27;t lose a lot of hair like most cheap wigs do. When I brush it, the curls bounce back into place. After I adjusted the size, it fit very well and didn&#x27;t fall off when I ran or did anything else. It&#x27;s also not as itchy as other wigs, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting that. I love this wig. I put a pic in the reviews so that you can see how it looks on me, so you can be a judge for yourself.</li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;love these products. I got this for a friend and she wears it everyday.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s so cute and heat resistant so it&#x27;s easy to style.</li>
            <li> Not even close to the wig I ordered. Totally different color. Completely different cut. Takes me about 20 minutes to make the hair line / fringe look okay. The part/ cut / fringe is horrible. Tangles very easily and sheds a lot.</li>
            <li> do not order from these ppl. its a cheaply made wig and isnt at all what it looks like. matter of fact it isnt the same thing at all</li>
            <li> Although the image has now changed to show an Ombre style wig, the one I purchased is one with highlights. It is just beautiful. Straight out of the bag and onto my head, it looks great. I brushed it out and that gave it more volume and made it look softer and more realistic. I am absolutely in love with this wig. Will definitely be purchasing more from this seller. The price is just too low to pass up! I bought this wig for fun, but I&#x27;m now seriously considering wearing it out. I don&#x27;t see why not! It looks amazing. No fallout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that would make it more perfect is if it had little clips on the front of the wig, like some others do. But, I can do without them. Maybe I can add some myself.</li>
            <li> The wig I received was very high quality for the price - and it looked great with my Viking Halloween costume - but it was definitely not the wig shown in the picture. \\&quot;My\\&quot; wig is just blonde - not two-toned - and has quite a thick fringe.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as lifelike as the wife was expecting and the bangs are even longer than the picture...too long.. Of course, you can just cut them I guess. Overall though, you get what&#x27;s pictured... It&#x27;s a wig. ;)</li>
            <li> THIS IS JUST WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR. PERFECT COLOR &amp; HIGHLIGHTS. I COULDNT BE HAPPIER. WISH THERE WAS A WAY TO GET SEVERAL STYLES IN THIS COLOR, I LOVE IT THAT MUCH. PLUS I LOVE THIS COMPANY, X&amp;Y ANGEL.&lt;br /&gt;I WONT SHOP ANY PLACE ELSE. THANK YOU FOR SUCH AN WONDERFUL PRODUCT.....</li>
            <li> I loved the color the fit the curls the softness and it feels so much like real hair. I can wear it to and function.</li>
            <li> this wig is by far the best wig ever I loved it and it looks and feels real simply awsome</li>
            <li> It is thick enough that it looks more expensive than it was. The color is about the same as in the picture. My daughter wears it a lot.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice wig but NOTHING like the picture they were advertising it to be.&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed but it looks nice so might as well keep it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought a lot of wigs and this is clearly the best, most well-made wig of the bunch! It has extra elastic bands to strap you in and comes with a little hair net for your existing hair. BEST WIG EVER!</li>
            <li> My mom bought this wig for me for my birthday. Everyone can&#x27;t believe how real it looks. I can&#x27;t believe the quality either. Hardly any shedding, NO bald spots, perfect thickness and bouncy curls. Fits my head perfectly and was never once itchy or hot. Great choice for my first non costume wig. Love it and recommend to all.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice hairpiece. I don&#x27;t know why they call it \\&quot;sweat\\&quot; in the description. Must have meant sweet. The colors are well mixed to give a slight highlight effect to the style. I guess that is the sweet part. The amount of strands seems correct and I mean that to say that some wigs seem to lack the fullness or body of hair and this one hits it right. Good density and hang to the style. The construction looks to be well made for this price range and looks good on me as well. I bought the same wig in different colors and they have been worth every penny spent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this is your style and length then I say you will not be disappointed. Buy two and be twice as happy.</li>
            <li> Loved the color, bangs were just not believable at all looked really fake</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe the price on this wig!  I&#x27;ve paid more for costume wigs.  This is NOT a costume wig.  You could certainly wear it with a costume..and look spectacular...but this is a quality wig.  The hair feels soft and natural. It has a natural gloss but it is not shiny. I hate those shiny wigs. It has a standard adjustable cap. I&#x27;m an adult..a little bit on the small side..but my own hair is long so I have a lot of hair to pile up inside and it fits me fine with room to adjust it larger or smaller.  If I saw this wig in a retail store with a price of $150..I would not be surprised. Thank goodness I found it here first! I bought it in 2 colors...love them both...so I&#x27;m putting this same review on both.</li>
