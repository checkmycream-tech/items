            <li>It functioned great plugged in or not.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, the design of this unit is well thought out and it is quite attractive.  </li>
            <li>This is an awsome trimmer at a great price.</li>
            <li>Suggested improvement - A stand would have been great</li>
            <li>The height adjustment is great too, those that complain about it moving out of the number need to stop smashing it into their face and keep their hand away from the adjuster.</li>
            <li>It works and is attractive.  </li>
            <li>The product itself is great and shipping went well.</li>
            <li>very easy cleaning, great product!</li>
            <li>I love it!!</li>
            <li>And I just LOVE the mini-beard trimmer attachment!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li>Sideburn accessory is very handy for keeping the &#x27;burns</li>
            <li>Very nice product.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time, but for now it&#x27;s very nice, no pinching, no pulling.    </li>
            <li>The turbo function though a bit noisy, but very handy.</li>
            <li>The trimmer guide has 9 very precise trimming length settings  - I found a 5 setting perfect for a medium length beard.  </li>
            <li>Amazing!</li>
            <li>This thing is simply amazing!</li>
            <li>It still runs amazingly well with no maintenance!</li>
            <li>It is simply amazing!  </li>
            <li>I went from a nice beard to the 5 o-clock shadow look!  </li>
            <li>My husband has tried many beard trimmers and he says this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li>I am a very happy and satisfied customer.</li>
            <li>It even has done a remarkable job maintaining its charge.  </li>
            <li>the best I&#x27;ve been able to find these days.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is awesome and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn a beard for over twenty five years and have used many types of trimmers--plug-in, cordless, scissors, and this is the best yet.  </li>
            <li>The Philips has been in use a month and is remarkable.</li>
            <li>Have owned this for many years and functions perfectly!</li>
            <li>excellent value for money great product and very quick</li>
            <li>the trimmer is really good and very handy.</li>
            <li>I am very happy with the purchase and if you have a decently full beard you like to keep trim, it is a great product.</li>
            <li>The travel case is wonderful for easy storage.</li>
            <li>Feels great in your hand and trims amazingly well without shooting hair all over your bathroom.</li>
            <li>I think the trimmer does a good job trimming evenly and the attachment for detailed trimming is excellent.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, a good purchase.</li>
            <li>and I can&#x27;t find a good replacement that will also use AC power.</li>
            <li>This trimmer does a good job of vacuuming the hairs and keeping them out of the sink.</li>
            <li>And the Amazon price is so good.   </li>
            <li>and he seems to be delighted.</li>
            <li>The comb does not allow good mustache trimming.  </li>
            <li>It does the job it is supposed to do and vacuums good even without putting it in turbo.</li>
            <li>Part alignment must be perfect of they don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li>The guard feels good against my skin and the hairs are all evenly cut.</li>
            <li>Definately a good buy.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, it is fair to mention one fatal flaw with this design:  </li>
            <li>dat means it is really a good trimmer..</li>
            <li>This product had good ratings</li>
            <li>Trimmer works good.  </li>
            <li>This one is just as good.</li>
            <li>A good trimmer for the $.</li>
            <li>not that you would ever wanna shave a good beard off.</li>
            <li>She, and the girlfriend loved the difference.</li>
            <li>, this one is not as good as you hope it will be.</li>
            <li>..just didnt think that the vaccuum would be that good since it was cordless...</li>
            <li>A good buy.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for a 5 &#x27;o&#x27; clock shadow, but also nice for longer lengths.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is a good and reliable product.</li>
            <li>The power is good too.</li>
            <li>Husband loved it.</li>
            <li>However, I chalked that up to not liking the rotary system and this trimmer had some good reviews.  </li>
            <li>The price was good and shipped on time...</li>
            <li>Good product.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good value and</li>
            <li>I feel like I bought the best trimmer that was available on the market.</li>
            <li>but in a good way.</li>
            <li>Good Product, get one.</li>
            <li>and I have loved it.  </li>
            <li>Basically, if you want a really good beard trimmer, this is what you want.  </li>
            <li>Good value for price..</li>
            <li>it does a fair job of sucking up the trimmings, so</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s been a good buy, no problems yet.    </li>
            <li>This is a good trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Good trimmer for the money.</li>
            <li>But otherwise good product.</li>
            <li>Good trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It had done a good job but</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a well made piece of machinery that feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good.</li>
            <li>Good ergonomics.</li>
            <li>Might be good for shearing sheep.</li>
            <li>i bought this to keep my beard nice and trim and it works GREAT.  </li>
            <li>Good at sucking up hair.</li>
            <li>This is a superior product to the Wahl in every respect.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t felt the need to use the turbo button so that might be contributing to the good battery life.    </li>
            <li>Good power and cut.</li>
            <li>It is good but as not par with what it promised.</li>
            <li>Rest are good.....</li>
            <li>it is a good product.  </li>
            <li>It does a good job of collecting the trimmings, but it won&#x27;t capture 100%.</li>
            <li>All and all another good Norelco.</li>
            <li>This is a good trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I charged the trimmer and gave it a good run for the money.</li>
            <li>This puppy is good.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a snap to keep my goatee looking good.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m completely delighted with my purchase and the value that I received for my investment.</li>
            <li>Good luck.</li>
            <li>I have not found a good nose hair trimmer yet.</li>
            <li>Good product.</li>
            <li>The battery is still good.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s definitely good for trimming your beard, manscaping, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>This quality beard trimmer is excellent for catching beard hair and for making cleanup easy.  </li>
            <li>I found the Phillips Norelco T980 fairly quickly and was impressed by the good reviews.</li>
            <li>It also charges quickly and indicates when the charging is finished.&lt;br /&gt;I shopped around, and Amazon&#x27;s price (when I bought it) was the best around, online or in stores.</li>
            <li>The improvement in features and performance is tremendous, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is wonderful, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li>The best of the best, fast, clean and very suitable.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li>but otherwise I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li>I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>My husband is very satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>and it also is great for bald patchy spots on top of the head.</li>
            <li>All-in-all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li>I have been using the T980 for over 3 months now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied with my choice.</li>
            <li>It makes beard trimming a very enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li>Its a well made device that does what it says and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m very glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li>It cuts very smooth!</li>
            <li>and it also is great for bald patchy spots on top of the head.</li>
            <li>very, very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned the T980 for 6 weeks now and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li>very satisfied with the trimmer</li>
            <li>Since then, I have been very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li>I am very satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>As others have said, a stand to store it in would have been nice, but to be fair</li>
            <li>It is easily the best beard trimmer of the many that I have owned.  </li>
            <li>The benefit of having one-size cuts all is very nice, but a trimmer with interchangeable trimming lengths would probably be more sufficient.  </li>
            <li>Look and feel is very stylish and the blade technology is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li>Plus, this one does a great job of catching all of the clippings making it a very clean and effortless experience.</li>
            <li>Boy am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li>It has so many functions all in one trimmer!</li>
            <li>LOVE IT!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the trimmer for a couple of months now and simply love it!</li>
            <li>The battery on this trimmer is outstanding!</li>
            <li>And now he doesn&#x27;t have to shave the old-fashioned way any more!</li>
            <li>all three guys love it!</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and I think my wife likes it even better!  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS TRIMMER!  </li>
            <li>Well, I am certainly glad I did!  </li>
            <li>Now with this trimmer he gets a much better trim and the hair is vaccumed up and never reaches the sink!  </li>
            <li>Besides that I love it!</li>
            <li>LOVE this trimmer!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone thorugh many beard trimmers and electric shavers, this one is TOPS!  </li>
            <li>Electric shavers for beards sure beat the heck out of scissors!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still very happy with this unit, but I think the newer method of clipping removal is not as good as the older unit.</li>
            <li>The trimmer itself works great, and the adjustable hights are easy to use.  </li>
            <li>He says it works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The clipper works great and easily cuts/trims without any effort.</li>
            <li>It made me WANT to shave, which is amazing.  </li>
            <li>If you buy this in hopes to remove the guard and shave smooth, youre not going to be happy.    </li>
            <li>This shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li>This is the absolute best product out there. . .</li>
            <li>This is a necessity for men, you should own one.</li>
            <li>Nice 70 minute charge, comfortable to hold, and attractive style.  </li>
            <li>nice carrying bag too included.</li>
            <li>trims nice.</li>
            <li>the best part is its precision trimmer, gives you a very close trim.</li>
            <li>* Turbo button to boost the speed of the blades is a nice feature  *</li>
            <li>My husband is returning his Phlips Norelco beard trimmer because it leaves his beard shaggy and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t make a neat, tidy line.  </li>
            <li>The vaccume feature is really nice.  </li>
            <li>This would be really nice if it had came with the stand</li>
            <li>My husband had one of these and our son uses it all the time, so I wanted to get him his own for Christmas.  </li>
            <li>The T980 comes with accessories and its own storage pouch.  </li>
            <li>I bought this to replace my Remington MB400 trimmer which I really liked.</li>
            <li>I babied the batteries for years and quite honestly if you don&#x27;t, with Ni-Cads you&#x27;ll be replacing them or the trimmer a lot</li>
            <li>But if you want anything from the popular \\&quot;haven&#x27;t shaved for a day</li>
            <li>I *borrowed* this from my man after my own wimpy, girly trimmer broke.  </li>
            <li>what angle I use it at because of the way the hair guard is made (nice feature).  </li>
            <li>The best straight razor), to shave and get the edges of the style perfected.</li>
            <li>Those trimmers are nice to own, compared to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is by far the greatest trimmer I have ever own, love the Turbo , no hairs anywhere, works great</li>
            <li>Overall, this was a great price for this trimmer and the quality is excellent!</li>
            <li>My husband has another Norelco and liked it</li>
            <li>Nice trimmer,</li>
            <li>It keeps his beard nice and trim.</li>
            <li>Plus, it&#x27;s nice to have a comb that varies in height rather than a set of combs that could get lost.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is really nice</li>
            <li>Nice travel bag.  </li>
            <li>- Nice design.  </li>
            <li>Kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li>and I concur - it would be nice.  </li>
            <li>and I concur - it would be nice.  </li>
            <li>handy</li>
            <li>I am kind of disapointed.</li>
            <li>Some of the concerns that others noted (followed by my own impressions):  </li>
            <li>Nice even trim.</li>
            <li>This one is nice</li>
            <li>turn knob and get any setting automatically, nice not to have a bunch of combs to lose.  </li>
            <li>Turbo option is also nice one.</li>
            <li>makes your sink nice</li>
            <li>This T980 trimmer does everything nicely, but not as nicely as the discontinued and</li>
            <li>The heigh adjustment click in nicely.</li>
            <li>The cover over the blades ride nicely over your face but this is something you&#x27;ll have to use the included cleaning brush to wipe out hair that will stick in</li>
            <li>a nice stubble-y look</li>
            <li>If you use the turbo feature, it is still not that effective.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a good dependable trimmer (that doesn&#x27;t pull more hair than it cuts)</li>
            <li>This razor impressed me so much</li>
            <li>after I butter myself up for a nice shave, I let the Norelco do the work, and the result makes my face make a baby&#x27;s butt feel like sandpaper.</li>
            <li>but curly beard hairs have a mind of their own.  </li>
            <li>and this is nice to keep it trim.  </li>
            <li>The T980 is a nice upgrade.  </li>
            <li>kind</li>
            <li>and it does a nice job.  </li>
            <li>It is functional and handy and trims well.</li>
            <li>The easy-adjust ring was nice.</li>
            <li>This is a nice beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>and it does a good job of capturing most of the hair.</li>
            <li>It gave a nice even trim all around.  </li>
            <li>and I love the fact that it&#x27;s a good size and weight for travel.</li>
            <li>Provides a nice trim.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re planning on buying this item, you might want to do some comparison shopping first to make sure you&#x27;re getting the best deal.</li>
            <li>Workd great for me - I use the Norelcon to avoid having to have a \\&quot;clean shave\\</li>
            <li>My T980 does almost everything perfectly: it holds a charge for weeks; its vacuum reduces the number of trimmed hairs around the sink by about 70%; it feels wonderful and it works quickly.    </li>
            <li>Excellent high end trimmer.  </li>
            <li>and then it would charge to full capacity, that is great.  </li>
            <li>Light and handy!</li>
            <li>It cuts well, has the attachment for more precise trimming, holds a good charge, has the corded/cordless feature that predecessors did not, and still has a fair price.  </li>
            <li>but overall the shaver is good quality and works great!</li>
            <li>It gives a good, close trim and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this trimmer about 12 times since writing this review, and by a combination of duct tape, a pinch grip, and a good deal of vigilance I had been able to avoid too many embarrassing shifts in beard length.    </li>
            <li>&quot; But I was impressed by the vacuum (which does collect a good 80% of the hair) and thought I&#x27;d try it out for the 60 day money-back time period.</li>
            <li>I find it very easy to use as it allows precision trimming lengths and</li>
            <li>Its very easy to travel with also.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is very easy, and I don&#x27;t believe it ever has to be oiled, which is quite a convenience.</li>
            <li>Works great and the clipper does a pretty good job of collecting most of the trimmings.  </li>
            <li>Works on beard and mustache great, cuts head hair, arm pits and trims other body hair places wonderfully!    </li>
            <li>It works very well, the battery life between charges is very good</li>
            <li>This trimmer holds a charge for a good amount of time and is very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li>This is the best one I have found so far.  </li>
            <li>I liked the 4 better anyway, so stuck with that.  </li>
            <li>This tool gets my most enthusiastic endorsement.</li>
            <li>The T980 trimmer is so far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried them all in the 25 years that i have a beard and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>This is by far the best beard trimmer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li>The battery is much better than the model I used to own.</li>
            <li>This is the best so far.</li>
            <li>Not 100% effective but way better than nothing.</li>
            <li>So far it is wonderful.</li>
            <li>Really a great buy and worth the cost.</li>
            <li>Light, good power</li>
            <li>I am sure every product purchased will have some kind of \\&quot;negative,\\&quot;</li>
            <li>and it would be nice if the vacume was more effetive and worked with the neck trimmer.</li>
            <li>My Dad and Brother both own one and love it.</li>
            <li>By far, this is the best trimmer, I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li>According to the Norelco site the T980 was the most popular seller, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li>This my 4rd trimmer in 15 years and by far the best yet.</li>
            <li>The price and free shipping made for a good deal.</li>
            <li>Also holds a charge quite well and so far very happy with it.</li>
            <li>So far this has really impressed me.</li>
            <li>After using this product for about a month I have zero complaints and have been very impressed with the it so far.</li>
            <li>So far its perfect for keeping an even tamed beast on my mug.</li>
            <li>I *loved* the T990 and would buy it again, but it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it is more than moderately effective.</li>
            <li>If I want a real clean look</li>
            <li>It makes it go faster with a cool noise, so even in a shaver that is attractive to many.    </li>
            <li>I tried this trimmer right away when I received it and it works great.  </li>
            <li>Have been using this trimmer for 3 years, still going strong!</li>
            <li>great razor trims very good not a linner and be careful with the Vac.</li>
            <li>I use it in the high speed position and it does a very good job of trapping clippings.  </li>
            <li>Turbo is good, but does not help you with a clean sink.</li>
            <li>It gives a superior, even beard and mustache trim, glides smoothly across without snagging, and catches most (yes, not ALL) your clippings.  </li>
            <li>I found it very easy and am satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li>It has a superb cut &amp; a nice vacuum for the droppings.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works as well as expected...not perfect but fairly  effective.</li>
            <li>the feature I liked best about it was the built in vacuum.</li>
            <li>Certainly some bits escape, but for the most part, I think it does an excellent job and is very easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li>Very pleased with this choice and happy to recommend it to anyone considering purchasing a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>The first one was great and lasted years.  </li>
            <li>This is my first electric beard trimmer and it is great.  </li>
            <li>I loved it, easy to cut the line and easy to switch the blade for a close up trim.</li>
            <li>It seems fine for a battery operated trimmer, EXCEPT!  </li>
            <li>Very accurate.  </li>
            <li>and I find it a very comfortable shaver to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>but the bulk is an issue for very detailed areas.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s very light too.</li>
            <li>- Very comfortable in the face.  </li>
            <li>It replaced a very cheap Remington trimmer that I had for years (the rechargable battery no longer held a charge) and</li>
            <li>And very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li>After some 9 months of use, this unit still looks great, cuts great, and has a pleasingly long battery life.</li>
            <li>Also a good solution for quick adjustments on those \\&quot;in a hurry\\&quot; mornings.</li>
            <li>but the flaw lies in that it is super bulky and it isn&#x27;t good for close up trims.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to use and trimming nicely....</li>
            <li>This trimmer does exactly what it is supposed to do, and does it very nicely.</li>
            <li>I am delighted with my purchase and it exceeded my expectations in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is light, easy to operate, rechargeable and has precision blades that cut evenly.  </li>
            <li>I previously had a Norelco Trimmer that I absolutely loved and thought worked wonderful.</li>
            <li>That being said, it works wonderfully, trims my facial hair nicely, and is easy to use.    </li>
            <li>have not figured out what turbo is for, sure the blades move faster and the device is louder</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen many of these types of trimmers and they come with all these attachments for the different hair lengths but the fact that this one has 9 adjustable lengths built in is just great!</li>
            <li>Have had this trimmer for a couple months now and love it.</li>
            <li>I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li>so I have hope that this time everything will be ok :)</li>
            <li>After reading many reviews of this product I was sold and went ahead and ordered it.  </li>
            <li>Plan on changing shirts after use. :)</li>
            <li>okay triming attachment</li>
            <li>, vacuume is an okay idea  </li>
            <li>Finding a shaver that works well for me has been more than a challenge.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer does a good job vacuuming the trimmings, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>But now I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li>Maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the T980 Turbo (and don&#x27;t all guys love stuff with \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; in the description?)</li>
            <li>(Some get away, but many fewer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Next to my Family Guy box sets this is the best purchase I have made in 12 months.      </li>
            <li>not NiCd, so I&#x27;m quite pleased about that.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s job better.  </li>
            <li>And of course I love the vacuuming ability of the trimmer.</li>
            <li>Actually performs as advertised and even gives an excellent close haircut.</li>
            <li>I wish the case that came with it were more compact, even form fitting.</li>
            <li>The T980 is ok.  </li>
            <li>It does the job for sure</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m glad I did--</li>
            <li>Ok its not dual exhaust</li>
            <li>I  have trimmed my beard a number of times since 1975 and this one is just OK.</li>
            <li>Catches most (98% or more) of the hair.  </li>
            <li>It even does a better job shaving my head than my Oster Turbo 111 electric razor.</li>
            <li>I love the way my boyfriend looks a day or two after shaving, so after doing some research I found this razor.  </li>
            <li>After using this, he has that sexy \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot; but manicured look.  </li>
            <li>It is OK.</li>
            <li>You need time to become more accustomed with it.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure this thing can get through the narliest of beards...</li>
            <li>:)  </li>
            <li>the problem was they didnt make the one I have any more...</li>
            <li>I was led to believe 90% of the hair would be collected and not end up all over the place, but it is more like 60% of the hair is captured, and quite a bit still ends up all over the sink.</li>
            <li>I think the guide/comb part could be better.  </li>
            <li>Gets most of the clippings making cleanup a breeze.</li>
            <li>The distance between the stationary and the moving blade on the Braun was maybe 1mm; on this Norelco T980, it was more like 3mm.  </li>
            <li>Battery life also satisfied and inline with their description.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the affordable great product....</li>
            <li>It also has many more length adjustments than most trimmers.  </li>
            <li>The extra power this trimmer delivers over comparable models is excellent.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned Norelco beard and mustache for years but after a ciuple of months this one would start without even touching it, The on-off button became defective.</li>
            <li>I would pay alittle more for a better quality trimer.</li>
            <li>When I went to replace the T980 that died, I avoided the latest Phillips/Norelco version because I think a wet/dry is</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a newer one by now, but  </li>
            <li>so maybe it will get better with age.</li>
            <li>This is my story of how I came to possess quite possibly the greatest trimmer known to man:    </li>
            <li>I did a Google search for \\&quot;top trimmer.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>I fell in love.    </li>
            <li>I have used various trimmers but this is the best i have ever used.</li>
            <li>Most men do not know how to trim their beard.....</li>
            <li>The seller shipped fast and was great.  </li>
            <li>then I am sure you will find this trimmer just find for your needs.  </li>
            <li>It vacuums the hairs better.</li>
            <li>I must say that I disagree with most reviewers on this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I bought this for my dad for last Christmas, and it&#x27;s been incredible!</li>
            <li>Take THAT, Fantastic Sam&#x27;s!</li>
            <li>Having used this item for several weeks, I can attest to it&#x27;s excellent performance.  </li>
            <li>all should accept 110-230 volts, since they are mostly travel items.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean out, and the adjustable guard does a good job of providing the selected shave length across the contours of the face.</li>
            <li>but most of it.</li>
            <li>It had it&#x27;s problems like many of these in holding the desired length.</li>
            <li>Not terrible</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t imagine what it is like for people who buy trimmers with 3 or more interchangable heads.  </li>
            <li>Keeps most of the trimmings out of the sink</li>
            <li>So here&#x27;s the scoop, the plastic guard/head if improperly seated on the top of the trimmer</li>
            <li>Thus on virtually any setting, the trimmer part isn&#x27;t touching your face.  </li>
            <li>I am extremely satisfied with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>OK.</li>
            <li>I love the rechargeable/cordless feature.  </li>
            <li>but this is so much better.  </li>
            <li>I used to love the Remington MB-300/200.</li>
            <li>, when using the machine, i noticed i was hitting the power button, or the turbo button accidently as i shave, but i&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s something i would have gotten used to</li>
            <li>I would recommend this trimmer :)</li>
            <li>Using the hilarious \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button just makes it louder and does nothing for performance.  </li>
            <li>but it has been improved in many ways as well.     </li>
            <li>Most of mine still fall out on the sink.</li>
            <li>It adds about 30-50% more speed (you decide) and 100% more noise.</li>
            <li>you have more then like 1/8 inch of hair on your face, i would not get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This trimmer works so much better than the others I have owned.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great trimmer for those of us real men with beards.</li>
            <li>All the reviews about the top of the trimmer falling off and ruining a trim seems bogus to me, but I can feel the pain of those who must have received defective products.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the performance of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>With the amount of people complaining about this, I have no doubt that it can happen, but my guess is that in most cases if not all, it has more to do with the way the groomer is being held.</li>
            <li>The vaccum works descent collecting most but not all the hair.</li>
            <li>I am glad for the shorter blade that helps define the trim edges and areas around the moustache.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had many and they spewed the fur all over the place.</li>
            <li>I then called Norelco and was told that the hair catching unit is not an available replacement part.</li>
            <li>And cheapest too! :-)    </li>
            <li>I was expecting a better trimmer.</li>
            <li>but overall I think the product is excellent.</li>
            <li>I gave up on trying to take the top off</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it works great so far and seems to be a nice trimming tool.  </li>
            <li>The T 980 works even better for beard and mustache grooming.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ll use it for the time being, then donate it to the thrift store when I find a better unit.  </li>
            <li>Got free shipping too, unlike Ebay sellers that are charging 20 bucks to ship!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this appliance, and heartily recommend it.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t buy this Philips Norelco, buy the Panasonic, which is cheaper, easier to handle, more accurate and waterproof!</li>
            <li>Ok, here&#x27;s my summary review of this trimmer.     </li>
            <li>Having the built-in vac suck up most of the trimmings makes cleaning up a cinch.  </li>
            <li>The best they will do is send an RMA to replace the entire unit.  </li>
            <li>Sure, some bean counter some place decided that if they didn&#x27;t have an inventory of spare parts, they could save money.  </li>
            <li>So at most, I&#x27;ve used the trimmer about 35 times.</li>
            <li>It should work longer and better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Otherwise I totally love it.     </li>
            <li>Such a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>The more I use it, the more I appreciate it.</li>
            <li>but I did want to make sure I rated the item.  </li>
            <li>But each time I use it now, I am more pleased.</li>
            <li>It might have broke after dropping it on the sink, I don&#x27;t remember it, but if the design were better it could be replaced.  </li>
            <li>I like the stubble look so after searching product reviews, purchasers of the 980 seemed confident in it&#x27;s ability to take care of business on setting #1.      </li>
            <li>OK but had limitations that, for the most part have been resolved in this model.      </li>
            <li>The hair collection compartment is OK.  </li>
            <li>but that is about it for this latest model.</li>
            <li>br /&gt;I am really pleased.</li>
            <li>The Norelco trimmer I bought 7 years ago has a better locking system.</li>
            <li>I found that with practice it gets better.</li>
            <li>and i am glad that i bought it...</li>
            <li>I always use &#x27;Turbo&#x27; mode (hoping that more suction will catch more of the clippings), and I tend to catch ~75% of the clippings this way.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer for my husband and he likes it for the most part.</li>
            <li>but it collects all the hair, so that more than makes up for the noise.</li>
            <li>The Norelco trimmer works much better.  </li>
            <li>If I was attracted to beard trimmers I would date this one because it&#x27;s sexy looking and cleans up after me.  </li>
            <li>Well it doesn&#x27;t but the motor does get louder in turbo and I&#x27;m sure it also eats up more battery power.</li>
            <li>It works better than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li>, i.e. you do it by feel more than sight since the shield blocks my view.  </li>
            <li>I can trim beard and mustache in under 5 minutes, including ALL hairs off the sink (that&#x27;s for my lovely wife).    </li>
            <li>I even run it in turbo mode most of the time, and still don&#x27;t have an issue with this.</li>
            <li>I love the trimmer, and have not seen anything else out there that would beat it.</li>
            <li>Good design, wireless which is great, and fairly quiet.</li>
            <li>more to come</li>
            <li>How many gadgets have you purchased that just didn&#x27;t \\&quot;do</li>
            <li>This product looks too flimsy and it looks more like a play toy.  </li>
            <li>Ok I took note of the reviews and some issues folks had with this model</li>
            <li>Regardless, it vacuums up enough of the hairs to keep my wife happy!    </li>
            <li>I bet it would work even better if I didn&#x27;t wait 2-3 weeks between beard trimmings.</li>
            <li>Most people that I know do, too).    </li>
            <li>I am pleased with the product and its ease of use.</li>
            <li>Most of the trimmings make it into the collection chamber, but not all of them.  </li>
            <li>It does a perfect job of trimming my beard evenly (setting at 7, ultimate beard length to be a 9).  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t think of anything this trimmer could do better.  </li>
            <li>But for those who have such a shaver, this product is, at best, superfluous.    </li>
            <li>Most of the hairs are captured in the hair cage.  </li>
            <li>it will take more than you want</li>
            <li>Not having a beard myself :) I had no idea what the heck to get</li>
            <li>so I just researched a bunch of different ones and this one appeared to be the best for beard trimming.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just an OK product.</li>
            <li>Except it could have a couple of setting more after the 1 setting.</li>
            <li>That would&#x27;ve been a better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A better design would&#x27;ve been a switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>But product design could be better.</li>
            <li>However, the trimmer&#x27;s phallic-like shape is good for a laugh with the ladies.     </li>
            <li>Although I did like the hair collection system on the Remington better.  </li>
            <li>Most namely, it keeps breaking.</li>
            <li>The T980 is a much better product.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much more you can say about a product like this.  </li>
            <li>It is rechargeable, removing the power cord, and I simply love this thing.</li>
            <li>Suddenly I have this wonderful piece of equipment that makes all of that child&#x27;s play.</li>
            <li>I wish the trimmer guide was made out of better plastic, it looks/feels somewhat brittle.</li>
            <li>(more so than my liking).</li>
            <li>As for trimming... outstanding.</li>
            <li>Lastly, battery life is very impressive.  </li>
            <li>Most others also felt like junk compared to the T980&#x27;s construction.  </li>
            <li>2/2012: 3 years of use and still works well.</li>
            <li>This one works just as well and maybe better in some respects.</li>
            <li>Also the sink is hair free now!</li>
            <li>My fiancé used to whine about the hair on the sink after I shaved, so I looked for a better one, and saw this.</li>
            <li>but i would if i found a better one.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>Sure, it collects some hair, but plenty more ends up on the sink and the floor.   </li>
            <li>It seems the shorter the hair trimmings, the better it does at capturing them.</li>
            <li>Not even sure they make it any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been left with two perfectly mechanically functional beard trimmers that will no longer run because of the design.</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t buy the brand any more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li>I love it</li>
            <li>and my wife loves me for not messing up the bathroom any more.</li>
            <li>The shave is much more enjoyable on this.   </li>
            <li>and I am glad I bought it.     </li>
            <li>One did make a favorable comment which is one more than before.  </li>
            <li>These are okay</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking for a better trimmer.</li>
            <li>Better than the Wahl, I think.  </li>
            <li>Most others have you hold the side with the buttons and logo against your face; when you use the length comb on the T980, however,you hold it with the buttons and logo on the side facing AWAY from your face.  </li>
            <li>I wonder how many of my fellow reviewers have been using this trimmer correctly, given this unconventional orientation.  </li>
            <li>but I decided to get this because it looked better.  </li>
            <li>You will love it.</li>
            <li>It catches MOST of the hairs, which is a lot better than NONE of the hairs.  </li>
            <li>It has an attractive design, which doesn&#x27;t matter much to me but is an added plus that makes it more enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li>For trimming it doesn&#x27;t get much better.</li>
            <li>The others were ok, for awhile, but eventually just could not get the job done.  </li>
            <li>especially first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li>I had a Norelco trimmer before but this one is even better.</li>
            <li>most of the items were better than my expectations</li>
            <li>Overall a wonderful purchase we&#x27;ve had zero problems with!</li>
            <li>Great idea, new innovations work great, but as a trimmer this is a piece of junk because you can&#x27;t shave at any level higher than a number 2 without risk of ending up 2 levels lower or MORE.</li>
            <li>but I am really impressed with the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect, so some of the trimmings still get in and around the sink.  </li>
            <li>I was hopping that I would not have to clean these up after a beard trimming session any more!</li>
            <li>The thing I like the best is the vacuum option.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is also very impressive.  </li>
            <li>I have been very happy with the design of this machine, the settings adjustments, the vacuum for clippings- just about everything.</li>
            <li>this product is the best trimmer i ever had with a vacuum.</li>
            <li>I saw this trimmer with the vacuum and said this will be great!</li>
            <li>Any package requiring scissors to open needs to be redesigned with more eco- and user-friendly materials!!!  </li>
            <li>Any package requiring scissors to open needs to be redesigned with more eco- and user-friendly materials!!!  </li>
            <li>, it works great, except for the suction feature, but hey when have us guys ever really cared about being neat and clean!</li>
            <li>The shaper works well, giving nice clean lines.</li>
            <li>Great upgrade from the \\&quot;older</li>
            <li>I still find that it doesn&#x27;t really do the best job at making my beard look consistent.</li>
            <li>I had the older model of this unit the 970 which i was happy with</li>
            <li>This shaver is pretty awesome, as it hasn&#x27;t irritated his skin at all, and he really likes that it leaves</li>
            <li>I had an older model and it worked great.</li>
            <li>and I figured that since the price was so high it must ba a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Battery seems to hold a charge for a good length of time and the new design change where the hair catching &#x27;basket&#x27; does not come off is welcomed.</li>
            <li>great machine, had the previous version and that was great</li>
            <li>In addition the flexibility really does allow you to get a precision trim really easily as it contours to the face great.    </li>
            <li>A bit bulky but easy to control and gives a nice accurate trim.</li>
            <li>Very clean and neat.</li>
            <li>It is a very comfortable size to hold as well and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is pretty good.</li>
            <li>On Turbo the trim is pretty good.  </li>
            <li>The device works pretty good.</li>
            <li>The Turbo makes a difference, the battery charge remains for a long time, the speed and sharpness of the blades is perfect.  </li>
            <li>or two\\&quot; look to a full but nicely trimmed beard, this will do it.</li>
            <li>Had this for about 2 years now and its pretty good.</li>
            <li>And a pretty good one to boot.</li>
            <li>Trims pretty good also.</li>
            <li>I loved the first, but it eventually had the power circuit just die.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer</li>
            <li>This is a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is pretty good.</li>
            <li>It hold charge pretty good too.</li>
            <li>works pretty good all around.    </li>
            <li>vacuum works great catching most of the trimmings.  </li>
            <li>This is a great machine, but the vacuum is far from perfect.  </li>
            <li>The new unit seems to be working great.    </li>
            <li>He had asked for a new beard trimmer and I was happy to oblige.  </li>
            <li>This thing is perfect for the nice fuzz to heavy beard trimming.</li>
            <li>I had the prior version which was good, but not as good.</li>
            <li>All in all a good buy overall and a great value, though I&#x27;d happily pay $20 more if made moslty if not entirely in USA</li>
            <li>This Norelco seemed to be the best non-pro model available, but it is quite different.</li>
            <li>I can go a whole vacation without needing to recharge, which is nice, but the included travel bag is handy just in case.    </li>
            <li>I own an earlier model of this trimmer and over all am happy with it.</li>
            <li>It was easy, the results were good, and the vacuum did a surprisingly good job of capturing most of the trimmed hair.    </li>
            <li>Like its grandfather, the click adjustable guard is the single best reason to buy one of these trimmers.      </li>
            <li>Does a great job, very quick to use, no mess at all (vacuum cleanup is awesome).</li>
            <li>Now I feel fine using it plugged or unplugged since the instructions say it&#x27;s OK.    </li>
            <li>Clean out container once a month for stubble trimming (more for beard trimming I am sure).    </li>
            <li>Makes the sink clean up MUCH easier and keeps the wife happy.</li>
            <li>Very cool indeed.      </li>
            <li>Overall, very good piece.  </li>
            <li>Very easy to use, the cut length adjuster is great, the vacuum captures about 80% with the turbo mode (bit noisy).  </li>
            <li>as a first time beard grower, trimming a beard was at best enigmatic.  </li>
            <li>It shaves much better than the cheap ($17 at Target)</li>
            <li>So far, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li>But if you are seeking a trimmer to crop and maintain body hair, especially facial hair, this is an ideal tool to have.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say the T980 is an improvement in every way over my old faithful trimmer (T970</li>
            <li>Most important to folks wondering whether to upgrade-</li>
            <li>so it is of dubious value, and most importantly 3) it does not hold its distance setting.  </li>
            <li>The battery is stronger, the motor and switch are improved, and the parts fit better.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really loud and sounds like it might explode, but it works great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It works great, makes beard upkeep a non-issue, and fits into a hand naturally.  </li>
            <li>Battery life seems great so far.  </li>
            <li>(roughly weekly) since then and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works great and beats my old Braun which did not collect whiskers.  </li>
            <li>Too much of my life depends on how good of a shave I give myself.</li>
            <li>I say reasonably well because in this day and age, 5 years is good</li>
            <li>Delivery was fast in a good condition.</li>
            <li>Battery life is good, and the comb doesn&#x27;t really get in the way.</li>
            <li>Fast to Cook Good to Eat, this is not a edible product &amp;</li>
            <li>The battery life is fantastic(four trims so far), the turbo mode works perfectly, and the vacuum is good.  </li>
            <li>The &#x27;vacuum&#x27; works brilliantly.</li>
            <li>It is easily cleanable with most important parts just pulling off.</li>
            <li>The vac works great and leaves no mess.</li>
            <li>Since it worked so well and does a pretty good job of keeping the sink and counter clean I decided to stick with this brand.  </li>
            <li>other than that seems to work perfectly.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband who has a full beard and moustache - he loves it!</li>
            <li>Other than that, this trimmer is awesome.</li>
            <li>the trimmer works flawlessly, as though the blades were sharp and efficient.  </li>
            <li>It was the best rated in Consumers Report and other reviews</li>
            <li>Great quality product and the storage pouch is such a nice simple touch but so very handy.  </li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s more comfortable and much more accurate for a far superior result.  </li>
            <li>Like that it is easily adjustable.</li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to adjust trimming height.  </li>
            <li>Mine falls off easy, spilling the trimmings over the floor.</li>
            <li>The T980 is well-balanced and easy to use.</li>
            <li>He says it&#x27;s easy and comfortable-doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt at all.  </li>
            <li>It can be easily dismantled for cleaning or razor head exchange and assembled again.</li>
            <li>Makes trimming beard easy.  </li>
            <li>this is a great product that women would love if they only knew it</li>
            <li>Return from Amazon was a non-issue, easily handled.</li>
            <li>One more thing, the device feels light (and a bit cheap).</li>
            <li>Cleans easily.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, not too noisy, and lives up to its billing.</li>
            <li>The T980 is a one piece adjustable trimmer, easy to use and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li>With a bit of care the blade placement is easy to get used to.</li>
            <li>The adjustable comb is easy to use and I don&#x27;t have to dig through the drawer in the bathroom to find a snap-on #3 comb I like to use and therefore always lose.</li>
            <li>Overall, this product is a must have for beginners all the way up to the most experienced beard and mustache groomers out there</li>
            <li>Guide pops off easily.  </li>
            <li>Easy to change lengths.</li>
            <li>Length indicator needs a stronger click-and-hold ratchet mechanism -- too easy to accidentally change length settings.  </li>
            <li>Easy to adjust trim length.</li>
            <li>Easily adjustable from 3/4 in.</li>
            <li>, it works with and without the cord, and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The height adjusts easily.  </li>
            <li>Trimmer attachment is easy to install</li>
            <li>Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li>Buttons placed in easy to use positions.  </li>
            <li>Easy to use.  </li>
            <li>and if you travel, it is so easy to accidentaly</li>
            <li>It trims well and is fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Changing the blade to trim is easy</li>
            <li>Its easy to shut off by grabbing the     handle.</li>
            <li>Can be easy to accidentally hit the power button mid-trim, no biggie.  </li>
            <li>so it is easily started by incidental luggage handling.    </li>
            <li>But soon they pop off easily.</li>
            <li>But this thing is so easy to use</li>
            <li>Easily adjustable.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure it sucked in some of the hair, but whats the point if you still have to clean your sink?  </li>
            <li>Secondly, it is easy to use with a cursory understanding of the instructions.  </li>
            <li>The length setting is easily shifted while in use.  </li>
            <li>Works well, but has three flaws:      Length setting selector moves too easily and slips in use    </li>
            <li>The trimmer is easy to use he has NO problems with it</li>
            <li>it has an easy to read dial to adjust the length of your cuts.  </li>
            <li>Easy and convenient.    </li>
            <li>This makes it incredibly easy to store and keeps it out of the way.</li>
            <li>Adjustments are easy and there&#x27;s no additional blade guides to snap on and lose.</li>
            <li>Easy to adjust.  </li>
            <li>Well-designed, Easy to use cutter height adjustments.</li>
            <li>It fits my hand well and is easy to use for thorough trimming.  </li>
            <li>The head is easy to change and works well.</li>
            <li>Whisker catch compartment is easily cleaned with enclosed brush.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>turbo is too easily turned on by accident.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The depth setting is easy and cutter head can be switched to a micro-head to do detail trim and borders.  </li>
            <li>I bought this years ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li>Strong blades clip everything in sight.  </li>
            <li>but I like my old one better that broke after 10 years of good use.</li>
            <li>The battery seems to hold a charge fairly well, and it has decent vacuuming power considering its size.</li>
            <li>The blades never need to be oiled, the see through hair chamber is awesome, and the powerful hair vacuum are all you need.</li>
            <li>, it looks nice, and as many others write, it does a great job at vacuuming up trimmed hairs, even if a few escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>In general, I am quite happy with this equipment.     </li>
            <li>This trimmer seems to be more for men with full beards or thicker,</li>
            <li>In short, the company has replaced an excellent product with one that is only good.</li>
            <li>Bought a T980, took it home, and found out the first trim... its junk (I&#x27;m being nice with my wording).  </li>
            <li>Now that I bought and used the T980, my cool slacker goatee is attracting too many women.</li>
            <li>This is the first beard trimmer I have ever liked.  </li>
            <li>He was thrilled to get the new version for Christmas and was happy that the new features make it even better than the original.</li>
            <li>I have tried alot of trimmers, and this is hands down is the best in the market.</li>
            <li>Cuts smoothly as well as the easy changing of lengths with just 1 turn makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is hands down the best trimmer I have used to date.  </li>
            <li>You must switch it to turbo mode to be effective, and if you&#x27;re trimming more than a light amount of hair you need to dump out the cut hair once or twice (which is easy to do with the way it is made) for the vacuum to still work effectively.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not the best (most powerful) trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had, but its other features make up for what it lacks in power.     </li>
            <li>It is easy to clean up, very smooth, very easy, very affordable, very cool looking, and very powerful.  </li>
            <li>The Remington was good but it eventually just couldn&#x27;t go any longer so I had to search for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>The Norelco T980 is good, but, it doesn&#x27;t completely live up to the claims on the product details.  </li>
            <li>but I guess it works fine.  </li>
            <li>in all, I am very happy with this trimmer, but would purchase another one if they addressed the previously mentioned issues.</li>
            <li>That said, it then gives a fine two-day trim.      </li>
            <li>The power and trimming of this razor is fine.</li>
            <li>Otherwise it works fine.</li>
            <li>the detail blade makes fine detailing a breeze.</li>
            <li>but it works fine.</li>
            <li>It is fine although it does not have a stand.  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s been fine since.    </li>
            <li>, I&#x27;m a #2), and it&#x27;s even fine for my neck (YMMV).    </li>
            <li>The mechanical tech department at Norelco have produced another fine shaver/trimmer mechanism.</li>
            <li>It seemed like it locked in position just fine.    </li>
            <li>In my impression and with previous experiences, thats the best selling point for this trimmer.</li>
            <li>The trimmer does all this just fine.  </li>
            <li>I instead use a fine tooth slid-up trimmer on another shaver for that.  </li>
            <li>The trim setting zoom works fine.  </li>
            <li>I could have bought a replacement battery for 10 bucks)which worked just fine until the battery died.</li>
            <li>But once I figured out how to position the thing and use it correctly, I found it to be just fine.</li>
            <li>If you are more intelligent than a trained monkey you will have no problem using this trimmer for virtually any place you can grow hair...    </li>
            <li>The given attachment also helps with closer trims and helps fine tune the trim, so no need to follow through with a razor shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>The trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li>(It needs a plug adapter for this, but otherwise it worked fine for me.)</li>
            <li>Some reviews said that this would not work in Europe, but mine works fine.  </li>
            <li>Functionally, this trimmer worked fine.</li>
            <li>Adjustability was fine.</li>
            <li>Using turbo mode drains it slightly more quickly.</li>
            <li>I think the Philips Norelco T980 Vacuum Trimmer is a great trimmer and recommend it highly (because of my bf&#x27;s good experience and approval).</li>
            <li>I bought this for my boyfriend so he&#x27;d keep his sexy new beard, and he was thrilled.  </li>
            <li>, was easy to use, was easy to clean, and produced  &lt;br /&gt;excellent results.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean and easy to operate.</li>
            <li>Easy to make length adjustments and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>The precision trim head slips on just as easily and really does a nice job with touch-up areas.  </li>
            <li>So far after 3 trim jobs, the batteries are going strong without a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;The turbo vac works fairly well.  </li>
            <li>First pleasant surprise: Amazon shipping is pretty damn zippy.</li>
            <li>Integrated mustache trimmer and a more positive lock on the height adjustment would make this a much better product.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is of good size but handles easily and with better precision than I initially thought.  </li>
            <li>Also includes a nice large case that holds everything plus some.</li>
            <li>Light, powerful and very smooth.</li>
            <li>It does an excellent job, and I have found little need to turn on the turbo feature.</li>
            <li>The decision to buy was mostly impluse, though I did check Amazon&#x27;s ratings, but I forgot to read the lowest ratings first! &lt;</li>
            <li>Easy to use and quite friendly to your face&#x27;s skin.   </li>
            <li>The description and reviews of this Norelco Trimmer were all accurate.  </li>
            <li>and it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal.     </li>
            <li>but it a huge improvement over using trimmers without suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is really a huge problem.</li>
            <li>It trims well and accurately.</li>
            <li>It is easy to handle and provide a comfortable clean cut.</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s had it for a few months now and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean after use.</li>
            <li>Does not need to be used on turbo mode, works great on regular mode.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Adjustable Guard:  Glides smooth.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
            <li>so if you want parts of your beard longer, you won&#x27;t have the automatic height setting available.  </li>
            <li>It was designed cheaply and made cheaply.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to look like a terrorist, so I needed a trimmer to keep my beard looking civilized.  </li>
            <li>I like the smooth look it gives, not splotchy or patchy.</li>
            <li>Philips Norelco thought of all the elements that make up a great beard trimmer and put them into a low cost product.   </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>also, the smaller trimmer accessory is great for those pesky noise and ear hair outcroppings...</li>
            <li>The pieces are easy to clean and adjust.    </li>
            <li>It has worked great the entire time, and I use it a lot.  </li>
            <li>The swing door on the collector is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>* Travel pouch and charger make for an easy-to-travel-with item    Keep in mind that if your intended use is for a body hair trimmer, the Norelco T980 does not shave the skin completely smooth -- as that is not in its intended design.</li>
            <li>I confirmed this by looking closely at both products&#x27; trimmer blades.  </li>
            <li>Fantastic.  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great trimmer, just watch you don&#x27;t push the power</li>
            <li>Norelco does recommend running the battery until the charge light comes on, and then recharging it (probably NiCad batteries), but this is no problem if you can use while charging.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean, and I appreciate that the hair is captured for disposal rather than covering the sink.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice trimmer gets a very close trim on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product.</li>
            <li>Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s feels comfortable using it</li>
            <li>I looked at the trimmers available and</li>
            <li>Comfortable design.</li>
            <li>Parts fit both</li>
            <li>trimmer itself fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
            <li>Points:  Comfortable, not too noisy, even on \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li>Buy it and enjoy the simplicity and efficiency.</li>
            <li>, it just doesn&#x27;t make the \\&quot;click\\&quot; sound to let me know it&#x27;s locked.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sleek and smooth.</li>
            <li>My husband enjoy using it</li>
            <li>I liked it so much, that I bought the Norelco Arcitec electric razor.  </li>
            <li>What I don&#x27;t like is the cheap plastic hair holder, this broke after about a year</li>
            <li>Light  </li>
            <li>Not that looks of the shaver are important but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>Seven day free shipping.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s comfortable and convenient ...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The trimmer is precise, and you do not need to repeat.</li>
            <li>Overall, the design is great and the unit works as advertised.</li>
            <li>The blade adjustment is precise.  </li>
            <li>Cheap ones at wal-mart, the drug store, etc.</li>
            <li>Overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Trims my beard smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li>no longer available Philips Norelco T-3000.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s larger than the Wahl or the Remington I had before, but works many times more effectively than either.  </li>
            <li>-It&#x27;s a great trimmer, overall</li>
            <li>, the directions are great, the packaging is terrific.  </li>
            <li>Overall I have had great luck with Norelco trimmers and this one</li>
            <li>The T980, however, fit the bill.  </li>
            <li>Not to mention shipping was free.</li>
            <li>light and ergonomic</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t fit under ones nose for mustache trimming.</li>
            <li>fantastic product.</li>
            <li>Happily, a gas compressor used for forced-induction of an internal combustion engine is not to be found here.</li>
            <li>I just used it last night, and I&#x27;m completely happy with it.</li>
            <li>There is an obstruction for the saw that cut hair and it does not work smoothly.</li>
            <li>Been using the T980 for a few weeks now and it works great!</li>
            <li>Oh yes, no problems to report with the way it works, the fit of the guard and the shaving heads.</li>
            <li>easy to use, but will take some time to clean the blade and vaccum chamber after the trim.</li>
            <li>However, the trimmer seams to be somewhat cheaply made.  </li>
            <li>Its easy for him to use and to keep clean.</li>
            <li>I searched quite a bit for a great facial hair trimmer</li>
            <li>once have i experienced the standard \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; moment when shavers catch  </li>
            <li>I am genuinely amazed at the simplicity of removing and replacing the grille guard.  </li>
            <li>Reliable, easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I had a different brand before and this one works great.  </li>
            <li>However, it only works well in Turbo mode and it feels like it will fly apart at any minute in Turbo mode.</li>
            <li>(my neurosis brings this to my attention since I prefer everything to be precise).  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a great product,</li>
            <li>Pilot light indicates when fully charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Does not feel cheap at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Quit being cheap and buy it or stay looking like an ape without a date.</li>
            <li>Maybe the shorter hairs are too light and get blown around?  </li>
            <li>works smoothly now.  </li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>I have tried several Trimmers but this one is really the best.</li>
            <li>As far as rechargable cutter/trimmers go this one is a good as it gets.</li>
            <li>So far so good and has lived up to or beyond my expectations.  </li>
            <li>And the best part is, the vaccum actually works for upto 70% of my hair which is very dense.    </li>
            <li>My old one was so good I decided to wait it out and order it online.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the price is good, it works well, and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it, and would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.</li>
            <li>So far, so good..</li>
            <li>It may be good for those who don&#x27;t have a Norelco shaver with the trimming feature, (and don&#x27;t want to pay a hundred dollars or more for such a shaver).  </li>
            <li>I trim once every week and it has been more than a month since I last charged my battery, so it seems to have a good battery life.</li>
            <li>So far so good after one month.</li>
            <li>The Norelco T980 is easy to use, the turbo vacuum keeps it clean and hairs don&#x27;t fly all over the place.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is great, and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>the vacuum aspect of it is the best, because you can really do the shaving anywhere, on the go, and not worry about leaving trimmings all over the place.</li>
            <li>the vacuum feature of this is great....</li>
            <li>Cuts well and vacuum works great.  </li>
            <li>Its a great experience to use a \\&quot;Philips Norelco T980 Vacuum Trimmer\\&quot;  </li>
            <li>The turbo vacuum is a great feature,tho it still allows some hair to fall.</li>
            <li>The vacuum suction works great</li>
            <li>the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer sounded great.</li>
            <li>Vacuum feature with Turbo on works great.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is great, it catches 97% of my hair.</li>
            <li>: the vacuum feature works great.</li>
            <li>- Great vacuum.</li>
            <li>Vacuum works great</li>
            <li>The vacuum is great, period.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works great and grabs cut hair.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum works great</li>
            <li>Vacuum is also great feature in it.</li>
            <li>The turbo vacuum system works great.</li>
            <li>vacuum is great addition to product...</li>
            <li>The vacuum works great...</li>
            <li>vacuum works great, not a hair on the floor</li>
            <li>The vacuum is great as well.</li>
            <li>Vacuum is a great improvement.  </li>
            <li>My older Braun still does a better job (after 8 years!)</li>
            <li>on/off switch is right on top, and a light touch will cycle it.</li>
            <li>Very powerful and smooth.</li>
            <li>I read some reviews before buying it and I am glad I made the right decision.</li>
            <li>My wife told me that I rave about how much I love it every time I use it that I should right a comment about it.  </li>
            <li>many settings to get just the right length.</li>
            <li>very useful and durable</li>
            <li>It is very powerful, even without the boost.  </li>
            <li>Very powerful and versatile shaver.</li>
            <li>that being said, some older trimmers (that have more metal) have more power than this one.     </li>
            <li>the fine trimmer attachment is ok, not so great to do the fine lines of a goatee, I got to do it quite a few times, but then I suspect nothing will ever come close to the perfection a blade can offer.  </li>
            <li>Vacuum works great for keeping area clean.</li>
            <li>This is an excellent trimmer, particularly with the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum works well and is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li>Noise level is minimum, vacuum and removable \\&quot;waste\\&quot; compartment are very nice additions.</li>
            <li>The T980 vacuum feature is very nice.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is not 100% effective, but it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li>Originally discovered it on Amazon when I was in the market to replace my former cordless clipper and was impressed by the high rating.</li>
            <li>It fits in the hand nicely, has swap able heads and generally cuts quite well.  </li>
            <li>All the parts fit cleanly, the charger works well</li>
            <li>The adjustment system works quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li>Clean up is fairly easy, plus this one looks really cool.    </li>
            <li>It does do a good job keeping his beard at an even length and is much easier to use and consistent that the comb an scissors routine that he was trying before we got the norelco.</li>
            <li>However, the Panasonic models readily available differed from those I had used previously and the Norelco had good reviews and a nice price.  </li>
            <li>but once I started using it properly it does a great job of trimming quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li>It works great, but it does get clogged with long hairs.</li>
            <li>Be sure to start at the longest trim setting the first time you use it and then work your way shorter to your desired length.  </li>
            <li>and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li>This was my first beard trimmer, and I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny!</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re buying this trimmer in order to cultivate a stubble look, be aware that with the T980 you&#x27;ll have to use it more</li>
            <li>I enjoyed this trimmer at first, though I should say that it never cut as closely to my skin as I wanted it too.  </li>
            <li>Pros: It looks real pretty.  </li>
            <li>I was incredibly excited to get this trimmer.</li>
            <li>If it weren&#x27;t for the pocket locking clip, I would&#x27;ve had the device hitting the floor or ground a significant number of times.</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>This is an easiest and most accurate trimmer I used to own over last 10+ years.  </li>
            <li>And, yes, for what its worth, as others have pointed out- it does indeed resemble a futuristic dildo!</li>
            <li>Great for tumble look or long Mustache.</li>
            <li>Original  </li>
            <li>I am not sure if it&#x27;s my technique or what, but I have just found it best to avoid using the #1 setting for the shortest hair.</li>
            <li>Also there is significant play (wiggle room) in the dial itself.</li>
            <li>Love the length settings--for the first time, I have a length setting that doesn&#x27;t fall between the length I desire.</li>
            <li>If you like your grooming aids sanitary, you&#x27;ll have fun cleaning this thing (and, except the adjustable guide and whisker tray, you can&#x27;t wash it in water)!</li>
            <li>FYI, the original unit was bought from Amazon on 4/7/07.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product (after a couple of weeks of use).  </li>
            <li>After nearly a month of use with this trimmer, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>I feel my experience is consistent with most reviews presented.  </li>
            <li>And batteries are not environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>Def worth getting!</li>
            <li>He was excited to try and now 3 years</li>
            <li>It does have a strong battery and if you are just lightly trimming a mustache or a beard, it may be the right choice for you.  </li>
            <li>Adjustments work, the vacuum option does a reasonably good job, and clean up is easy.    </li>
            <li>The vacuum built into the trimmer works pretty well, with the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; or \\&quot;non-Turbo\\&quot; mode successfully capturing most of the hair that&#x27;s trimmed off.</li>
            <li>Locks guide into place much better, more comfortable to use, turbo mode cuts longer beards a little better and gets more of cut hair into holding chamber-</li>
            <li>I used to get a more precise shave from my oldest original trimmer especially near my moustache.</li>
            <li>Besides the mess, it did a very good job.</li>
            <li>well when I hve a beard or stash.....been clean for a while</li>
            <li>It is powerful and easy to use.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had four different beard trimmers and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li>and I have always had a problem with clean up of the sink afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Admittedly, I only use it to trim my modest goatee but for this it does an excellent work.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just another thing to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s easier to clean up the sink after trimming...</li>
            <li>Overall, very happy so far.</li>
            <li>It appears to be of the kind of quality that last for many years......</li>
            <li>and you end up with hair everywhere to clean up.  </li>
            <li>I clean if after every use</li>
            <li>Also my sink is clean another plus   - Off On button needs to be moved.</li>
            <li>T980 comes with a mustache trimmer, AC adapter, carrying case, and a brush to clean the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use, self contained, powerful and flexible too.  </li>
            <li>Far more better than the one which I was using previously(Hitachi).</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband for two reasons: 1) because he hates how a clean shave looks, and how it irritates his skin, and 2)</li>
            <li>The hair collector cup snaps in and out with ease and rinses clean.    </li>
            <li>The best thing I can say about this trimmer is that at least it&#x27;s cheap to buy...</li>
            <li>I am a hairy guy, and have not felt any pulling or ripping of the hairs, just a clean trim.    </li>
            <li>yes, you are going to have to clean up some hair off the sink.</li>
            <li>I have not had to clean my bathroom sink even once.</li>
            <li>I have used trimmers on my facial hair for over 40 years and this is by far the best one that I have had.</li>
            <li>To clean out the drive compartment you must still remove the trimmer head and use the included brush.    </li>
            <li>and you still need to clean your sink afterward.    </li>
            <li>I have a short beard and this is by far the best shaver I have had.  </li>
            <li>still have to clean up after i&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve ran into problems having to clean out the inside of the head</li>
            <li>It does a good job, maintains a nice charge, and I was amazed at how well it vacuums the trimmed beard hairs into the waste compartment.  </li>
            <li>Second pleasant surprise:</li>
            <li>It is powerful, holds a great charge and the vacuum feature works as designed.  </li>
            <li>As some reviewers had expressed reservations I took a flyer on the many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>Long battery life, good vacuum that leaves sink pretty clean, great adjustable lengths, got this in the mail in less than 48 hours, great buy!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on my first charge with about 10 trims and still running strong - no recharge indicator light yet.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer operates at a higher speed than previous ones and it&#x27;s multitude of length settings allows for a perfect setting for me.  </li>
            <li>vac isn&#x27;t strong and clogs up easy other wise</li>
            <li>The length adjuster is very nice, much nicer than my old crappy walmart cheapie.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t make that much noise (when the turbo button is not on) and it is a very light device.  </li>
            <li>very glad i purchased this trimmer easy to use, quite, catches the hair that is cut with the vacuum</li>
            <li>Really like this trimmer - it&#x27;s easy to adjust, collects all of the hair cuttings, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried several beard trimmers over the years but the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer is the best one by far for providing an even beard and mustache trim while doing a good job in turbo mode of vacuuming up the beard clippings.    </li>
            <li>But other than that it is a good beard trimmer and I am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t snagged a hair yet, it cuts clean and true.  </li>
            <li>It was fine, but this one operates a little smoother and catches shaved whiskers better for me (a surprising plus).  </li>
            <li>Specially for the cost.</li>
            <li>Lip, chin, and jaw are no problem, but the area just under the nose has to have special attention with scissors.</li>
            <li>on occassion the trimming head came off so strangly that it was dropped on the floor...not happy with this product although, as previously stated, the vacuum is really a great addition</li>
            <li>The trimmer does a great job, is easy to adjust, and the vacuum function works very well.  </li>
            <li>once your done trimming your beard, although it doesn&#x27;t catch all the trimmings it did catch most of them and clean up was much faster than what I am used too.</li>
            <li>This one has too much bell and whistle but not as good as the older model.</li>
            <li>It provides a wide variety of settings, its handling is pleasant and easy to adjust, and recharging is a breeze.</li>
            <li>though by no means all of the hair gets collected, seems better built all around vs older version, travel case is nice enough and has slightly better instructions on use and maintenence of product.    </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I set it on \\&quot;2\\&quot; which turned out to be much shorter than I would have liked.      </li>
            <li>, I bet this would be a great purchase.te and carefully trim the hairs using the height of the surrounding hairs that the trimmer did get as a guide.    </li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t experienced the guard slipping as others have.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good so far.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is marketed toward facial hair and sideburns, and that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for.  </li>
            <li>When it&#x27;s full, just dump it out.</li>
            <li>Did I mention that it doesn&#x27;t leave the bathroom sink full of hair trimmings?</li>
            <li>But, if you want a very close trim, like a two-day beard look, you must remove the adjustable head and make sure not to work from the bottom up.  </li>
            <li>If it was not for this I would give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li>but the rest is true.</li>
            <li>Overall it does an good job</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s just full and even</li>
            <li>The only good thing I have to say about this trimmer is it holds a charge for seemingly forever.      </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve worn a beard for 15 years, and have tried everything from full sized Oster clippers to a variety of trimmers.</li>
            <li>Of the trimmers I have used (have been through several brands), this one does a good job for the price.  </li>
            <li>Good seller, prompt shipping,  My second trimmer from Norelco.</li>
            <li>If the battery dies (AND THEY ALL DO) in many trimmers you have to trash the whole unit.</li>
            <li>This product is really cool one from Phillips.</li>
            <li>For me the battery on the trimmer has lasted about 25-35 trims of the my full beard.  </li>
            <li>I really liked the old Norelco</li>
            <li>Every feature I liked from the old one is still there</li>
            <li>The product overall works good.</li>
            <li>The multiple settings are a good feature.</li>
            <li>I wear a medium length full beard</li>
            <li>I really wanted to love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I have a full beard, which I trim for length.  </li>
            <li>The selection of lengths is good for me; I keep my beard fairly short (#6).</li>
            <li>I had a Norelco trimmer that lasted several years and loved it.</li>
            <li>After you&#x27;ve used it about 3 or 4 times, you&#x27;ll really understand how to use it and love it.</li>
            <li>I think overall the trimmer is a good product</li>
            <li>The early reports of issues where the blade height adjusts itself on its own seem to be gone.  </li>
            <li>It looks cool.</li>
            <li>This is a good product overall</li>
            <li>I have had several Norelco products and all have been good.</li>
            <li>Works at full capacity even while plugged in and charging.      </li>
            <li>For the record, I maintain a full beard with this.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see how this product can work on full head of hair.    </li>
            <li>He gets a cool gadget, and I get a bearded, manly beast of a lover.  </li>
            <li>I would give it an overall good rating.</li>
            <li>I went on the web page for registration and they require you to answer a full privacy invasive survey to register the product.  </li>
            <li>Overall quality is good.</li>
            <li>Overall really good product.</li>
            <li>I ended-up replacing the batteries in my beloved T990 for about the same price as the T765.</li>
            <li>The trimmings are quick and clean.  </li>
            <li>Recharging has been done six times and unplugged when full charge is reached.    </li>
            <li>The nicad battery life is acceptable -- I get a week of trims on my full beard and moustache at the Turbo setting.  </li>
            <li>This razor is way to bulky and does not get close enough for a good trim for your mustache or goatee.</li>
            <li>Very durable and has lasted me for many years.</li>
            <li>Not a bad trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad trimmer, but it&#x27;s not what I was hoping for when I bought it.  </li>
            <li>Not bad</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the vacuum was more powerful and it was a bit quieter.</li>
            <li>The most surprising part is that the vacuum pump really does the job.</li>
            <li>That is, when using a very lighter touch than what I&#x27;m used to so that the teeth do not compress and sculpture the result.f switch is right on top, and a light touch will cycle it.</li>
            <li>its vacuum power is good...</li>
            <li>The vacuum works surprisingly well</li>
            <li>The one thing I will say is the vacuum is not quite as good as reviews said.     </li>
            <li>The good news is that it cuts my beard well, and the vacuum is not noisy.  </li>
            <li>The Vacuum Trimmer is a good idea.</li>
            <li>The vacuum on this worked fairly well.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works surprisingly well, almost none of the clippings escape.</li>
            <li>Vacuum works well but not as good as i thought.</li>
            <li>A beard trimmer with a built-in vacuum to keep the trimmings from collecting all over your sink is a good thing.  </li>
            <li>The pieces come apart pretty easily and clean quickly.</li>
            <li>Mind you, if there was no vaccum my sink would be filled with black hairs, so having any type of vaccum is great.</li>
            <li>It works quite nicely, just as the previous trimmer worked nicely.</li>
            <li>It is nice not to have to do a major sink clean.    </li>
            <li>Price is right, no tax, free shipping...buy with confidence.</li>
            <li>And the battery ran the trimmer strongly throughout that first session.  </li>
            <li>It is easy to pick up and start operating as soon as it&#x27;s charged the first time.  </li>
            <li>After looking high and low and doing much research I am very happy with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It trims very well, nice range of adjustable settings, vacuum feature really does work, good battery and charger.  </li>
            <li>It is somewhat large (not the best for travel) and it has trouble with hair along the curve of my jawline and on the thinner, softer hair on my cheek.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;low battery&#x27; and smart &#x27;charge&#x27; indicators are great.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it is a great product.</li>
            <li>Other than that it is a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Great gift for christmas or any other holiday.</li>
            <li>And the vacuum works fine, keep things tidy.  </li>
            <li>Well it leaves u goat-t clean and fresh looking.   </li>
            <li>Adjusts quickly.  </li>
            <li>This is an adequate trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I scoured the net looking for the perfect beard trimmer to trim my beard that I brough back from Iraq.  </li>
            <li>- The battery is adequate.  </li>
            <li>otherwise it works well, seldom needs recharging and does its job relatively quickly</li>
            <li>The shipment came quick and I got to test it out (waited an hour for it to fully charge) to see how it would perform and perform it</li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer to replace an older Norelco trimmer for my husband and this one is much better.</li>
            <li>The T980 allows a quick and non-messy trim of my beard without the residue in the sink.  </li>
            <li>It works best in Turbo mode and is not really all that loud.  </li>
            <li>This beard trimmer is a big improvement over Norelco&#x27;s earlier version (which used to be the best beard trimmer on the market).</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t work as good as professional trimmers, but doesn&#x27;t cost as much either.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- first the motor charged quickly and fine.  </li>
            <li>I picked the t980 because it has the 1 hour quick charge.  </li>
            <li>I just wish it actually cut better and with more consistency.</li>
            <li>I just bought the Norelco T980 after reading many reviews from many different products.</li>
            <li>This battery has many times the life of the older model it replaced after a month or so of use.</li>
            <li>My husband likes this trimmer much better than the older model he had.  </li>
            <li>Luckily he didn&#x27;t trim his mustache.</li>
            <li>There are more beard length settings on this one, but you can&#x27;t easily see them like you could on the T-3000, and more settings are not really needed.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t and would have like a place to sit the T980 where I can grab it for a quick trim.</li>
            <li>So enough said...  Buy it, it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful for the price, especially when paired with the nose/ear/brow trimmer that I bought in the package.</li>
            <li>but it does have a quick charge feature that takes about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>what I ment to say is that it quick to use when you are in hurry and nobody notices any difference between rgular blade and</li>
            <li>-The charge lasts for a looong time and recharge is really quick  </li>
            <li>This trimmer, overall, works very well and is a great buy for the money.  </li>
            <li>This unit does an entirely adequate job of beard trimming.  </li>
            <li>well--- battery holds charge and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li>Charges quickly.</li>
            <li>just makes super noise.</li>
            <li>I am about my new purchase!!!!</li>
            <li>Outstanding product, well built, durable, has features that are used, many beard length settings use and no need to pick up whiskers with vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>He says it works great and really likes the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>The best innovation in that ten year time span is the vacuum system for the T980.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that about 90% of the clippings go into the vacuum receptical with only about 10% being lost.  </li>
            <li>This is a great trimmer and the vacuum works really well.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind the beard trimmings everywhere, you will be happy with the T370, however if you are serious about perfect beard grooming (and I DO mean PERFECT), with none of the mess, both tools are a must.</li>
            <li>The coreless feature and Vacuum is awesome, but i need a little bit more.        </li>
            <li>This product is amazing easy to empty, clean and doesn&#x27;t need oil BUY ONE.</li>
            <li>Overall, I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li>I will say that this is much better to use than the Remington 3000 that I have seen selling for nearly $100 on Amazon (which I originally bought for $50).     </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>that sometimes it would catch on my skin more than the normal sized trimmer attachment.&lt;br</li>
            <li>This Product works great,much better than other bands i own.</li>
            <li>Overall we have been very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase, and you can&#x27;t beat it for under $30 shipped.</li>
            <li>Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li>Overall, very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li>All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to someone else too!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not really loud either, when you consider how good it works.</li>
            <li>but I figured as long as it cut good</li>
            <li>and it has lasted a long time with good battery power.</li>
            <li>My girlfriend is happy that there isn&#x27;t hair all over the place anymore, and I&#x27;m happy that I don&#x27;t have to clean up (and apparently leave a lot behind, as my girlfriend likes to point out) hair scattered around the bathroom.    </li>
            <li>It provides a very clean trim, and the vacuum feature makes this product worthwhile over others (from what I can assume).  </li>
            <li>Overall, a great classic Norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not only a beard trimmer, but it will edge for you too, so you can get a nice clean neck line or shape up your sideburns.  </li>
            <li>A battery keeps its charge very well and a recharge process is easy and quick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quick, easy to use, and the adjustable settings make it very versatile.  </li>
            <li>this shaver gets clogged very easily and if you want to make precise trims, you need to remove the one attachment and add the smaller one on.</li>
            <li>I am very pleased with the purchase of the T980 turbo vacuum trimmer.</li>
            <li>Battery life so far has been good, noticeably better than the older model even when it was new.  </li>
            <li>Overall a great product and a highly recommended product.</li>
            <li>Trims with ease and very clean.  ~Highly</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to make trimming a new experience or solve the world&#x27;s problems, but it&#x27;s a competent trimmer that reduces some of the clean-up.</li>
            <li>I bought the new T980 and really love it.</li>
            <li>All in all I am pleased with the new model.</li>
            <li>I had used another Norelco trimmer for many years and had been looking for a new one for some time.</li>
            <li>price is right on this thing, and it LOOKS sweet.   </li>
            <li>I could use a sturdier carrying case and maybe a slightly stronger vaccum, but even with those niggling complaints this is a great product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the T980 for a year and a half and it still works great.  </li>
            <li>Perfect tool for trimming long or short beard/ mustache.  </li>
            <li>Overall this trimmer is pretty good, but is not the all-in-one trimmer that I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Very adaptable and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The motor is strong, giving a very even cut.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve trained my battery correctly from the start (turn it on and leave it to expend itself when I opened the box and then give it the first good, solid nights charge).      </li>
            <li>This shaver keeps your girlfriend from yelling at you about hair every where and never loses power or charge it is the most useful product i have bought in years</li>
            <li>Not sure how this thing got so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fast and easy.  </li>
            <li>The adjustable comb tilts easily, and the whole head can be removed and replaced without any effort at all.  </li>
            <li>This thing is super powerful.    </li>
            <li>Fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li>It may not capture every single hair, but I would say it gets a good 90-95% of them.  </li>
            <li>Even at the normal setting, the vacuum works great.  </li>
            <li>the vacuum feature is pretty good</li>
            <li>Simple is better!</li>
            <li>So assuming you can figure out how to work this product correctly, it should do exactly what you need it to!</li>
            <li>It works pretty well for this!</li>
            <li>Which when cleaning up the sink so as to not put a hair-ball down the drain, it is a very nice assist.    </li>
            <li>Exceptionally well thought out, simple design is very user friendly.  </li>
            <li>The best part is that with the vacuum action, there&#x27;s no mess to clean up around the sink - and it works.     </li>
            <li>It will work much better if clean, so make sure you use the little brush that comes with it to clean it well, removing the blade.  </li>
            <li>Long run time between charges, great vacuum, easy to clean, and</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not an expert but do think the T980 works fine to very well.</li>
            <li>It is not difficult to clean.</li>
            <li>Making daily grooming easy, with easy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>If you want to get a clean shave, go ahead and purchase this product, because that is exactly what you will have to do after using it.</li>
            <li>that being said, i really don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;Tom Selleck\\&quot; stache, so It works fine for me....</li>
            <li>It takes a little learning, but is otherwise great.  </li>
            <li>The little accessory neck trimmer works great for touch ups between haircuts, but the vacume does not work at all with that attachement in place.</li>
            <li>Anyway, this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Very impressed with this little product so far.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; feature on the T980 works somewhat better than the earlier unit: it does not catch everything, but certainly captures most of the clippings.</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer works very well, and the included narrow trimmer is very good for trimming mustaches.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum and turbo vacuum featured on this model are an interesting new rendition, and they do a fair job capturing most (not all) of the shavings.  </li>
            <li>It works better than former models and hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck behind the mechanism any more...  Very good product.</li>
            <li>It lacks a multi-LED charge indicator, but does have a \\&quot;Low\\&quot; battery warning light (+ a Charge light) &amp; the unit will still run for several beard trimmings once the warning light comes on.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for quite a few months now and it has been great.  </li>
            <li>It cuts well, and accurately, although it does take me a while because you have to keep going over the beard to make sure all the hairs are cut to the same length.</li>
            <li>After buying this amazing trimmer, I will never go back.</li>
            <li>I have owned the Norelco T980 for a few months now, and it is great.  </li>
            <li>Even when the battery light does begin to blink, what it really means to say is,</li>
            <li>But overall, nice product.  </li>
            <li>It is worth it 100%</li>
            <li>It also has an attachment for more precise areas such as the mustache area.  </li>
            <li>He has said that it is much better than his old trimmer in that it floats closer to all areas of his face and</li>
            <li>I own an earlier model, which I prefer, but the battery died.</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>The battery provides a couple week&#x27;s worth of uses before it needs recharging, which takes a bit over an hour.  </li>
            <li>worth it.</li>
            <li>but because the trimmer is so large, it isn&#x27;t good for trimming the mustache area right above the lip.  </li>
            <li>, I think, it is still worth.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li>Has a useful attachment for shaping beard.</li>
            <li>The smaller clipper is a nice size for trimming areas around your nose and lip.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised how much better this version is.</li>
            <li>I love it because it&#x27;s a lot quieter than his old one</li>
            <li>Perhaps this item would not dangerously overheat, maybe it would just lessen the life of the batteries.</li>
            <li>I really want to be fair and objective, but i have to admit</li>
            <li>I was having success.</li>
            <li>He rarely (if ever) goes to the barber anymore.  </li>
            <li>This Beard Trimmer is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li>So I made sure to pick a model that could be used by either recharging or plugged in directly.    </li>
            <li>The guard also comes off, and you can even replace the &#x27;shaver&#x27; with a smaller, more detailed &#x27;shaver&#x27; (which comes with it).  </li>
            <li>What I like most about it is the option to plug in to AC directly and not have to wait for the charge.      </li>
            <li>The trimmer blades work very well and the unit is so quiet even surprisingly on the turbo setting.  </li>
            <li>The attachment is useful for stray hairs in the nose and ears and for edging a moustache.  </li>
            <li>This means that because I broke two cents worth of plastic, I now have to toss out a $40 beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Just be sure to take a minute out of your abnormally busy day to read the instructions and precautions and maintenance tips to prolong the life of this thing.</li>
            <li>so far the battery life has been outstanding.</li>
            <li>Well worth the price.</li>
            <li>This one is much better because it has a light that comes on when the battery is low.  </li>
            <li>If you are careful this will be a good trimmer for you.</li>
            <li>I gave this product one star because the trimmer works very well, but I have had many trimmers that worked very well.</li>
            <li>Very much worth the price.</li>
            <li>main thing I like with this trimmer is that its not bulky and easily fits into my shaving kit.</li>
            <li>It trims evenly, is quiet and handy.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t cut quit as low as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>Only had it for a week or so but works great so far.  </li>
            <li>If you are not pressed for time, the T980 is a lot of fun to use.</li>
            <li>However, it does collect by far most of the cut hairs.  </li>
            <li>I bought an Oster trimmer for nearly the same price on amazon and been supremely happy with it.</li>
            <li>I have had several trimmers and I would say this one does a nice job..</li>
            <li>From my perspective, it seems to be a marketing tool designed to convince guys that they&#x27;re getting a really powerful, studly shaver.</li>
            <li>definately worth buying.</li>
            <li>Never really got a good shave out of this.  </li>
            <li>Powerful.  </li>
            <li>Now worth 5 stars.  </li>
            <li>easy clean up because of the vaccum action.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used quite a few shavers, and this one has been the best so far.</li>
            <li>One suggestion: be sure to save the box and receipts so you can get it fixed or replaced with whatever warranty they offer.</li>
            <li>But, by far, my favorite thing about this trimmer is the way it feels.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit loud, but so are most trimmers....</li>
            <li>When you see the red light come on after turning the unit off -- figure you have one more trim at Turbo speed.  </li>
            <li>I did not experience the problems most frequently reported by others.  </li>
            <li>I suppose something like this is necessary from an engineering point of view to get the vaccum to work effectively.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect, nor should that be expected.  </li>
            <li>-look my own hair, if you use this on your hair aside from your beard, some hairs get stuck and clog the opening of the vacuum that leads to the chamber, you have to remove the clippers and cutters to remove it.  </li>
            <li>The hair vacuum capability is a nice plus.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature was nice</li>
            <li>The vacuum is a nice feature, it simplifies cleanup.  </li>
            <li>I settled on getting him this Norelco trimmer because of the vacuum feature, something he really liked in the Wahl.</li>
            <li>I liked the MB400, because it gave me a close stuble shave, its vacuum worked well</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is nice and works well.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is a nice touch.</li>
            <li>The T980 has the dial up cut length that locks in place, the vacuum is a nice touch although it still doesn&#x27;t get all the clippings.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is a nice feature which keeps the hair from falling in the sink or on the floor.</li>
            <li>vacuum is about 90% effective.  </li>
            <li>I get a close trim, never pulls the hair on my face, easy to clean and no mess.</li>
            <li>the vacuum is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li>The Vacuum feature is nice, as it gets 98% of my hair.</li>
            <li>The vacuum and the turbo speed is nice.</li>
            <li>The vacuum catches about 80% of the hair which is really nice.    </li>
            <li>I researched beard trimmers and the customer reviews I found were very positive for this model.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s just a set of exceptionally well designed tabs and slots that quickly correct a hurried approach and seat the grille home with a satisfying, subtle click.      </li>
            <li>This is a fine trimmer with no serious draw backs.</li>
            <li>It trims my beard and moustache adequately and to the length I want, but not on first pass.  </li>
            <li>so it makes a more clean and efficient trim than his last one.  </li>
            <li>The precision trim head extends away from the body of the trimmer more than the standard one, making it easier to clean up errant hair.    </li>
            <li>Overall, this is probably a decent to good trimmer for longer hair lengths, but if you are looking for anything nearing a close shave, avoid this model.   </li>
            <li>If you contort you wrists and elbows you can get a fairly close trim on setting 1, but it is a giant pain to have to keep twisting and turning this trimmer around to achieve an even halfway decent trim.</li>
            <li>this was not a big deal to be as the first and the most important to me was a trimmer that did the job, which would be the bulk of the rating.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, a good buy.</li>
            <li>Other than that is a good product.</li>
            <li>Other options for triming around lips good.</li>
            <li>Good battery, sharp cutter.</li>
            <li>Well it looks good and outperforms my other one by battery power and performance.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if you could manually lock this shield down when doing fine edge trim.  </li>
            <li>also the vaccuum is a great feature where the hair just gets sucked into a clear little compartment that is easily emptied.</li>
            <li>I love the vacuum, as it eliminates almost all clean up after trimming my beard.</li>
            <li>I love the vacuum feature which makes clean up a breeze.  </li>
            <li>You have to make sure you clean it often or it will clog up the vacuum and your beards will fall all over the place.</li>
            <li>It is cumbersome to shave the hair right under your nose</li>
            <li>Received this trimmer and went right to the instruction book.  </li>
            <li>not like the feel of the unit right out of the box either</li>
            <li>The Amazon price seems about right for what it is.</li>
            <li>Price was definitely right.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m still trying to get the trim length right.</li>
            <li>Yeah, right.</li>
            <li>Right off the bat</li>
            <li>Maybe one day they can get this design right.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all right there.    </li>
            <li>In my estimation, their aspirations to achieve the fancy \\&quot;vacuum effect\\&quot; has clouded what should be their primary goal with this device: to trim facial hair EVENLY and EFFECTIVELY!  </li>
            <li>The carrying case is pretty useful    for the price its worth it</li>
            <li>Overall, great product, no regrets.</li>
            <li>It works as advertised, does everything it claims to do, is both easy to use &amp; easy to clean, holds a charge for quite a while, and I have had absolutely no complaints about it.  </li>
            <li>The tray was much easier to clean out thoroughly.      </li>
            <li>I have been using Norelco Trimmers for the past 30 years and I could say that the Norelco T980 is among the best so far.</li>
            <li>I have been using the normal mode and it just works fine,</li>
            <li>If you plan to travel outside the USA make sure you have a full charge and do not run out of juice while away.</li>
            <li>I wonder if all these reviews are pertaining to this particular model, some reviews dont sound like my unit.</li>
            <li>Have no need for the turbo mode, works fine in normal mode.</li>
            <li>/&gt;However, the product works well, feels solid in my hands, and it looks cool :-).  </li>
            <li>; for me it works just fine at the normal setting.  </li>
            <li>Of course it did not catch all of the hair; however, I would say it got about 90% of it which really eased the clean up.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is probably the best part - everyone knows how much hair goes everywhere when you trim your beard, but this one significantly cuts down on that.</li>
            <li>power button is very sensitive and an inadvertant flick of a finger easily shuts off (or turns on trimmer).</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to adjust the setting for different lengths as well.</li>
            <li>I use the #5 setting for a nice short trimmed beard look -- more than stubble, but not a long beard.</li>
            <li>It is good for facial hair,wont recommend for your body hair, the vacuum tube clogs up really easy.</li>
            <li>I have no other product to compare, but can&#x27;t imagine finding another that would do the job better.  </li>
            <li>And the price was pretty damn reasonable, too!!</li>
            <li>I was particularly interested because the reviews stated it could be used plugged in or unplugged and that the vacuum feature was effective in reducing the level of flung trimmings.  </li>
            <li>I was skeptical about whether or not the vacuum would be able to get most of the falling hair, but it does a very good job.</li>
            <li>Works great on any length beard and vacuum feature eliminates most of the mess.</li>
            <li>This item holds a charge for a very long time and the vacuum functionality works very good..</li>
            <li>I decided to replace the whole unit with the new version and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li>This is not so much a reflection on the product, but more of a: \\&quot;keep in mind, you&#x27;ll have to adjust to this new product&#x27;s height - it doesn&#x27;t adjust to you\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>The two things I like the most about this trimmer would be the vacuum feature (actually gets about 90% or more of the hair) and the smooth feeling it gives you when you use it.  </li>
            <li>Very little cleanup required afterwards - makes for a happy spouse.</li>
            <li>Finally, the trimmer comes with a travel bag for easy storage on trips which I thought was thoughtful.</li>
            <li>definitely better made and better performing than previous Norelcos.  </li>
            <li>It needs to be built more simply, more durable, less prone to breakage.</li>
            <li>The only thing I am not inlove with is, and that it has a super rechargeable battery which will have to be removed one day and recycled appropriately.  </li>
            <li>and I am happy as always when buying small electronics from amazon.  </li>
            <li>My old Panasonic was awesome and lasted several years but died last year</li>
            <li>In general, it&#x27;s a worthwhile</li>
            <li>If not for the great vacum not much better then the $19.99 trimer at CVS.</li>
            <li>(I think the stubble is actually a bit longer) though it is much MUCH faster and more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li>My husband has a full beard and mustache and likes to keep it neatly groomed very close to his skin</li>
            <li>having to remove the general trimmer and replace it with the mini trimmer is more of a PITA than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li>Yet it must be removed each time one wants to use the smaller, more accurate trimming blade.</li>
            <li>I have always been happy in the past and the T980 is no exception to that.</li>
            <li>it doesn&#x27;t take that long to change, but I could see where this might be an aggravation for a sideburn/goatee&#x27; kind of guy.</li>
            <li>Ergonomics are pretty good on this one but it may take a while to get used to it if you have been using other brands.</li>
            <li>Seems to have a nice long battery life too; I don&#x27;t have to charge it up every time I get done using it.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s never a mess to clean up!  </li>
            <li>Although I am not sure why you need a turbo button, when it seems to me it should be on full vacuum all the time, it is an excellent beard and mustache trimmer/shaver.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to use, works very well, and I have no regrets at all with it&#x27;s purchase.</li>
            <li>Overall, good power, never pulls hairs, sharp blades, and the vaccum does its job for the most part.</li>
            <li>I have own various Norelco Vacuum Trimmers in the past and this one is the best yet.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t I just take the new, free unit?  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s fairly large and and bulky, like the charger!</li>
            <li>It makes it easier to groom your beard to exactly the right length.</li>
            <li>This beard trimmer ([[ASIN:B000UCBFKW Norelco T980 turbo vacuum beard and moustache trimmer.]]) is very fine, and I have no complaints at all about</li>
            <li>Overall a great product especially for the money.</li>
            <li>shave is quick and the receptacle really does seem to catch upwards of 95% of what I&#x27;m using.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it is simple and easy to clean.</li>
            <li>I had a previous model of this trimmer and loved it.  </li>
            <li>Comfortable settings available for different trims.</li>
            <li>I enjoy the trimmer, love that I can walk around my room and clean my beard without spilling shards of dead cells everywhere.</li>
            <li>It is far too easy to accidentally switch the level of shave.</li>
            <li>It is more powerful and somewhat bigger.  </li>
            <li>It cuts cleanly and consistently, far better than my old Braun.</li>
            <li>My Norelco T900 was great, but broke recently, so I went out looking for another one, only to find it was discontinued.</li>
            <li>They did one good thing this time and actually made the beard reservoir window clear.</li>
            <li>I was using an older Norelco model of this device and was happy with it except that now it was so old that it was acting up.</li>
            <li>* of loud, but honestly, a shaver is loud regardless.    </li>
            <li>T980 issues: The electronic power and turbo switches are touch sensitive and too easy to press while trimming.</li>
            <li>It will be more economical than a 5 blade razor if it only lasts about year.    </li>
            <li>It does a good job at keeping the hair out of the sink, but its placement sets the trimmer so far back from the guard that using this trimmer on setting 2</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really see that the spring and hinge arrangement is very useful, and without it the trimmer might be less bulky and feel more secure.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is straightforward as all the pieces come apart and go back together pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I can only say that it works great, does what its supposed to do, and I would never, ever buy any product without the vacuum.</li>
            <li>Happily, however, such is not the case with the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.      </li>
            <li>highly recommend this shaver if you are wanting a clean, neat trim.</li>
            <li>It just minimizes the mess, and it&#x27;s good though.</li>
            <li>Why mess with a good thing?</li>
            <li>As with all shavers I have not been able to catch the hair right below my nose - and thus require and additional device (the flip up here is still too big...).    </li>
            <li>yes, it does capture quite a bit of hair when you&#x27;re trimming a longer beard (making clean up a bit easier), but this does not mean that hair does not fall.</li>
            <li>The little detail cutter is easy to attach and does a great job of defining the beard area and also clipping any stray hairs under the nose where the big cutter head cannot reach.    </li>
            <li>one charging gives me 2 weeks easily, now the deal is, i dont have full beard, i use it to trim my french beard and sometimes use it on armpits</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s performance and very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li>Recharging time is very reasonable, unlike some of these trimmers.</li>
            <li>Does an excellent job with the trimming itself (I rarely shave, I just occasionally trim with this), and it definitely reduces the amount of hairs left lying all over the sink when I&#x27;m done, making cleanup easier, but it is still required.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very light and fragile basket.  </li>
            <li>I decided to get this Norelco for its vac feature because with the Braun, it was kind of a pain to clean up all the little hairs on the sink after each use.  </li>
            <li>&#x27;Tornadoes&#x27; super warm beard trimmer and nose waxer was developed in the climates of Southern Arabia where men are known to never shave.</li>
            <li>As far as trimming goes, does a fine job.</li>
            <li>&#x27;Tornadoes&#x27; super warm beard trimmer and nose waxer was developed in the climates of Southern Arabia where men are known to never shave.</li>
            <li>With some patience and a bit of mess it does a pretty good job at trimming.</li>
            <li>Vacuum actually get 90% of clippings, huge plus!!!</li>
            <li>They (Norelco) wanted more to put new batteries in my Norelco 7500 trimmer then the cost of a new trimmer.</li>
            <li>Update: 3 years old and like new!  </li>
            <li>The charge lasts a long time and pulling it apart for cleaning is very easy.</li>
            <li>My wife loved the vacum feature since it kept the sink a little cleaner.</li>
            <li>the T980 is generally a good little trimmer.</li>
            <li>Battery time is good, easier to handle, its a little</li>
            <li>Although I wasn&#x27;t interested in a vacuum trimmer I have to say that the vacuum works better than I thought it would and actually turned out to be a welcome benefit ie.</li>
            <li>It was pretty quick and easy to shape up my goatee and actually make it look presentable on the first try.</li>
            <li>In addition it allows me to make a smooth line where I trim the beard completely.</li>
            <li>I started shaving my head over ten years ago and I am so glad I found the T980.  </li>
            <li>Mostly used for personal body grooming.</li>
            <li>The first one that I bought (as a gift for my boyfriend) stopped functioning after it was used 5-6 times.</li>
            <li>First, the highest setting is about 3/4\\&quot;</li>
            <li>I would recommend that this be the first one you try</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>It does a nice job, as I expected.</li>
            <li>overall performance of this shaver more than makes up for this one shortcoming.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li>I first bought a 10 piece/change attachments/thin plastic trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t catch 100%, but it gets pretty close.  </li>
            <li>go for higher philips models...</li>
            <li>Overall it is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li>As far a detailed trimmer</li>
            <li>and my first time using it</li>
            <li>Its exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li>This is probably the result of the aforementioned greater distance between the edge of the stationary and moving blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this trimmer after going through many bargain basement off the shelf beard trimmers.</li>
            <li>switch too much!</li>
            <li>(I learned to check this out first)  </li>
            <li>I found that I look better if I use two heights for different areas.  </li>
            <li>This is my first beard (mustaches aplenty over the years before now), and I used the reviews here to select a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>overall, i am satisfied to the core.</li>
            <li>First, a disclaimer.  </li>
            <li>Perhaps I did not see the distinction at first, but I see that others purchase this unit as a clipper as well.  </li>
            <li>By trimming twice a week, it keeps my beard at a consistent neat length.</li>
            <li>First one lasted about 5 years.</li>
            <li>I love the fact that I can use it corded or cordless beacuse sooner or later the battery is not charged or dies.  </li>
            <li>Simple to use, and many hair length settings.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still on the first charge so time will tell.</li>
            <li>stands 1/2 - 1 inch higher than it should.  </li>
            <li>As far as what it&#x27;s designed to do, I don&#x27;t think the turbo feature works any better than normal mode.  </li>
            <li>Yes it happened to me first time I used it.</li>
            <li>How hot would it get in the suitcase if it does come on and run 45 minutes?</li>
            <li>How hot would it get in the suitcase if it does come on and run 45 minutes?</li>
            <li>I subsequently bought a Wahl product and found it to be much better.</li>
            <li>first I noticed the flimsy bag which was shin and would not protect the machine against bumps.</li>
            <li>After starting to trim on a safe level 6</li>
            <li>but could not make out the numbers at first.</li>
            <li>I contacted the company and they told me that they would do nothing to help me since i bought it over 2 years ago (2.5 yrs ago to be exact).</li>
            <li>If not, sorry ;)    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always prefered trimming short than shaving mostly because its easier on my skin and doesn&#x27;t give me acne.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through this before, you are doomed to a useful life measured in months before the battery (and therefore the whole trimmer) craps out.     </li>
            <li>First trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>I bought this mainly to use on my beard, which grows quickly.</li>
            <li>My beard is very coarse, and tends to jam up most trimmers.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s better to use this more often on smaller jobs than waiting to do a bigger trim.</li>
            <li>The first time I set it to \\&quot;4\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it capture a lot of the hair but enough of it drop out too.</li>
            <li>It does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li>Seems like they concentrate on that feature more than the basic design.  </li>
            <li>, it feels rather cheap (which it is), unlike my old unit.  </li>
            <li>Removing and installing the guide was a bit tricky at first</li>
            <li>Battery holds its charge pretty well.</li>
            <li>I told them that&#x27;s just damn nuts, and I don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re willing to do</li>
            <li>/&gt;Otherwise, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li>This is the first one I have had which sucks the trimmings into a built-in container, which is a great idea.  </li>
            <li>However, if you set it up correctly (not difficult), then no problem occurs.    </li>
            <li>With the length guard removed you can get pretty close</li>
            <li>but if you want no hair there you&#x27;ll need to resort to trimming to zero length then shaping with a razor (while not perfect in that it can&#x27;t do it all, the results are perfect)!    </li>
            <li>At first I thought that this thing just doesn&#x27;t cut hair well.</li>
            <li>The first 3-4 times I used this trimmer</li>
            <li>This is my first beard trimmer for use with my first beard.  </li>
            <li>Even though this is my first beard, I know trimmings tend to go everywhere when trimming a beard.  </li>
            <li>It replaced the first one which I dropped and broke.  </li>
            <li>My beard has gone from 3-inch length to 1/4 inch length, rough tracing my own growth from a 20-something college kid to an AARP neophyte.</li>
            <li>For a first time beard grower this was just what the doctor ordered.  </li>
            <li>I would give it 5 stars, but this is my first trimmer and have nothing to measure against.  </li>
            <li>This is the first electric trimmer I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li>Funny thing about the attachments.</li>
            <li>I just used it for the first time and have decided that I will never use a razor again.  </li>
            <li>I do agree with others about the initial awkwardness of trimming with the comb-like top guide part off.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;- T980 Trim settings are almost exact to the T860&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>This is the first where you can trim while charging.  </li>
            <li>Overall, I am satisfied with the product, but there are some caveats.    </li>
            <li>First of all, it&#x27;s a well-made product.  </li>
            <li>I had but better in several ways.  </li>
            <li>I bought the first T100 which used 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li>Also:  The directions say that charging more than necessary will reduce battery life.  </li>
            <li>First used it when my hair was \\&quot;long\\&quot; - 1/4\\&quot;+ - and the vac sucked up the all the clippings.  </li>
            <li>The only problem I have is the top flap on hair collecting chamber came off at the joint where it swivel.</li>
            <li>the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode on this puppy REALLY vuccums!  </li>
            <li>The trimmer works pretty well.  </li>
            <li>so during my first trim, it ruined my goatee.  </li>
            <li>It trims well and the mini-shaver is still the best way to shave the short hairs on my cheeks above my beard on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li>This was a gift I gave to my son-in-law, but he has told me several times how much he is enjoying it.  </li>
            <li>the vac only OK.</li>
            <li>however, this is not why i buy a beard trimmer in the first place.  </li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li>exactly cuts.</li>
            <li>Definitely much better than Wahl at double price.</li>
            <li>The battery is also pretty reliable.</li>
            <li>Trying to catch the hair is good, but this is not a good design for precise</li>
            <li>You would be better off buying a set of clippers with the different guards and trimming your beard that way.</li>
            <li>The first time I opened the Norelco compartment</li>
            <li>I have still not drained the initial charge, but it is a much better trimmer than the Wahl ever was.</li>
            <li>Even shortest trim level doesn&#x27;t allow me to short my beard as I wished, but I could manage it by removing the comb on top of the blade.</li>
            <li>Makes it still very convenient to travel with too!  </li>
            <li>These trimmers have come along way since I bought my first one.</li>
            <li>Whichever comes first.     </li>
            <li>Trimming whiskers used to be such a chore that the ZZ Top look began to show some sense, if not appeal.  </li>
            <li>Most generate just a bit of wind, sufficient to scatter your whiskers over the widest possible surface.  </li>
            <li>I had to duct tape mine to make sure that this doesn&#x27;t constantly happen.</li>
            <li>This is the first trimmer I have used.  </li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had turn on the power thinking it was in Tubro mode and accidentally hit the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button this and was like what the heck.    </li>
            <li>And, unlike most trimmers in this price range don&#x27;t allow you to use the cord when the battery gets low.</li>
            <li>When putting the comb back on the trimmer, make sure it responds to the height adjustment ring.</li>
            <li>My first impression at taking my $44 trimmer out the box, was \\&quot;Gee, this feels cheap.\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m overall pleased with it.</li>
            <li>I will be interested to see how well the blades hold up to the \\&quot;ever-sharp\\&quot; claim.  </li>
            <li>This is my first Philips Norelco product.  </li>
            <li>I have used this product for at least three years now and it still works great.  </li>
            <li>battery life is good and if it goes dead you can run the trimmer off of the charging cord.    </li>
            <li>- The vacuum picks up more than 90% of the clippings, leaving the bathroom sink nearly hair free.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum part works really well and doesn&#x27;t leave too much hair in the sink, and DH gets a nice, even trim.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature works best in turbo mode, which is louder, but not enough for me to mind it, personally.</li>
            <li>This is a great product,the only downfall I see is the vacuum guard in front of razors gets in the way of making straight lines.  </li>
            <li>My fiance is quite pleased with this vacuum trimmer-</li>
            <li>and I Love the vacuum for not leaving hair everywhere.  </li>
            <li>The device does vacuum most of the beard, but not all.  </li>
            <li>Vacuum catches most, but not all the clipped hairs.  </li>
            <li>Another added bennifit is that my husband said the vacuum seems to make the hair stand up better just before it&#x27;s cut</li>
            <li>The magic in it is the vacuum that captures and stores</li>
            <li>i love the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>I love the vacuum.  </li>
            <li>It cuts hair well, most all of the hair gets sucked in by the vacuum feature</li>
            <li>The vacuum picks up most, but not all, hair.</li>
            <li>I like the vacuum although it doesn&#x27;t get 100% of hairs it does get most.</li>
            <li>it can be done, it just takes more effort than before; again I think its the price you pay for the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li>I chose this trimmer mostly because of the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li>turns out the vacuum gets about 90% of the hairs -certainly better than nothing.  </li>
            <li>i love the fact that it has a vacuum on it.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, I love the vacuum aspect.</li>
            <li>The turbo vacuum catches most of the hair,</li>
            <li>I love the vacuum, it even gives a bit of a coolin effect.  </li>
            <li>I love that it has a vacuum suction for the trimmed hair</li>
            <li>I also found that the vacuum works much better on longer hair then on shorter hair.  </li>
            <li>I absolutely love the vacuum function.</li>
            <li>Amazon was very understanding and offered me a new one free.</li>
            <li>I used to have an old Norelco trimmer that used for years until it just wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore and bought this as the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; replacement and for the most part . . .</li>
            <li>This fantastic tool takes care of that for you leaving absolutely no mess on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer has a wide variety of trim lengths, doesn&#x27;t need to be charged frequently, is very comfortable to use, and even has a vacuum that makes clean-up VERY easy.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been through several other kinds of trimmers over the years, but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li>It works really well and priced right.  </li>
            <li>As such, I am downgrading the original 3-star rating to ONE-STAR and changing my review title from \\&quot;It&#x27;s Just OK\\&quot; to reflect my true feelings about this product.</li>
            <li>If you trim with this thing quickly on the &#x27;normal&#x27; trimming mode, it&#x27;ll catch maybe 75% of your hair in the vaccuum.</li>
            <li>With the twist action settings on this razor, I quickly change settings and get my beard right every time.  </li>
            <li>It cleans easily, and captures a good amount of hair to prevent a giant sink mess.</li>
            <li>It has a &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; boost setting, but I rarely ever use it; it does a fine job on regular speed.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works great and catches all the loose hair during the trimming process.  </li>
            <li>The beard trimmer is pretty good, but has trouble getting really close under my nose.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times however it cuts nicely and has a small attachment which is nice for trimming and getting close to skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had various Norelco&#x27;s over the past couple decades and they all work wonderful fo a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Overall it looks good and it charges from empty to full in an hour.</li>
            <li>I definitely feel that I got my money&#x27;s worth when I purchased this product!!</li>
            <li>so decide on that before buying if u need complete clean shave like look..</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t liked is that the hair container is SUPER fragile.</li>
            <li>it works excellent has a pretty strong charge you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li>The provided pre-set lengths are pretty good and usually work for the style I need.  </li>
            <li>Spent more than planned, but well worth it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap, and has barely any material supporting it.</li>
            <li>I do wish the turbo button was in a different spot on the handle, as it turns on accidentally very easily, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li>And last, but not least, my original impression of this being an overpriced piece of cheap plastic does count.</li>
            <li>While the little vacumn may seem like a gimmick, it actually works very well compared to not using a vacumn at all - don&#x27;t expect perfection - BUT it is very good.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts for weeks and the vacuum, though loud, is EXTREMELY effective.  </li>
            <li>Says the vacuum feature works very well, and that he is able to keep his beard at an even length.  </li>
            <li>The razor cuts well, fast, and can do very straight lines</li>
            <li>The old battery was weakening, and when I saw the Philips special promotion on Amazon, I decided it was time for an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have spent many $$ looking for the right trimmer...........</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature would be great if it got all the hairs, but it only gets some of them, so kind of pointless.  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job, but has way too many little, fragile parts.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nicer than my old Norelco, and it even trims a little better too :)</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li>Reviews were mostly positive and I agree.</li>
            <li>I read all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I admit that I use my old electric razor for the trim around the mouth and the part of the cheeks kept clean, takes a few seconds, and maybe every 2 weeks a couple of minutes with a safety razor to make sure that the clean area hasn&#x27;t shrunk.</li>
            <li>The circumference is large; it&#x27;s a pretty large clipper.  </li>
            <li>The end result is better than nothing, but not a complete solution.    </li>
            <li>It does indeed capture pretty much all of the cut hair which saves clean-up time afterwards.  </li>
            <li>really* shorter and that part of your beard will look funny at work a couple days.</li>
            <li>and if you really buy after reading all this, i&#x27;m not sorry for you because you didn&#x27;t listen and you&#x27;ll just have to return it.  </li>
            <li>The title pretty much says it all.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum gets the vast majority of the hair, it&#x27;s super easy to clean and keeps a charge well.  </li>
            <li>the carrying case they included was useful during travel too and accommodates other toiletries. :)</li>
            <li>This trimmer does pretty much everything I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I bought my first Philips Norelco  trimmer in 1993 and it worked very well.</li>
            <li>This newer, top-of-the-line T980 is pretty much what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li>He now has no problem finding the correct length trimmer guides or deal with a pile of clippings because the trimmer pretty much takes care of that for him.</li>
            <li>Bottom line up front: this thing trims and has lots of nice features, but is not worth leaving a working trimmer in the trash for.    </li>
            <li>it was a good trimmer overall, though I really didn&#x27;t like have to switch out the trimmer heads for the standard</li>
            <li>In anycase so far so good and does seem well made as my other Norelco products.</li>
            <li>It may be a tad louder than normal trimmers but its worth it.  </li>
            <li>you&#x27;re using an older Norelco trimmer similar to this one and have been pleased with it</li>
            <li>This model works as well as or better than an earlier one for which I bought this as a replacement (the older battery would no longer hold a charge).</li>
            <li>The vacuum does an exceptional job, especially in the turbo mode.</li>
            <li>This particular model had a built in vacuum - I figured it was more of a gimic than anything</li>
            <li>The vacuum works better on this one than my older Norelco.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going strong with a powerful battery and the suction of loose hair even allows me to shave in the car when I&#x27;m pressed for time.</li>
            <li>I love these - easy to use, quality cut, holds a charge for months, less mess that most.  </li>
            <li>Solid feel, the vacuum feature definitely reduces the amount of hair in the sink (and on the counter, on the floor, etc.), the Turbo mode, while loud, is awesome.  </li>
            <li>The one downfall of this one is that the plastic guard is far enough from the cutter that it stops him from getting a good trim right under the nose, but that is the same with all trimmers depending on what length setting you have it on.  </li>
            <li>The size and shape is comfortable; the vaccum, although not perfect, keeps your work area neat and relatively clean; the turbo function is a nice additional feature.</li>
            <li>After finding the setting best for me it has been consistent in cutting.  </li>
            <li>I especially like the adjustable settings that are easy to change.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with a nice black carrying case.  </li>
            <li>however design leaves a bit to be desired, e.g., the on/off button and the &#x27;turbo&#x27; button are easily and unintentionally turned on or off -- should have been recessed or different switch device used; similarly, the trim adjustment wheel shifts from one setting to another way to easy.</li>
            <li>It is easy to adjust, relatively quite, vacumms up the cuttings quite well.  </li>
            <li>The height guide and standard trim head slip off easily (5 seconds or less-literally).  </li>
            <li>Easy to pop off, dump in trash, and pop back on.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I recently grew a goatee and was looking for a no-nonsense, easy to use trimmer that would not break the bank</li>
            <li>(and I don&#x27;t have very steady</li>
            <li>However, I liked the way the Remington could sit on the sink counter in the vertical position, taking up less counter space.</li>
            <li>The clean-out and length of cut adjustment are easy enough to use.  </li>
            <li>and I was able to assemble the trimmer back to normal working order.</li>
            <li>It adjusts easy and is quiet.  </li>
            <li>I found you&#x27;re better off with dry hair.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still going strong after several years.  </li>
            <li>He has a pretty thick beard and while the vacuum part isn&#x27;t as good as I had hoped, it picks up a lot more than a normal razor.</li>
            <li>(it doesn&#x27;t seem to be dedicated to holding each part in a certain place, but instead it holds everything in one pouch).      </li>
            <li>The on/off switch is too large</li>
            <li>(That&#x27;s a smart design.)</li>
            <li>Also, the power brick is a bit large, and there&#x27;s no included charging base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>A bit large</li>
            <li>I use a little more care when fine trimming than with my older model, but the extra seconds aren&#x27;t too much hassle and the results are fantastic.    </li>
            <li>On the other hand, its amazing at any other length, which is why I was still able to give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li>Emptying the vacuum chamber is easy though.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum works well in sucking up 95% of the trimmings and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this for several months - first such trimmer I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;ve liked it quite a bit.  </li>
            <li>Works well and easily and vacuum element keeps beard trimmings from dirtying shirt.</li>
            <li>I have already paid for the trimmer, because with the vacuum feature, I can shave my head easily myself, saving $19:00 per head-shave.</li>
            <li>Good product - vacuum (no stray bits of hair), self-sharpinging, holds a long charge, works in close quarters, very competative price</li>
            <li>It is both necessary to catch most of the hair and very loud.</li>
            <li>guarantee maybe I can calm down and decide if I like the unit - sure don&#x27;t like the service so far!!!</li>
            <li>I thought this was simply a manufacturing fluke when I first bought it, so I returned the trimmer directly to Norelco (very friendly service).  </li>
            <li>Battery life seems fine, haven&#x27;t needed to charge it since the initial charging.  </li>
            <li>So all in all, this trimmer is a fine replacement; dare I say upgrade to my last trimmer, it is said, \\&quot;You get what you pay</li>
            <li>The vacuum function works very well capturing the clippings easily.  </li>
            <li>It also comes with different size removable heads that makes the fine trimming a breeze.  </li>
            <li>If you need to give yourself a fade or any short length haircut, it&#x27;ll do fine.</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t tried the alternate fine trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It works fine, but I wish you didn&#x27;t need to go that extra step of switching out the trimmer blades.  </li>
            <li>I have another Panasonic trimmer that works fine, but it has the same issue.  </li>
            <li>It did a great job of shaping and trimming, but left a mess of clippings in the sink.  </li>
            <li>The nine settings lock into place which is nice (and was an improvement over my previous trimmer, which would slip into lower settings now and again), and it is possible to take the comb off and do detailed trims with the detail blade included.</li>
            <li>If you have fine short bear</li>
            <li>I really like the \\&quot;specialty Mini-Beard trimmer attachment\\&quot; which allows me to easily shape my beard and moustache while still using the vacuum.  </li>
            <li>The extra attachment for fine detail works well</li>
            <li>I found this to be a pretty decent trimmer.</li>
            <li>Hubby likes it as a replacement for an older model (that lasted about 6 years!).</li>
            <li>But this produt does a very nice job and it makes very little to no mess.  </li>
            <li>I marked it down a star for that issue as well as the fact that there is a plastic spring-loaded piece that I think is there to help push the trimmings toward the vacuum, but when you remove the top for mustache trimming it would be nice if that piece moved out of the way</li>
            <li>and it is too smooth and has no flat or grippy surfaces.</li>
            <li>It has 9 different settings and does an excellent job of collecting facial hairs without making a mess.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m optimistic that I&#x27;ll go from liking it to loving it with a little practice.    </li>
            <li>It came with a detail trimmer attachment that is really nice and a little storage case for everything.     </li>
            <li>The little travel pouch is nice.    </li>
            <li>I think the adjustable length feature is really great, it accomodates about &#x27;any&#x27; length beard, and eliminates all the extra little clip-on guides you have to keep track of.</li>
            <li>Our experience has been that little bits of hair still fly all over the place, even with the vacuum--although perhaps to a slightly lesser degree.</li>
            <li>The parts detach easily and the little supplied brush works well to clean it out.</li>
            <li>I had a Remington vacuum shave that worked fine</li>
            <li>What I expected when purchasing this product, and it does cost a lot more than most, is the vacuum that it advertises to work, and it clearly does NOT!</li>
            <li>I find that, as I shave, the shave length setting can very easily be pushed down so that I end up with a much shorter beard than I intended.  </li>
            <li>I happily trimmed to a 4 once a week (sometimes twice to clean it up) for the last couple months and it worked well, until just a couple of days ago when the setting slipped all the way down to 1 when I was in the middle of shaving!  </li>
            <li>The batteries last nicely even with the turbo vacuum on, certainly lasts longer than it takes for me to trim my beard.    </li>
            <li>B0028QFHUM DOVO Shavette Straight Razor with Red Holder and FREE 100</li>
            <li>Low battery warning light is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>This trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li>Trims fast.  </li>
            <li>This real does the job.  </li>
            <li>It also has a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>The T980 works very well for a consumer-grade device.  </li>
            <li>The description really doesn&#x27;t do it justice.  </li>
            <li>Others have mentioned the power button was touchy, I don&#x27;t really agree.</li>
            <li>Both shavers require a light pressure or the setting can suddenly change to a shorter length.  </li>
            <li>This shaver really is a treat to use.</li>
            <li>What I really like is the adjustable guard.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s much nicer not having all those attachments.</li>
            <li>And the turbo function doesn&#x27;t really help anyway; it drops a lot of whiskers.</li>
            <li>[[VIDEOID:29484211]]I only review products that I use, enjoy, and want to advocate for; the T980 is one of these.</li>
            <li>It cuts well, but it doesn&#x27;t catch as much as it billed to.  </li>
            <li>thanks to philips...</li>
            <li>if u really want a quality over price....  </li>
            <li>You need to pass it a couple of times until the surface is really even.</li>
            <li>Of course you should be more careful.</li>
            <li>It is very helpful too that it can be used with a cord power supply.</li>
            <li>Have been using the T980 for about a month and it works very well.</li>
            <li>haha.</li>
            <li>it was really a surprise when I got it ..</li>
            <li>they either look like grizzly adams and try to mow the whole thing at once</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t capture the whole hairs</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t think of anything else I&#x27;d really want in a beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>it comes in a really sturdy clam shell package and with no helpful opening tabs</li>
            <li>I bought this for my husband, who&#x27;s very picky about his shavers and trimmers.</li>
            <li>He does really like it.</li>
            <li>something I really like.</li>
            <li>And the turbo feature does work, kicking up the speed much faster to trim you beard in no time.  </li>
            <li>The battery much to its credit also holds a charge well.</li>
            <li>And that, my friends, is really it.     </li>
            <li>It really works quite well.</li>
            <li>and I must say this one is much nicer</li>
            <li>he&#x27;s ever used - highly recommended!</li>
            <li>Cleaning is a bit more complicated that would appear, but the PERKS and QUALITY of the trimmer are more than worth it.  </li>
            <li>The price was also very competetive.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer over a month ago, and it works very well.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li>I purchased this for my husband who has really course hair.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of $ on an electric trimmer, because he seems to go through them fast.  </li>
            <li>It trims his goatee which is really course, and he has even had to trim his head with it, he buzzes his head, since his clippers broke.  </li>
            <li>He&#x27;s really picky about his clippers and trimmer, and he said he loves it</li>
            <li>It does a very through job</li>
            <li>He doesn&#x27;t have much hair and he just doesn&#x27;t want to look bald.  </li>
            <li>That is, when using a very lighter touch than what I&#x27;m used to so that the teeth do not compress and sculpture the result.</li>
            <li>if you REALLY want it, just try it at any store and tell me if you can run it across your beard, or body 4 times without cleaning it.  </li>
            <li>I wish it came with a stand or dock, but I really can&#x27;t fault it at that price.</li>
            <li>I really like mine.</li>
            <li>but I really can&#x27;t use it now.</li>
            <li>It defines his beard very well.</li>
            <li>It seems to work really well for him.</li>
            <li>The turbo settings really help with the hair suction and there is virtually</li>
            <li>I ended up taking the comb attachment off the blade and, using a real comb like hairdressers used to do, trimmer the rest of the way manually.</li>
            <li>I really like the rechargable feathure and the option to plug in the trimmer if is out of juice.  </li>
            <li>I was looking to find a groomer that was fast and could provide an even cut on my beard which consists of both straight and curly hair.</li>
            <li>I was very impressed by the cutting quality.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Much cleaner.</li>
            <li>Can remove the variable adjustable clipper section for a real close trim on the beards outer fringes.</li>
            <li>Very satisfied with the trimmer, like the small attachable close edge piece..</li>
            <li>It adjusts to provide a very close and even trim.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re like me, you use your beard trimmer when you don&#x27;t have much time in the morning before you have to take off for work.</li>
            <li>this one not so much)</li>
            <li>Cuts and vacumes fast and efficiently.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to anyone!    </li>
            <li>When shaving with my Norelco T900, the shavings would fly all over the place --- in the sink, behind the faucet, in between the handles of the faucet, and on the floor.</li>
            <li>Very quite operation.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t take much to glue or otherwise fix the thing.  </li>
            <li>It really works as advertised.</li>
            <li>That was a real concern I had</li>
            <li>It has functioned very well.  </li>
            <li>The turbo really helps keep the hair in the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>and it is still working very wello.  </li>
            <li>Better than expected.</li>
            <li>I really like the guide on Norelco trimmers</li>
            <li>all simply pull off and on smoothly without any difficulty lining them up or anything like that.  </li>
            <li>I also really like the feature of running off either corded or cordless.  </li>
            <li>product works very well, gets close with a very even cut.</li>
            <li>I was very concerned about it</li>
            <li>but I didn&#x27;t really expect \\&quot;no</li>
            <li>My wife really likes the lack of beard hair in the sink.  </li>
            <li>Was very underpowered and I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li>It trims fast and evenly.  </li>
            <li>Cleaning is a drag but should keep the unit working better longer.    </li>
            <li>Overall, I enjoy using this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I think these manufacturers should specify their trimming lengths so you can do a reasonable buying comparison.</li>
            <li>But aside from that, they&#x27;ve really worked out the details on this thing.</li>
            <li>If you work in real time, it&#x27;s performance is sub par.</li>
            <li>but I really didn&#x27;t need it.  </li>
            <li>So I can&#x27;t really complain about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Modern decent-quality rechargeable devices automatically prevent overcharging</li>
            <li>Turbo really works well, even if it does make it louder</li>
            <li>With the indicators on this trimmer, it is much easier to try and extend the life of the battery.  </li>
            <li>I find that the smallest setting--#1--does not give a real stubble shave.</li>
            <li>This product does everything the manufacturer says and does it very well.    </li>
            <li>I figured there isn&#x27;t much to a trimmer</li>
            <li>So let me get this straight.  </li>
            <li>Equally delicate-feeling are the two sliding, plastic prongs used to hold the primary blade in place.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works very well however the vaccume does not collect much.  </li>
            <li>i&#x27;m very picky, and this trimmer lacks in no area.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the Turbo setting because I haven&#x27;t really used that</li>
            <li>Product works very well.  </li>
            <li>And once the lead is connected from socket to trimmer, a scant hour will have it fully refreshed and ready for another month on the road.    </li>
            <li>But they don&#x27;t really, do they?  </li>
            <li>I threw away several cheap, battery-operated, trimmers before getting this, which I&#x27;ve had for quite a while.</li>
            <li>This works very well.  </li>
            <li>It will serve you very well...unless you are a finicky turd.</li>
            <li>Works VERY well.  </li>
            <li>Very convenient product.    </li>
            <li>The T980 works just as it should, for me, and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve found I have to remove the prongs and then very cautiously trim my mustache.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Vacuum works very well.</li>
            <li>Well, the trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li>The trimmer itself is very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li>I must say I haven&#x27;t seen much of these negatives.  </li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used the trimmer a few times since getting it and so far so good.</li>
            <li>This one is OK with good power and suction but awkward to use.</li>
            <li>; you can still pop the top off and do the edge trimming without adding any attachments; No. 3 and No. 2 depth on this one are the same as on the old one, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have an old razor that plugs in and has 3 or 4 different adapters, and that works a lot better.    </li>
            <li>Quality is good, the adjustment for cutting length worked OK.  </li>
            <li>The T980 works much better and leaves almost no trail of hair behind, i love the turbo button for areas with lots of hair.</li>
            <li>If noise is a concern, like in early morning, the standard mode does an ok job too.</li>
            <li>My older T-3000 had a self-contained trimming blade that slid forward with a simple thumb push whenever needed and then retracted just as easily.</li>
            <li>Norelco fixed this in their more recent models?</li>
            <li>/&gt;Bottom line, it is a good value home trimmer to handle delicately.</li>
            <li>if I didn&#x27;t know better, I would say it makes an old geezer like me look younger.  </li>
            <li>Be sure to start a lot higher than you think you need, and work your way down if needed.</li>
            <li>I suggest a can of compressed air be handy and to blow the shavings out after each use, which defeats the neatness of the vacuum collection, but blow lightly over a waste basket.</li>
            <li>It is easy to clean and the vacuum actually works well.  </li>
            <li>Now I can trim my beard line, mustache and sideburn hair (with the help of vacuum power) without having to worry about a HUGE mess to clean up!!</li>
            <li>The vacuum action will catch most hairs, but you can&#x27;t get away with not trimming over a sink.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum component works really well to collect and house the trimmings, keeping the bathroom sink free of stray hairs  </li>
            <li>It does a nice job, and I especially like the vacuum that catches all the hair</li>
            <li>The blue hair deflector broke after using it only 2 times, but I was able to exchange the whole unit right away.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re thinking of getting a new one, you might as well go all out and get the good one that is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer is a fantastic beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>It does a neat and consistent trimming and the \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; feature works better on this model than it did on previous models.</li>
            <li>Plus, the vacuum works decently, and gets most (not quite all, but most) of the little hairs</li>
            <li>will be fine if you are not an equipment trasher and as long as you pay a little attention when sliding the moveable pieces off and on and make sure you have them in the right groove.  </li>
            <li>I always trimmed in a downward fashion with my old one because if I went up it would reduce it to stubble even with the right length setting.</li>
            <li>for noise, my old trimmer had no doubt gotten noisier over the years as the blades dulled or whatever, but with them side by side, the T980 was noticeably QUIETER right out of the box.  </li>
            <li>I liked that the turbo not only boosted power to the vacuum, but also to the blades making a much more even and short cut the first time eliminating the need to do a second pass.</li>
            <li>The Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer allowed me to achieve and maintain the beard length I was seeking more precisely and efficiently than any other trimmer I have owned.</li>
            <li>Vacuum really works!!!</li>
            <li>The vacuum collection certainly helps keep the sink area clean.  </li>
            <li>Its form, design and cut remind me of my old Norelco (which is great) with only one major difference, the vacuum.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a couple of Norelco trimmers in the past, most recently the T780, and have never really been happy.</li>
            <li>I generally liked the performance of the older one (except it didn&#x27;t quite vacuum \\&quot;all them tiny hairs\\&quot; as Bill Cosby used to say)</li>
            <li>The vacuum is much better, the alternate head for detailed trimming is easy to change back and forth, and the ability to use it plugged in is a big plus.</li>
            <li>Definitely less clean up, but still have to clean the sink, and surrounding counter.  </li>
            <li>Many other trimmers require you to change heads.</li>
            <li>and then the detail sized cutters--on more than one occasion I was in a hurry and fumbling around looking for the other cutter assembly than what was on the trimmer.</li>
            <li>The trimmer is sleek, it comes with a travel/carrying bag, and it does a better 5 o&#x27;clock shadow than the other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>I read many of the other reviews of the Norelco T980 and having a Norelco electric razor decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Unlike many other trimmers, this trimmer can be used both cord and cordless.</li>
            <li>You will get used to it quickly, but the design makes fine trimming more of a blind operation</li>
            <li>The blades are easy to clean and battery last for a long time once fully charged.  </li>
            <li>There are just too many other problems with this trimmer to recommend it.</li>
            <li>It has an option to trim more close than other trimmers I have tried.</li>
            <li>Also I have noticed that despite the jet engine sucking noises there is a fair amount of very small pieces of beard that still escape and wind up on the sink.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with the locking mechanism slipping down to a lower guard setting, and I apply a reasonable amount of pressure.</li>
            <li>This is the second vacuum unit I&#x27;ve owned and is significantly better in performance and features than the first.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the vacuum capabilities when I first read about it, but after trying it I must admit that I&#x27;m very impressed.  </li>
            <li>(Previous models would change settings as you were trimming because the change ring was right under your grip and moved too easily.)</li>
            <li>Precision trimming, ease of use, and convenient clean up and features makes this shaver a must buy for any man especially those on the job hunt!</li>
            <li>The guide is much sturdier and it doesn&#x27;t poke him like the older trimmer.</li>
            <li>The T980 is OK, but I long for the old days.   </li>
            <li>Works better than expected and better than the less expense models.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the turbo mode and it still leaves numerous beard hairs which I have to clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li>Even the Accu Control System&#x27;s flexing guide comb is easier to clean than the last one.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I occasionally use a compressed air can to thoroughly clean it once a</li>
            <li>love the way you can choose the size of trim with a simple twist, but I use the trimmer bare or at setting \\&quot;0\\&quot; to get that fashionable stubble look.</li>
            <li>I like the fact that as I cut my beard the shaver vacuums the cut hair so there is not big clean up at the end of the trim.  </li>
            <li>Almost all the trimmings get sucked into a small chamber that is viewable and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>It works quite well without the comb housing to clean up the back of my neck between haircuts.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older and can&#x27;t see the numbers very well,</li>
            <li>Mind you, I&#x27;m no professional stylist, but I thought it was tremendously helpful!</li>
            <li>This unit is unique in that it has a built in vacuum.</li>
            <li>and I was excited about the addition of a vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>The turbo function does work, it has enough high power that calling it &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; is not only cool but accurate.</li>
            <li>The vacuum catches almost all clippings and the trimmer gives great, reproducable settings from very short to very long.    </li>
            <li>The turbo mode is useful if you have a lot of hair you are getting rid of, but by no means a major factor.   </li>
            <li>The vacuum function is great - no more hair all over the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say the adjusment clicks for length of hair settings could be a little more positive.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum feature keeps the sink area clean and the turbo feature speeds up trim time.</li>
            <li>vacuum suction keeps the basin clean and it is a breeze to use.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think that the vacuum will keep your bathroom clean.  </li>
            <li>I have trimmed with scissors, rasors, the old cip on guard trimmers and the grandfather of this trimmer which just recently died after 7 years of service (not bad Norelco!).  </li>
            <li>My daughter says there is no unwanted hair in the sink, so that&#x27;s a big YIPPEE right there!</li>
            <li>Bigger than I thought, which makes it a little bit harder to use, but it works great!</li>
            <li>Works well, catches cut hair good, the only reason I did not give it a 5 was it is a little hard to use with the top off, working around the guard, other than that - very satisfied</li>
            <li>So far, the only issue is that the power control is a bit too easily activated when you are holding the unit in your hand, meaning that you can change your grip while trimming and accidentally turn the thing off.</li>
            <li>Finally I found one that is not cheap and offers a great trim.  </li>
            <li>I usually have to have the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; turned on for it to be really effective.</li>
            <li>This replaced an earlier Norelco whose battery finally gave up (+ it got dropped a couple of times...), and - for once - the replacement actually seems better than the original.  </li>
            <li>but I am not sure about that it seems to clip nicely whether the Turbo Mode is on or off.</li>
            <li>Its cool, it works, and its simple.......</li>
            <li>the T980 works EXACTLY like the old one</li>
            <li>I have a full beard and it does not pull my facial hair when I use it.</li>
            <li>My only real requirement was that it had to be able to be used corded OR cordless, for those times when you realize you shouldn&#x27;t look like a deadbeat just as you are about to walk out the door, only to find out that the unit needs charging!  </li>
            <li>The shaver also comes with a Turbo Mode but the only thing this really does that I have noticed is give the vacuum more power, it may also speed up the clippers</li>
            <li>but it could have had better vacuum, or at least it could have sucked in hair better.</li>
            <li>It is easy to use, it takes less time to trim my beard, and the results are a consistent even trim every time.     </li>
            <li>My old trimmer worked fine; only the battery needed replacing.  </li>
            <li>It might depend on your style of cutting,havnt tried from the top down to see if the vaccuum gets it all.</li>
            <li>Battery life seems pretty decent so far.  </li>
            <li>but I really wish that the spring on the belt clip was a little more robust.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is a true blessing.</li>
            <li>Seeing a good price here at amazon, I sprang for the Turbo model, which promised a little extra oomph.  </li>
            <li>Never has beard trimming been so easy and the vacuum feature leaves almost no mess on the sink.  </li>
            <li>I like my new look and the tool that keeps it that way !</li>
            <li>Well, only four months after receiving the new replacement trimmer, the whisker tray (aka \\&quot;hair collection chamber\\&quot;) has fallen apart, just like it did on my original defective trimmer.</li>
            <li>Norelco should send us out new trimmers, guys!</li>
            <li>Only idiosyncrasy is that the control turns the clipper on a little too easily, so anything in the suitcase can easily turn it on.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer is pretty good, it vacuums up most of the loose hair when I trim my beard and leaves little mess.</li>
            <li>It was really a win-win situation - he needed a new trimmer</li>
            <li>Costs as much to replace the pack as a new trimmer.  </li>
            <li>When my old beard trimmer conked out after a half dozen years, I wanted a nice new one.</li>
            <li>Battery (still pretty new) holds a charge for a long period of time and recharges relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li>Easy to empty out collected hair.</li>
            <li>The flexible trim guard was something I immediately noticed and enjoyed, since my previous trimmer did not have this feature.</li>
            <li>It is a trustworthy, reliable product that performs much better than the Remington and Wahl I previously owned.</li>
            <li>He uses it more often than the one he had previously.</li>
            <li>this trimmer is  better than my Wahl and cost less    </li>
            <li>I grew a goatee a couple of years ago and was using what I thought was a decent groomer.  </li>
            <li>I had the older model of this trimmer and now after years needed to upgrade, so I have no problems with this product and will continue to buy this name brand</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer as an upgrade to my older T900 model.</li>
            <li>The older model had a removable tray.  </li>
            <li>I purchased it to replace an older Norelco for my husband.  </li>
            <li>Like many of the reviewers here, I was actually seeking an overall body hair trimmer when I came across the Norelco T980.</li>
            <li>This model is easier to use and much more substantial with a longer lasting battery than a competing model I bought several years ago.  </li>
            <li>For 5 years, I had an older Norelco model which still worked, but I was in need of an upgrade.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a decent product for the price and seems to work well.</li>
            <li>finally, the smaller attachment it comes with, I just love that one, thank god someone thought about creating it</li>
            <li>I cant speak for all men because all hair is different but speaking for most African Americans, it wouldnt work well.</li>
            <li>It allows for a nice range of beard lengths as long as you don&#x27;t want it too long.  </li>
            <li>if it&#x27;s like my last Norelco it should last many years.</li>
            <li>Why do we have to go sneaking around borrowing decent trimmers from our men or have to go to a salon to get</li>
            <li>Then after the trimming is complete I use a Straight Razor (DOVO Shavette Straight Razor</li>
            <li>I was used to my older Norelco with teeth which were not bendable, but dependable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Only thing is make sure you open the hatch over your garbage because it doesn&#x27;t slide out...</li>
            <li>but I found that on both this model and my old one, the teeth on the trimmer were too big for a comfortable close trim anyway, so I do not use that feature.  </li>
            <li>I had an older model that my son took to college</li>
            <li>Had an older version which used to spray hair everwhere.</li>
            <li>I did like the simplicity of my older model in just removing the hair comb to use the trimmer head for the detail work.  </li>
            <li>The main reason I chose the T980 over the T765 is that it can be operated from the plug.</li>
            <li>After a few months of use (1-2 times a week), I developed my own pro&#x27;s con&#x27;s for the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>All in all a decent trimmer but could be quieter</li>
            <li>In particular, when &#x27;Turbo&#x27; mode is on, it sounds like a mini-buzz-saw.  </li>
            <li>-Particular</li>
            <li>Bought this to replace my older model.  </li>
            <li>but, I thought it would work as well as the older model.</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer in March 2009 to replace an older Norelco T770 model trimmer whose battery was dying.  </li>
            <li>It looks and feels sturdier than the older T770.    </li>
            <li>Luckily it does have a 2 year warranty and Philips/Norelco has been terrific at replacing them.</li>
            <li>The reason I chose this particular one, is that it vacuums up the bits of beard rather than finding them in the sink.  </li>
            <li>Having a regular shaver before I used to spend more time cleaning the space after myself than actually shaving.</li>
            <li>All of the reviews and articles that I read online pointed me to this particular grooming tool.  </li>
            <li>I keep my goatee pretty short, and my first time using this</li>
            <li>charges holds for decent amount of time.</li>
            <li>Comb stays in position (one of the older Panasonic could switch to a lower position under pressure).  </li>
            <li>you can also use it while it is plugged in, which you could not do with the older model trimmers.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s be realistic....</li>
            <li>Over all it was decent.</li>
            <li>The built-in vacuum may be the weakest part of it, but hey, it&#x27;s better than no vacuum at all.</li>
            <li>works very well and with a great deal less mess as the trimmer has a suction to keep the hair  from flying everywhere.</li>
            <li>I also agree that the vacuum is a waste, as unless it retains most of the hairs (which it doesn&#x27;t), you still have to clean up the sink.</li>
            <li>Only problem that I see with it, is the vacuum could work better.</li>
            <li>While not perfect, the vacuum feature on the T980 is wonderful.</li>
            <li>-Pro - Vacuum is significantly better than on their last version.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend it and have purchased two of them; one for my main home and one for a vacation home.</li>
            <li>You just need to make sure to charge it after it arrives, because it is sort of weak (very powerful, especially with the TURBO BUTTON, but not as powerful).</li>
            <li>If Norelco could change the design of the trimming area to eliminate the hinged door design -- say a small cup that you snap out and empty instead -- then this product would be flawless and guaranteed to last for years.  </li>
            <li>It vacuums most of the hair, but he still has to stand over the sink because of the mess it makes.</li>
            <li>its very loud !  </li>
            <li>One note: The hair \\&quot;reservoir\\&quot; under the vacuum fills up quickly,</li>
            <li>After a quick look thru the internet I soon discovered this vacuum feature was a rarity.</li>
            <li>And then there&#x27;s a Turbo button that doubles the already adequate force of the vacuum&#x27;s suction so that you can give yourself that wind-blown look if you so choose.    </li>
            <li>super vacuum.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better to trim the beard dry not wet.</li>
            <li>The vacuum works better when you use the turbo vacuum.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>maybe the truth is that *I* am paying a high price for my laziness regarding cleaning up post-shave whiskers off the sink myself, vs. having a lower-quality trimmer with a vac function.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this trimmer for both</li>
            <li>I highly recomend this trimmer...</li>
            <li>and I was looking for a high quality trimmer.     </li>
            <li>I purchased this product for my boyfriend who happens to have high standards for beard/hair trimmers.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this trimmer to anyone.</li>
            <li>I would highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li>Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li>Over all I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li>But then again, I would guess that product longevity does not rise high on the list of marketing features.</li>
            <li>He would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>So long as it&#x27;s kept clean, it&#x27;ll keep working.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature really does work, and the waste receptacle is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The power on button went off many times when traveling, due to the fairly sensitive button being flush with the shaver.</li>
            <li>He feels he does a better job with his old, non-electric razor and a sharp pair of scissors.</li>
            <li>so I had to wait for it to charge for a little while just to be able to finish up.  </li>
            <li>The only thing about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s bigger, pretty significantly, compared to the Wahl.</li>
            <li>There is a little brush for cleaning the trimmer that works OK.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature generates a little more noise and vibration.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is also more powerful than the previous Remington model I had.  </li>
            <li>Trimming is easy, the vacuum feature is very convenient, keeping your bathroom counter and sink hair-free, and the multiple trim settings is also a plus.  </li>
            <li>all over\\&quot; (even after I tried to clean up) -- so I returned that one and looked for a similar one to my old one.</li>
            <li>Pros:  Classic Design, Same quality and function, powerful vacum  </li>
            <li>Other than that,  &lt;br /&gt;the trimmer itself was easy to assemble (the ideographs on the instruction  </li>
            <li>It is easy to maintain because it does not require any lubrication and the blades are forever sharp.  </li>
            <li>The height adjustment can be easily set, and unlike other reviews mention, I haven&#x27;t accidentally changed the setting without knowing.    </li>
            <li>the vacuum action catches 95% of the hairs but 95% means you still have to clean up afterwards</li>
            <li>/&gt;Comparing the shroud around the cutters, its exactly the same size and looks very much like my old Norelco.</li>
            <li>Second, you have to clean the vacuum chamber really often, once every 10 seconds or so depending on the hair size!</li>
            <li>well, i had the older model of this trimmer for a couple of years now and decided it&#x27;s time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Vacuum:  worked great on regular power (non-turbo) mode, and let only a few hairs drop to the sink.  </li>
            <li>So far I really like the Panasonic, and I wish I had bought one of these to start with.......</li>
            <li>This unit replaces a T990 in which the battery died much too early.  </li>
            <li>So far this trimmer is holding up very well.</li>
            <li>So far, he hasn&#x27;t had to charge it much.</li>
            <li>Over all so far i really like the buzzer.</li>
            <li>My old Remington was not giving me the shave I needed, so I thought this razor would be much improved.</li>
            <li>Absolutely no pinching or pulling, just smooth and efficient.  </li>
            <li>I am surprised they sell this seriously as real product that can cut hair.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the remington mb-300, which is much like the old norelco</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really tempted to pay the $30 it will cost to restore my old T-3000.</li>
            <li>setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexible blade housing pivots smoothly and covered the contours of my face very well with an even cut at several different lengths.  </li>
            <li>and because it was over 4 years old figured the battery did not have much life in it.</li>
            <li>Much improvement over the old way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not so sure about the hair chamber as the old one I had had a removable hair chamber, this one only actually has a door</li>
            <li>With so many reviews saying this trimmer suddenly shifted the trimming length, I debated a long time whether to buy it or not.    </li>
            <li>I cut from the bottom of my face going up and never had more than a few hairs that didnt get in the vaccuum.</li>
            <li>I feel I have definitely gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>For the extra 10 dollars this one costs, it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>and he was pretty adamant about getting the exact same trimmer</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say this trimmer is well worth your money.</li>
            <li>Cleaning is a breeze, since most of the hair is trapped.</li>
            <li>and I make sure it is firmly set on the length I want.  </li>
            <li>but it is better than a messy sink area.</li>
            <li>You have to use the mini-trimmer attachment, which works great but is on the small side (making it slightly more difficult to cut a straight line).</li>
            <li>I normally get 5 years of use out of them.</li>
            <li>Far better than similar units that use multiple guides that can get lost, damaged and require additional storage space.</li>
            <li>I am pretty much bald except for around the back and sides</li>
            <li>I normally don&#x27;t give out 5-star ratings for things, but I just can&#x27;t find anything to complain about and it exceeded my expectations on every function.</li>
            <li>The only gripe is that it&#x27;s loud, especially first thing in the morning, but it&#x27;s not a big issue to me.</li>
            <li>So we&#x27;d say that while it&#x27;s not perfect, it&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li>If we&#x27;re completely honest, we&#x27;ve been conditioned by manufacturers these days to accept rubbish without complaint.  </li>
            <li>There is little to no mess and the bettery life is amazing, love the travel ouch and small wal charger.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d prefer something more narrow.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s alot of fun when you realize that what you thought was length 3 has suddenly become a length 1 shave.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the first time I had a completely even shave--including my jawline and the vacuum works better than I expected.</li>
            <li>I have attempted to use this trimmer twice and both times have had to result to pulling my very old T7500 out of the drawer and using it to get a decent trim.    </li>
            <li>It slips down to the lowest setting making this effective only for a stubble look.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum action is great, and at least 90 percent of the trimmings make it into the reservoir.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is nice, the turbo is nice, but I got it because of the adjustable cutting length and the ease of use.</li>
            <li>Also, despite what many have written, I did not find the turbo vacuum to be excessively loud and the zoom length definitely *locked* into place at #3.  </li>
            <li>On my first one, the spring hold the door up broke allowing it to drop and lose much of the vacuum.   </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sure why I need to press 2 buttons to get the good vacuum speed.</li>
            <li>It has a nice vacuum feature but some hairs still escape the vacuum, but it&#x27;s beats cleaning up the entire sink!  </li>
            <li>I found the vacuum to be well worth while, to my surprise.  </li>
            <li>It might still be worth buying this model over the one $10 cheaper, because in addition to the vacuum, this model works plugged in when the battery is drained.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had a T900 trimmer for a few years now and wanted to upgrade to a new and hopefully better trimmer.</li>
            <li>My previous trimmers - also from Norelco- eventually developed battery problems when the battery did not hold charge any more.  </li>
            <li>Being that my previous Norelco trimmer (a T770) took 10 hours to fully charge, I greatly liked how the T980 took just 70 minutes to do the same thing.</li>
            <li>First of all, you can easily change the size adjustment during the usage, and you can end up with uneven beard/hair!</li>
            <li>Overall, its too big to easily hold.  </li>
            <li>The vacuuum feature is particularly nice - no more hair in the sink!</li>
            <li>I can have just the right length of trim that I want, in fact, I found that the shortest trim is a bit too short, it just gives the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow -</li>
            <li>It needs to have a setting lock or the dial in a different location than right where you hold it.</li>
            <li>I did the same thing you are doing right now.</li>
            <li>It does take a little training, but it is a great little tool.</li>
            <li>Some stray clippings \\&quot;escape\\&quot; even in turbo mode, but the vacuum captures enough to make it an easy cleanup.</li>
            <li>but it does so with a composure and aplomb that will sweep away the corporate fog and, suddenly, everything else you own will seem completely and utterly inadequate.    </li>
            <li>My wife got this for me it is a good trimmer and the vacuum works will unlike other trimmers I have owned where the vacuum makes noise but does not work...</li>
            <li>Even after spending considerable time, I still have the wild hair or two left that requires special attention.  </li>
            <li>I like the regular as well as the smaller blades for fine trimming.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had the same generic beard trimmer for 6 years now and it worked just fine</li>
            <li>After using the regular beard trimmers for years, I was pleasantly surprised to see NO mess of hair clippings to clean up from the counter.      </li>
            <li>The vacuum does collect most of the loose hair, but there is still a ton that makes it into the sink.</li>
            <li>On the \\&quot;turbo screamer\\&quot; setting, it was about even with the old one as far as pure decibels.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, fantastic.</li>
            <li>Mini trimmer blade is sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li>I think this is mostly due to the cheap plastic build.      </li>
            <li>Besides the fact that it&#x27;s a little bit loud. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li>The vacuum works well and the vacuum compartment is easy to empty and clean.  </li>
            <li>To my surprise the vacuum actually works pretty good - if you keep a bushy beard you&#x27;ll need to empty out the pouch a few times per trimming (it fills up pretty fast).</li>
            <li>When it died on me I thought \\&quot;well\\&quot; I&#x27;ll just get a new Wahl..</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s get with the new tech.</li>
            <li>The vaccum function is so-so, I could live without it.</li>
            <li>If you run out of power when in Europe (say) plan to have to take a AC adapter or buy a new adapter while overseas.</li>
            <li>Remington doesn&#x27;t have a new model, so I tried this one.  </li>
            <li>The Norelco trimmer that I bought around five years ago just died on me so it was time to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li>I just question the degree to which the new features are improvements.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had that issue with the new trimmer at all.    </li>
            <li>Shaving has always been one my life&#x27;s peeves and growing a beard was a way to avoid that but then trimming and upkeep became a new peeve.</li>
            <li>I will say, I placed an order for a new one the QT4070.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer to deal with the upkeep of a newly grown beard.  </li>
            <li>So when I decided it was time to replace my Wahl Vacu-Trim, which needed new blades and battery</li>
            <li>I wish there was a new trimmer just like this to eventually replace mine.</li>
            <li>I bought this one about 5 years ago and still like brand new.</li>
            <li>This is my second Norelco Vacuum Trimmer and as before, this one has been a fine product.  </li>
            <li>only issues I have had are the fact that this is not a duel voltage system and the design of the vacuum places the blades more towards the center of the head instead of right at the fromt.  </li>
            <li>Update: 5 years old, still like new!</li>
            <li>This unit has a handy little vacuum inside of it that gets almost all of the stray hairs.  </li>
            <li>little vacuum is nice, and collects a bunch of hair.. but don&#x27;t count on it to pick up everything.&lt;br</li>
            <li>- so it&#x27;s harder to clean out.</li>
            <li>The unit feels solid as a whole and also has a reasonable case</li>
            <li>Yes, there will be a few that don&#x27;t make it in, but by far, most of them get sucked into the chamber.    </li>
            <li>main drawback with the Norelco however is that with the adjustable guard off, it doesn&#x27;t provide nearly as close a trim as the Braun.  </li>
            <li>This may be a non issue for some buyers if they are only looking to trim longer hair, however it is a critical issue for me as I tend to use my trimmer as my primary shaver, and keep a seperate foil shaver for days I need a cleaner shave.</li>
            <li>I purchased this unit to replace a 7-year old Norelco trimmer (that had an integral main blade and an integral mini pop-up blade, but</li>
            <li>Only issue is a lack of different size attachments for beard length and cannot easily trim mustache directly under the  nose.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and the value I&#x27;ve recieved for the money spent.</li>
            <li>Further experimentation -- and another call to a male rep -- confirmed that I was using the trimmer correctly.  </li>
            <li>Further experimentation -- and another call to a male rep -- confirmed that I was using the trimmer correctly.  </li>
            <li>Even setting this thing on the closest setting (#1) the trimmer still sets back waaaaay too far from the guard to be useful.</li>
            <li>Unlike most trimmers, which require that you dig around to find the correct attachment in order to trim your left eyebrow now that you&#x27;re done with the right, nearly everything is built directly into this sleek little unit.  </li>
            <li>I really think the T980 is a major advance in technology over the proior model.  </li>
            <li>I really think the T370 does as good a job trimming as this one does, but will not run with a dead battery when plugged in, and does make a mess with beard clippings all over the place.  </li>
            <li>No one wants a mess to clean up with.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is a nice feature but the receptacle is not secure, sometimes sending hair flying everywhere.</li>
            <li>biggest complaints goes on the noise of the trimmer thanks to the vacuum and very unprecise cut of the beard</li>
            <li>It seems that the only vacuum beard trimmers available at this writing are the two models from Philips Norelco.  </li>
            <li>- The instructions are very clear about how to maximize a Ni-Cad battery&#x27;s life.    </li>
            <li>However, this product gets the job done much quicker and the sound is not annoying and unlikely to wake up someone else on the normal</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s why when I say it sucks, I mean that in the best of ways.     </li>
            <li>The downsides of this model are the hair suction action isn&#x27;t very strong and still drops hair, the hair holder is small and needs frequent emptying(maybe</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s quite easy to take apart to empty out the little hair-catch-all and clean trimmer attachments or swapping them out (comes with a fine-line trimmer).</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s very little mess and does a great job.  </li>
            <li>The Turbo Vacuum does work well, and the chamber is large enough to hold about two weeks worth of hair growth.  </li>
            <li>give you an additional smaller trimming blade for detail work on the moustache, but it isn&#x27;t built into the trimmer, so you have to remove the outer guard, remove the inner trimming blade, usually clean out all the hair, then attach the new trimming blade.</li>
            <li>It is also more comfortable on sensitive areas like my neck than other clippers I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li>The battery lasts a long time between charges and the trimmer is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li>It is still working off the original charge, using it about every other day.</li>
            <li>I usually leave the &#x27;turbo&#x27; on and find it vacuums most cut hairs.</li>
            <li>A minor problem is that it too easy to hit the vacuum button while you are trimming your beard.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t have a giant beard for my first shave</li>
            <li>No complaints thus far!</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for the past couple of years and just love it.</li>
            <li>This may work OK if you are trimming short guide settings, but if you get a clump of hair in the guide, which happens constantly with me, it will block the tiny opening for the hair cup.  </li>
            <li>Speaking from an African-American, the trimmer just doesnt give me that smooth trim i have with my current    \\&quot;Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>At first, people think this is some kinda sex-toy from the future.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t be disappointed, buy the best.</li>
            <li>First shave and my husband lost his short beard.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say much more raving about this without getting repetitive.    </li>
            <li>I wanted Braun-quality to match their stellar shavers (I&#x27;m on my third Braun shaver in twenty years of use), but they discontinued their beard trimmer.</li>
            <li>Most other trimmers only work when charged, not on house current.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The only criticism that I have is that the blade doesn&#x27;t work too well to do extreme details because of the bulkiness of the unit, but for me the rest of the package more than compensates for this.</li>
            <li>This is my second Norelco trimmer, the first was before Philips acquired Norelco.</li>
            <li>I know there are other big names in beard trimmers, but I am glad I chose the T980.  </li>
            <li>Easily fixed though I just pulled it out!</li>
            <li>Actually, I&#x27;m sure that if it was to cut more closely, that would take it into the realm of regular shavers, an expensive world of high-tech blades and lubricants.</li>
            <li>When this happened to the first trimmer, I had the battery replaced locally; the replacement battery did not hold a charge as well.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t recall the exact model number for the Panasonic, but something similar to the ER389K or ER205.  </li>
            <li>Since then I have bought three more Norelco trimmers and they have all broken after a fairly short time and under quite light use.</li>
            <li>The instructions never tell you which side of the trimmer to hold against your face, and the T980 works the opposite of most other trimmers and shavers.  </li>
            <li>I guess in that it doesn&#x27;t get too many little beard trimmings all over the sink, but then again it&#x27;s really easy to just turn on the sink and rinse it, or, use the trimmer over a rug where you&#x27;ll never see the small trimmings.....</li>
            <li>Also, they improved the compartment that    Catches the hair with a little door that opens for easy disposal.</li>
            <li>I bought this unit, a little concerned about some of the reviewers who said the length adjustment changed too easily.  </li>
            <li>I little drawer pulled out that you could easily dump out in the basket and wash out if desired.    </li>
            <li>The only thing that could be a bit better is the regular speed vacuum misses some clippings when being rushed through the clipping of your beard, but I guess thats why they made this clipper with a &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The T980 does as good a job as my old one with one exception-the safety shield makes it a little more difficult to trim the edge of my mustache.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum on it is impeccable and literally sucks up every hair!</li>
            <li>The charge seems to last for days and the charger itself, like the shaver, is a decent and modern design.    </li>
            <li>Since there is no base its tempting to just lay it down anywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The vacuum power of this model is much better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li>not the quality of a barber&#x27;s tool with a really clean, sharp cut.    </li>
            <li>The vacuum works pretty well.</li>
            <li>In fact, this is the first vacuum trimmer I have had that will catch almost every hair-</li>
            <li>The vacuum works pretty well, but don&#x27;t expect it to catch every hair.</li>
            <li>Only tried it once so far -- for beard trimming -- but it&#x27;s very promising.    </li>
            <li>When the vacuum part is backed up, it blocks hair from entering the blades, forcing you to clean it several times per trimming session.  </li>
            <li>Power and battery life are fine, the vacuum feature is strange.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting a good trimmer with less mess.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to the vacuum feature but doesn&#x27;t work particularly well for me.  </li>
            <li>I really like this trimmer, it trims my beard evenly in much less time then my last trimmer, and while it does not pick up ALL the hair that falls, it picks up enough to make clean-up very easy.</li>
            <li>Only thing I feel is that the construction is not as solid as it appears specially when you hold it.</li>
            <li>it took a trim or two to get used to the new settings from my old trimmer</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nearly two weeks, and I still haven&#x27;t seen hide nor hair of the new shaver.</li>
            <li>just lets hair jam up against the blades, which again makes for a less comfortable trim.  </li>
            <li>My one observation is that the moustache trimmer attachment seems less precise than the one on the T900</li>
            <li>Precise, Reliable, long lasting battery,</li>
            <li>It turns out cheap flimsy plastic does not last long.</li>
            <li>Also, this amazon price of $39.95 is $20 less than on the Norelco website, plus you get free shipping.</li>
            <li>I suspect that buyers who are having trouble with this feature have longer beards, and longer hairs might not be caught as easily.    </li>
            <li>The old one never failed, I simply plugged it into the wall on a trip to Europe during a lapse in judgment.     </li>
            <li>Also, I noticed far more skin irritation using this product than any past trimmers.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it about once a week for the past 4-5 months and have been extremely satisfied so far.  </li>
            <li>I have a full beard, and have been using this trimmer several times a week for the last couple of years or so.</li>
            <li>It would be nice to have a slightly more powerful vacuum, but I realize it&#x27;s difficult to get the hairs that are trapped in a beard.</li>
            <li>After trying this trimmer Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, it is very similar to Remington MB-300/200 with the added vacuum, less noise, much more powerful motor!</li>
            <li>the trimmer does a good job of trimming like so many other trimmers but its vacuum function only sucks in 50% of the hair on turbo!</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re not terrible, but most trimmers leave a mess, particularly with thick coarse beards like mine.  </li>
            <li>Smaller trimmer involves removing regular trim head:  People who complained about having to change trim heads must be in a much more significant hurry than I am in the morning.  </li>
            <li>Although not flawless this is hands down the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li>I have normal hearing and do not find the trimmer overly loud even in the turbo mode which for me is the only mode that I use as both the cutting and vacuum features work best at high speed and battery life</li>
            <li>(which is what I always used on my old Norelco T7500 to keep it nice and tight) is the equivalent of setting 7 or so (which is fairly long) on my old trimmer</li>
            <li>I would certainly recommnend the new Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.</li>
            <li>For all other purposes and general grooming it is fine</li>
            <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full five stars is that it doesn&#x27;t vacuum up all the beard trimmings.  </li>
            <li>If you trim very very slowly, the vacuum feature does a pretty nice job of picking up probably 80-90% of the trimmed hair.</li>
            <li>Not the clunker my wife had purchased for me six years ago that pulled hairs, kept my sink a mess, and looked cheap.</li>
            <li>so I usually use it a few times a week and so far it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;95% mess free.   </li>
            <li>But it is not 100% mess free as the package and the manufacturer suggest.</li>
            <li>The item comes with different heads, one of which will give you a wide range of length adjustments that are easily switched between.  </li>
            <li>The hinged trimming receptacle is easy to open and empty.  </li>
            <li>you end up dropping less hair below you, but over a bigger radius, so it makes more mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Finally, having to manually change out the trimmer head to trim your mustache, ears, etc is a pain, and really not all that easy.</li>
            <li>I have an previous Model of the same company trimmer and that is better than this.</li>
            <li>The chamber would fill up so quickly and I could only get what I needed after several passes in turbo mode.</li>
            <li>Decent settings, decent battery life, turbo button is required - and not an option but the reason I gave it two stars is because it simply cannot do the mustache area because the prongs hit my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>people say that the Turbo is too loud, which is why they offer an option I suppose, but in our house the bathroom is far enough away and well-insulated enough that no one can hear it running full blast.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The blade works great and the trimmer piece is very sharp which helps for precise cutting.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is weak at best, and left me cleaning up almost as much hair from my counter as my previous, non-vacuum trimmer.  </li>
            <li>It has a narrow head for fine trimming.  </li>
            <li>Speaking of the turbo setting, it&#x27;s a neat idea, but the vacuum on this one works so much better than the previous one on \\&quot;normal,\\&quot; in practice</li>
            <li>Vacuum does pick up lots of beard/stache clippings and it&#x27;s easy to empty clippings,too.  </li>
            <li>I usually use setting 1 for a close, stubble plus a little more look, and then shave my neck clean.</li>
            <li>The head is large enough that it does get cumbersome up under the nose.  </li>
            <li>This is my second Norelco Vacuum trimmer and this new design is fantistic while on turbo power rarely see any cut hair on counter or in sink.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature saves a lot of cleaning up time, and I am free of the irritations caused sometimes by a single hair.</li>
            <li>Only had it short while, but so far it has proved simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li>All of this said, I&#x27;ve used a few other trimmers in the past and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li>I had used other brand trimmers in the past and this is by far superior.</li>
            <li>One minor problem one must clean the trimmer after each use and to take apart and to put back together</li>
            <li>This one gets hung up sometimes, but if I go slowly and don&#x27;t try to cut too much at once, it works fine.     </li>
            <li>Love the vacuum feature - keeps mess to a minimum.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;-i noticed the vacuum and quickly tried the vacuum, which can not be turned off, and the vaccum did not pull all the hair, but maybe 80% of the hair.  </li>
            <li>Like many other reviewers, I experienced the annoying nuisance of the trimmer length setting decreasing with normal pressure applied while trimming.</li>
            <li>I agree the case is a bit lame; it could be more rigid or padded, but if you travel with it, just roll it up inside an item of clothing and it will very likely survive just fine.  </li>
            <li>When the blades get dull eventually, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy another just like it.</li>
            <li>so there is a greater chance the clippings will get on the floor as it is hard to blow it out and aim the refuse.      </li>
            <li>The blades are sharp and cut quickly without hassle or pulling on the beard.  </li>
            <li>It is easy enough to superglue it back together, but it is a design flaw that you must grab the cup right at the seam in order to open it and empty it.  </li>
            <li>Anyway, the vacuum part of it certainly works well.</li>
            <li>However, recently the removable hair catching unit got stuck and, when I pulled too hard, the plastic broke.</li>
            <li>The blades are very sharp which has resulted in cleanly cut whiskers.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t care for the hard body, but there is a nice rubber ring (used to change the cutting depth) that makes a good grip point.</li>
            <li>The vacuum could be a little better.  </li>
            <li>The little vacuum works for the most part.  </li>
            <li>While this item is not 100% spotless after a trim, the clean up takes less than a minute.  </li>
            <li>Anyhow, the sink clean up afterwards takes a lot less time.  </li>
            <li>Others have stated quite clearly it&#x27;s benefits, which I fully agree with.    </li>
            <li>It literally catches about 90% of the hair, so there&#x27;s way less to clean up after.  </li>
            <li>A lot less to clean up around the sink.</li>
            <li>Nowhere in the instructions do they show a clear photo of a guy using the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I love how it sucks up the hair.</li>
            <li>I had devised all sorts of ways to alleviate the clippings problem and none solved it completely.  </li>
            <li>I was replacing an old conair that wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  </li>
            <li>My plan is to now get a much simpler version of this type trimmer and go back to trimming as I have always done it.</li>
            <li>But I see no reason to use it with Turbo off because then it&#x27;s just like the old underpowered version.</li>
            <li>and I think I could have gotten at least one more.  </li>
            <li>far I&#x27;ve had four shaves off the one charge</li>
            <li>So those of you that got the old fashioned NiCad batteries, they&#x27;ve updated it since then.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s bound to be loud.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile the beard trimming functions have worked well so far.  </li>
            <li>and/or there was a lock switch to lock the trimmer off completely when traveling.</li>
            <li>if you turn your hand too far over, the hairs will start to spill out - that&#x27;s happened twice in the eight times</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it so far.</li>
            <li>After 6 plus years it was time to replace my old Wahl.</li>
            <li>Was looking online for a solid trimmer for detailing my goatee, and after much research settled on the Norelco T980 Turbo Vac Trimmer.</li>
            <li>I keep my hair very short and this trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li>This replaces my old Norelco trimmer of 5 years.</li>
            <li>Once I figured out how to use it properly, however, it worked fast to trim my beard and mustache.  </li>
            <li>This thing actually works really well.</li>
            <li>beard trimmer is really the only way to go.</li>
            <li>I purchased the T980 after my old Norelco died and I found they no longer made it.  </li>
            <li>This trimmer works well, i always use it on turbo mode just because it cuts and sucks more hair.</li>
            <li>So far, I have not had to charge it</li>
            <li>I cut the bulk of his hair with our Oster clippers, but I thought the Norelco was much easier to handle for detail work (i.e. shaping, sideburns, back of the neck).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d used my old trimmer for over 3 years with no problems whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>depth adjustment on the T980 does have a slightly soft \\&quot;click\\</li>
            <li>&quot; as definitively as the old one ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I used to use my old trimmer to trim my mustache, but I&#x27;ll probably use the trimmer on my shaver for that now</li>
            <li>The turbo is a bit loud but trust me its not the end of world.</li>
            <li>My old T965&#x27;s battery gave up after 4 faithful years of service.  </li>
            <li>being said, I still LOVE this trimmer and would buy it again, but be careful when you are emptying out the cup and possibly think about only opening it over the trash can just in case.</li>
            <li>Continue using it until the battery is completely empty\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>Well to sum it up, about halfway into it I was surprised with a slip to level 2.     </li>
            <li>The old version was an AccuVac T870.    </li>
            <li>I got another trimmer to replace the old one</li>
            <li>The old one took 12 hrs.</li>
            <li>and I used it that way at times which may have compromised the battery for the old one.</li>
            <li>My bf loves it -- he threw away his old one.</li>
            <li>It also sucks up the hairs better than I&#x27;ve ever seen it.</li>
            <li>Not as loud as people are saying on here.</li>
            <li>It needs to be emptied after each use, naturally.</li>
            <li>some others have mentioned it being way too loud-</li>
            <li>in my opinion its not too loud.  </li>
            <li>(I don&#x27;t know why some referred to unexpected changes in that regard.</li>
            <li>They normally last reasonably well.</li>
            <li>many have complained about the height adjustment changing on them...</li>
            <li>I can add that for me, none of the settings match my old Remington.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it so far.</li>
            <li>I believe it&#x27;s an old style battery</li>
            <li>I purchased this trimmer nearly 6 years ago and it has served me well.</li>
            <li>I put it to use nearly every day of ownership.</li>
            <li>I can use the battery to complete depletion and then finish the trim using the cord.  </li>
            <li>If I had my choice, at this point, I would have preferred to stick with the old one (it was worn out).</li>
            <li>Works well enough, but doesn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li>the shaver&#x27;s really loud.  </li>
            <li>Needs frequent charging:  </li>
            <li>so     far.</li>
            <li>This battery is about shot and the trimmer is getting old</li>
            <li>Old one was a 270, el cheapo</li>
            <li>Earlier version had removable cup which seemed much easier to use.  </li>
            <li>I bought this trimmer after my old Norelco stopped charging.</li>
            <li>This problem would not happen with a fixed blade trimmer.</li>
            <li>Just like my old T760 that I had for 5-6 years, you adjust the guard by twisting the zoom lock till you see the numbered setting you want.</li>
            <li>You become attached to the weight and feel of a trimmer and losing an old friend</li>
            <li>You can save time by forgoing the retail search and buying direct from Amazon.</li>
            <li>That only happens if you&#x27;re REALLY pressing this thing into your face, and there&#x27;s no need for that unless you&#x27;re Sasquatch.  </li>
            <li>You get a complete package of accessories too.</li>
            <li>The length adjustment does not snap into place like my old Norelco trimmer and will shift while you are shaving.</li>
            <li>When the battery no longer takes a charge, as with my old trimmer, the trimmer will not run even when the cord is plugged in.  </li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t see any Norelco trimmers comparible to my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Too big, too much bling.  </li>
            <li>But the quality of its trimming is far below that on my Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li>I got this for my 22 year old boyfriend.</li>
            <li>Works well as far as trimming your beard is concerned but the suction system isn&#x27;t as thorough as advertised.</li>
            <li>enough so that I really miss the sense of control and precision</li>
            <li>I have also been using it on the back side of head now too, cuz the hair gets really bushy there</li>
            <li>Because these buttons are where the fingers naturally sit to hold the trimmer</li>
            <li>I tried a Wahl to replace my 8 year old Norelco Maverick.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace and old Wahl vacuum-style trimmer I had for years.</li>
            <li>So far after a couple of weeks I can&#x27;t complain about this unit.</li>
            <li>The result is always neat and professional looking.</li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace a 3.5 year old Norelco T990 when its batteries died.</li>
            <li>Many people complained that these either shifted or fell off.  </li>
            <li>If it is too loud, you are too picky.  </li>
            <li>It still misses some of the cut hairs, but it does catch nearly all of them.</li>
            <li>My old trimmer died.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li>it closed, because you need to be able to open it.&lt;br /&gt;2)The spring-loaded trimmings hatch stuck open, and lost its spring.</li>
            <li>/&gt;5)The turbo is LOUD.</li>
            <li>/&gt;-Turbo does not seem too loud at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this electric razor when my old Phillips Norelco razor died on me.</li>
            <li>It does not get every hair but nearly all.  </li>
            <li>Even though it may be fairly loud</li>
            <li>WELL worth the money I spent for it.</li>
            <li>It also has a turbo option, but is already powerful enough on its standard setting to do the job.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s solid, powerful and holds a charge through several trimmings.</li>
            <li>Good product, but seems expensive.  </li>
            <li>i still get hair in the sink, though a little less.... not really a big difference from the old model but an amazing feature!  </li>
            <li>The vacuum wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected, since it still misses a few hairs.  </li>
            <li>I keep my beard pretty short and the vacuum under normal power does the job.    </li>
            <li>Still - there&#x27;s definitely LESS left over for me to clean up after he trims his beard!</li>
            <li>I had a crappy old vacuum beard trimmer by Remmington that I replaced because It would never trim evenly, even if I really really tried, I&#x27;d always end up with a bald spot on my chinstrap</li>
            <li>The vacuum is definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>so I think its worth the extra money for the vacuum.   </li>
            <li>vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch enough hair for it to be worth all of the inconveniences of its design flaws.</li>
            <li>I let it drain the battery until it indicated it was time for a charge (neat new flashy light thingy does that), but it let me use the trimmer for full trim (I do my head and my beard) about 6 - 7 times before it needed to be re charged.    </li>
            <li>This is quite an improvement as far as vacuuming almost all the tiny hairs, which is to say, Norelco finally got the speed right.</li>
            <li>I say unfortunately, because the vacuum actually works pretty good when the unit is new.</li>
            <li>The vacuum really works and emptying is a breeze.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really follow the vacuum or turbo descriptions but bought it anyway based on price.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really need the vacuum however.   </li>
            <li>Really appreciate the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li>I purchased the Philips Norelco 7980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer a couple of weeks ago and really like it.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum really works but you gotta have turbo on.  </li>
            <li>My real issue is the vacuum shield gets in the way while I trim my beard.</li>
            <li>I really like the Turbo Vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum works very well, and the cut is even with NO pulls on my hairs.</li>
            <li>It collects all the trimmings very well, and does not leave lots of stray hairs on my shirt.[[ASIN:B000FED5D0 Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer]]</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ll still need to trim over a sink or trash container, which really takes away from the advantage of having the vacuum (even on the Turbo setting).  </li>
            <li>The vacuum does work really well, and the noise does not bother me -as</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t really care about the vacuum function you might want to keep in mind that trade off.  </li>
            <li>My sink drain and my wife are quite grateful with the vacuum, the cat not so much.</li>
            <li>However, cleanup is much much easier than it would be without any vacuum</li>
            <li>The vacuum works very well.</li>
            <li>The vacuum didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li>Not to mention that the vacuum is much stronger on this newer model also.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum really works.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature was much appreciated.  </li>
            <li>But the vacuum feature tends to obscure your view of the blade edge making it much trickier to aim the thing at your beard&#x27;s edge while looking in the mirror.</li>
            <li>I really like the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li>It trims well and the vacuum really works.</li>
            <li>but yes the vacuum really works.</li>
            <li>And the vacuum feature works really well.</li>
            <li>My son appreciated the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer!</li>
            <li>a major difference in this model compared to the old one - you can use it connected to the outlet!  </li>
            <li>After one day of use the blue piece that gathers the hair into the vacuum broke right off.</li>
            <li>It has an integrated vacuum that pulls out more than 90% of the mess!  </li>
            <li>Strong battery, at least new.</li>
            <li>and even then I&#x27;ll have to clean both the sink and the little transparent bin</li>
            <li>This Norelco shaver works well if there is not much hair to remove; however, if one is shaving a substantial amount of hair, it takes several passes to clean it up.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone through several other beard trimmers, and was very excited about the features this one provides: adjustability, turbo vacuum, EASY-adjust, ability to use corded</li>
            <li>Cordless feature is great to trim in shower and not make a mess in bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;The bells and whistles such as turbo power and vacuum chamber are more annoying than useful.</li>
            <li>The trimmer works reasonably well, and the vacuum on the high setting (why did they bother with a low?) gets almost all the hair.  </li>
            <li>My only complaint about the unit is that the button is very easily depressed when it&#x27;s in the case.  </li>
            <li>Products works great with only a few small issues.    </li>
            <li>I like this razor because it has a long lasting battery, which makes the whole process much easier.</li>
            <li>I use it also to buzz cut my hair and there is virtually no mess now</li>
            <li>I trimmed the Fuzz and it made no mess whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>By now, he&#x27;s used it all around the house, and still no mess.</li>
            <li>It is a bit bigger than my old small Wahl, but it has more features that require that.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t see why hair should get trapped under there, but it does and reduces the trimming ability significantly.</li>
            <li>now there is no mess.  </li>
            <li>no mess.</li>
            <li>I had no mess from when I did trim it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve owned this quite a few years now, and it&#x27;s still going on the original battery.</li>
            <li>They said they&#x27;d send a new one out and that I should just put the old one back in the same box, apply the PP label they&#x27;ll include and drop the whole enchilada in the mail.</li>
            <li>Its various settings are easy to work with, give you enough range for whatever length you&#x27;re looking for, and the closest setting will give you the short stubble length that is very short.     </li>
            <li>, it had a lot more positive reviews than negative and it was the most expensive trimmer on amazon at the time</li>
            <li>The decibel level of the vacuum should not bother any red blooded man who enjoys going to sporting events and screaming at the top of his lungs, or watching a dragster blast down a quarter mile in 4 seconds.  </li>
            <li>Finally, while the adjuster ring generally performs well, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;click\\&quot; at the right spot in the low number range.</li>
            <li>It shaves cleanly and hasn&#x27;t given me any trouble.  </li>
            <li>The battery only lasts for about three shaves (maybe less considering how many times you have to go over the same patches to get everything even).</li>
            <li>Although the mechanics look the same this one felt like it delivered a smoother shave than my older model.</li>
            <li>The only thing that I don&#x27;t like as much as an older model of this trimmer that I had is that it has a hinged door to remove the clippings from the trimmer.  </li>
            <li>I used my T980 about 2 to 3 times a week for a fast trim and did not need to re-charge it since I first got it, which was a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li>The back of the trimmer guide looks odd, but it works fine.  </li>
            <li>In other words, if you travel, you can&#x27;t charge this trimmer in most other countries.</li>
            <li>The height adjustment doesn&#x27;t seem quite as pronounced as my older Norelco trimmer (meaning you can obviously tell when it clicks into place...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend starting on a higher length setting and adjusting it shorter until it cuts at the desired length.</li>
            <li>The button to operate the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature (totally unnecessary) is extremely cheap and came off the first time I pressed it.</li>
            <li>Unfortunately, I have no faith that this one will perform and hold-up any better than the first.</li>
            <li>The T-980 is larger around and heavier than the older unit...</li>
            <li>The beard cutting is very uniform, seems to be plenty of height adjustment settings, and about 95% of the trimmings magically got sucked into the little chamber instead of all over my bathroom counter, which is a huge boost for my marriage!  </li>
            <li>(the little metal rod under the head that spins to move the blades back and forth) to solve a decrease in performance, but this is easily done by turning on the trimmer and poking with the brush provided until the hairs come out.</li>
            <li>As advised in the operating manual, I started with a longer length and worked my way down to a setting that fit what I wanted by simply turning a dial.  </li>
            <li>Since this model is no longer available, (I would have bought it again), and since Remington, no longer offers a vacuum trimmer for some odd reason, I had to look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li>Not bad, but a little pricey.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li>trimmer might be the best compromise of cost / features / functionality out there, but was disappointed with the vacuum capabilities even on Turbo.  </li>
            <li>It has the vacuum and a extra Turbo function that your first time you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s going to pull off all the hair.</li>
            <li>The other reviews are right about the turbo mode, though.</li>
            <li>What little the vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch is easily wiped with a sponge.  </li>
            <li>Because of the vacuum, you cannot do close trimming with the main head and switching heads is a pain.  </li>
            <li>Bought this to replace an older model Norelco trimmer without a vacuum function.  </li>
            <li>I bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer because the older version I had died after about 3 years of use.</li>
            <li>I replaced an older model norelco vacuum trimmer with this one.  </li>
            <li>What a major upgrade it was!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;While the trimmer itself is a little bigger than most, it charges with just a power cord and has only one precision attachment.</li>
            <li>Vacuum: Like me, you may be interested in the included vacuum, rather than getting hair all over the place.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few years, and it&#x27;s held up to regular use and still going strong.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not too loud and for those very early morning trimmings you can turn the turbo off as to not disturb anyone who may be sleeping in the next room over.</li>
            <li>Anyway, hope to prevent people from having the same frustrations I have after spending $40 for something that could barely shave your head much less something a bit more technical, like your face!</li>
            <li>I just find the whole set up \\&quot;gimmicky\\&quot; and I will take the old standard guides and no vacuum any day.    </li>
            <li>I use the vacuum on the high setting.</li>
            <li>In short, I can find only positive to say about this trimmer</li>
            <li>A potential positive is not having to oil the blades, but only if this does not shorten product life.   </li>
            <li>My only complaint would be that the settings are very easy to change mid shave (as some have pointed out) and you can very easily have an uneven beard if you arent careful.</li>
            <li>to long (9), works really well.</li>
            <li>The zero feature makes it look like you shaved that morning and the stubble has just barely started to grow in, and if you wanted to be completely hairless</li>
            <li>but the charge lasts so long it really isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li>Just through normal wear, it is time for a replacement, but I will keep my current one as a backup.    </li>
            <li>Also, just be sure to open the window and chuck out some hair along the way (few times only).</li>
            <li>Last but not least, watch out for the settings.  </li>
            <li>Overall, this is a good but not great personal appliance.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s an ok trimmer, nothing bad per say, wish it had a bit more vacuum.  </li>
            <li>No, the vacuum doesn&#x27;t pick up everything, but it makes clean up much much less bothersome than the old trimmer I used.    </li>
            <li>The vacuum intrigued me -- would it really be worth the extra $20-25 over a standard trimmer?</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve tried quite a few, and this one is pretty decent.    </li>
            <li>I use the # 2 length setting, and thats just right for a stubble - just enough to feel, but too short to actually grip any of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>For the guys who are able to keep their beards a little longer this is probably not much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I had a few reservations due to other comments about the settings changing mid trim but after watching the great video review posted on here decided to go for it.</li>
            <li>It takes me much less time to trim my beard and cuts much better than any other trimmer I have tried.  </li>
            <li>I have to say in some ways I don&#x27;t like it as much as the plain Norelco trimmer it replaced, but I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars because the main reason I bought this, for the vacuum, works very well.  </li>
            <li>: it provides an even cut in difficult areas, it is light and not noisy, and the vaccum works better than in other models I tried.</li>
            <li>The vacuum captures most (but not all) of the hair trimmings, it has a wide range of length settings, and battery holds a charge for a long enough time that it has never been a bother.</li>
            <li>and I am only leaving this review as I am on Amazon looking for a new one.</li>
            <li>It was exchanged when I returned and the new one seems to work properly.</li>
            <li>the new plastic guide is bigger on this one.</li>
            <li>I decided it was finally time to just go for it and get a new one, and based on the reviews of this trimmer I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely the trimmer to get if you&#x27;re in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li>but because the overall trimmer function has worked well for over four years decided to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li>The only reason I purchased a new one is the charger broke</li>
            <li>The major complaints I had with all of these products were that a) they pulled my beard hair and hurt and b) were very messy and not at all precise.  </li>
            <li>Does a clean job of cutting, vacuums cut hair up  well, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>The trim time takes less than one minute, and only seconds to clean the razor.</li>
            <li>The vaccum feature sucks all the cut hair and is easy to wash, charge and carry in the provided pouch.</li>
            <li>i started running the trimmer first on my arms, which was not nearly as thick as face and noticed it was uneven after two runs.  </li>
            <li>but, at some point in the next several days, when it isn&#x27;t too much of a bother, could you please plug me in for a bit?\\&quot;  Nothing urgent about it whatsoever.  </li>
            <li>I would say as long as you shave in the proper direction (where the blade cuts first and the suction thingy follows)</li>
            <li>It holds a charge for a few weeks (based on using it 2 x week, 5 min each), recharges quickly, works with or without the cord.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum works much better than expected and the trimmer works without any pulling or biting like other trimmers.  </li>
            <li>Also, product arrived quickly, within a few days.</li>
            <li>Very fast with little (if any) cleanup required thanks to the built-in vacuum functionality.</li>
            <li>So, as a trimmer (used very frequently and with very short hair trimmings)</li>
            <li>, no more \\&quot;little hairs all over\\&quot; -- of course a few leak out here and there, but I usually do a good enough job to keep my wife happy with a little wipe down around the sink, etc.</li>
            <li>i will note that if you are cutting off a lot of long beard hair it will miss more than if you do it regularly and trim short hair more frequently.</li>
            <li>And then I found the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, that has the close to skin blade trimmer attachment that is very useful in getting sharp edges of the style on your facial hair.</li>
            <li>When I had used a scissors to trim my beard, the results were just so-so and there was always a big mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is made so that there is less of a clean up</li>
            <li>I think because of the vacuum this trimmer seems a bit louder during operation than my last trimmer but by no means is it a chainsaw (haha).    </li>
            <li>The vacuum feature HELPS so much; much less to clean up on the sink afterwards.</li>
            <li>As for the vacuum part... it is a marked improvement over the old method of covering the sink with a towel or just wiping all the stubble off after trimming.</li>
            <li>The T980&#x27;s vacuum actually DOES work very well...</li>
            <li>The head is easily manipulated for different cutting lengths, as well as be removed for the fine trimmer.  </li>
            <li>Well, I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews!  </li>
            <li>This is not a big deal, properly seating the guard on the device is pretty simple.      </li>
            <li>What totally amazed me is after the first initial charge (following instructions)</li>
            <li>This is a major advancement in retail trimmers.</li>
            <li>major pros of this product:  </li>
            <li>This vacuum works very well; the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; vacuum setting is somewhat louder but does not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a little over a year, and prior to this I&#x27;d been using a similar product by Norelco, so I came to love the vacuum concept.  </li>
            <li>A full charge last me long enough for me to forget when was the last time I charged it</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s true that because of the vacuum, there is less hair in the sink.  </li>
            <li>The \\&quot;edging\\&quot; operation was a little less successful, but I think that new personal care products like this always take a little while to get used to.  </li>
            <li>I think this one cost less than my previous and has more features.</li>
            <li>I bought the T980 to replace my older model Norelco trimmer, which died after several years of regular use.  </li>
            <li>Overall, the trimmer has a lot of positive points (quiet, efficient, vacuum works well, etc)</li>
            <li>The storage pouch is a little weird, but I found I can fit both the trimmer and my electric razor in it without any problems, so all the better.    </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I spent the little extra.    </li>
            <li>the big lesson here is to be sure buy a wet/dry beard trimmer that won&#x27;t die if it gets a little wet.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is decent, but won&#x27;t keep the occasional stray hair from hitting the counter.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always heard that Norelco is the best, but the T980 turbo vacuum trimmer is a little disappointing.  </li>
            <li>In general I like Philips products</li>
            <li>I generally like the shave.      </li>
            <li>The hairs generally grow up toward the ear and this thing, on \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; or not cannot cut them.  </li>
            <li>Apparently this model has been upgraded to this unit:  </li>
            <li>My old one seemed to like to die occasionally when I wasn&#x27;t quite finished using it</li>
            <li>but I like my choice and have no regrets..             </li>
            <li>Not much to complain about, really.</li>
            <li>Philips has now replaced the old standard coiled power cords with specialized adapters.  </li>
            <li>Even with the guide off it could barely shave my beard.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this to replace my old Norelco, only because the batteries died and they could not be replaced.</li>
            <li>ive spent so much money on crappy shavers</li>
            <li>I guess I expected too much.  </li>
            <li>My old Remington had a built in mini-trimmer that flipped up on the back side - nothing to remove - just flip up and use.  </li>
            <li>That said, unless you&#x27;re worried about waking a sleeping baby in the same room, it&#x27;s not obnoxiously loud.    </li>
            <li>The only thing i would improve is a charge meter which was on the old version.</li>
            <li>I have not tried the Turbo mode since the regular setting works perfectly so far.    </li>
            <li>Speaking of the adjustable guide, check the setting often, or you&#x27;ll end up with a surprise...a much closer cut than you expected.</li>
            <li>Apparently, the thing was on backorder, but nobody at Phillips/Norelco Customer Service bothered to disclose that fact, nor did they provide a tracking number.</li>
            <li>I bought the T980 to replace my old T760, which has a similar shape and size.     </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it about seven or eight times so far and still haven&#x27;t recharged it from it&#x27;s initial charge.</li>
            <li>Never wet.</li>
            <li>Possible for pressure to turn on clipper when in soft case; it&#x27;s happened to me.  </li>
            <li>Of coarse buying a product from Amazon directly</li>
            <li>Never have I owned a more poorly designed device.</li>
            <li>All in all, the T980 works OK but not great.</li>
            <li>Good except the mustache trimmer requires changing the head blade, which can be inconvenient.</li>
            <li>I got this for my husband for Christmas, but it was more for me than for him because I was tired of cleaning up his beard hairs from around the sink when he was done trimming.  </li>
            <li>it sure doesn&#x27;t leave much behind to be cleaned up.</li>
            <li>it gets worse the more you use it.</li>
            <li>It does struggle a little bit with longer bushy hairs (as most do), but works like a champ when keeping previously trimmed ones in check.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is nice and makes cleaning up small jobs easier, especially since I don&#x27;t have to sweep hair off a wet sink afterwards.</li>
            <li>The blades on this are not very sharp, and the length adjustment collapses when in use.</li>
            <li>The vacuum part of it doesn&#x27;t work well unless its in &#x27;turbo&#x27; mode, and its not quite as loud as a blow-dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have used this trimmer for one month and was surprised at how well the trimmer and vacuum system work.  </li>
            <li>There&#x27;s a sliding plastic panel that I guess is there to help direct hair into the vacuum, but it makes trimming without the guide a bit of a pain.  </li>
            <li>Despite the vacuum action, whiskers collect in every nook and cranny.</li>
            <li>I can now trim my beard at the sink with a fraction of the cleanup that was required with my old trimmer that didn&#x27;t have a vacuum.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t expect the vacuum action to work so well.</li>
            <li>Two years later still don&#x27;t have the same features for new trimmers.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a bit loud, but it is a vacuum!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does leave a few hairs in the sink, but that&#x27;s expected with all trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li>The T980 comes with a 2 bristle (one soft, one hard) brush for cleaning out the clippers but what really is unique about this trimmer is the vacuum that is attached to it.</li>
            <li>I also had no mess when I used on my back.    </li>
            <li>Until then, save your money and use a regular shaver with replaceable trimming attachments and put down a paper towel to catch the hair.s design right.</li>
            <li>(my goatie had gotten long, waiting for a new trimmer)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty large, and the blades are set back about 1/2 inch from the edge, so it&#x27;s hard to get close in some areas (nose and ears).</li>
            <li>The new vacuum feature allows for the capture of only about 60-70% of the hair trimmed.  </li>
            <li>As it stands, I&#x27;m going to wait for this product to evolve a little further before purchasing from Norelco again -- unless a competitor comes up with an improved design first!</li>
            <li>the only problem i found is that it doesn&#x27;t gives you look like you have after doing a shave...which could be obtained by using other higher models of philips...</li>
            <li>Hair at the top of the upper lip is difficult to reach with the main trimmer, but put on the mini-trimmer attachment (which takes about 5 seconds) and it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li>I have tried several trimmers over the last ten years - Wahl, Panasonic, an older Norelco -</li>
            <li>and it is better than all the other trimmers he owned in the past.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little bulky, so getting the hairs under the nose takes just a little more effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The sideburn attachment is a little small to my liking which makes it had to get an accurate straight trim of sideburns.  </li>
            <li>So I bought it thinking they couldn&#x27;t possibly sell it at such a high price point with such an unsuitable battery.      </li>
            <li>This is somewhat frustrating, as one has to go over the same areas more than I used to with my old similar model.  </li>
            <li>And the vacuum, when using the turbo, gets all the hair; it leaves no mess at all.</li>
            <li>This trimmer is so much improved over the older trimmer that I had been using for the past couple of years.</li>
            <li>Main downsides: Made in China and has non replaceable battery, no removable hair chamber-only small door opens and have to shake whole trimmer over garbage can to get hair out.    </li>
            <li>Just to check this, I deliberately applied enough pressure on levels 2 and 3, hard enough to punch my face with it but the trimmer stayed at the selected level, did  not slid down to 1, probably i was not hammering it into my face as other guys did, lol.  </li>
            <li>I just trimmed my beard, which had grown out over the past two weeks, and amazingly, the sink below me only had a few pieces of hair in it.</li>
            <li>but since we&#x27;re triming hair and not a full lawn of grass it seems pretty</li>
            <li>I travel a lot for work and this tool is small enough to fit in my travel medicine bag along with my standard razor.  </li>
            <li>, you have to blow really hard on the comb in order to clean the path.  </li>
            <li>Normally when i trim my beard the bathroom counter is covered in hair which is annoying to clean, but with this buzzer about 85% of the hair gets contained in the buzzer and is easily emptied.  </li>
            <li>The batteries in some other devices (which use other chemistry) do not require any of these special maintenance routines to remember.</li>
            <li>Using it on a mustache is useless especially right underneath your nose.</li>
            <li>Brush falls out of small compartment in case (will be easy to loose it someday).  </li>
            <li>Cuts well enough, vacuum doesn&#x27;t really seem to work for me (I suppose it may be because I wait too long between trimmings).  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial real estate to cover, so I don&#x27;t have to empty it as often as others might.</li>
            <li>Well in today corporate world I&#x27;m really surprised when the product actually is what the advertisement say.</li>
            <li>So far, with my weekly usage I&#x27;ve only had to do 2 charges since the initial one.</li>
            <li>I bought this to replace a 5-6 year old similar version that finally gave out on me.   </li>
            <li>still has a tendency to go down a trimmer level while you shave if you&#x27;re not careful and put too much pressure on it.</li>
            <li>it got all but two little hairs the first time out..and the rest is history..</li>
            <li>the battery seems to hold its charge really well.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a cinch.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s noisy with turbo on, but certainly not in the same vicinity as a hair dryer.</li>
            <li>I was happily surprised that the vacuum feature actual does work.  </li>
            <li>However, I&#x27;m also not really seeing much benefit from the vacuum part.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;The vacuum is power and made more powerful over earlier models through the use of the \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; button that amps up the cutting power and vacuum power substantially.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I can think of is that I&#x27;d prefer finer granularity between settings, meaning I&#x27;d like to be able to trim at number 3 and 1/2 (3 is a bit too short for my linking, 4 a bit too long).</li>
            <li>&quot; right out of the box, but contrary to what I&#x27;ve read, it holds the setting at least as firmly as my old one.  </li>
            <li>No more damp toilet tissue wiping of the sink basin to clean up the clippings.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum is loud, but then again, it&#x27;s a vacuum</li>
            <li>I was left with a funny looking longer part of the mustache and looking like a dictator from the previous century which i will not name.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is gimmick that works more or less, but the recepticle can pop open without warning and dump lots of little trimmings everywhere.  </li>
            <li>Love the vacumn collection space as the mess leaves very little cleanup.</li>
            <li>This new trimmer is great so far, except for one feature: the vacuum system has a plastic sheath right infront of the trimmer teeth, and if you want to cut or shape your beard using the naked trimmer without the numbered head, it becomes difficult to gauge where the trimmer is cutting because of the obstruction.</li>
            <li>The vacuum and container make this a no mess beard trimmer, go from stubble to short hair by adjusting the guide.</li>
            <li>It gives a really neat trim and can get places with the additional smaller clipper than other trimmers I have used.</li>
            <li>Admittedly though I have only used the turbo vacuum on my person as I cant imagine a situation when you&#x27;d want less suckage... except to make this more stealthy when you have a few beers and decide its time to shave the cat...</li>
            <li>I am not a fan of the trimmer when you take the guard off, I still prefer my old Norelco for this, and I do wish it had a nose/ear trimmer also, but these are minor gripes.  </li>
            <li>I had an old norelco that lasted 10 years, but the internal battery only lasted about 3 minutes before i finally threw it out...</li>
            <li>This machine has a cool resevoir for hair- which makes cleaning up easier because it sucks in a lot of the hair.  </li>
            <li>So, I used it for the first time this AM, put the setting on 5 or 6, but after a few strokes on the beard, it reset itself to the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li>He said it is a handy little trimmer and works well, but it is rather noisy at regular speed and sounds like a small jet engine in his ear with the turbo on!</li>
            <li>I am so mad about trying to register for this trimmer for warranty service on the Phillips Norelco web page that I can&#x27;t actually say whether or not the trimmer is any good.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only had the Turbo Vacuum Trimmer for a few weeks, but my experience so far has been mostly positive.  </li>
            <li>Sure the Trimmer has 9 different settings, but what they don&#x27;t tell you is that you&#x27;ll usually end up with a 2 every time unless you tape it down.</li>
            <li>Finally, it is not easy to remove the beard length piece to perform a close trim right above the lip.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be returning it and looking for a different vacuum trimmer with a battery that will be useful for longer than a few months.</li>
            <li>The only exception is a neat little detail trimmer that stands eternally at the ready in itsown clear and obvious pocket inside the travel pouch.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not any louder than any other electric razor I have tried (even on turbo), and it doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li>The turbo is not that loud (no significant difference between normal mode and turbo).</li>
            <li>I recall one guy saying he was pressing super hard</li>
            <li>The other brands that I used consisted of clip on guards, a single guard that slid to the proper length and in most cases never locked correctly giving an uneven cut.    </li>
            <li>I love that feature as my beard is grey and tough.</li>
            <li>First, the \\&quot;on\\&quot; and \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; buttons are too easy to push while handling, and I&#x27;m constantly startling myself with the turbo setting (it is a little loud).  </li>
            <li>This is my third Norelco trimmer, none of them seem to have much staying power, my other two had similar clogging issues with the blade, and both had the rechargeable battery die.</li>
            <li>The vacuum is also loud enough that it would wake up someone sleeping in the same room but not the next room.    </li>
            <li>With the vacuum set on low, I barely see any clippings now!</li>
            <li>The setting indicator is so small I need my reading glasses to insure I&#x27;ve got it right.</li>
            <li>In short, the T-980 feels clumsier, less maneuverable, and less accurate.</li>
            <li>This thing works well and it really does create much less hair in your sink.  </li>
            <li>I typically charge it while I am in the shower and then remove the charger to trim (it holds charge very well).</li>
            <li>My first, a Remington was at least 15 years old and worked like a champ.</li>
            <li>: I typically get several weeks worth of trimming (every 2-3 days) on a single charge.</li>
            <li>(while neat) doesn&#x27;t put up much resistance to being knocked down to the next setting.</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about the vacuum, but it really does the job keeping the bathroom clean.  </li>
            <li>the vacuum feature is pretty gimmicky.</li>
            <li>The unit is a little large, but not unwieldy.  </li>
            <li>but it doesnt leave you with a whole lot of mess.</li>
            <li>After leaving my beard a patchy mess I decided to just shave the whole thing.  </li>
            <li>The vacumn works great, which alone makes my purchase of it worthwhile to me; in the past the sink always had a lot of nasty looking hairs all over it.</li>
            <li>reviewers have complained about the noise but to me it seems about average as far as sound goes.  </li>
            <li>Really the only reason to replace my previous trimmer was that the battery no longer held a charge and the batteries are not replaceable.  </li>
            <li>You get a reasonable use time before re-charging, but ever now and again you will have a situation where your trimmer or shaver gets turned on while packed tight in your luggage - then you will be out of luck.</li>
            <li>Worked will at first then within the first couple months of ownership plastic parts began to fail, generally when the unit was being taken apart for regular cleaning.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle trimmer, it doesn&#x27;t suck up every single hair, but is a vast improvement over his old method.</li>
            <li>If you are in a bit of a rush and trim quickly, it will of course miss a few more hairs but manages to still suck up about 70% of what its cutting.  </li>
            <li>The fine tuning length control works well, although I recommend you always start a little long and work down.  </li>
            <li>For me the 2 is a little on the short side and 3 is a bit much.  </li>
            <li>and i understand this is not a vacuum cleaner, its a trimmer and as a matter of fact i dont even use turbo mode, its just not required.  </li>
            <li>The hair catcher was a cup that could be removed and be easily dumped into a waste basket; this model has a fragile door, the hairs do not easily come out or off of the filter and tapping the unit could damage it.</li>
            <li>The vacuum feature is good, keeps the mess to a minimum, but not perfect.  </li>
            <li>Also, due to the added bulk of the vacuum, it&#x27;s a little less precise than my old Norelco trimmer, which it replaced.  </li>
            <li>The vacuum feature works very well, leaving little to no cleanup.  </li>
            <li>My only problem is that when I try to trim my stash straight along my lip a little piece of plastic associated with the vacuum mechanism gets in the way.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d been wanting a trimmer with a vacuum option on it, so when I was buying some other new trimmers and shavers, I decided to get this one too.  </li>
            <li>The &lt;br /&gt;difference between a good haircut and a bad haircut is two weeks.</li>
            <li>Of course it would be great if it were completely silent, but really it&#x27;s not that bad.    </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it yet, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much advantage to it vs my old, clumsy trimmer.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s got a great design, from the curve of the device body, to the ease and access of the On/Off controls, and swap-able blade heads.</li>
            <li> And the vaccum works great with the beard trimmer and guard - 99% of hair winds up in the vaccum chamber.</li>
            <li> What a great product.  </li>

            <li> I purchased this for my husband not even a year ago and it worked great.  </li>
            <li> This is great.  </li>
            <li> The plastic trimmer guide which guides the blade thickness is not that great</li>
            <li> If you use some caution in how you hold it, it works great.  </li>
            <li> The rest is great.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great.  </li>
            <li> All in all it is great.</li>
            <li> The battery life is still great even with the age and thousands of uses.</li>
            <li> It functioned great plugged in or not.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, the design of this unit is well thought out and it is quite attractive.  </li>
            <li> This is an awsome trimmer at a great price.</li>
            <li> Suggested improvement - A stand would have been great</li>
            <li> The height adjustment is great too, those that complain about it moving out of the number need to stop smashing it into their face and keep their hand away from the adjuster.</li>
            <li> It works and is attractive.  </li>
            <li> The product itself is great and shipping went well.</li>

            <li> I LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> Sideburn accessory is very handy for keeping the &#x27;burns</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time, but for now it&#x27;s very nice, no pinching, no pulling.    </li>
            <li> The turbo function though a bit noisy, but very handy.</li>
            <li> The trimmer guide has 9 very precise trimming length settings  - I found a 5 setting perfect for a medium length beard.  </li>
            <li> Amazing!</li>
            <li> This thing is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> It still runs amazingly well with no maintenance!</li>
            <li> It is simply amazing!  </li>

            <li> My husband has tried many beard trimmers and he says this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li> I am a very happy and satisfied customer.</li>
            <li> It even has done a remarkable job maintaining its charge.  </li>
            <li> the best I&#x27;ve been able to find these days.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is awesome and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a beard for over twenty five years and have used many types of trimmers--plug-in, cordless, scissors, and this is the best yet.  </li>
            <li> The Philips has been in use a month and is remarkable.</li>
            <li> Have owned this for many years and functions perfectly!</li>
            <li> excellent value for money great product and very quick</li>
            <li> the trimmer is really good and very handy.</li>
            <li> I am very happy with the purchase and if you have a decently full beard you like to keep trim, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> The travel case is wonderful for easy storage.</li>
            <li> Feels great in your hand and trims amazingly well without shooting hair all over your bathroom.</li>
            <li> I think the trimmer does a good job trimming evenly and the attachment for detailed trimming is excellent.</li>
            <li> All-in-all, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t find a good replacement that will also use AC power.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a good job of vacuuming the hairs and keeping them out of the sink.</li>
            <li> And the Amazon price is so good.   </li>
            <li> and he seems to be delighted.</li>
            <li> The comb does not allow good mustache trimming.  </li>
            <li> It does the job it is supposed to do and vacuums good even without putting it in turbo.</li>
            <li> Part alignment must be perfect of they don&#x27;t fit.  </li>
            <li> The guard feels good against my skin and the hairs are all evenly cut.</li>
            <li> Definately a good buy.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, it is fair to mention one fatal flaw with this design:  </li>
            <li> dat means it is really a good trimmer..</li>
            <li> This product had good ratings</li>
            <li> Trimmer works good.  </li>
            <li> This one is just as good.</li>
            <li> A good trimmer for the $.</li>
            <li> not that you would ever wanna shave a good beard off.</li>
            <li> She, and the girlfriend loved the difference.</li>
            <li> , this one is not as good as you hope it will be.</li>
            <li> ..just didnt think that the vaccuum would be that good since it was cordless...</li>
            <li> A good buy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for a 5 &#x27;o&#x27; clock shadow, but also nice for longer lengths.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is a good and reliable product.</li>
            <li> The power is good too.</li>
            <li> Husband loved it.</li>
            <li> However, I chalked that up to not liking the rotary system and this trimmer had some good reviews.  </li>
            <li> The price was good and shipped on time...</li>
            <li> Good product.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a good value and</li>
            <li> I feel like I bought the best trimmer that was available on the market.</li>
            <li> but in a good way.</li>
            <li> Good Product, get one.</li>
            <li> and I have loved it.  </li>
            <li> Basically, if you want a really good beard trimmer, this is what you want.  </li>
            <li> Good value for price..</li>
            <li> it does a fair job of sucking up the trimmings, so</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s been a good buy, no problems yet.    </li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Good trimmer for the money.</li>
            <li> But otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It had done a good job but</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a well made piece of machinery that feels good in your hand.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good.</li>
            <li> Good ergonomics.</li>
            <li> Might be good for shearing sheep.</li>
            <li> i bought this to keep my beard nice and trim and it works GREAT.  </li>
            <li> Good at sucking up hair.</li>
            <li> This is a superior product to the Wahl in every respect.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t felt the need to use the turbo button so that might be contributing to the good battery life.    </li>
            <li> Good power and cut.</li>
            <li> It is good but as not par with what it promised.</li>
            <li> Rest are good.....</li>
            <li> it is a good product.  </li>
            <li> It does a good job of collecting the trimmings, but it won&#x27;t capture 100%.</li>
            <li> All and all another good Norelco.</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I charged the trimmer and gave it a good run for the money.</li>
            <li> This puppy is good.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a snap to keep my goatee looking good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m completely delighted with my purchase and the value that I received for my investment.</li>
            <li> Good luck.</li>
            <li> I have not found a good nose hair trimmer yet.</li>
            <li> Good product.</li>
            <li> The battery is still good.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely good for trimming your beard, manscaping, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> This quality beard trimmer is excellent for catching beard hair and for making cleanup easy.  </li>
            <li> I found the Phillips Norelco T980 fairly quickly and was impressed by the good reviews.</li>
            <li> It also charges quickly and indicates when the charging is finished.&lt;br /&gt;I shopped around, and Amazon&#x27;s price (when I bought it) was the best around, online or in stores.</li>
            <li> The improvement in features and performance is tremendous, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is wonderful, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The best of the best, fast, clean and very suitable.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase.  </li>
            <li> but otherwise I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
            <li> I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> My husband is very satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> and it also is great for bald patchy spots on top of the head.</li>
            <li> All-in-all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase</li>
            <li> I have been using the T980 for over 3 months now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied with my choice.</li>
            <li> It makes beard trimming a very enjoyable experience.</li>
            <li> Its a well made device that does what it says and I am very pleased with it.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m very glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> It cuts very smooth!</li>
            <li> and it also is great for bald patchy spots on top of the head.</li>
            <li> very, very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the T980 for 6 weeks now and am very satisfied.  </li>
            <li> very satisfied with the trimmer</li>
            <li> Since then, I have been very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> I am very satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> As others have said, a stand to store it in would have been nice, but to be fair</li>
            <li> It is easily the best beard trimmer of the many that I have owned.  </li>
            <li> The benefit of having one-size cuts all is very nice, but a trimmer with interchangeable trimming lengths would probably be more sufficient.  </li>
            <li> Look and feel is very stylish and the blade technology is pretty impressive.</li>
            <li> Plus, this one does a great job of catching all of the clippings making it a very clean and effortless experience.</li>
            <li> Boy am I glad I did!  </li>
            <li> It has so many functions all in one trimmer!</li>
            <li> LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the trimmer for a couple of months now and simply love it!</li>
            <li> The battery on this trimmer is outstanding!</li>
            <li> And now he doesn&#x27;t have to shave the old-fashioned way any more!</li>
            <li> all three guys love it!</li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> and I think my wife likes it even better!  </li>
            <li> I love this product!</li>
            <li> Love it!</li>
            <li> I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS TRIMMER!  </li>
            <li> Well, I am certainly glad I did!  </li>
            <li> Now with this trimmer he gets a much better trim and the hair is vaccumed up and never reaches the sink!  </li>
            <li> Besides that I love it!</li>
            <li> LOVE this trimmer!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone thorugh many beard trimmers and electric shavers, this one is TOPS!  </li>
            <li> Electric shavers for beards sure beat the heck out of scissors!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still very happy with this unit, but I think the newer method of clipping removal is not as good as the older unit.</li>
            <li> The trimmer itself works great, and the adjustable hights are easy to use.  </li>
            <li> He says it works great and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The clipper works great and easily cuts/trims without any effort.</li>
            <li> It made me WANT to shave, which is amazing.  </li>
            <li> If you buy this in hopes to remove the guard and shave smooth, youre not going to be happy.    </li>
            <li> This shaver is amazing.</li>
            <li> This is the absolute best product out there. . .</li>
            <li> This is a necessity for men, you should own one.</li>
            <li> Nice 70 minute charge, comfortable to hold, and attractive style.  </li>
            <li> nice carrying bag too included.</li>
            <li> trims nice.</li>
            <li> the best part is its precision trimmer, gives you a very close trim.</li>
            <li> * Turbo button to boost the speed of the blades is a nice feature  *</li>
            <li> My husband is returning his Phlips Norelco beard trimmer because it leaves his beard shaggy and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t make a neat, tidy line.  </li>
            <li> The vaccume feature is really nice.  </li>
            <li> This would be really nice if it had came with the stand</li>
            <li> My husband had one of these and our son uses it all the time, so I wanted to get him his own for Christmas.  </li>
            <li> The T980 comes with accessories and its own storage pouch.  </li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Remington MB400 trimmer which I really liked.</li>
            <li> I babied the batteries for years and quite honestly if you don&#x27;t, with Ni-Cads you&#x27;ll be replacing them or the trimmer a lot</li>
            <li> But if you want anything from the popular \\&quot;haven&#x27;t shaved for a day</li>
            <li> I *borrowed* this from my man after my own wimpy, girly trimmer broke.  </li>
            <li> what angle I use it at because of the way the hair guard is made (nice feature).  </li>
            <li> The best straight razor), to shave and get the edges of the style perfected.</li>
            <li> Those trimmers are nice to own, compared to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is by far the greatest trimmer I have ever own, love the Turbo , no hairs anywhere, works great</li>
            <li> Overall, this was a great price for this trimmer and the quality is excellent!</li>
            <li> My husband has another Norelco and liked it</li>
            <li> Nice trimmer,</li>
            <li> It keeps his beard nice and trim.</li>
            <li> Plus, it&#x27;s nice to have a comb that varies in height rather than a set of combs that could get lost.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is really nice</li>
            <li> Nice travel bag.  </li>
            <li> - Nice design.  </li>
            <li> Kind of a pain.  </li>
            <li> and I concur - it would be nice.  </li>
            <li> and I concur - it would be nice.  </li>
            <li> handy</li>
            <li> I am kind of disapointed.</li>
            <li> Some of the concerns that others noted (followed by my own impressions):  </li>
            <li> Nice even trim.</li>
            <li> This one is nice</li>
            <li> turn knob and get any setting automatically, nice not to have a bunch of combs to lose.  </li>
            <li> Turbo option is also nice one.</li>
            <li> makes your sink nice</li>
            <li> This T980 trimmer does everything nicely, but not as nicely as the discontinued and</li>
            <li> The heigh adjustment click in nicely.</li>
            <li> The cover over the blades ride nicely over your face but this is something you&#x27;ll have to use the included cleaning brush to wipe out hair that will stick in</li>
            <li> a nice stubble-y look</li>
            <li> If you use the turbo feature, it is still not that effective.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a good dependable trimmer (that doesn&#x27;t pull more hair than it cuts)</li>
            <li> This razor impressed me so much</li>
            <li> after I butter myself up for a nice shave, I let the Norelco do the work, and the result makes my face make a baby&#x27;s butt feel like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> but curly beard hairs have a mind of their own.  </li>
            <li> and this is nice to keep it trim.  </li>
            <li> The T980 is a nice upgrade.  </li>
            <li> kind</li>
            <li> and it does a nice job.  </li>
            <li> It is functional and handy and trims well.</li>
            <li> The easy-adjust ring was nice.</li>
            <li> This is a nice beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> and it does a good job of capturing most of the hair.</li>
            <li> It gave a nice even trim all around.  </li>
            <li> and I love the fact that it&#x27;s a good size and weight for travel.</li>
            <li> Provides a nice trim.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re planning on buying this item, you might want to do some comparison shopping first to make sure you&#x27;re getting the best deal.</li>
            <li> Workd great for me - I use the Norelcon to avoid having to have a \\&quot;clean shave\\</li>
            <li> My T980 does almost everything perfectly: it holds a charge for weeks; its vacuum reduces the number of trimmed hairs around the sink by about 70%; it feels wonderful and it works quickly.    </li>
            <li> Excellent high end trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and then it would charge to full capacity, that is great.  </li>
            <li> Light and handy!</li>
            <li> It cuts well, has the attachment for more precise trimming, holds a good charge, has the corded/cordless feature that predecessors did not, and still has a fair price.  </li>
            <li> but overall the shaver is good quality and works great!</li>
            <li> It gives a good, close trim and is easy to hold.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer about 12 times since writing this review, and by a combination of duct tape, a pinch grip, and a good deal of vigilance I had been able to avoid too many embarrassing shifts in beard length.    </li>
            <li> &quot; But I was impressed by the vacuum (which does collect a good 80% of the hair) and thought I&#x27;d try it out for the 60 day money-back time period.</li>
            <li> I find it very easy to use as it allows precision trimming lengths and</li>
            <li> Its very easy to travel with also.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is very easy, and I don&#x27;t believe it ever has to be oiled, which is quite a convenience.</li>
            <li> Works great and the clipper does a pretty good job of collecting most of the trimmings.  </li>
            <li> Works on beard and mustache great, cuts head hair, arm pits and trims other body hair places wonderfully!    </li>
            <li> It works very well, the battery life between charges is very good</li>
            <li> This trimmer holds a charge for a good amount of time and is very easy and comfortable to use.</li>
            <li> This is the best one I have found so far.  </li>
            <li> I liked the 4 better anyway, so stuck with that.  </li>
            <li> This tool gets my most enthusiastic endorsement.</li>
            <li> The T980 trimmer is so far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all in the 25 years that i have a beard and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best beard trimmer I have ever owned.  </li>
            <li> The battery is much better than the model I used to own.</li>
            <li> This is the best so far.</li>
            <li> Not 100% effective but way better than nothing.</li>
            <li> So far it is wonderful.</li>
            <li> Really a great buy and worth the cost.</li>
            <li> Light, good power</li>
            <li> I am sure every product purchased will have some kind of \\&quot;negative,\\&quot;</li>
            <li> and it would be nice if the vacume was more effetive and worked with the neck trimmer.</li>
            <li> My Dad and Brother both own one and love it.</li>
            <li> By far, this is the best trimmer, I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> this is the best by far.  </li>
            <li> According to the Norelco site the T980 was the most popular seller, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> This my 4rd trimmer in 15 years and by far the best yet.</li>
            <li> The price and free shipping made for a good deal.</li>
            <li> Also holds a charge quite well and so far very happy with it.</li>
            <li> So far this has really impressed me.</li>
            <li> After using this product for about a month I have zero complaints and have been very impressed with the it so far.</li>
            <li> So far its perfect for keeping an even tamed beast on my mug.</li>
            <li> I *loved* the T990 and would buy it again, but it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it is more than moderately effective.</li>
            <li> If I want a real clean look</li>
            <li> It makes it go faster with a cool noise, so even in a shaver that is attractive to many.    </li>
            <li> I tried this trimmer right away when I received it and it works great.  </li>
            <li> Have been using this trimmer for 3 years, still going strong!</li>
            <li> great razor trims very good not a linner and be careful with the Vac.</li>
            <li> I use it in the high speed position and it does a very good job of trapping clippings.  </li>
            <li> Turbo is good, but does not help you with a clean sink.</li>
            <li> It gives a superior, even beard and mustache trim, glides smoothly across without snagging, and catches most (yes, not ALL) your clippings.  </li>
            <li> I found it very easy and am satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> It has a superb cut &amp; a nice vacuum for the droppings.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works as well as expected...not perfect but fairly  effective.</li>
            <li> the feature I liked best about it was the built in vacuum.</li>
            <li> Certainly some bits escape, but for the most part, I think it does an excellent job and is very easy to handle and clean.</li>
            <li> Very pleased with this choice and happy to recommend it to anyone considering purchasing a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> The first one was great and lasted years.  </li>
            <li> This is my first electric beard trimmer and it is great.  </li>
            <li> I loved it, easy to cut the line and easy to switch the blade for a close up trim.</li>
            <li> It seems fine for a battery operated trimmer, EXCEPT!  </li>
            <li> Very accurate.  </li>
            <li> and I find it a very comfortable shaver to use.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> but the bulk is an issue for very detailed areas.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s very light too.</li>
            <li> - Very comfortable in the face.  </li>
            <li> It replaced a very cheap Remington trimmer that I had for years (the rechargable battery no longer held a charge) and</li>
            <li> And very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> After some 9 months of use, this unit still looks great, cuts great, and has a pleasingly long battery life.</li>
            <li> Also a good solution for quick adjustments on those \\&quot;in a hurry\\&quot; mornings.</li>
            <li> but the flaw lies in that it is super bulky and it isn&#x27;t good for close up trims.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to use and trimming nicely....</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly what it is supposed to do, and does it very nicely.</li>
            <li> I am delighted with my purchase and it exceeded my expectations in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is light, easy to operate, rechargeable and has precision blades that cut evenly.  </li>
            <li> I previously had a Norelco Trimmer that I absolutely loved and thought worked wonderful.</li>
            <li> That being said, it works wonderfully, trims my facial hair nicely, and is easy to use.    </li>
            <li> have not figured out what turbo is for, sure the blades move faster and the device is louder</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many of these types of trimmers and they come with all these attachments for the different hair lengths but the fact that this one has 9 adjustable lengths built in is just great!</li>
            <li> Have had this trimmer for a couple months now and love it.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer.</li>
            <li> so I have hope that this time everything will be ok :)</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews of this product I was sold and went ahead and ordered it.  </li>
            <li> Plan on changing shirts after use. :)</li>
            <li> okay triming attachment</li>
            <li> , vacuume is an okay idea  </li>
            <li> Finding a shaver that works well for me has been more than a challenge.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer does a good job vacuuming the trimmings, and is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> But now I&#x27;m glad she did.</li>
            <li> Maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the T980 Turbo (and don&#x27;t all guys love stuff with \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; in the description?)</li>
            <li> (Some get away, but many fewer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Next to my Family Guy box sets this is the best purchase I have made in 12 months.      </li>
            <li> not NiCd, so I&#x27;m quite pleased about that.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s job better.  </li>
            <li> And of course I love the vacuuming ability of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Actually performs as advertised and even gives an excellent close haircut.</li>
            <li> I wish the case that came with it were more compact, even form fitting.</li>
            <li> The T980 is ok.  </li>
            <li> It does the job for sure</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad I did--</li>
            <li> Ok its not dual exhaust</li>
            <li> I  have trimmed my beard a number of times since 1975 and this one is just OK.</li>
            <li> Catches most (98% or more) of the hair.  </li>
            <li> It even does a better job shaving my head than my Oster Turbo 111 electric razor.</li>
            <li> I love the way my boyfriend looks a day or two after shaving, so after doing some research I found this razor.  </li>
            <li> After using this, he has that sexy \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot; but manicured look.  </li>
            <li> It is OK.</li>
            <li> You need time to become more accustomed with it.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure this thing can get through the narliest of beards...</li>
            <li> :)  </li>
            <li> the problem was they didnt make the one I have any more...</li>
            <li> I was led to believe 90% of the hair would be collected and not end up all over the place, but it is more like 60% of the hair is captured, and quite a bit still ends up all over the sink.</li>
            <li> I think the guide/comb part could be better.  </li>
            <li> Gets most of the clippings making cleanup a breeze.</li>
            <li> The distance between the stationary and the moving blade on the Braun was maybe 1mm; on this Norelco T980, it was more like 3mm.  </li>
            <li> Battery life also satisfied and inline with their description.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the affordable great product....</li>
            <li> It also has many more length adjustments than most trimmers.  </li>
            <li> The extra power this trimmer delivers over comparable models is excellent.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco beard and mustache for years but after a ciuple of months this one would start without even touching it, The on-off button became defective.</li>
            <li> I would pay alittle more for a better quality trimer.</li>
            <li> When I went to replace the T980 that died, I avoided the latest Phillips/Norelco version because I think a wet/dry is</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a newer one by now, but  </li>
            <li> so maybe it will get better with age.</li>
            <li> This is my story of how I came to possess quite possibly the greatest trimmer known to man:    </li>
            <li> I did a Google search for \\&quot;top trimmer.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> I fell in love.    </li>
            <li> I have used various trimmers but this is the best i have ever used.</li>
            <li> Most men do not know how to trim their beard.....</li>
            <li> The seller shipped fast and was great.  </li>
            <li> then I am sure you will find this trimmer just find for your needs.  </li>
            <li> It vacuums the hairs better.</li>
            <li> I must say that I disagree with most reviewers on this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it.  </li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for last Christmas, and it&#x27;s been incredible!</li>
            <li> Take THAT, Fantastic Sam&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> Having used this item for several weeks, I can attest to it&#x27;s excellent performance.  </li>
            <li> all should accept 110-230 volts, since they are mostly travel items.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean out, and the adjustable guard does a good job of providing the selected shave length across the contours of the face.</li>
            <li> but most of it.</li>
            <li> It had it&#x27;s problems like many of these in holding the desired length.</li>
            <li> Not terrible</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine what it is like for people who buy trimmers with 3 or more interchangable heads.  </li>
            <li> Keeps most of the trimmings out of the sink</li>
            <li> So here&#x27;s the scoop, the plastic guard/head if improperly seated on the top of the trimmer</li>
            <li> Thus on virtually any setting, the trimmer part isn&#x27;t touching your face.  </li>
            <li> I am extremely satisfied with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> OK.</li>
            <li> I love the rechargeable/cordless feature.  </li>
            <li> but this is so much better.  </li>
            <li> I used to love the Remington MB-300/200.</li>
            <li> , when using the machine, i noticed i was hitting the power button, or the turbo button accidently as i shave, but i&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s something i would have gotten used to</li>
            <li> I would recommend this trimmer :)</li>
            <li> Using the hilarious \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button just makes it louder and does nothing for performance.  </li>
            <li> but it has been improved in many ways as well.     </li>
            <li> Most of mine still fall out on the sink.</li>
            <li> It adds about 30-50% more speed (you decide) and 100% more noise.</li>
            <li> you have more then like 1/8 inch of hair on your face, i would not get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This trimmer works so much better than the others I have owned.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great trimmer for those of us real men with beards.</li>
            <li> All the reviews about the top of the trimmer falling off and ruining a trim seems bogus to me, but I can feel the pain of those who must have received defective products.  </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the performance of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> With the amount of people complaining about this, I have no doubt that it can happen, but my guess is that in most cases if not all, it has more to do with the way the groomer is being held.</li>
            <li> The vaccum works descent collecting most but not all the hair.</li>
            <li> I am glad for the shorter blade that helps define the trim edges and areas around the moustache.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall I am pleased with the product.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had many and they spewed the fur all over the place.</li>
            <li> I then called Norelco and was told that the hair catching unit is not an available replacement part.</li>
            <li> And cheapest too! :-)    </li>
            <li> I was expecting a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> but overall I think the product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I gave up on trying to take the top off</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it works great so far and seems to be a nice trimming tool.  </li>
            <li> The T 980 works even better for beard and mustache grooming.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it for the time being, then donate it to the thrift store when I find a better unit.  </li>
            <li> Got free shipping too, unlike Ebay sellers that are charging 20 bucks to ship!</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this appliance, and heartily recommend it.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this Philips Norelco, buy the Panasonic, which is cheaper, easier to handle, more accurate and waterproof!</li>
            <li> Ok, here&#x27;s my summary review of this trimmer.     </li>
            <li> Having the built-in vac suck up most of the trimmings makes cleaning up a cinch.  </li>
            <li> The best they will do is send an RMA to replace the entire unit.  </li>
            <li> Sure, some bean counter some place decided that if they didn&#x27;t have an inventory of spare parts, they could save money.  </li>
            <li> So at most, I&#x27;ve used the trimmer about 35 times.</li>
            <li> It should work longer and better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Otherwise I totally love it.     </li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> The more I use it, the more I appreciate it.</li>
            <li> but I did want to make sure I rated the item.  </li>
            <li> But each time I use it now, I am more pleased.</li>
            <li> It might have broke after dropping it on the sink, I don&#x27;t remember it, but if the design were better it could be replaced.  </li>
            <li> I like the stubble look so after searching product reviews, purchasers of the 980 seemed confident in it&#x27;s ability to take care of business on setting #1.      </li>
            <li> OK but had limitations that, for the most part have been resolved in this model.      </li>
            <li> The hair collection compartment is OK.  </li>
            <li> but that is about it for this latest model.</li>
            <li> br /&gt;I am really pleased.</li>
            <li> The Norelco trimmer I bought 7 years ago has a better locking system.</li>
            <li> I found that with practice it gets better.</li>
            <li> and i am glad that i bought it...</li>
            <li> I always use &#x27;Turbo&#x27; mode (hoping that more suction will catch more of the clippings), and I tend to catch ~75% of the clippings this way.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for my husband and he likes it for the most part.</li>
            <li> but it collects all the hair, so that more than makes up for the noise.</li>
            <li> The Norelco trimmer works much better.  </li>
            <li> If I was attracted to beard trimmers I would date this one because it&#x27;s sexy looking and cleans up after me.  </li>
            <li> Well it doesn&#x27;t but the motor does get louder in turbo and I&#x27;m sure it also eats up more battery power.</li>
            <li> It works better than I anticipated.  </li>
            <li> , i.e. you do it by feel more than sight since the shield blocks my view.  </li>
            <li> I can trim beard and mustache in under 5 minutes, including ALL hairs off the sink (that&#x27;s for my lovely wife).    </li>
            <li> I even run it in turbo mode most of the time, and still don&#x27;t have an issue with this.</li>
            <li> I love the trimmer, and have not seen anything else out there that would beat it.</li>
            <li> Good design, wireless which is great, and fairly quiet.</li>
            <li> more to come</li>
            <li> How many gadgets have you purchased that just didn&#x27;t \\&quot;do</li>
            <li> This product looks too flimsy and it looks more like a play toy.  </li>
            <li> Ok I took note of the reviews and some issues folks had with this model</li>
            <li> Regardless, it vacuums up enough of the hairs to keep my wife happy!    </li>
            <li> I bet it would work even better if I didn&#x27;t wait 2-3 weeks between beard trimmings.</li>
            <li> Most people that I know do, too).    </li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and its ease of use.</li>
            <li> Most of the trimmings make it into the collection chamber, but not all of them.  </li>
            <li> It does a perfect job of trimming my beard evenly (setting at 7, ultimate beard length to be a 9).  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t think of anything this trimmer could do better.  </li>
            <li> But for those who have such a shaver, this product is, at best, superfluous.    </li>
            <li> Most of the hairs are captured in the hair cage.  </li>
            <li> it will take more than you want</li>
            <li> Not having a beard myself :) I had no idea what the heck to get</li>
            <li> so I just researched a bunch of different ones and this one appeared to be the best for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just an OK product.</li>
            <li> Except it could have a couple of setting more after the 1 setting.</li>
            <li> That would&#x27;ve been a better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A better design would&#x27;ve been a switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But product design could be better.</li>
            <li> However, the trimmer&#x27;s phallic-like shape is good for a laugh with the ladies.     </li>
            <li> Although I did like the hair collection system on the Remington better.  </li>
            <li> Most namely, it keeps breaking.</li>
            <li> The T980 is a much better product.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much more you can say about a product like this.  </li>
            <li> It is rechargeable, removing the power cord, and I simply love this thing.</li>
            <li> Suddenly I have this wonderful piece of equipment that makes all of that child&#x27;s play.</li>
            <li> I wish the trimmer guide was made out of better plastic, it looks/feels somewhat brittle.</li>
            <li> (more so than my liking).</li>
            <li> As for trimming... outstanding.</li>
            <li> Lastly, battery life is very impressive.  </li>
            <li> Most others also felt like junk compared to the T980&#x27;s construction.  </li>
            <li> 2/2012: 3 years of use and still works well.</li>
            <li> This one works just as well and maybe better in some respects.</li>
            <li> Also the sink is hair free now!</li>
            <li> My fiancé used to whine about the hair on the sink after I shaved, so I looked for a better one, and saw this.</li>
            <li> but i would if i found a better one.</li>
            <li> I love it.</li>
            <li> Sure, it collects some hair, but plenty more ends up on the sink and the floor.   </li>
            <li> It seems the shorter the hair trimmings, the better it does at capturing them.</li>
            <li> Not even sure they make it any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been left with two perfectly mechanically functional beard trimmers that will no longer run because of the design.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t buy the brand any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
            <li> I love it</li>
            <li> and my wife loves me for not messing up the bathroom any more.</li>
            <li> The shave is much more enjoyable on this.   </li>
            <li> and I am glad I bought it.     </li>
            <li> One did make a favorable comment which is one more than before.  </li>
            <li> These are okay</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking for a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> Better than the Wahl, I think.  </li>
            <li> Most others have you hold the side with the buttons and logo against your face; when you use the length comb on the T980, however,you hold it with the buttons and logo on the side facing AWAY from your face.  </li>
            <li> I wonder how many of my fellow reviewers have been using this trimmer correctly, given this unconventional orientation.  </li>
            <li> but I decided to get this because it looked better.  </li>
            <li> You will love it.</li>
            <li> It catches MOST of the hairs, which is a lot better than NONE of the hairs.  </li>
            <li> It has an attractive design, which doesn&#x27;t matter much to me but is an added plus that makes it more enjoyable to use.</li>
            <li> For trimming it doesn&#x27;t get much better.</li>
            <li> The others were ok, for awhile, but eventually just could not get the job done.  </li>
            <li> especially first thing in the morning.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco trimmer before but this one is even better.</li>
            <li> most of the items were better than my expectations</li>
            <li> Overall a wonderful purchase we&#x27;ve had zero problems with!</li>
            <li> Great idea, new innovations work great, but as a trimmer this is a piece of junk because you can&#x27;t shave at any level higher than a number 2 without risk of ending up 2 levels lower or MORE.</li>
            <li> but I am really impressed with the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect, so some of the trimmings still get in and around the sink.  </li>
            <li> I was hopping that I would not have to clean these up after a beard trimming session any more!</li>
            <li> The thing I like the best is the vacuum option.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is also very impressive.  </li>
            <li> I have been very happy with the design of this machine, the settings adjustments, the vacuum for clippings- just about everything.</li>
            <li> this product is the best trimmer i ever had with a vacuum.</li>
            <li> I saw this trimmer with the vacuum and said this will be great!</li>
            <li> Any package requiring scissors to open needs to be redesigned with more eco- and user-friendly materials!!!  </li>
            <li> Any package requiring scissors to open needs to be redesigned with more eco- and user-friendly materials!!!  </li>
            <li> , it works great, except for the suction feature, but hey when have us guys ever really cared about being neat and clean!</li>
            <li> The shaper works well, giving nice clean lines.</li>
            <li> Great upgrade from the \\&quot;older</li>
            <li> I still find that it doesn&#x27;t really do the best job at making my beard look consistent.</li>
            <li> I had the older model of this unit the 970 which i was happy with</li>
            <li> This shaver is pretty awesome, as it hasn&#x27;t irritated his skin at all, and he really likes that it leaves</li>
            <li> I had an older model and it worked great.</li>
            <li> and I figured that since the price was so high it must ba a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Battery seems to hold a charge for a good length of time and the new design change where the hair catching &#x27;basket&#x27; does not come off is welcomed.</li>
            <li> great machine, had the previous version and that was great</li>
            <li> In addition the flexibility really does allow you to get a precision trim really easily as it contours to the face great.    </li>
            <li> A bit bulky but easy to control and gives a nice accurate trim.</li>
            <li> Very clean and neat.</li>
            <li> It is a very comfortable size to hold as well and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is pretty good.</li>
            <li> On Turbo the trim is pretty good.  </li>
            <li> The device works pretty good.</li>
            <li> The Turbo makes a difference, the battery charge remains for a long time, the speed and sharpness of the blades is perfect.  </li>
            <li> or two\\&quot; look to a full but nicely trimmed beard, this will do it.</li>
            <li> Had this for about 2 years now and its pretty good.</li>
            <li> And a pretty good one to boot.</li>
            <li> Trims pretty good also.</li>
            <li> I loved the first, but it eventually had the power circuit just die.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is pretty good.</li>
            <li> It hold charge pretty good too.</li>
            <li> works pretty good all around.    </li>
            <li> vacuum works great catching most of the trimmings.  </li>
            <li> This is a great machine, but the vacuum is far from perfect.  </li>
            <li> The new unit seems to be working great.    </li>
            <li> He had asked for a new beard trimmer and I was happy to oblige.  </li>
            <li> This thing is perfect for the nice fuzz to heavy beard trimming.</li>
            <li> I had the prior version which was good, but not as good.</li>
            <li> All in all a good buy overall and a great value, though I&#x27;d happily pay $20 more if made moslty if not entirely in USA</li>
            <li> This Norelco seemed to be the best non-pro model available, but it is quite different.</li>
            <li> I can go a whole vacation without needing to recharge, which is nice, but the included travel bag is handy just in case.    </li>
            <li> I own an earlier model of this trimmer and over all am happy with it.</li>
            <li> It was easy, the results were good, and the vacuum did a surprisingly good job of capturing most of the trimmed hair.    </li>
            <li> Like its grandfather, the click adjustable guard is the single best reason to buy one of these trimmers.      </li>
            <li> Does a great job, very quick to use, no mess at all (vacuum cleanup is awesome).</li>
            <li> Now I feel fine using it plugged or unplugged since the instructions say it&#x27;s OK.    </li>
            <li> Clean out container once a month for stubble trimming (more for beard trimming I am sure).    </li>
            <li> Makes the sink clean up MUCH easier and keeps the wife happy.</li>
            <li> Very cool indeed.      </li>
            <li> Overall, very good piece.  </li>
            <li> Very easy to use, the cut length adjuster is great, the vacuum captures about 80% with the turbo mode (bit noisy).  </li>
            <li> as a first time beard grower, trimming a beard was at best enigmatic.  </li>
            <li> It shaves much better than the cheap ($17 at Target)</li>
            <li> So far, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> But if you are seeking a trimmer to crop and maintain body hair, especially facial hair, this is an ideal tool to have.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say the T980 is an improvement in every way over my old faithful trimmer (T970</li>
            <li> Most important to folks wondering whether to upgrade-</li>
            <li> so it is of dubious value, and most importantly 3) it does not hold its distance setting.  </li>
            <li> The battery is stronger, the motor and switch are improved, and the parts fit better.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really loud and sounds like it might explode, but it works great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It works great, makes beard upkeep a non-issue, and fits into a hand naturally.  </li>
            <li> Battery life seems great so far.  </li>
            <li> (roughly weekly) since then and am very happy with it.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works great and beats my old Braun which did not collect whiskers.  </li>
            <li> Too much of my life depends on how good of a shave I give myself.</li>
            <li> I say reasonably well because in this day and age, 5 years is good</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast in a good condition.</li>
            <li> Battery life is good, and the comb doesn&#x27;t really get in the way.</li>
            <li> Fast to Cook Good to Eat, this is not a edible product &amp;</li>
            <li> The battery life is fantastic(four trims so far), the turbo mode works perfectly, and the vacuum is good.  </li>
            <li> The &#x27;vacuum&#x27; works brilliantly.</li>
            <li> It is easily cleanable with most important parts just pulling off.</li>
            <li> The vac works great and leaves no mess.</li>
            <li> Since it worked so well and does a pretty good job of keeping the sink and counter clean I decided to stick with this brand.  </li>
            <li> other than that seems to work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who has a full beard and moustache - he loves it!</li>
            <li> Other than that, this trimmer is awesome.</li>
            <li> the trimmer works flawlessly, as though the blades were sharp and efficient.  </li>
            <li> It was the best rated in Consumers Report and other reviews</li>
            <li> Great quality product and the storage pouch is such a nice simple touch but so very handy.  </li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s more comfortable and much more accurate for a far superior result.  </li>
            <li> Like that it is easily adjustable.</li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to adjust trimming height.  </li>
            <li> Mine falls off easy, spilling the trimmings over the floor.</li>
            <li> The T980 is well-balanced and easy to use.</li>
            <li> He says it&#x27;s easy and comfortable-doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt at all.  </li>
            <li> It can be easily dismantled for cleaning or razor head exchange and assembled again.</li>
            <li> Makes trimming beard easy.  </li>
            <li> this is a great product that women would love if they only knew it</li>
            <li> Return from Amazon was a non-issue, easily handled.</li>
            <li> One more thing, the device feels light (and a bit cheap).</li>
            <li> Cleans easily.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, not too noisy, and lives up to its billing.</li>
            <li> The T980 is a one piece adjustable trimmer, easy to use and works as advertised.  </li>
            <li> With a bit of care the blade placement is easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> The adjustable comb is easy to use and I don&#x27;t have to dig through the drawer in the bathroom to find a snap-on #3 comb I like to use and therefore always lose.</li>
            <li> Overall, this product is a must have for beginners all the way up to the most experienced beard and mustache groomers out there</li>
            <li> Guide pops off easily.  </li>
            <li> Easy to change lengths.</li>
            <li> Length indicator needs a stronger click-and-hold ratchet mechanism -- too easy to accidentally change length settings.  </li>
            <li> Easy to adjust trim length.</li>
            <li> Easily adjustable from 3/4 in.</li>
            <li> , it works with and without the cord, and it is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The height adjusts easily.  </li>
            <li> Trimmer attachment is easy to install</li>
            <li> Easy to hold and use.</li>
            <li> Buttons placed in easy to use positions.  </li>
            <li> Easy to use.  </li>
            <li> and if you travel, it is so easy to accidentaly</li>
            <li> It trims well and is fairly easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Changing the blade to trim is easy</li>
            <li> Its easy to shut off by grabbing the     handle.</li>
            <li> Can be easy to accidentally hit the power button mid-trim, no biggie.  </li>
            <li> so it is easily started by incidental luggage handling.    </li>
            <li> But soon they pop off easily.</li>
            <li> But this thing is so easy to use</li>
            <li> Easily adjustable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sure it sucked in some of the hair, but whats the point if you still have to clean your sink?  </li>
            <li> Secondly, it is easy to use with a cursory understanding of the instructions.  </li>
            <li> The length setting is easily shifted while in use.  </li>
            <li> Works well, but has three flaws:      Length setting selector moves too easily and slips in use    </li>
            <li> The trimmer is easy to use he has NO problems with it</li>
            <li> it has an easy to read dial to adjust the length of your cuts.  </li>
            <li> Easy and convenient.    </li>
            <li> This makes it incredibly easy to store and keeps it out of the way.</li>
            <li> Adjustments are easy and there&#x27;s no additional blade guides to snap on and lose.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust.  </li>

            <li> Whisker catch compartment is easily cleaned with enclosed brush.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> turbo is too easily turned on by accident.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The depth setting is easy and cutter head can be switched to a micro-head to do detail trim and borders.  </li>
            <li> I bought this years ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> Strong blades clip everything in sight.  </li>
            <li> but I like my old one better that broke after 10 years of good use.</li>
            <li> The battery seems to hold a charge fairly well, and it has decent vacuuming power considering its size.</li>
            <li> The blades never need to be oiled, the see through hair chamber is awesome, and the powerful hair vacuum are all you need.</li>
            <li> , it looks nice, and as many others write, it does a great job at vacuuming up trimmed hairs, even if a few escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> In general, I am quite happy with this equipment.     </li>
            <li> This trimmer seems to be more for men with full beards or thicker,</li>
            <li> In short, the company has replaced an excellent product with one that is only good.</li>
            <li> Bought a T980, took it home, and found out the first trim... its junk (I&#x27;m being nice with my wording).  </li>
            <li> Now that I bought and used the T980, my cool slacker goatee is attracting too many women.</li>
            <li> This is the first beard trimmer I have ever liked.  </li>
            <li> He was thrilled to get the new version for Christmas and was happy that the new features make it even better than the original.</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of trimmers, and this is hands down is the best in the market.</li>
            <li> Cuts smoothly as well as the easy changing of lengths with just 1 turn makes it easy to use.</li>
            <li> It is hands down the best trimmer I have used to date.  </li>
            <li> You must switch it to turbo mode to be effective, and if you&#x27;re trimming more than a light amount of hair you need to dump out the cut hair once or twice (which is easy to do with the way it is made) for the vacuum to still work effectively.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not the best (most powerful) trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had, but its other features make up for what it lacks in power.     </li>
            <li> It is easy to clean up, very smooth, very easy, very affordable, very cool looking, and very powerful.  </li>
            <li> The Remington was good but it eventually just couldn&#x27;t go any longer so I had to search for a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Norelco T980 is good, but, it doesn&#x27;t completely live up to the claims on the product details.  </li>
            <li> but I guess it works fine.  </li>
            <li> in all, I am very happy with this trimmer, but would purchase another one if they addressed the previously mentioned issues.</li>
            <li> That said, it then gives a fine two-day trim.      </li>
            <li> The power and trimming of this razor is fine.</li>
            <li> Otherwise it works fine.</li>
            <li> the detail blade makes fine detailing a breeze.</li>
            <li> but it works fine.</li>
            <li> It is fine although it does not have a stand.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s been fine since.    </li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a #2), and it&#x27;s even fine for my neck (YMMV).    </li>
            <li> The mechanical tech department at Norelco have produced another fine shaver/trimmer mechanism.</li>
            <li> It seemed like it locked in position just fine.    </li>
            <li> In my impression and with previous experiences, thats the best selling point for this trimmer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer does all this just fine.  </li>
            <li> I instead use a fine tooth slid-up trimmer on another shaver for that.  </li>
            <li> The trim setting zoom works fine.  </li>
            <li> I could have bought a replacement battery for 10 bucks)which worked just fine until the battery died.</li>
            <li> But once I figured out how to position the thing and use it correctly, I found it to be just fine.</li>
            <li> If you are more intelligent than a trained monkey you will have no problem using this trimmer for virtually any place you can grow hair...    </li>
            <li> The given attachment also helps with closer trims and helps fine tune the trim, so no need to follow through with a razor shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine.</li>
            <li> (It needs a plug adapter for this, but otherwise it worked fine for me.)</li>
            <li> Some reviews said that this would not work in Europe, but mine works fine.  </li>
            <li> Functionally, this trimmer worked fine.</li>
            <li> Adjustability was fine.</li>
            <li> Using turbo mode drains it slightly more quickly.</li>
            <li> I think the Philips Norelco T980 Vacuum Trimmer is a great trimmer and recommend it highly (because of my bf&#x27;s good experience and approval).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend so he&#x27;d keep his sexy new beard, and he was thrilled.  </li>
            <li> , was easy to use, was easy to clean, and produced  &lt;br /&gt;excellent results.</li>
            <li> Easy to clean and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> Easy to make length adjustments and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> The precision trim head slips on just as easily and really does a nice job with touch-up areas.  </li>
            <li> So far after 3 trim jobs, the batteries are going strong without a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;The turbo vac works fairly well.  </li>
            <li> First pleasant surprise: Amazon shipping is pretty damn zippy.</li>
            <li> Integrated mustache trimmer and a more positive lock on the height adjustment would make this a much better product.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is of good size but handles easily and with better precision than I initially thought.  </li>
            <li> Also includes a nice large case that holds everything plus some.</li>
            <li> Light, powerful and very smooth.</li>
            <li> It does an excellent job, and I have found little need to turn on the turbo feature.</li>
            <li> The decision to buy was mostly impluse, though I did check Amazon&#x27;s ratings, but I forgot to read the lowest ratings first! &lt;</li>
            <li> Easy to use and quite friendly to your face&#x27;s skin.   </li>
            <li> The description and reviews of this Norelco Trimmer were all accurate.  </li>
            <li> and it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal.     </li>
            <li> but it a huge improvement over using trimmers without suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This is really a huge problem.</li>
            <li> It trims well and accurately.</li>
            <li> It is easy to handle and provide a comfortable clean cut.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s had it for a few months now and is very happy with it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean after use.</li>
            <li> Does not need to be used on turbo mode, works great on regular mode.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Adjustable Guard:  Glides smooth.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product</li>
            <li> so if you want parts of your beard longer, you won&#x27;t have the automatic height setting available.  </li>
            <li> It was designed cheaply and made cheaply.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to look like a terrorist, so I needed a trimmer to keep my beard looking civilized.  </li>
            <li> I like the smooth look it gives, not splotchy or patchy.</li>
            <li> Philips Norelco thought of all the elements that make up a great beard trimmer and put them into a low cost product.   </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> also, the smaller trimmer accessory is great for those pesky noise and ear hair outcroppings...</li>
            <li> The pieces are easy to clean and adjust.    </li>
            <li> It has worked great the entire time, and I use it a lot.  </li>
            <li> The swing door on the collector is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> * Travel pouch and charger make for an easy-to-travel-with item    Keep in mind that if your intended use is for a body hair trimmer, the Norelco T980 does not shave the skin completely smooth -- as that is not in its intended design.</li>
            <li> I confirmed this by looking closely at both products&#x27; trimmer blades.  </li>
            <li> Fantastic.  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great trimmer, just watch you don&#x27;t push the power</li>
            <li> Norelco does recommend running the battery until the charge light comes on, and then recharging it (probably NiCad batteries), but this is no problem if you can use while charging.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean, and I appreciate that the hair is captured for disposal rather than covering the sink.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice trimmer gets a very close trim on the lowest setting.</li>
            <li> Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> Smooth transaction.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s feels comfortable using it</li>
            <li> I looked at the trimmers available and</li>
            <li> Comfortable design.</li>
            <li> Parts fit both</li>
            <li> trimmer itself fits comfortably in your hand.</li>
            <li> Points:  Comfortable, not too noisy, even on \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; setting.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable to hold.  </li>
            <li> Buy it and enjoy the simplicity and efficiency.</li>
            <li> , it just doesn&#x27;t make the \\&quot;click\\&quot; sound to let me know it&#x27;s locked.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sleek and smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband enjoy using it</li>
            <li> I liked it so much, that I bought the Norelco Arcitec electric razor.  </li>
            <li> What I don&#x27;t like is the cheap plastic hair holder, this broke after about a year</li>
            <li> Light  </li>
            <li> Not that looks of the shaver are important but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> Seven day free shipping.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s comfortable and convenient ...</li>
            <li> /&gt;The trimmer is precise, and you do not need to repeat.</li>
            <li> Overall, the design is great and the unit works as advertised.</li>
            <li> The blade adjustment is precise.  </li>
            <li> Cheap ones at wal-mart, the drug store, etc.</li>
            <li> Overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Trims my beard smoothly and evenly.</li>
            <li> no longer available Philips Norelco T-3000.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s larger than the Wahl or the Remington I had before, but works many times more effectively than either.  </li>
            <li> -It&#x27;s a great trimmer, overall</li>
            <li> , the directions are great, the packaging is terrific.  </li>
            <li> Overall I have had great luck with Norelco trimmers and this one</li>
            <li> The T980, however, fit the bill.  </li>
            <li> Not to mention shipping was free.</li>
            <li> light and ergonomic</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t fit under ones nose for mustache trimming.</li>
            <li> fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Happily, a gas compressor used for forced-induction of an internal combustion engine is not to be found here.</li>
            <li> I just used it last night, and I&#x27;m completely happy with it.</li>
            <li> There is an obstruction for the saw that cut hair and it does not work smoothly.</li>
            <li> Been using the T980 for a few weeks now and it works great!</li>
            <li> Oh yes, no problems to report with the way it works, the fit of the guard and the shaving heads.</li>
            <li> easy to use, but will take some time to clean the blade and vaccum chamber after the trim.</li>
            <li> However, the trimmer seams to be somewhat cheaply made.  </li>
            <li> Its easy for him to use and to keep clean.</li>
            <li> I searched quite a bit for a great facial hair trimmer</li>
            <li> once have i experienced the standard \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; moment when shavers catch  </li>
            <li> I am genuinely amazed at the simplicity of removing and replacing the grille guard.  </li>
            <li> Reliable, easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I had a different brand before and this one works great.  </li>
            <li> However, it only works well in Turbo mode and it feels like it will fly apart at any minute in Turbo mode.</li>
            <li> (my neurosis brings this to my attention since I prefer everything to be precise).  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a great product,</li>
            <li> Pilot light indicates when fully charge.&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Does not feel cheap at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Quit being cheap and buy it or stay looking like an ape without a date.</li>
            <li> Maybe the shorter hairs are too light and get blown around?  </li>
            <li> works smoothly now.  </li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> I have tried several Trimmers but this one is really the best.</li>
            <li> As far as rechargable cutter/trimmers go this one is a good as it gets.</li>
            <li> So far so good and has lived up to or beyond my expectations.  </li>
            <li> And the best part is, the vaccum actually works for upto 70% of my hair which is very dense.    </li>
            <li> My old one was so good I decided to wait it out and order it online.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the price is good, it works well, and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it, and would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.</li>
            <li> So far, so good..</li>
            <li> It may be good for those who don&#x27;t have a Norelco shaver with the trimming feature, (and don&#x27;t want to pay a hundred dollars or more for such a shaver).  </li>
            <li> I trim once every week and it has been more than a month since I last charged my battery, so it seems to have a good battery life.</li>
            <li> So far so good after one month.</li>
            <li> The Norelco T980 is easy to use, the turbo vacuum keeps it clean and hairs don&#x27;t fly all over the place.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is great, and it is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> the vacuum aspect of it is the best, because you can really do the shaving anywhere, on the go, and not worry about leaving trimmings all over the place.</li>
            <li> the vacuum feature of this is great....</li>
            <li> Cuts well and vacuum works great.  </li>
            <li> Its a great experience to use a \\&quot;Philips Norelco T980 Vacuum Trimmer\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> The turbo vacuum is a great feature,tho it still allows some hair to fall.</li>
            <li> The vacuum suction works great</li>
            <li> the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer sounded great.</li>
            <li> Vacuum feature with Turbo on works great.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is great, it catches 97% of my hair.</li>

            <li> The turbo vacuum system works great.</li>
            <li> vacuum is great addition to product...</li>
            <li> The vacuum works great...</li>
            <li> vacuum works great, not a hair on the floor</li>
            <li> The vacuum is great as well.</li>
            <li> Vacuum is a great improvement.  </li>
            <li> My older Braun still does a better job (after 8 years!)</li>
            <li> on/off switch is right on top, and a light touch will cycle it.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and smooth.</li>
            <li> I read some reviews before buying it and I am glad I made the right decision.</li>
            <li> My wife told me that I rave about how much I love it every time I use it that I should right a comment about it.  </li>
            <li> many settings to get just the right length.</li>
            <li> very useful and durable</li>
            <li> It is very powerful, even without the boost.  </li>
            <li> Very powerful and versatile shaver.</li>
            <li> that being said, some older trimmers (that have more metal) have more power than this one.     </li>
            <li> the fine trimmer attachment is ok, not so great to do the fine lines of a goatee, I got to do it quite a few times, but then I suspect nothing will ever come close to the perfection a blade can offer.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum works great for keeping area clean.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent trimmer, particularly with the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum works well and is a very nice feature.</li>
            <li> Noise level is minimum, vacuum and removable \\&quot;waste\\&quot; compartment are very nice additions.</li>
            <li> The T980 vacuum feature is very nice.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is not 100% effective, but it does a pretty good job.</li>
            <li> Originally discovered it on Amazon when I was in the market to replace my former cordless clipper and was impressed by the high rating.</li>
            <li> It fits in the hand nicely, has swap able heads and generally cuts quite well.  </li>
            <li> All the parts fit cleanly, the charger works well</li>
            <li> The adjustment system works quickly and easily.  </li>
            <li> Clean up is fairly easy, plus this one looks really cool.    </li>
            <li> It does do a good job keeping his beard at an even length and is much easier to use and consistent that the comb an scissors routine that he was trying before we got the norelco.</li>
            <li> However, the Panasonic models readily available differed from those I had used previously and the Norelco had good reviews and a nice price.  </li>
            <li> but once I started using it properly it does a great job of trimming quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> It works great, but it does get clogged with long hairs.</li>
            <li> Be sure to start at the longest trim setting the first time you use it and then work your way shorter to your desired length.  </li>
            <li> and I was not disappointed.  </li>
            <li> This was my first beard trimmer, and I am satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re buying this trimmer in order to cultivate a stubble look, be aware that with the T980 you&#x27;ll have to use it more</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this trimmer at first, though I should say that it never cut as closely to my skin as I wanted it too.  </li>
            <li> Pros: It looks real pretty.  </li>
            <li> I was incredibly excited to get this trimmer.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t for the pocket locking clip, I would&#x27;ve had the device hitting the floor or ground a significant number of times.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> This is an easiest and most accurate trimmer I used to own over last 10+ years.  </li>
            <li> And, yes, for what its worth, as others have pointed out- it does indeed resemble a futuristic dildo!</li>
            <li> Great for tumble look or long Mustache.</li>
            <li> Original  </li>
            <li> I am not sure if it&#x27;s my technique or what, but I have just found it best to avoid using the #1 setting for the shortest hair.</li>
            <li> Also there is significant play (wiggle room) in the dial itself.</li>
            <li> Love the length settings--for the first time, I have a length setting that doesn&#x27;t fall between the length I desire.</li>
            <li> If you like your grooming aids sanitary, you&#x27;ll have fun cleaning this thing (and, except the adjustable guide and whisker tray, you can&#x27;t wash it in water)!</li>
            <li> FYI, the original unit was bought from Amazon on 4/7/07.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product (after a couple of weeks of use).  </li>
            <li> After nearly a month of use with this trimmer, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> I feel my experience is consistent with most reviews presented.  </li>
            <li> And batteries are not environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> Def worth getting!</li>
            <li> He was excited to try and now 3 years</li>
            <li> It does have a strong battery and if you are just lightly trimming a mustache or a beard, it may be the right choice for you.  </li>
            <li> Adjustments work, the vacuum option does a reasonably good job, and clean up is easy.    </li>
            <li> The vacuum built into the trimmer works pretty well, with the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; or \\&quot;non-Turbo\\&quot; mode successfully capturing most of the hair that&#x27;s trimmed off.</li>
            <li> Locks guide into place much better, more comfortable to use, turbo mode cuts longer beards a little better and gets more of cut hair into holding chamber-</li>
            <li> I used to get a more precise shave from my oldest original trimmer especially near my moustache.</li>
            <li> Besides the mess, it did a very good job.</li>
            <li> well when I hve a beard or stash.....been clean for a while</li>
            <li> It is powerful and easy to use.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had four different beard trimmers and this is by far the best.</li>
            <li> and I have always had a problem with clean up of the sink afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Admittedly, I only use it to trim my modest goatee but for this it does an excellent work.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just another thing to clean and maintain.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s easier to clean up the sink after trimming...</li>
            <li> Overall, very happy so far.</li>
            <li> It appears to be of the kind of quality that last for many years......</li>
            <li> and you end up with hair everywhere to clean up.  </li>
            <li> I clean if after every use</li>
            <li> Also my sink is clean another plus   - Off On button needs to be moved.</li>
            <li> T980 comes with a mustache trimmer, AC adapter, carrying case, and a brush to clean the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use, self contained, powerful and flexible too.  </li>
            <li> Far more better than the one which I was using previously(Hitachi).</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for two reasons: 1) because he hates how a clean shave looks, and how it irritates his skin, and 2)</li>
            <li> The hair collector cup snaps in and out with ease and rinses clean.    </li>
            <li> The best thing I can say about this trimmer is that at least it&#x27;s cheap to buy...</li>
            <li> I am a hairy guy, and have not felt any pulling or ripping of the hairs, just a clean trim.    </li>
            <li> yes, you are going to have to clean up some hair off the sink.</li>
            <li> I have not had to clean my bathroom sink even once.</li>
            <li> I have used trimmers on my facial hair for over 40 years and this is by far the best one that I have had.</li>
            <li> To clean out the drive compartment you must still remove the trimmer head and use the included brush.    </li>
            <li> and you still need to clean your sink afterward.    </li>
            <li> I have a short beard and this is by far the best shaver I have had.  </li>
            <li> still have to clean up after i&#x27;m done.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ran into problems having to clean out the inside of the head</li>
            <li> It does a good job, maintains a nice charge, and I was amazed at how well it vacuums the trimmed beard hairs into the waste compartment.  </li>
            <li> Second pleasant surprise:</li>
            <li> It is powerful, holds a great charge and the vacuum feature works as designed.  </li>
            <li> As some reviewers had expressed reservations I took a flyer on the many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> Long battery life, good vacuum that leaves sink pretty clean, great adjustable lengths, got this in the mail in less than 48 hours, great buy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on my first charge with about 10 trims and still running strong - no recharge indicator light yet.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer operates at a higher speed than previous ones and it&#x27;s multitude of length settings allows for a perfect setting for me.  </li>
            <li> vac isn&#x27;t strong and clogs up easy other wise</li>
            <li> The length adjuster is very nice, much nicer than my old crappy walmart cheapie.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t make that much noise (when the turbo button is not on) and it is a very light device.  </li>
            <li> very glad i purchased this trimmer easy to use, quite, catches the hair that is cut with the vacuum</li>
            <li> Really like this trimmer - it&#x27;s easy to adjust, collects all of the hair cuttings, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several beard trimmers over the years but the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer is the best one by far for providing an even beard and mustache trim while doing a good job in turbo mode of vacuuming up the beard clippings.    </li>
            <li> But other than that it is a good beard trimmer and I am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> It hasn&#x27;t snagged a hair yet, it cuts clean and true.  </li>
            <li> It was fine, but this one operates a little smoother and catches shaved whiskers better for me (a surprising plus).  </li>
            <li> Specially for the cost.</li>
            <li> Lip, chin, and jaw are no problem, but the area just under the nose has to have special attention with scissors.</li>
            <li> on occassion the trimming head came off so strangly that it was dropped on the floor...not happy with this product although, as previously stated, the vacuum is really a great addition</li>
            <li> The trimmer does a great job, is easy to adjust, and the vacuum function works very well.  </li>
            <li> once your done trimming your beard, although it doesn&#x27;t catch all the trimmings it did catch most of them and clean up was much faster than what I am used too.</li>
            <li> This one has too much bell and whistle but not as good as the older model.</li>
            <li> It provides a wide variety of settings, its handling is pleasant and easy to adjust, and recharging is a breeze.</li>
            <li> though by no means all of the hair gets collected, seems better built all around vs older version, travel case is nice enough and has slightly better instructions on use and maintenence of product.    </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I set it on \\&quot;2\\&quot; which turned out to be much shorter than I would have liked.      </li>
            <li> , I bet this would be a great purchase.te and carefully trim the hairs using the height of the surrounding hairs that the trimmer did get as a guide.    </li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t experienced the guard slipping as others have.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good so far.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is marketed toward facial hair and sideburns, and that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for.  </li>
            <li> When it&#x27;s full, just dump it out.</li>
            <li> Did I mention that it doesn&#x27;t leave the bathroom sink full of hair trimmings?</li>
            <li> But, if you want a very close trim, like a two-day beard look, you must remove the adjustable head and make sure not to work from the bottom up.  </li>
            <li> If it was not for this I would give it a full 5 stars.</li>
            <li> but the rest is true.</li>
            <li> Overall it does an good job</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s just full and even</li>
            <li> The only good thing I have to say about this trimmer is it holds a charge for seemingly forever.      </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a beard for 15 years, and have tried everything from full sized Oster clippers to a variety of trimmers.</li>
            <li> Of the trimmers I have used (have been through several brands), this one does a good job for the price.  </li>
            <li> Good seller, prompt shipping,  My second trimmer from Norelco.</li>
            <li> If the battery dies (AND THEY ALL DO) in many trimmers you have to trash the whole unit.</li>
            <li> This product is really cool one from Phillips.</li>
            <li> For me the battery on the trimmer has lasted about 25-35 trims of the my full beard.  </li>
            <li> I really liked the old Norelco</li>
            <li> Every feature I liked from the old one is still there</li>
            <li> The product overall works good.</li>
            <li> The multiple settings are a good feature.</li>
            <li> I wear a medium length full beard</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I have a full beard, which I trim for length.  </li>
            <li> The selection of lengths is good for me; I keep my beard fairly short (#6).</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco trimmer that lasted several years and loved it.</li>
            <li> After you&#x27;ve used it about 3 or 4 times, you&#x27;ll really understand how to use it and love it.</li>
            <li> I think overall the trimmer is a good product</li>
            <li> The early reports of issues where the blade height adjusts itself on its own seem to be gone.  </li>
            <li> It looks cool.</li>
            <li> This is a good product overall</li>
            <li> I have had several Norelco products and all have been good.</li>
            <li> Works at full capacity even while plugged in and charging.      </li>
            <li> For the record, I maintain a full beard with this.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see how this product can work on full head of hair.    </li>
            <li> He gets a cool gadget, and I get a bearded, manly beast of a lover.  </li>
            <li> I would give it an overall good rating.</li>
            <li> I went on the web page for registration and they require you to answer a full privacy invasive survey to register the product.  </li>
            <li> Overall quality is good.</li>
            <li> Overall really good product.</li>
            <li> I ended-up replacing the batteries in my beloved T990 for about the same price as the T765.</li>
            <li> The trimmings are quick and clean.  </li>
            <li> Recharging has been done six times and unplugged when full charge is reached.    </li>
            <li> The nicad battery life is acceptable -- I get a week of trims on my full beard and moustache at the Turbo setting.  </li>
            <li> This razor is way to bulky and does not get close enough for a good trim for your mustache or goatee.</li>
            <li> Very durable and has lasted me for many years.</li>
            <li> Not a bad trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad trimmer, but it&#x27;s not what I was hoping for when I bought it.  </li>
            <li> Not bad</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the vacuum was more powerful and it was a bit quieter.</li>
            <li> The most surprising part is that the vacuum pump really does the job.</li>
            <li> That is, when using a very lighter touch than what I&#x27;m used to so that the teeth do not compress and sculpture the result.f switch is right on top, and a light touch will cycle it.</li>
            <li> its vacuum power is good...</li>
            <li> The vacuum works surprisingly well</li>
            <li> The one thing I will say is the vacuum is not quite as good as reviews said.     </li>
            <li> The good news is that it cuts my beard well, and the vacuum is not noisy.  </li>
            <li> The Vacuum Trimmer is a good idea.</li>
            <li> The vacuum on this worked fairly well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works surprisingly well, almost none of the clippings escape.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works well but not as good as i thought.</li>
            <li> A beard trimmer with a built-in vacuum to keep the trimmings from collecting all over your sink is a good thing.  </li>
            <li> The pieces come apart pretty easily and clean quickly.</li>
            <li> Mind you, if there was no vaccum my sink would be filled with black hairs, so having any type of vaccum is great.</li>
            <li> It works quite nicely, just as the previous trimmer worked nicely.</li>
            <li> It is nice not to have to do a major sink clean.    </li>
            <li> Price is right, no tax, free shipping...buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> And the battery ran the trimmer strongly throughout that first session.  </li>
            <li> It is easy to pick up and start operating as soon as it&#x27;s charged the first time.  </li>
            <li> After looking high and low and doing much research I am very happy with this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It trims very well, nice range of adjustable settings, vacuum feature really does work, good battery and charger.  </li>
            <li> It is somewhat large (not the best for travel) and it has trouble with hair along the curve of my jawline and on the thinner, softer hair on my cheek.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;low battery&#x27; and smart &#x27;charge&#x27; indicators are great.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Other than that it is a great trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Great gift for christmas or any other holiday.</li>
            <li> And the vacuum works fine, keep things tidy.  </li>
            <li> Well it leaves u goat-t clean and fresh looking.   </li>
            <li> Adjusts quickly.  </li>
            <li> This is an adequate trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I scoured the net looking for the perfect beard trimmer to trim my beard that I brough back from Iraq.  </li>
            <li> - The battery is adequate.  </li>
            <li> otherwise it works well, seldom needs recharging and does its job relatively quickly</li>
            <li> The shipment came quick and I got to test it out (waited an hour for it to fully charge) to see how it would perform and perform it</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an older Norelco trimmer for my husband and this one is much better.</li>
            <li> The T980 allows a quick and non-messy trim of my beard without the residue in the sink.  </li>
            <li> It works best in Turbo mode and is not really all that loud.  </li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is a big improvement over Norelco&#x27;s earlier version (which used to be the best beard trimmer on the market).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as professional trimmers, but doesn&#x27;t cost as much either.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- first the motor charged quickly and fine.  </li>
            <li> I picked the t980 because it has the 1 hour quick charge.  </li>
            <li> I just wish it actually cut better and with more consistency.</li>
            <li> I just bought the Norelco T980 after reading many reviews from many different products.</li>
            <li> This battery has many times the life of the older model it replaced after a month or so of use.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this trimmer much better than the older model he had.  </li>
            <li> Luckily he didn&#x27;t trim his mustache.</li>
            <li> There are more beard length settings on this one, but you can&#x27;t easily see them like you could on the T-3000, and more settings are not really needed.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t and would have like a place to sit the T980 where I can grab it for a quick trim.</li>
            <li> So enough said...  Buy it, it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful for the price, especially when paired with the nose/ear/brow trimmer that I bought in the package.</li>
            <li> but it does have a quick charge feature that takes about 1 hour.</li>
            <li> what I ment to say is that it quick to use when you are in hurry and nobody notices any difference between rgular blade and</li>
            <li> -The charge lasts for a looong time and recharge is really quick  </li>
            <li> This trimmer, overall, works very well and is a great buy for the money.  </li>
            <li> This unit does an entirely adequate job of beard trimming.  </li>
            <li> well--- battery holds charge and recharges quickly.  </li>
            <li> Charges quickly.</li>
            <li> just makes super noise.</li>
            <li> I am about my new purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, well built, durable, has features that are used, many beard length settings use and no need to pick up whiskers with vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> He says it works great and really likes the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> The best innovation in that ten year time span is the vacuum system for the T980.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that about 90% of the clippings go into the vacuum receptical with only about 10% being lost.  </li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer and the vacuum works really well.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t mind the beard trimmings everywhere, you will be happy with the T370, however if you are serious about perfect beard grooming (and I DO mean PERFECT), with none of the mess, both tools are a must.</li>
            <li> The coreless feature and Vacuum is awesome, but i need a little bit more.        </li>
            <li> This product is amazing easy to empty, clean and doesn&#x27;t need oil BUY ONE.</li>
            <li> Overall, I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I will say that this is much better to use than the Remington 3000 that I have seen selling for nearly $100 on Amazon (which I originally bought for $50).     </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> that sometimes it would catch on my skin more than the normal sized trimmer attachment.&lt;br</li>
            <li> This Product works great,much better than other bands i own.</li>
            <li> Overall we have been very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase, and you can&#x27;t beat it for under $30 shipped.</li>
            <li> Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Overall, very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to someone else too!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really loud either, when you consider how good it works.</li>
            <li> but I figured as long as it cut good</li>
            <li> and it has lasted a long time with good battery power.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend is happy that there isn&#x27;t hair all over the place anymore, and I&#x27;m happy that I don&#x27;t have to clean up (and apparently leave a lot behind, as my girlfriend likes to point out) hair scattered around the bathroom.    </li>
            <li> It provides a very clean trim, and the vacuum feature makes this product worthwhile over others (from what I can assume).  </li>
            <li> Overall, a great classic Norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not only a beard trimmer, but it will edge for you too, so you can get a nice clean neck line or shape up your sideburns.  </li>
            <li> A battery keeps its charge very well and a recharge process is easy and quick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quick, easy to use, and the adjustable settings make it very versatile.  </li>
            <li> this shaver gets clogged very easily and if you want to make precise trims, you need to remove the one attachment and add the smaller one on.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of the T980 turbo vacuum trimmer.</li>
            <li> Battery life so far has been good, noticeably better than the older model even when it was new.  </li>
            <li> Overall a great product and a highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> Trims with ease and very clean.  ~Highly</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to make trimming a new experience or solve the world&#x27;s problems, but it&#x27;s a competent trimmer that reduces some of the clean-up.</li>
            <li> I bought the new T980 and really love it.</li>
            <li> All in all I am pleased with the new model.</li>
            <li> I had used another Norelco trimmer for many years and had been looking for a new one for some time.</li>
            <li> price is right on this thing, and it LOOKS sweet.   </li>
            <li> I could use a sturdier carrying case and maybe a slightly stronger vaccum, but even with those niggling complaints this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the T980 for a year and a half and it still works great.  </li>
            <li> Perfect tool for trimming long or short beard/ mustache.  </li>
            <li> Overall this trimmer is pretty good, but is not the all-in-one trimmer that I was looking for.  </li>
            <li> Very adaptable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The motor is strong, giving a very even cut.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve trained my battery correctly from the start (turn it on and leave it to expend itself when I opened the box and then give it the first good, solid nights charge).      </li>
            <li> This shaver keeps your girlfriend from yelling at you about hair every where and never loses power or charge it is the most useful product i have bought in years</li>
            <li> Not sure how this thing got so many good reviews.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fast and easy.  </li>
            <li> The adjustable comb tilts easily, and the whole head can be removed and replaced without any effort at all.  </li>
            <li> This thing is super powerful.    </li>
            <li> Fast and easy to use.</li>
            <li> It may not capture every single hair, but I would say it gets a good 90-95% of them.  </li>
            <li> Even at the normal setting, the vacuum works great.  </li>
            <li> the vacuum feature is pretty good</li>
            <li> Simple is better!</li>
            <li> So assuming you can figure out how to work this product correctly, it should do exactly what you need it to!</li>
            <li> It works pretty well for this!</li>
            <li> Which when cleaning up the sink so as to not put a hair-ball down the drain, it is a very nice assist.    </li>
            <li> Exceptionally well thought out, simple design is very user friendly.  </li>
            <li> The best part is that with the vacuum action, there&#x27;s no mess to clean up around the sink - and it works.     </li>
            <li> It will work much better if clean, so make sure you use the little brush that comes with it to clean it well, removing the blade.  </li>
            <li> Long run time between charges, great vacuum, easy to clean, and</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not an expert but do think the T980 works fine to very well.</li>
            <li> It is not difficult to clean.</li>
            <li> Making daily grooming easy, with easy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If you want to get a clean shave, go ahead and purchase this product, because that is exactly what you will have to do after using it.</li>
            <li> that being said, i really don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;Tom Selleck\\&quot; stache, so It works fine for me....</li>
            <li> It takes a little learning, but is otherwise great.  </li>
            <li> The little accessory neck trimmer works great for touch ups between haircuts, but the vacume does not work at all with that attachement in place.</li>
            <li> Anyway, this is a great little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this little product so far.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; feature on the T980 works somewhat better than the earlier unit: it does not catch everything, but certainly captures most of the clippings.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer works very well, and the included narrow trimmer is very good for trimming mustaches.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum and turbo vacuum featured on this model are an interesting new rendition, and they do a fair job capturing most (not all) of the shavings.  </li>
            <li> It works better than former models and hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck behind the mechanism any more...  Very good product.</li>
            <li> It lacks a multi-LED charge indicator, but does have a \\&quot;Low\\&quot; battery warning light (+ a Charge light) &amp; the unit will still run for several beard trimmings once the warning light comes on.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for quite a few months now and it has been great.  </li>
            <li> It cuts well, and accurately, although it does take me a while because you have to keep going over the beard to make sure all the hairs are cut to the same length.</li>
            <li> After buying this amazing trimmer, I will never go back.</li>
            <li> I have owned the Norelco T980 for a few months now, and it is great.  </li>
            <li> Even when the battery light does begin to blink, what it really means to say is,</li>
            <li> But overall, nice product.  </li>
            <li> It is worth it 100%</li>
            <li> It also has an attachment for more precise areas such as the mustache area.  </li>
            <li> He has said that it is much better than his old trimmer in that it floats closer to all areas of his face and</li>
            <li> I own an earlier model, which I prefer, but the battery died.</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> The battery provides a couple week&#x27;s worth of uses before it needs recharging, which takes a bit over an hour.  </li>
            <li> worth it.</li>
            <li> but because the trimmer is so large, it isn&#x27;t good for trimming the mustache area right above the lip.  </li>
            <li> , I think, it is still worth.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  </li>
            <li> Has a useful attachment for shaping beard.</li>
            <li> The smaller clipper is a nice size for trimming areas around your nose and lip.  </li>
            <li> I was surprised how much better this version is.</li>
            <li> I love it because it&#x27;s a lot quieter than his old one</li>
            <li> Perhaps this item would not dangerously overheat, maybe it would just lessen the life of the batteries.</li>
            <li> I really want to be fair and objective, but i have to admit</li>
            <li> I was having success.</li>
            <li> He rarely (if ever) goes to the barber anymore.  </li>
            <li> This Beard Trimmer is well worth the money.  </li>
            <li> So I made sure to pick a model that could be used by either recharging or plugged in directly.    </li>
            <li> The guard also comes off, and you can even replace the &#x27;shaver&#x27; with a smaller, more detailed &#x27;shaver&#x27; (which comes with it).  </li>
            <li> What I like most about it is the option to plug in to AC directly and not have to wait for the charge.      </li>
            <li> The trimmer blades work very well and the unit is so quiet even surprisingly on the turbo setting.  </li>
            <li> The attachment is useful for stray hairs in the nose and ears and for edging a moustache.  </li>
            <li> This means that because I broke two cents worth of plastic, I now have to toss out a $40 beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Just be sure to take a minute out of your abnormally busy day to read the instructions and precautions and maintenance tips to prolong the life of this thing.</li>
            <li> so far the battery life has been outstanding.</li>
            <li> Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> This one is much better because it has a light that comes on when the battery is low.  </li>
            <li> If you are careful this will be a good trimmer for you.</li>
            <li> I gave this product one star because the trimmer works very well, but I have had many trimmers that worked very well.</li>
            <li> Very much worth the price.</li>
            <li> main thing I like with this trimmer is that its not bulky and easily fits into my shaving kit.</li>
            <li> It trims evenly, is quiet and handy.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t cut quit as low as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> Only had it for a week or so but works great so far.  </li>
            <li> If you are not pressed for time, the T980 is a lot of fun to use.</li>
            <li> However, it does collect by far most of the cut hairs.  </li>
            <li> I bought an Oster trimmer for nearly the same price on amazon and been supremely happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have had several trimmers and I would say this one does a nice job..</li>
            <li> From my perspective, it seems to be a marketing tool designed to convince guys that they&#x27;re getting a really powerful, studly shaver.</li>
            <li> definately worth buying.</li>
            <li> Never really got a good shave out of this.  </li>
            <li> Powerful.  </li>
            <li> Now worth 5 stars.  </li>
            <li> easy clean up because of the vaccum action.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used quite a few shavers, and this one has been the best so far.</li>
            <li> One suggestion: be sure to save the box and receipts so you can get it fixed or replaced with whatever warranty they offer.</li>
            <li> But, by far, my favorite thing about this trimmer is the way it feels.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud, but so are most trimmers....</li>
            <li> When you see the red light come on after turning the unit off -- figure you have one more trim at Turbo speed.  </li>
            <li> I did not experience the problems most frequently reported by others.  </li>
            <li> I suppose something like this is necessary from an engineering point of view to get the vaccum to work effectively.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect, nor should that be expected.  </li>
            <li> -look my own hair, if you use this on your hair aside from your beard, some hairs get stuck and clog the opening of the vacuum that leads to the chamber, you have to remove the clippers and cutters to remove it.  </li>
            <li> The hair vacuum capability is a nice plus.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature was nice</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a nice feature, it simplifies cleanup.  </li>
            <li> I settled on getting him this Norelco trimmer because of the vacuum feature, something he really liked in the Wahl.</li>
            <li> I liked the MB400, because it gave me a close stuble shave, its vacuum worked well</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is nice and works well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a nice touch.</li>
            <li> The T980 has the dial up cut length that locks in place, the vacuum is a nice touch although it still doesn&#x27;t get all the clippings.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is a nice feature which keeps the hair from falling in the sink or on the floor.</li>
            <li> vacuum is about 90% effective.  </li>
            <li> I get a close trim, never pulls the hair on my face, easy to clean and no mess.</li>
            <li> the vacuum is a nice touch.  </li>
            <li> The Vacuum feature is nice, as it gets 98% of my hair.</li>
            <li> The vacuum and the turbo speed is nice.</li>
            <li> The vacuum catches about 80% of the hair which is really nice.    </li>
            <li> I researched beard trimmers and the customer reviews I found were very positive for this model.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a set of exceptionally well designed tabs and slots that quickly correct a hurried approach and seat the grille home with a satisfying, subtle click.      </li>
            <li> This is a fine trimmer with no serious draw backs.</li>
            <li> It trims my beard and moustache adequately and to the length I want, but not on first pass.  </li>
            <li> so it makes a more clean and efficient trim than his last one.  </li>
            <li> The precision trim head extends away from the body of the trimmer more than the standard one, making it easier to clean up errant hair.    </li>
            <li> Overall, this is probably a decent to good trimmer for longer hair lengths, but if you are looking for anything nearing a close shave, avoid this model.   </li>
            <li> If you contort you wrists and elbows you can get a fairly close trim on setting 1, but it is a giant pain to have to keep twisting and turning this trimmer around to achieve an even halfway decent trim.</li>
            <li> this was not a big deal to be as the first and the most important to me was a trimmer that did the job, which would be the bulk of the rating.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, a good buy.</li>
            <li> Other than that is a good product.</li>
            <li> Other options for triming around lips good.</li>
            <li> Good battery, sharp cutter.</li>
            <li> Well it looks good and outperforms my other one by battery power and performance.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if you could manually lock this shield down when doing fine edge trim.  </li>
            <li> also the vaccuum is a great feature where the hair just gets sucked into a clear little compartment that is easily emptied.</li>
            <li> I love the vacuum, as it eliminates almost all clean up after trimming my beard.</li>
            <li> I love the vacuum feature which makes clean up a breeze.  </li>
            <li> You have to make sure you clean it often or it will clog up the vacuum and your beards will fall all over the place.</li>
            <li> It is cumbersome to shave the hair right under your nose</li>
            <li> Received this trimmer and went right to the instruction book.  </li>
            <li> not like the feel of the unit right out of the box either</li>
            <li> The Amazon price seems about right for what it is.</li>
            <li> Price was definitely right.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m still trying to get the trim length right.</li>
            <li> Yeah, right.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat</li>
            <li> Maybe one day they can get this design right.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all right there.    </li>
            <li> In my estimation, their aspirations to achieve the fancy \\&quot;vacuum effect\\&quot; has clouded what should be their primary goal with this device: to trim facial hair EVENLY and EFFECTIVELY!  </li>
            <li> The carrying case is pretty useful    for the price its worth it</li>
            <li> Overall, great product, no regrets.</li>
            <li> It works as advertised, does everything it claims to do, is both easy to use &amp; easy to clean, holds a charge for quite a while, and I have had absolutely no complaints about it.  </li>
            <li> The tray was much easier to clean out thoroughly.      </li>
            <li> I have been using Norelco Trimmers for the past 30 years and I could say that the Norelco T980 is among the best so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using the normal mode and it just works fine,</li>
            <li> If you plan to travel outside the USA make sure you have a full charge and do not run out of juice while away.</li>
            <li> I wonder if all these reviews are pertaining to this particular model, some reviews dont sound like my unit.</li>
            <li> Have no need for the turbo mode, works fine in normal mode.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, the product works well, feels solid in my hands, and it looks cool :-).  </li>
            <li> ; for me it works just fine at the normal setting.  </li>
            <li> Of course it did not catch all of the hair; however, I would say it got about 90% of it which really eased the clean up.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is probably the best part - everyone knows how much hair goes everywhere when you trim your beard, but this one significantly cuts down on that.</li>
            <li> power button is very sensitive and an inadvertant flick of a finger easily shuts off (or turns on trimmer).</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to adjust the setting for different lengths as well.</li>
            <li> I use the #5 setting for a nice short trimmed beard look -- more than stubble, but not a long beard.</li>
            <li> It is good for facial hair,wont recommend for your body hair, the vacuum tube clogs up really easy.</li>
            <li> I have no other product to compare, but can&#x27;t imagine finding another that would do the job better.  </li>
            <li> And the price was pretty damn reasonable, too!!</li>
            <li> I was particularly interested because the reviews stated it could be used plugged in or unplugged and that the vacuum feature was effective in reducing the level of flung trimmings.  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical about whether or not the vacuum would be able to get most of the falling hair, but it does a very good job.</li>
            <li> Works great on any length beard and vacuum feature eliminates most of the mess.</li>
            <li> This item holds a charge for a very long time and the vacuum functionality works very good..</li>
            <li> I decided to replace the whole unit with the new version and am so glad I did.</li>
            <li> This is not so much a reflection on the product, but more of a: \\&quot;keep in mind, you&#x27;ll have to adjust to this new product&#x27;s height - it doesn&#x27;t adjust to you\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> The two things I like the most about this trimmer would be the vacuum feature (actually gets about 90% or more of the hair) and the smooth feeling it gives you when you use it.  </li>
            <li> Very little cleanup required afterwards - makes for a happy spouse.</li>
            <li> Finally, the trimmer comes with a travel bag for easy storage on trips which I thought was thoughtful.</li>
            <li> definitely better made and better performing than previous Norelcos.  </li>
            <li> It needs to be built more simply, more durable, less prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> The only thing I am not inlove with is, and that it has a super rechargeable battery which will have to be removed one day and recycled appropriately.  </li>
            <li> and I am happy as always when buying small electronics from amazon.  </li>
            <li> My old Panasonic was awesome and lasted several years but died last year</li>
            <li> In general, it&#x27;s a worthwhile</li>
            <li> If not for the great vacum not much better then the $19.99 trimer at CVS.</li>
            <li> (I think the stubble is actually a bit longer) though it is much MUCH faster and more comfortable to use.  </li>
            <li> My husband has a full beard and mustache and likes to keep it neatly groomed very close to his skin</li>
            <li> having to remove the general trimmer and replace it with the mini trimmer is more of a PITA than I thought it would be.  </li>
            <li> Yet it must be removed each time one wants to use the smaller, more accurate trimming blade.</li>
            <li> I have always been happy in the past and the T980 is no exception to that.</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t take that long to change, but I could see where this might be an aggravation for a sideburn/goatee&#x27; kind of guy.</li>
            <li> Ergonomics are pretty good on this one but it may take a while to get used to it if you have been using other brands.</li>
            <li> Seems to have a nice long battery life too; I don&#x27;t have to charge it up every time I get done using it.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s never a mess to clean up!  </li>
            <li> Although I am not sure why you need a turbo button, when it seems to me it should be on full vacuum all the time, it is an excellent beard and mustache trimmer/shaver.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to use, works very well, and I have no regrets at all with it&#x27;s purchase.</li>
            <li> Overall, good power, never pulls hairs, sharp blades, and the vaccum does its job for the most part.</li>
            <li> I have own various Norelco Vacuum Trimmers in the past and this one is the best yet.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t I just take the new, free unit?  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fairly large and and bulky, like the charger!</li>
            <li> It makes it easier to groom your beard to exactly the right length.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer ([[ASIN:B000UCBFKW Norelco T980 turbo vacuum beard and moustache trimmer.]]) is very fine, and I have no complaints at all about</li>
            <li> Overall a great product especially for the money.</li>
            <li> shave is quick and the receptacle really does seem to catch upwards of 95% of what I&#x27;m using.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and it is simple and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I had a previous model of this trimmer and loved it.  </li>
            <li> Comfortable settings available for different trims.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the trimmer, love that I can walk around my room and clean my beard without spilling shards of dead cells everywhere.</li>
            <li> It is far too easy to accidentally switch the level of shave.</li>
            <li> It is more powerful and somewhat bigger.  </li>
            <li> It cuts cleanly and consistently, far better than my old Braun.</li>
            <li> My Norelco T900 was great, but broke recently, so I went out looking for another one, only to find it was discontinued.</li>
            <li> They did one good thing this time and actually made the beard reservoir window clear.</li>
            <li> I was using an older Norelco model of this device and was happy with it except that now it was so old that it was acting up.</li>
            <li> * of loud, but honestly, a shaver is loud regardless.    </li>
            <li> T980 issues: The electronic power and turbo switches are touch sensitive and too easy to press while trimming.</li>
            <li> It will be more economical than a 5 blade razor if it only lasts about year.    </li>
            <li> It does a good job at keeping the hair out of the sink, but its placement sets the trimmer so far back from the guard that using this trimmer on setting 2</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really see that the spring and hinge arrangement is very useful, and without it the trimmer might be less bulky and feel more secure.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is straightforward as all the pieces come apart and go back together pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I can only say that it works great, does what its supposed to do, and I would never, ever buy any product without the vacuum.</li>
            <li> Happily, however, such is not the case with the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.      </li>
            <li> highly recommend this shaver if you are wanting a clean, neat trim.</li>
            <li> It just minimizes the mess, and it&#x27;s good though.</li>
            <li> Why mess with a good thing?</li>
            <li> As with all shavers I have not been able to catch the hair right below my nose - and thus require and additional device (the flip up here is still too big...).    </li>
            <li> yes, it does capture quite a bit of hair when you&#x27;re trimming a longer beard (making clean up a bit easier), but this does not mean that hair does not fall.</li>
            <li> The little detail cutter is easy to attach and does a great job of defining the beard area and also clipping any stray hairs under the nose where the big cutter head cannot reach.    </li>
            <li> one charging gives me 2 weeks easily, now the deal is, i dont have full beard, i use it to trim my french beard and sometimes use it on armpits</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s performance and very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> Recharging time is very reasonable, unlike some of these trimmers.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job with the trimming itself (I rarely shave, I just occasionally trim with this), and it definitely reduces the amount of hairs left lying all over the sink when I&#x27;m done, making cleanup easier, but it is still required.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very light and fragile basket.  </li>
            <li> I decided to get this Norelco for its vac feature because with the Braun, it was kind of a pain to clean up all the little hairs on the sink after each use.  </li>
            <li> &#x27;Tornadoes&#x27; super warm beard trimmer and nose waxer was developed in the climates of Southern Arabia where men are known to never shave.</li>
            <li> As far as trimming goes, does a fine job.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Tornadoes&#x27; super warm beard trimmer and nose waxer was developed in the climates of Southern Arabia where men are known to never shave.</li>
            <li> With some patience and a bit of mess it does a pretty good job at trimming.</li>
            <li> Vacuum actually get 90% of clippings, huge plus!!!</li>
            <li> They (Norelco) wanted more to put new batteries in my Norelco 7500 trimmer then the cost of a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> Update: 3 years old and like new!  </li>
            <li> The charge lasts a long time and pulling it apart for cleaning is very easy.</li>
            <li> My wife loved the vacum feature since it kept the sink a little cleaner.</li>
            <li> the T980 is generally a good little trimmer.</li>
            <li> Battery time is good, easier to handle, its a little</li>
            <li> Although I wasn&#x27;t interested in a vacuum trimmer I have to say that the vacuum works better than I thought it would and actually turned out to be a welcome benefit ie.</li>
            <li> It was pretty quick and easy to shape up my goatee and actually make it look presentable on the first try.</li>
            <li> In addition it allows me to make a smooth line where I trim the beard completely.</li>
            <li> I started shaving my head over ten years ago and I am so glad I found the T980.  </li>
            <li> Mostly used for personal body grooming.</li>
            <li> The first one that I bought (as a gift for my boyfriend) stopped functioning after it was used 5-6 times.</li>
            <li> First, the highest setting is about 3/4\\&quot;</li>
            <li> I would recommend that this be the first one you try</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> It does a nice job, as I expected.</li>
            <li> overall performance of this shaver more than makes up for this one shortcoming.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> I first bought a 10 piece/change attachments/thin plastic trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t catch 100%, but it gets pretty close.  </li>
            <li> go for higher philips models...</li>
            <li> Overall it is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> As far a detailed trimmer</li>
            <li> and my first time using it</li>
            <li> Its exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li> This is probably the result of the aforementioned greater distance between the edge of the stationary and moving blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this trimmer after going through many bargain basement off the shelf beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> switch too much!</li>
            <li> (I learned to check this out first)  </li>
            <li> I found that I look better if I use two heights for different areas.  </li>
            <li> This is my first beard (mustaches aplenty over the years before now), and I used the reviews here to select a beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> overall, i am satisfied to the core.</li>
            <li> First, a disclaimer.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps I did not see the distinction at first, but I see that others purchase this unit as a clipper as well.  </li>
            <li> By trimming twice a week, it keeps my beard at a consistent neat length.</li>
            <li> First one lasted about 5 years.</li>
            <li> I love the fact that I can use it corded or cordless beacuse sooner or later the battery is not charged or dies.  </li>
            <li> Simple to use, and many hair length settings.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still on the first charge so time will tell.</li>
            <li> stands 1/2 - 1 inch higher than it should.  </li>
            <li> As far as what it&#x27;s designed to do, I don&#x27;t think the turbo feature works any better than normal mode.  </li>
            <li> Yes it happened to me first time I used it.</li>
            <li> How hot would it get in the suitcase if it does come on and run 45 minutes?</li>
            <li> How hot would it get in the suitcase if it does come on and run 45 minutes?</li>
            <li> I subsequently bought a Wahl product and found it to be much better.</li>
            <li> first I noticed the flimsy bag which was shin and would not protect the machine against bumps.</li>
            <li> After starting to trim on a safe level 6</li>
            <li> but could not make out the numbers at first.</li>
            <li> I contacted the company and they told me that they would do nothing to help me since i bought it over 2 years ago (2.5 yrs ago to be exact).</li>
            <li> If not, sorry ;)    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always prefered trimming short than shaving mostly because its easier on my skin and doesn&#x27;t give me acne.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through this before, you are doomed to a useful life measured in months before the battery (and therefore the whole trimmer) craps out.     </li>
            <li> First trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly to use on my beard, which grows quickly.</li>
            <li> My beard is very coarse, and tends to jam up most trimmers.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s better to use this more often on smaller jobs than waiting to do a bigger trim.</li>
            <li> The first time I set it to \\&quot;4\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it capture a lot of the hair but enough of it drop out too.</li>
            <li> It does the job pretty well.</li>
            <li> Seems like they concentrate on that feature more than the basic design.  </li>
            <li> , it feels rather cheap (which it is), unlike my old unit.  </li>
            <li> Removing and installing the guide was a bit tricky at first</li>
            <li> Battery holds its charge pretty well.</li>
            <li> I told them that&#x27;s just damn nuts, and I don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re willing to do</li>
            <li> /&gt;Otherwise, it works pretty well.</li>
            <li> This is the first one I have had which sucks the trimmings into a built-in container, which is a great idea.  </li>
            <li> However, if you set it up correctly (not difficult), then no problem occurs.    </li>
            <li> With the length guard removed you can get pretty close</li>
            <li> but if you want no hair there you&#x27;ll need to resort to trimming to zero length then shaping with a razor (while not perfect in that it can&#x27;t do it all, the results are perfect)!    </li>
            <li> At first I thought that this thing just doesn&#x27;t cut hair well.</li>
            <li> The first 3-4 times I used this trimmer</li>
            <li> This is my first beard trimmer for use with my first beard.  </li>
            <li> Even though this is my first beard, I know trimmings tend to go everywhere when trimming a beard.  </li>
            <li> It replaced the first one which I dropped and broke.  </li>
            <li> My beard has gone from 3-inch length to 1/4 inch length, rough tracing my own growth from a 20-something college kid to an AARP neophyte.</li>
            <li> For a first time beard grower this was just what the doctor ordered.  </li>
            <li> I would give it 5 stars, but this is my first trimmer and have nothing to measure against.  </li>
            <li> This is the first electric trimmer I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Funny thing about the attachments.</li>
            <li> I just used it for the first time and have decided that I will never use a razor again.  </li>
            <li> I do agree with others about the initial awkwardness of trimming with the comb-like top guide part off.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;- T980 Trim settings are almost exact to the T860&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> This is the first where you can trim while charging.  </li>
            <li> Overall, I am satisfied with the product, but there are some caveats.    </li>
            <li> First of all, it&#x27;s a well-made product.  </li>
            <li> I had but better in several ways.  </li>
            <li> I bought the first T100 which used 2 AA batteries.</li>
            <li> Also:  The directions say that charging more than necessary will reduce battery life.  </li>
            <li> First used it when my hair was \\&quot;long\\&quot; - 1/4\\&quot;+ - and the vac sucked up the all the clippings.  </li>
            <li> The only problem I have is the top flap on hair collecting chamber came off at the joint where it swivel.</li>
            <li> the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode on this puppy REALLY vuccums!  </li>
            <li> The trimmer works pretty well.  </li>
            <li> so during my first trim, it ruined my goatee.  </li>
            <li> It trims well and the mini-shaver is still the best way to shave the short hairs on my cheeks above my beard on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly what I needed.</li>
            <li> This was a gift I gave to my son-in-law, but he has told me several times how much he is enjoying it.  </li>
            <li> the vac only OK.</li>
            <li> however, this is not why i buy a beard trimmer in the first place.  </li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  </li>
            <li> exactly cuts.</li>
            <li> Definitely much better than Wahl at double price.</li>
            <li> The battery is also pretty reliable.</li>
            <li> Trying to catch the hair is good, but this is not a good design for precise</li>
            <li> You would be better off buying a set of clippers with the different guards and trimming your beard that way.</li>
            <li> The first time I opened the Norelco compartment</li>
            <li> I have still not drained the initial charge, but it is a much better trimmer than the Wahl ever was.</li>
            <li> Even shortest trim level doesn&#x27;t allow me to short my beard as I wished, but I could manage it by removing the comb on top of the blade.</li>
            <li> Makes it still very convenient to travel with too!  </li>
            <li> These trimmers have come along way since I bought my first one.</li>
            <li> Whichever comes first.     </li>
            <li> Trimming whiskers used to be such a chore that the ZZ Top look began to show some sense, if not appeal.  </li>
            <li> Most generate just a bit of wind, sufficient to scatter your whiskers over the widest possible surface.  </li>
            <li> I had to duct tape mine to make sure that this doesn&#x27;t constantly happen.</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer I have used.  </li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had turn on the power thinking it was in Tubro mode and accidentally hit the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button this and was like what the heck.    </li>
            <li> And, unlike most trimmers in this price range don&#x27;t allow you to use the cord when the battery gets low.</li>
            <li> When putting the comb back on the trimmer, make sure it responds to the height adjustment ring.</li>
            <li> My first impression at taking my $44 trimmer out the box, was \\&quot;Gee, this feels cheap.\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m overall pleased with it.</li>
            <li> I will be interested to see how well the blades hold up to the \\&quot;ever-sharp\\&quot; claim.  </li>
            <li> This is my first Philips Norelco product.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least three years now and it still works great.  </li>
            <li> battery life is good and if it goes dead you can run the trimmer off of the charging cord.    </li>
            <li> - The vacuum picks up more than 90% of the clippings, leaving the bathroom sink nearly hair free.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum part works really well and doesn&#x27;t leave too much hair in the sink, and DH gets a nice, even trim.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature works best in turbo mode, which is louder, but not enough for me to mind it, personally.</li>
            <li> This is a great product,the only downfall I see is the vacuum guard in front of razors gets in the way of making straight lines.  </li>
            <li> My fiance is quite pleased with this vacuum trimmer-</li>
            <li> and I Love the vacuum for not leaving hair everywhere.  </li>
            <li> The device does vacuum most of the beard, but not all.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum catches most, but not all the clipped hairs.  </li>
            <li> Another added bennifit is that my husband said the vacuum seems to make the hair stand up better just before it&#x27;s cut</li>
            <li> The magic in it is the vacuum that captures and stores</li>
            <li> i love the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> I love the vacuum.  </li>
            <li> It cuts hair well, most all of the hair gets sucked in by the vacuum feature</li>
            <li> The vacuum picks up most, but not all, hair.</li>
            <li> I like the vacuum although it doesn&#x27;t get 100% of hairs it does get most.</li>
            <li> it can be done, it just takes more effort than before; again I think its the price you pay for the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li> I chose this trimmer mostly because of the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li> turns out the vacuum gets about 90% of the hairs -certainly better than nothing.  </li>
            <li> i love the fact that it has a vacuum on it.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, I love the vacuum aspect.</li>
            <li> The turbo vacuum catches most of the hair,</li>
            <li> I love the vacuum, it even gives a bit of a coolin effect.  </li>
            <li> I love that it has a vacuum suction for the trimmed hair</li>
            <li> I also found that the vacuum works much better on longer hair then on shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> I absolutely love the vacuum function.</li>
            <li> Amazon was very understanding and offered me a new one free.</li>
            <li> I used to have an old Norelco trimmer that used for years until it just wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore and bought this as the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; replacement and for the most part . . .</li>
            <li> This fantastic tool takes care of that for you leaving absolutely no mess on the bathroom counter.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer has a wide variety of trim lengths, doesn&#x27;t need to be charged frequently, is very comfortable to use, and even has a vacuum that makes clean-up VERY easy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been through several other kinds of trimmers over the years, but this one is by far the best.</li>
            <li> It works really well and priced right.  </li>
            <li> As such, I am downgrading the original 3-star rating to ONE-STAR and changing my review title from \\&quot;It&#x27;s Just OK\\&quot; to reflect my true feelings about this product.</li>
            <li> If you trim with this thing quickly on the &#x27;normal&#x27; trimming mode, it&#x27;ll catch maybe 75% of your hair in the vaccuum.</li>
            <li> With the twist action settings on this razor, I quickly change settings and get my beard right every time.  </li>
            <li> It cleans easily, and captures a good amount of hair to prevent a giant sink mess.</li>
            <li> It has a &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; boost setting, but I rarely ever use it; it does a fine job on regular speed.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works great and catches all the loose hair during the trimming process.  </li>
            <li> The beard trimmer is pretty good, but has trouble getting really close under my nose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times however it cuts nicely and has a small attachment which is nice for trimming and getting close to skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had various Norelco&#x27;s over the past couple decades and they all work wonderful fo a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Overall it looks good and it charges from empty to full in an hour.</li>
            <li> I definitely feel that I got my money&#x27;s worth when I purchased this product!!</li>
            <li> so decide on that before buying if u need complete clean shave like look..</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t liked is that the hair container is SUPER fragile.</li>
            <li> it works excellent has a pretty strong charge you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> The provided pre-set lengths are pretty good and usually work for the style I need.  </li>
            <li> Spent more than planned, but well worth it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap, and has barely any material supporting it.</li>
            <li> I do wish the turbo button was in a different spot on the handle, as it turns on accidentally very easily, but I can live with that.</li>
            <li> And last, but not least, my original impression of this being an overpriced piece of cheap plastic does count.</li>
            <li> While the little vacumn may seem like a gimmick, it actually works very well compared to not using a vacumn at all - don&#x27;t expect perfection - BUT it is very good.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts for weeks and the vacuum, though loud, is EXTREMELY effective.  </li>
            <li> Says the vacuum feature works very well, and that he is able to keep his beard at an even length.  </li>
            <li> The razor cuts well, fast, and can do very straight lines</li>
            <li> The old battery was weakening, and when I saw the Philips special promotion on Amazon, I decided it was time for an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have spent many $$ looking for the right trimmer...........</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature would be great if it got all the hairs, but it only gets some of them, so kind of pointless.  </li>
            <li> It does a nice job, but has way too many little, fragile parts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nicer than my old Norelco, and it even trims a little better too :)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews.</li>
            <li> Reviews were mostly positive and I agree.</li>
            <li> I read all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I admit that I use my old electric razor for the trim around the mouth and the part of the cheeks kept clean, takes a few seconds, and maybe every 2 weeks a couple of minutes with a safety razor to make sure that the clean area hasn&#x27;t shrunk.</li>
            <li> The circumference is large; it&#x27;s a pretty large clipper.  </li>
            <li> The end result is better than nothing, but not a complete solution.    </li>
            <li> It does indeed capture pretty much all of the cut hair which saves clean-up time afterwards.  </li>
            <li> really* shorter and that part of your beard will look funny at work a couple days.</li>
            <li> and if you really buy after reading all this, i&#x27;m not sorry for you because you didn&#x27;t listen and you&#x27;ll just have to return it.  </li>
            <li> The title pretty much says it all.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum gets the vast majority of the hair, it&#x27;s super easy to clean and keeps a charge well.  </li>
            <li> the carrying case they included was useful during travel too and accommodates other toiletries. :)</li>
            <li> This trimmer does pretty much everything I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought my first Philips Norelco  trimmer in 1993 and it worked very well.</li>
            <li> This newer, top-of-the-line T980 is pretty much what I&#x27;ve been looking for.</li>
            <li> He now has no problem finding the correct length trimmer guides or deal with a pile of clippings because the trimmer pretty much takes care of that for him.</li>
            <li> Bottom line up front: this thing trims and has lots of nice features, but is not worth leaving a working trimmer in the trash for.    </li>
            <li> it was a good trimmer overall, though I really didn&#x27;t like have to switch out the trimmer heads for the standard</li>
            <li> In anycase so far so good and does seem well made as my other Norelco products.</li>
            <li> It may be a tad louder than normal trimmers but its worth it.  </li>
            <li> you&#x27;re using an older Norelco trimmer similar to this one and have been pleased with it</li>
            <li> This model works as well as or better than an earlier one for which I bought this as a replacement (the older battery would no longer hold a charge).</li>
            <li> The vacuum does an exceptional job, especially in the turbo mode.</li>
            <li> This particular model had a built in vacuum - I figured it was more of a gimic than anything</li>
            <li> The vacuum works better on this one than my older Norelco.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going strong with a powerful battery and the suction of loose hair even allows me to shave in the car when I&#x27;m pressed for time.</li>
            <li> I love these - easy to use, quality cut, holds a charge for months, less mess that most.  </li>
            <li> Solid feel, the vacuum feature definitely reduces the amount of hair in the sink (and on the counter, on the floor, etc.), the Turbo mode, while loud, is awesome.  </li>
            <li> The one downfall of this one is that the plastic guard is far enough from the cutter that it stops him from getting a good trim right under the nose, but that is the same with all trimmers depending on what length setting you have it on.  </li>
            <li> The size and shape is comfortable; the vaccum, although not perfect, keeps your work area neat and relatively clean; the turbo function is a nice additional feature.</li>
            <li> After finding the setting best for me it has been consistent in cutting.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the adjustable settings that are easy to change.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with a nice black carrying case.  </li>
            <li> however design leaves a bit to be desired, e.g., the on/off button and the &#x27;turbo&#x27; button are easily and unintentionally turned on or off -- should have been recessed or different switch device used; similarly, the trim adjustment wheel shifts from one setting to another way to easy.</li>
            <li> It is easy to adjust, relatively quite, vacumms up the cuttings quite well.  </li>
            <li> The height guide and standard trim head slip off easily (5 seconds or less-literally).  </li>
            <li> Easy to pop off, dump in trash, and pop back on.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I recently grew a goatee and was looking for a no-nonsense, easy to use trimmer that would not break the bank</li>
            <li> (and I don&#x27;t have very steady</li>
            <li> However, I liked the way the Remington could sit on the sink counter in the vertical position, taking up less counter space.</li>
            <li> The clean-out and length of cut adjustment are easy enough to use.  </li>
            <li> and I was able to assemble the trimmer back to normal working order.</li>
            <li> It adjusts easy and is quiet.  </li>
            <li> I found you&#x27;re better off with dry hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still going strong after several years.  </li>
            <li> He has a pretty thick beard and while the vacuum part isn&#x27;t as good as I had hoped, it picks up a lot more than a normal razor.</li>
            <li> (it doesn&#x27;t seem to be dedicated to holding each part in a certain place, but instead it holds everything in one pouch).      </li>
            <li> The on/off switch is too large</li>
            <li> (That&#x27;s a smart design.)</li>
            <li> Also, the power brick is a bit large, and there&#x27;s no included charging base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A bit large</li>
            <li> I use a little more care when fine trimming than with my older model, but the extra seconds aren&#x27;t too much hassle and the results are fantastic.    </li>
            <li> On the other hand, its amazing at any other length, which is why I was still able to give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> Emptying the vacuum chamber is easy though.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum works well in sucking up 95% of the trimmings and is easily cleaned.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months - first such trimmer I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;ve liked it quite a bit.  </li>
            <li> Works well and easily and vacuum element keeps beard trimmings from dirtying shirt.</li>
            <li> I have already paid for the trimmer, because with the vacuum feature, I can shave my head easily myself, saving $19:00 per head-shave.</li>
            <li> Good product - vacuum (no stray bits of hair), self-sharpinging, holds a long charge, works in close quarters, very competative price</li>
            <li> It is both necessary to catch most of the hair and very loud.</li>
            <li> guarantee maybe I can calm down and decide if I like the unit - sure don&#x27;t like the service so far!!!</li>
            <li> I thought this was simply a manufacturing fluke when I first bought it, so I returned the trimmer directly to Norelco (very friendly service).  </li>
            <li> Battery life seems fine, haven&#x27;t needed to charge it since the initial charging.  </li>
            <li> So all in all, this trimmer is a fine replacement; dare I say upgrade to my last trimmer, it is said, \\&quot;You get what you pay</li>
            <li> The vacuum function works very well capturing the clippings easily.  </li>
            <li> It also comes with different size removable heads that makes the fine trimming a breeze.  </li>
            <li> If you need to give yourself a fade or any short length haircut, it&#x27;ll do fine.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t tried the alternate fine trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It works fine, but I wish you didn&#x27;t need to go that extra step of switching out the trimmer blades.  </li>
            <li> I have another Panasonic trimmer that works fine, but it has the same issue.  </li>
            <li> It did a great job of shaping and trimming, but left a mess of clippings in the sink.  </li>
            <li> The nine settings lock into place which is nice (and was an improvement over my previous trimmer, which would slip into lower settings now and again), and it is possible to take the comb off and do detailed trims with the detail blade included.</li>
            <li> If you have fine short bear</li>
            <li> I really like the \\&quot;specialty Mini-Beard trimmer attachment\\&quot; which allows me to easily shape my beard and moustache while still using the vacuum.  </li>
            <li> The extra attachment for fine detail works well</li>
            <li> I found this to be a pretty decent trimmer.</li>
            <li> Hubby likes it as a replacement for an older model (that lasted about 6 years!).</li>
            <li> But this produt does a very nice job and it makes very little to no mess.  </li>
            <li> I marked it down a star for that issue as well as the fact that there is a plastic spring-loaded piece that I think is there to help push the trimmings toward the vacuum, but when you remove the top for mustache trimming it would be nice if that piece moved out of the way</li>
            <li> and it is too smooth and has no flat or grippy surfaces.</li>
            <li> It has 9 different settings and does an excellent job of collecting facial hairs without making a mess.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m optimistic that I&#x27;ll go from liking it to loving it with a little practice.    </li>
            <li> It came with a detail trimmer attachment that is really nice and a little storage case for everything.     </li>
            <li> The little travel pouch is nice.    </li>
            <li> I think the adjustable length feature is really great, it accomodates about &#x27;any&#x27; length beard, and eliminates all the extra little clip-on guides you have to keep track of.</li>
            <li> Our experience has been that little bits of hair still fly all over the place, even with the vacuum--although perhaps to a slightly lesser degree.</li>
            <li> The parts detach easily and the little supplied brush works well to clean it out.</li>
            <li> I had a Remington vacuum shave that worked fine</li>
            <li> What I expected when purchasing this product, and it does cost a lot more than most, is the vacuum that it advertises to work, and it clearly does NOT!</li>
            <li> I find that, as I shave, the shave length setting can very easily be pushed down so that I end up with a much shorter beard than I intended.  </li>
            <li> I happily trimmed to a 4 once a week (sometimes twice to clean it up) for the last couple months and it worked well, until just a couple of days ago when the setting slipped all the way down to 1 when I was in the middle of shaving!  </li>
            <li> The batteries last nicely even with the turbo vacuum on, certainly lasts longer than it takes for me to trim my beard.    </li>
            <li> B0028QFHUM DOVO Shavette Straight Razor with Red Holder and FREE 100</li>
            <li> Low battery warning light is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li> Trims fast.  </li>
            <li> This real does the job.  </li>
            <li> It also has a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> The T980 works very well for a consumer-grade device.  </li>
            <li> The description really doesn&#x27;t do it justice.  </li>
            <li> Others have mentioned the power button was touchy, I don&#x27;t really agree.</li>
            <li> Both shavers require a light pressure or the setting can suddenly change to a shorter length.  </li>
            <li> This shaver really is a treat to use.</li>
            <li> What I really like is the adjustable guard.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much nicer not having all those attachments.</li>
            <li> And the turbo function doesn&#x27;t really help anyway; it drops a lot of whiskers.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:29484211]]I only review products that I use, enjoy, and want to advocate for; the T980 is one of these.</li>
            <li> It cuts well, but it doesn&#x27;t catch as much as it billed to.  </li>
            <li> thanks to philips...</li>
            <li> if u really want a quality over price....  </li>
            <li> You need to pass it a couple of times until the surface is really even.</li>
            <li> Of course you should be more careful.</li>
            <li> It is very helpful too that it can be used with a cord power supply.</li>
            <li> Have been using the T980 for about a month and it works very well.</li>
            <li> haha.</li>
            <li> it was really a surprise when I got it ..</li>
            <li> they either look like grizzly adams and try to mow the whole thing at once</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t capture the whole hairs</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t think of anything else I&#x27;d really want in a beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> it comes in a really sturdy clam shell package and with no helpful opening tabs</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who&#x27;s very picky about his shavers and trimmers.</li>
            <li> He does really like it.</li>
            <li> something I really like.</li>
            <li> And the turbo feature does work, kicking up the speed much faster to trim you beard in no time.  </li>
            <li> The battery much to its credit also holds a charge well.</li>
            <li> And that, my friends, is really it.     </li>
            <li> It really works quite well.</li>
            <li> and I must say this one is much nicer</li>
            <li> he&#x27;s ever used - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a bit more complicated that would appear, but the PERKS and QUALITY of the trimmer are more than worth it.  </li>
            <li> The price was also very competetive.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer over a month ago, and it works very well.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who has really course hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of $ on an electric trimmer, because he seems to go through them fast.  </li>
            <li> It trims his goatee which is really course, and he has even had to trim his head with it, he buzzes his head, since his clippers broke.  </li>
            <li> He&#x27;s really picky about his clippers and trimmer, and he said he loves it</li>
            <li> It does a very through job</li>
            <li> He doesn&#x27;t have much hair and he just doesn&#x27;t want to look bald.  </li>
            <li> That is, when using a very lighter touch than what I&#x27;m used to so that the teeth do not compress and sculpture the result.</li>
            <li> if you REALLY want it, just try it at any store and tell me if you can run it across your beard, or body 4 times without cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> I wish it came with a stand or dock, but I really can&#x27;t fault it at that price.</li>
            <li> I really like mine.</li>
            <li> but I really can&#x27;t use it now.</li>
            <li> It defines his beard very well.</li>
            <li> It seems to work really well for him.</li>
            <li> The turbo settings really help with the hair suction and there is virtually</li>
            <li> I ended up taking the comb attachment off the blade and, using a real comb like hairdressers used to do, trimmer the rest of the way manually.</li>
            <li> I really like the rechargable feathure and the option to plug in the trimmer if is out of juice.  </li>
            <li> I was looking to find a groomer that was fast and could provide an even cut on my beard which consists of both straight and curly hair.</li>
            <li> I was very impressed by the cutting quality.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Much cleaner.</li>
            <li> Can remove the variable adjustable clipper section for a real close trim on the beards outer fringes.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the trimmer, like the small attachable close edge piece..</li>
            <li> It adjusts to provide a very close and even trim.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you use your beard trimmer when you don&#x27;t have much time in the morning before you have to take off for work.</li>
            <li> this one not so much)</li>
            <li> Cuts and vacumes fast and efficiently.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to anyone!    </li>
            <li> When shaving with my Norelco T900, the shavings would fly all over the place --- in the sink, behind the faucet, in between the handles of the faucet, and on the floor.</li>
            <li> Very quite operation.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t take much to glue or otherwise fix the thing.  </li>
            <li> It really works as advertised.</li>
            <li> That was a real concern I had</li>
            <li> It has functioned very well.  </li>
            <li> The turbo really helps keep the hair in the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> and it is still working very wello.  </li>
            <li> Better than expected.</li>
            <li> I really like the guide on Norelco trimmers</li>
            <li> all simply pull off and on smoothly without any difficulty lining them up or anything like that.  </li>
            <li> I also really like the feature of running off either corded or cordless.  </li>
            <li> product works very well, gets close with a very even cut.</li>
            <li> I was very concerned about it</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t really expect \\&quot;no</li>
            <li> My wife really likes the lack of beard hair in the sink.  </li>
            <li> Was very underpowered and I stopped using it.  </li>
            <li> It trims fast and evenly.  </li>
            <li> Cleaning is a drag but should keep the unit working better longer.    </li>
            <li> Overall, I enjoy using this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I think these manufacturers should specify their trimming lengths so you can do a reasonable buying comparison.</li>
            <li> But aside from that, they&#x27;ve really worked out the details on this thing.</li>
            <li> If you work in real time, it&#x27;s performance is sub par.</li>
            <li> but I really didn&#x27;t need it.  </li>
            <li> So I can&#x27;t really complain about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Modern decent-quality rechargeable devices automatically prevent overcharging</li>
            <li> Turbo really works well, even if it does make it louder</li>
            <li> With the indicators on this trimmer, it is much easier to try and extend the life of the battery.  </li>
            <li> I find that the smallest setting--#1--does not give a real stubble shave.</li>
            <li> This product does everything the manufacturer says and does it very well.    </li>
            <li> I figured there isn&#x27;t much to a trimmer</li>
            <li> So let me get this straight.  </li>
            <li> Equally delicate-feeling are the two sliding, plastic prongs used to hold the primary blade in place.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well however the vaccume does not collect much.  </li>
            <li> i&#x27;m very picky, and this trimmer lacks in no area.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the Turbo setting because I haven&#x27;t really used that</li>
            <li> Product works very well.  </li>
            <li> And once the lead is connected from socket to trimmer, a scant hour will have it fully refreshed and ready for another month on the road.    </li>
            <li> But they don&#x27;t really, do they?  </li>
            <li> I threw away several cheap, battery-operated, trimmers before getting this, which I&#x27;ve had for quite a while.</li>
            <li> This works very well.  </li>
            <li> It will serve you very well...unless you are a finicky turd.</li>
            <li> Works VERY well.  </li>
            <li> Very convenient product.    </li>
            <li> The T980 works just as it should, for me, and the price is reasonable.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve found I have to remove the prongs and then very cautiously trim my mustache.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Vacuum works very well.</li>
            <li> Well, the trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li> The trimmer itself is very well made and sturdy.</li>
            <li> I must say I haven&#x27;t seen much of these negatives.  </li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the trimmer a few times since getting it and so far so good.</li>
            <li> This one is OK with good power and suction but awkward to use.</li>
            <li> ; you can still pop the top off and do the edge trimming without adding any attachments; No. 3 and No. 2 depth on this one are the same as on the old one, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have an old razor that plugs in and has 3 or 4 different adapters, and that works a lot better.    </li>
            <li> Quality is good, the adjustment for cutting length worked OK.  </li>
            <li> The T980 works much better and leaves almost no trail of hair behind, i love the turbo button for areas with lots of hair.</li>
            <li> If noise is a concern, like in early morning, the standard mode does an ok job too.</li>
            <li> My older T-3000 had a self-contained trimming blade that slid forward with a simple thumb push whenever needed and then retracted just as easily.</li>
            <li> Norelco fixed this in their more recent models?</li>
            <li> /&gt;Bottom line, it is a good value home trimmer to handle delicately.</li>
            <li> if I didn&#x27;t know better, I would say it makes an old geezer like me look younger.  </li>
            <li> Be sure to start a lot higher than you think you need, and work your way down if needed.</li>
            <li> I suggest a can of compressed air be handy and to blow the shavings out after each use, which defeats the neatness of the vacuum collection, but blow lightly over a waste basket.</li>
            <li> It is easy to clean and the vacuum actually works well.  </li>
            <li> Now I can trim my beard line, mustache and sideburn hair (with the help of vacuum power) without having to worry about a HUGE mess to clean up!!</li>
            <li> The vacuum action will catch most hairs, but you can&#x27;t get away with not trimming over a sink.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum component works really well to collect and house the trimmings, keeping the bathroom sink free of stray hairs  </li>
            <li> It does a nice job, and I especially like the vacuum that catches all the hair</li>
            <li> The blue hair deflector broke after using it only 2 times, but I was able to exchange the whole unit right away.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of getting a new one, you might as well go all out and get the good one that is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer is a fantastic beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> It does a neat and consistent trimming and the \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; feature works better on this model than it did on previous models.</li>
            <li> Plus, the vacuum works decently, and gets most (not quite all, but most) of the little hairs</li>
            <li> will be fine if you are not an equipment trasher and as long as you pay a little attention when sliding the moveable pieces off and on and make sure you have them in the right groove.  </li>
            <li> I always trimmed in a downward fashion with my old one because if I went up it would reduce it to stubble even with the right length setting.</li>
            <li> for noise, my old trimmer had no doubt gotten noisier over the years as the blades dulled or whatever, but with them side by side, the T980 was noticeably QUIETER right out of the box.  </li>
            <li> I liked that the turbo not only boosted power to the vacuum, but also to the blades making a much more even and short cut the first time eliminating the need to do a second pass.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer allowed me to achieve and maintain the beard length I was seeking more precisely and efficiently than any other trimmer I have owned.</li>
            <li> Vacuum really works!!!</li>
            <li> The vacuum collection certainly helps keep the sink area clean.  </li>
            <li> Its form, design and cut remind me of my old Norelco (which is great) with only one major difference, the vacuum.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of Norelco trimmers in the past, most recently the T780, and have never really been happy.</li>
            <li> I generally liked the performance of the older one (except it didn&#x27;t quite vacuum \\&quot;all them tiny hairs\\&quot; as Bill Cosby used to say)</li>
            <li> The vacuum is much better, the alternate head for detailed trimming is easy to change back and forth, and the ability to use it plugged in is a big plus.</li>
            <li> Definitely less clean up, but still have to clean the sink, and surrounding counter.  </li>
            <li> Many other trimmers require you to change heads.</li>
            <li> and then the detail sized cutters--on more than one occasion I was in a hurry and fumbling around looking for the other cutter assembly than what was on the trimmer.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is sleek, it comes with a travel/carrying bag, and it does a better 5 o&#x27;clock shadow than the other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> I read many of the other reviews of the Norelco T980 and having a Norelco electric razor decided to give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Unlike many other trimmers, this trimmer can be used both cord and cordless.</li>
            <li> You will get used to it quickly, but the design makes fine trimming more of a blind operation</li>
            <li> The blades are easy to clean and battery last for a long time once fully charged.  </li>
            <li> There are just too many other problems with this trimmer to recommend it.</li>
            <li> It has an option to trim more close than other trimmers I have tried.</li>
            <li> Also I have noticed that despite the jet engine sucking noises there is a fair amount of very small pieces of beard that still escape and wind up on the sink.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with the locking mechanism slipping down to a lower guard setting, and I apply a reasonable amount of pressure.</li>
            <li> This is the second vacuum unit I&#x27;ve owned and is significantly better in performance and features than the first.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the vacuum capabilities when I first read about it, but after trying it I must admit that I&#x27;m very impressed.  </li>
            <li> (Previous models would change settings as you were trimming because the change ring was right under your grip and moved too easily.)</li>
            <li> Precision trimming, ease of use, and convenient clean up and features makes this shaver a must buy for any man especially those on the job hunt!</li>
            <li> The guide is much sturdier and it doesn&#x27;t poke him like the older trimmer.</li>
            <li> The T980 is OK, but I long for the old days.   </li>
            <li> Works better than expected and better than the less expense models.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the turbo mode and it still leaves numerous beard hairs which I have to clean up afterwards.  </li>
            <li> Even the Accu Control System&#x27;s flexing guide comb is easier to clean than the last one.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I occasionally use a compressed air can to thoroughly clean it once a</li>
            <li> love the way you can choose the size of trim with a simple twist, but I use the trimmer bare or at setting \\&quot;0\\&quot; to get that fashionable stubble look.</li>
            <li> I like the fact that as I cut my beard the shaver vacuums the cut hair so there is not big clean up at the end of the trim.  </li>
            <li> Almost all the trimmings get sucked into a small chamber that is viewable and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> It works quite well without the comb housing to clean up the back of my neck between haircuts.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older and can&#x27;t see the numbers very well,</li>
            <li> Mind you, I&#x27;m no professional stylist, but I thought it was tremendously helpful!</li>
            <li> This unit is unique in that it has a built in vacuum.</li>
            <li> and I was excited about the addition of a vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> The turbo function does work, it has enough high power that calling it &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; is not only cool but accurate.</li>
            <li> The vacuum catches almost all clippings and the trimmer gives great, reproducable settings from very short to very long.    </li>
            <li> The turbo mode is useful if you have a lot of hair you are getting rid of, but by no means a major factor.   </li>
            <li> The vacuum function is great - no more hair all over the bathroom floor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say the adjusment clicks for length of hair settings could be a little more positive.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature keeps the sink area clean and the turbo feature speeds up trim time.</li>
            <li> vacuum suction keeps the basin clean and it is a breeze to use.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think that the vacuum will keep your bathroom clean.  </li>
            <li> I have trimmed with scissors, rasors, the old cip on guard trimmers and the grandfather of this trimmer which just recently died after 7 years of service (not bad Norelco!).  </li>
            <li> My daughter says there is no unwanted hair in the sink, so that&#x27;s a big YIPPEE right there!</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought, which makes it a little bit harder to use, but it works great!</li>
            <li> Works well, catches cut hair good, the only reason I did not give it a 5 was it is a little hard to use with the top off, working around the guard, other than that - very satisfied</li>
            <li> So far, the only issue is that the power control is a bit too easily activated when you are holding the unit in your hand, meaning that you can change your grip while trimming and accidentally turn the thing off.</li>
            <li> Finally I found one that is not cheap and offers a great trim.  </li>
            <li> I usually have to have the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; turned on for it to be really effective.</li>
            <li> This replaced an earlier Norelco whose battery finally gave up (+ it got dropped a couple of times...), and - for once - the replacement actually seems better than the original.  </li>
            <li> but I am not sure about that it seems to clip nicely whether the Turbo Mode is on or off.</li>
            <li> Its cool, it works, and its simple.......</li>
            <li> the T980 works EXACTLY like the old one</li>
            <li> I have a full beard and it does not pull my facial hair when I use it.</li>
            <li> My only real requirement was that it had to be able to be used corded OR cordless, for those times when you realize you shouldn&#x27;t look like a deadbeat just as you are about to walk out the door, only to find out that the unit needs charging!  </li>
            <li> The shaver also comes with a Turbo Mode but the only thing this really does that I have noticed is give the vacuum more power, it may also speed up the clippers</li>
            <li> but it could have had better vacuum, or at least it could have sucked in hair better.</li>
            <li> It is easy to use, it takes less time to trim my beard, and the results are a consistent even trim every time.     </li>
            <li> My old trimmer worked fine; only the battery needed replacing.  </li>
            <li> It might depend on your style of cutting,havnt tried from the top down to see if the vaccuum gets it all.</li>
            <li> Battery life seems pretty decent so far.  </li>
            <li> but I really wish that the spring on the belt clip was a little more robust.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is a true blessing.</li>
            <li> Seeing a good price here at amazon, I sprang for the Turbo model, which promised a little extra oomph.  </li>
            <li> Never has beard trimming been so easy and the vacuum feature leaves almost no mess on the sink.  </li>
            <li> I like my new look and the tool that keeps it that way !</li>
            <li> Well, only four months after receiving the new replacement trimmer, the whisker tray (aka \\&quot;hair collection chamber\\&quot;) has fallen apart, just like it did on my original defective trimmer.</li>
            <li> Norelco should send us out new trimmers, guys!</li>
            <li> Only idiosyncrasy is that the control turns the clipper on a little too easily, so anything in the suitcase can easily turn it on.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer is pretty good, it vacuums up most of the loose hair when I trim my beard and leaves little mess.</li>
            <li> It was really a win-win situation - he needed a new trimmer</li>
            <li> Costs as much to replace the pack as a new trimmer.  </li>
            <li> When my old beard trimmer conked out after a half dozen years, I wanted a nice new one.</li>
            <li> Battery (still pretty new) holds a charge for a long period of time and recharges relatively quickly.  </li>
            <li> Easy to empty out collected hair.</li>
            <li> The flexible trim guard was something I immediately noticed and enjoyed, since my previous trimmer did not have this feature.</li>
            <li> It is a trustworthy, reliable product that performs much better than the Remington and Wahl I previously owned.</li>
            <li> He uses it more often than the one he had previously.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is  better than my Wahl and cost less    </li>
            <li> I grew a goatee a couple of years ago and was using what I thought was a decent groomer.  </li>
            <li> I had the older model of this trimmer and now after years needed to upgrade, so I have no problems with this product and will continue to buy this name brand</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer as an upgrade to my older T900 model.</li>
            <li> The older model had a removable tray.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it to replace an older Norelco for my husband.  </li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers here, I was actually seeking an overall body hair trimmer when I came across the Norelco T980.</li>
            <li> This model is easier to use and much more substantial with a longer lasting battery than a competing model I bought several years ago.  </li>
            <li> For 5 years, I had an older Norelco model which still worked, but I was in need of an upgrade.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a decent product for the price and seems to work well.</li>
            <li> finally, the smaller attachment it comes with, I just love that one, thank god someone thought about creating it</li>
            <li> I cant speak for all men because all hair is different but speaking for most African Americans, it wouldnt work well.</li>
            <li> It allows for a nice range of beard lengths as long as you don&#x27;t want it too long.  </li>
            <li> if it&#x27;s like my last Norelco it should last many years.</li>
            <li> Why do we have to go sneaking around borrowing decent trimmers from our men or have to go to a salon to get</li>
            <li> Then after the trimming is complete I use a Straight Razor (DOVO Shavette Straight Razor</li>
            <li> I was used to my older Norelco with teeth which were not bendable, but dependable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Only thing is make sure you open the hatch over your garbage because it doesn&#x27;t slide out...</li>
            <li> but I found that on both this model and my old one, the teeth on the trimmer were too big for a comfortable close trim anyway, so I do not use that feature.  </li>
            <li> I had an older model that my son took to college</li>
            <li> Had an older version which used to spray hair everwhere.</li>
            <li> I did like the simplicity of my older model in just removing the hair comb to use the trimmer head for the detail work.  </li>
            <li> The main reason I chose the T980 over the T765 is that it can be operated from the plug.</li>
            <li> After a few months of use (1-2 times a week), I developed my own pro&#x27;s con&#x27;s for the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> All in all a decent trimmer but could be quieter</li>
            <li> In particular, when &#x27;Turbo&#x27; mode is on, it sounds like a mini-buzz-saw.  </li>
            <li> -Particular</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my older model.  </li>
            <li> but, I thought it would work as well as the older model.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer in March 2009 to replace an older Norelco T770 model trimmer whose battery was dying.  </li>
            <li> It looks and feels sturdier than the older T770.    </li>
            <li> Luckily it does have a 2 year warranty and Philips/Norelco has been terrific at replacing them.</li>
            <li> The reason I chose this particular one, is that it vacuums up the bits of beard rather than finding them in the sink.  </li>
            <li> Having a regular shaver before I used to spend more time cleaning the space after myself than actually shaving.</li>
            <li> All of the reviews and articles that I read online pointed me to this particular grooming tool.  </li>
            <li> I keep my goatee pretty short, and my first time using this</li>
            <li> charges holds for decent amount of time.</li>
            <li> Comb stays in position (one of the older Panasonic could switch to a lower position under pressure).  </li>
            <li> you can also use it while it is plugged in, which you could not do with the older model trimmers.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s be realistic....</li>
            <li> Over all it was decent.</li>
            <li> The built-in vacuum may be the weakest part of it, but hey, it&#x27;s better than no vacuum at all.</li>
            <li> works very well and with a great deal less mess as the trimmer has a suction to keep the hair  from flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> I also agree that the vacuum is a waste, as unless it retains most of the hairs (which it doesn&#x27;t), you still have to clean up the sink.</li>
            <li> Only problem that I see with it, is the vacuum could work better.</li>
            <li> While not perfect, the vacuum feature on the T980 is wonderful.</li>
            <li> -Pro - Vacuum is significantly better than on their last version.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend it and have purchased two of them; one for my main home and one for a vacation home.</li>
            <li> You just need to make sure to charge it after it arrives, because it is sort of weak (very powerful, especially with the TURBO BUTTON, but not as powerful).</li>
            <li> If Norelco could change the design of the trimming area to eliminate the hinged door design -- say a small cup that you snap out and empty instead -- then this product would be flawless and guaranteed to last for years.  </li>
            <li> It vacuums most of the hair, but he still has to stand over the sink because of the mess it makes.</li>
            <li> its very loud !  </li>
            <li> One note: The hair \\&quot;reservoir\\&quot; under the vacuum fills up quickly,</li>
            <li> After a quick look thru the internet I soon discovered this vacuum feature was a rarity.</li>
            <li> And then there&#x27;s a Turbo button that doubles the already adequate force of the vacuum&#x27;s suction so that you can give yourself that wind-blown look if you so choose.    </li>
            <li> super vacuum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better to trim the beard dry not wet.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works better when you use the turbo vacuum.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> maybe the truth is that *I* am paying a high price for my laziness regarding cleaning up post-shave whiskers off the sink myself, vs. having a lower-quality trimmer with a vac function.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this trimmer for both</li>
            <li> I highly recomend this trimmer...</li>
            <li> and I was looking for a high quality trimmer.     </li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my boyfriend who happens to have high standards for beard/hair trimmers.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this trimmer to anyone.</li>
            <li> I would highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> and I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> Over all I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> But then again, I would guess that product longevity does not rise high on the list of marketing features.</li>
            <li> He would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> So long as it&#x27;s kept clean, it&#x27;ll keep working.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature really does work, and the waste receptacle is easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The power on button went off many times when traveling, due to the fairly sensitive button being flush with the shaver.</li>
            <li> He feels he does a better job with his old, non-electric razor and a sharp pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> so I had to wait for it to charge for a little while just to be able to finish up.  </li>
            <li> The only thing about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s bigger, pretty significantly, compared to the Wahl.</li>
            <li> There is a little brush for cleaning the trimmer that works OK.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature generates a little more noise and vibration.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is also more powerful than the previous Remington model I had.  </li>
            <li> Trimming is easy, the vacuum feature is very convenient, keeping your bathroom counter and sink hair-free, and the multiple trim settings is also a plus.  </li>
            <li> all over\\&quot; (even after I tried to clean up) -- so I returned that one and looked for a similar one to my old one.</li>
            <li> Pros:  Classic Design, Same quality and function, powerful vacum  </li>
            <li> Other than that,  &lt;br /&gt;the trimmer itself was easy to assemble (the ideographs on the instruction  </li>
            <li> It is easy to maintain because it does not require any lubrication and the blades are forever sharp.  </li>
            <li> The height adjustment can be easily set, and unlike other reviews mention, I haven&#x27;t accidentally changed the setting without knowing.    </li>
            <li> the vacuum action catches 95% of the hairs but 95% means you still have to clean up afterwards</li>
            <li> /&gt;Comparing the shroud around the cutters, its exactly the same size and looks very much like my old Norelco.</li>
            <li> Second, you have to clean the vacuum chamber really often, once every 10 seconds or so depending on the hair size!</li>
            <li> well, i had the older model of this trimmer for a couple of years now and decided it&#x27;s time to get a new one.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Vacuum:  worked great on regular power (non-turbo) mode, and let only a few hairs drop to the sink.  </li>
            <li> So far I really like the Panasonic, and I wish I had bought one of these to start with.......</li>
            <li> This unit replaces a T990 in which the battery died much too early.  </li>
            <li> So far this trimmer is holding up very well.</li>
            <li> So far, he hasn&#x27;t had to charge it much.</li>
            <li> Over all so far i really like the buzzer.</li>
            <li> My old Remington was not giving me the shave I needed, so I thought this razor would be much improved.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no pinching or pulling, just smooth and efficient.  </li>
            <li> I am surprised they sell this seriously as real product that can cut hair.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the remington mb-300, which is much like the old norelco</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really tempted to pay the $30 it will cost to restore my old T-3000.</li>
            <li> setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexible blade housing pivots smoothly and covered the contours of my face very well with an even cut at several different lengths.  </li>
            <li> and because it was over 4 years old figured the battery did not have much life in it.</li>
            <li> Much improvement over the old way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not so sure about the hair chamber as the old one I had had a removable hair chamber, this one only actually has a door</li>
            <li> With so many reviews saying this trimmer suddenly shifted the trimming length, I debated a long time whether to buy it or not.    </li>
            <li> I cut from the bottom of my face going up and never had more than a few hairs that didnt get in the vaccuum.</li>
            <li> I feel I have definitely gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> For the extra 10 dollars this one costs, it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> and he was pretty adamant about getting the exact same trimmer</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say this trimmer is well worth your money.</li>
            <li> Cleaning is a breeze, since most of the hair is trapped.</li>
            <li> and I make sure it is firmly set on the length I want.  </li>
            <li> but it is better than a messy sink area.</li>
            <li> You have to use the mini-trimmer attachment, which works great but is on the small side (making it slightly more difficult to cut a straight line).</li>
            <li> I normally get 5 years of use out of them.</li>
            <li> Far better than similar units that use multiple guides that can get lost, damaged and require additional storage space.</li>
            <li> I am pretty much bald except for around the back and sides</li>
            <li> I normally don&#x27;t give out 5-star ratings for things, but I just can&#x27;t find anything to complain about and it exceeded my expectations on every function.</li>
            <li> The only gripe is that it&#x27;s loud, especially first thing in the morning, but it&#x27;s not a big issue to me.</li>
            <li> So we&#x27;d say that while it&#x27;s not perfect, it&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li> If we&#x27;re completely honest, we&#x27;ve been conditioned by manufacturers these days to accept rubbish without complaint.  </li>
            <li> There is little to no mess and the bettery life is amazing, love the travel ouch and small wal charger.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer something more narrow.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s alot of fun when you realize that what you thought was length 3 has suddenly become a length 1 shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the first time I had a completely even shave--including my jawline and the vacuum works better than I expected.</li>
            <li> I have attempted to use this trimmer twice and both times have had to result to pulling my very old T7500 out of the drawer and using it to get a decent trim.    </li>
            <li> It slips down to the lowest setting making this effective only for a stubble look.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum action is great, and at least 90 percent of the trimmings make it into the reservoir.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is nice, the turbo is nice, but I got it because of the adjustable cutting length and the ease of use.</li>
            <li> Also, despite what many have written, I did not find the turbo vacuum to be excessively loud and the zoom length definitely *locked* into place at #3.  </li>
            <li> On my first one, the spring hold the door up broke allowing it to drop and lose much of the vacuum.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why I need to press 2 buttons to get the good vacuum speed.</li>
            <li> It has a nice vacuum feature but some hairs still escape the vacuum, but it&#x27;s beats cleaning up the entire sink!  </li>
            <li> I found the vacuum to be well worth while, to my surprise.  </li>
            <li> It might still be worth buying this model over the one $10 cheaper, because in addition to the vacuum, this model works plugged in when the battery is drained.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a T900 trimmer for a few years now and wanted to upgrade to a new and hopefully better trimmer.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmers - also from Norelco- eventually developed battery problems when the battery did not hold charge any more.  </li>
            <li> Being that my previous Norelco trimmer (a T770) took 10 hours to fully charge, I greatly liked how the T980 took just 70 minutes to do the same thing.</li>
            <li> First of all, you can easily change the size adjustment during the usage, and you can end up with uneven beard/hair!</li>
            <li> Overall, its too big to easily hold.  </li>
            <li> The vacuuum feature is particularly nice - no more hair in the sink!</li>
            <li> I can have just the right length of trim that I want, in fact, I found that the shortest trim is a bit too short, it just gives the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow -</li>
            <li> It needs to have a setting lock or the dial in a different location than right where you hold it.</li>
            <li> I did the same thing you are doing right now.</li>
            <li> It does take a little training, but it is a great little tool.</li>
            <li> Some stray clippings \\&quot;escape\\&quot; even in turbo mode, but the vacuum captures enough to make it an easy cleanup.</li>
            <li> but it does so with a composure and aplomb that will sweep away the corporate fog and, suddenly, everything else you own will seem completely and utterly inadequate.    </li>
            <li> My wife got this for me it is a good trimmer and the vacuum works will unlike other trimmers I have owned where the vacuum makes noise but does not work...</li>
            <li> Even after spending considerable time, I still have the wild hair or two left that requires special attention.  </li>
            <li> I like the regular as well as the smaller blades for fine trimming.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same generic beard trimmer for 6 years now and it worked just fine</li>
            <li> After using the regular beard trimmers for years, I was pleasantly surprised to see NO mess of hair clippings to clean up from the counter.      </li>
            <li> The vacuum does collect most of the loose hair, but there is still a ton that makes it into the sink.</li>
            <li> On the \\&quot;turbo screamer\\&quot; setting, it was about even with the old one as far as pure decibels.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, fantastic.</li>
            <li> Mini trimmer blade is sharp and precise.  </li>
            <li> I think this is mostly due to the cheap plastic build.      </li>
            <li> Besides the fact that it&#x27;s a little bit loud. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> The vacuum works well and the vacuum compartment is easy to empty and clean.  </li>
            <li> To my surprise the vacuum actually works pretty good - if you keep a bushy beard you&#x27;ll need to empty out the pouch a few times per trimming (it fills up pretty fast).</li>
            <li> When it died on me I thought \\&quot;well\\&quot; I&#x27;ll just get a new Wahl..</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s get with the new tech.</li>
            <li> The vaccum function is so-so, I could live without it.</li>
            <li> If you run out of power when in Europe (say) plan to have to take a AC adapter or buy a new adapter while overseas.</li>
            <li> Remington doesn&#x27;t have a new model, so I tried this one.  </li>
            <li> The Norelco trimmer that I bought around five years ago just died on me so it was time to buy a new one.  </li>
            <li> I just question the degree to which the new features are improvements.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had that issue with the new trimmer at all.    </li>
            <li> Shaving has always been one my life&#x27;s peeves and growing a beard was a way to avoid that but then trimming and upkeep became a new peeve.</li>
            <li> I will say, I placed an order for a new one the QT4070.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to deal with the upkeep of a newly grown beard.  </li>
            <li> So when I decided it was time to replace my Wahl Vacu-Trim, which needed new blades and battery</li>
            <li> I wish there was a new trimmer just like this to eventually replace mine.</li>
            <li> I bought this one about 5 years ago and still like brand new.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco Vacuum Trimmer and as before, this one has been a fine product.  </li>
            <li> only issues I have had are the fact that this is not a duel voltage system and the design of the vacuum places the blades more towards the center of the head instead of right at the fromt.  </li>
            <li> Update: 5 years old, still like new!</li>
            <li> This unit has a handy little vacuum inside of it that gets almost all of the stray hairs.  </li>
            <li> little vacuum is nice, and collects a bunch of hair.. but don&#x27;t count on it to pick up everything.&lt;br</li>
            <li> - so it&#x27;s harder to clean out.</li>
            <li> The unit feels solid as a whole and also has a reasonable case</li>
            <li> Yes, there will be a few that don&#x27;t make it in, but by far, most of them get sucked into the chamber.    </li>
            <li> main drawback with the Norelco however is that with the adjustable guard off, it doesn&#x27;t provide nearly as close a trim as the Braun.  </li>
            <li> This may be a non issue for some buyers if they are only looking to trim longer hair, however it is a critical issue for me as I tend to use my trimmer as my primary shaver, and keep a seperate foil shaver for days I need a cleaner shave.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to replace a 7-year old Norelco trimmer (that had an integral main blade and an integral mini pop-up blade, but</li>
            <li> Only issue is a lack of different size attachments for beard length and cannot easily trim mustache directly under the  nose.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and the value I&#x27;ve recieved for the money spent.</li>
            <li> Further experimentation -- and another call to a male rep -- confirmed that I was using the trimmer correctly.  </li>
            <li> Further experimentation -- and another call to a male rep -- confirmed that I was using the trimmer correctly.  </li>
            <li> Even setting this thing on the closest setting (#1) the trimmer still sets back waaaaay too far from the guard to be useful.</li>
            <li> Unlike most trimmers, which require that you dig around to find the correct attachment in order to trim your left eyebrow now that you&#x27;re done with the right, nearly everything is built directly into this sleek little unit.  </li>
            <li> I really think the T980 is a major advance in technology over the proior model.  </li>
            <li> I really think the T370 does as good a job trimming as this one does, but will not run with a dead battery when plugged in, and does make a mess with beard clippings all over the place.  </li>
            <li> No one wants a mess to clean up with.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a nice feature but the receptacle is not secure, sometimes sending hair flying everywhere.</li>
            <li> biggest complaints goes on the noise of the trimmer thanks to the vacuum and very unprecise cut of the beard</li>
            <li> It seems that the only vacuum beard trimmers available at this writing are the two models from Philips Norelco.  </li>
            <li> - The instructions are very clear about how to maximize a Ni-Cad battery&#x27;s life.    </li>
            <li> However, this product gets the job done much quicker and the sound is not annoying and unlikely to wake up someone else on the normal</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s why when I say it sucks, I mean that in the best of ways.     </li>
            <li> The downsides of this model are the hair suction action isn&#x27;t very strong and still drops hair, the hair holder is small and needs frequent emptying(maybe</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s quite easy to take apart to empty out the little hair-catch-all and clean trimmer attachments or swapping them out (comes with a fine-line trimmer).</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s very little mess and does a great job.  </li>
            <li> The Turbo Vacuum does work well, and the chamber is large enough to hold about two weeks worth of hair growth.  </li>
            <li> give you an additional smaller trimming blade for detail work on the moustache, but it isn&#x27;t built into the trimmer, so you have to remove the outer guard, remove the inner trimming blade, usually clean out all the hair, then attach the new trimming blade.</li>
            <li> It is also more comfortable on sensitive areas like my neck than other clippers I have used in the past.  </li>
            <li> The battery lasts a long time between charges and the trimmer is quite powerful.  </li>
            <li> It is still working off the original charge, using it about every other day.</li>
            <li> I usually leave the &#x27;turbo&#x27; on and find it vacuums most cut hairs.</li>
            <li> A minor problem is that it too easy to hit the vacuum button while you are trimming your beard.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have a giant beard for my first shave</li>
            <li> No complaints thus far!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past couple of years and just love it.</li>
            <li> This may work OK if you are trimming short guide settings, but if you get a clump of hair in the guide, which happens constantly with me, it will block the tiny opening for the hair cup.  </li>
            <li> Speaking from an African-American, the trimmer just doesnt give me that smooth trim i have with my current    \\&quot;Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> At first, people think this is some kinda sex-toy from the future.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t be disappointed, buy the best.</li>
            <li> First shave and my husband lost his short beard.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say much more raving about this without getting repetitive.    </li>
            <li> I wanted Braun-quality to match their stellar shavers (I&#x27;m on my third Braun shaver in twenty years of use), but they discontinued their beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Most other trimmers only work when charged, not on house current.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only criticism that I have is that the blade doesn&#x27;t work too well to do extreme details because of the bulkiness of the unit, but for me the rest of the package more than compensates for this.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco trimmer, the first was before Philips acquired Norelco.</li>
            <li> I know there are other big names in beard trimmers, but I am glad I chose the T980.  </li>
            <li> Easily fixed though I just pulled it out!</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;m sure that if it was to cut more closely, that would take it into the realm of regular shavers, an expensive world of high-tech blades and lubricants.</li>
            <li> When this happened to the first trimmer, I had the battery replaced locally; the replacement battery did not hold a charge as well.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t recall the exact model number for the Panasonic, but something similar to the ER389K or ER205.  </li>
            <li> Since then I have bought three more Norelco trimmers and they have all broken after a fairly short time and under quite light use.</li>
            <li> The instructions never tell you which side of the trimmer to hold against your face, and the T980 works the opposite of most other trimmers and shavers.  </li>
            <li> I guess in that it doesn&#x27;t get too many little beard trimmings all over the sink, but then again it&#x27;s really easy to just turn on the sink and rinse it, or, use the trimmer over a rug where you&#x27;ll never see the small trimmings.....</li>
            <li> Also, they improved the compartment that    Catches the hair with a little door that opens for easy disposal.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit, a little concerned about some of the reviewers who said the length adjustment changed too easily.  </li>
            <li> I little drawer pulled out that you could easily dump out in the basket and wash out if desired.    </li>
            <li> The only thing that could be a bit better is the regular speed vacuum misses some clippings when being rushed through the clipping of your beard, but I guess thats why they made this clipper with a &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> The T980 does as good a job as my old one with one exception-the safety shield makes it a little more difficult to trim the edge of my mustache.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum on it is impeccable and literally sucks up every hair!</li>
            <li> The charge seems to last for days and the charger itself, like the shaver, is a decent and modern design.    </li>
            <li> Since there is no base its tempting to just lay it down anywhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vacuum power of this model is much better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> not the quality of a barber&#x27;s tool with a really clean, sharp cut.    </li>
            <li> The vacuum works pretty well.</li>
            <li> In fact, this is the first vacuum trimmer I have had that will catch almost every hair-</li>
            <li> The vacuum works pretty well, but don&#x27;t expect it to catch every hair.</li>
            <li> Only tried it once so far -- for beard trimming -- but it&#x27;s very promising.    </li>
            <li> When the vacuum part is backed up, it blocks hair from entering the blades, forcing you to clean it several times per trimming session.  </li>
            <li> Power and battery life are fine, the vacuum feature is strange.  </li>
            <li> and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting a good trimmer with less mess.</li>
            <li> I was really looking forward to the vacuum feature but doesn&#x27;t work particularly well for me.  </li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer, it trims my beard evenly in much less time then my last trimmer, and while it does not pick up ALL the hair that falls, it picks up enough to make clean-up very easy.</li>
            <li> Only thing I feel is that the construction is not as solid as it appears specially when you hold it.</li>
            <li> it took a trim or two to get used to the new settings from my old trimmer</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s nearly two weeks, and I still haven&#x27;t seen hide nor hair of the new shaver.</li>
            <li> just lets hair jam up against the blades, which again makes for a less comfortable trim.  </li>
            <li> My one observation is that the moustache trimmer attachment seems less precise than the one on the T900</li>
            <li> Precise, Reliable, long lasting battery,</li>
            <li> It turns out cheap flimsy plastic does not last long.</li>
            <li> Also, this amazon price of $39.95 is $20 less than on the Norelco website, plus you get free shipping.</li>
            <li> I suspect that buyers who are having trouble with this feature have longer beards, and longer hairs might not be caught as easily.    </li>
            <li> The old one never failed, I simply plugged it into the wall on a trip to Europe during a lapse in judgment.     </li>
            <li> Also, I noticed far more skin irritation using this product than any past trimmers.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it about once a week for the past 4-5 months and have been extremely satisfied so far.  </li>
            <li> I have a full beard, and have been using this trimmer several times a week for the last couple of years or so.</li>
            <li> It would be nice to have a slightly more powerful vacuum, but I realize it&#x27;s difficult to get the hairs that are trapped in a beard.</li>
            <li> After trying this trimmer Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, it is very similar to Remington MB-300/200 with the added vacuum, less noise, much more powerful motor!</li>
            <li> the trimmer does a good job of trimming like so many other trimmers but its vacuum function only sucks in 50% of the hair on turbo!</li>
            <li> they&#x27;re not terrible, but most trimmers leave a mess, particularly with thick coarse beards like mine.  </li>
            <li> Smaller trimmer involves removing regular trim head:  People who complained about having to change trim heads must be in a much more significant hurry than I am in the morning.  </li>
            <li> Although not flawless this is hands down the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> I have normal hearing and do not find the trimmer overly loud even in the turbo mode which for me is the only mode that I use as both the cutting and vacuum features work best at high speed and battery life</li>
            <li> (which is what I always used on my old Norelco T7500 to keep it nice and tight) is the equivalent of setting 7 or so (which is fairly long) on my old trimmer</li>
            <li> I would certainly recommnend the new Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.</li>
            <li> For all other purposes and general grooming it is fine</li>
            <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full five stars is that it doesn&#x27;t vacuum up all the beard trimmings.  </li>
            <li> If you trim very very slowly, the vacuum feature does a pretty nice job of picking up probably 80-90% of the trimmed hair.</li>
            <li> Not the clunker my wife had purchased for me six years ago that pulled hairs, kept my sink a mess, and looked cheap.</li>
            <li> so I usually use it a few times a week and so far it&#x27;s been great.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;95% mess free.   </li>
            <li> But it is not 100% mess free as the package and the manufacturer suggest.</li>
            <li> The item comes with different heads, one of which will give you a wide range of length adjustments that are easily switched between.  </li>
            <li> The hinged trimming receptacle is easy to open and empty.  </li>
            <li> you end up dropping less hair below you, but over a bigger radius, so it makes more mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Finally, having to manually change out the trimmer head to trim your mustache, ears, etc is a pain, and really not all that easy.</li>
            <li> I have an previous Model of the same company trimmer and that is better than this.</li>
            <li> The chamber would fill up so quickly and I could only get what I needed after several passes in turbo mode.</li>
            <li> Decent settings, decent battery life, turbo button is required - and not an option but the reason I gave it two stars is because it simply cannot do the mustache area because the prongs hit my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> people say that the Turbo is too loud, which is why they offer an option I suppose, but in our house the bathroom is far enough away and well-insulated enough that no one can hear it running full blast.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The blade works great and the trimmer piece is very sharp which helps for precise cutting.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is weak at best, and left me cleaning up almost as much hair from my counter as my previous, non-vacuum trimmer.  </li>
            <li> It has a narrow head for fine trimming.  </li>
            <li> Speaking of the turbo setting, it&#x27;s a neat idea, but the vacuum on this one works so much better than the previous one on \\&quot;normal,\\&quot; in practice</li>
            <li> Vacuum does pick up lots of beard/stache clippings and it&#x27;s easy to empty clippings,too.  </li>
            <li> I usually use setting 1 for a close, stubble plus a little more look, and then shave my neck clean.</li>
            <li> The head is large enough that it does get cumbersome up under the nose.  </li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco Vacuum trimmer and this new design is fantistic while on turbo power rarely see any cut hair on counter or in sink.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature saves a lot of cleaning up time, and I am free of the irritations caused sometimes by a single hair.</li>
            <li> Only had it short while, but so far it has proved simple and easy to use.</li>
            <li> All of this said, I&#x27;ve used a few other trimmers in the past and this is one of the best.  </li>
            <li> I had used other brand trimmers in the past and this is by far superior.</li>
            <li> One minor problem one must clean the trimmer after each use and to take apart and to put back together</li>
            <li> This one gets hung up sometimes, but if I go slowly and don&#x27;t try to cut too much at once, it works fine.     </li>
            <li> Love the vacuum feature - keeps mess to a minimum.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;-i noticed the vacuum and quickly tried the vacuum, which can not be turned off, and the vaccum did not pull all the hair, but maybe 80% of the hair.  </li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I experienced the annoying nuisance of the trimmer length setting decreasing with normal pressure applied while trimming.</li>
            <li> I agree the case is a bit lame; it could be more rigid or padded, but if you travel with it, just roll it up inside an item of clothing and it will very likely survive just fine.  </li>
            <li> When the blades get dull eventually, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy another just like it.</li>
            <li> so there is a greater chance the clippings will get on the floor as it is hard to blow it out and aim the refuse.      </li>
            <li> The blades are sharp and cut quickly without hassle or pulling on the beard.  </li>
            <li> It is easy enough to superglue it back together, but it is a design flaw that you must grab the cup right at the seam in order to open it and empty it.  </li>
            <li> Anyway, the vacuum part of it certainly works well.</li>
            <li> However, recently the removable hair catching unit got stuck and, when I pulled too hard, the plastic broke.</li>
            <li> The blades are very sharp which has resulted in cleanly cut whiskers.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t care for the hard body, but there is a nice rubber ring (used to change the cutting depth) that makes a good grip point.</li>
            <li> The vacuum could be a little better.  </li>
            <li> The little vacuum works for the most part.  </li>
            <li> While this item is not 100% spotless after a trim, the clean up takes less than a minute.  </li>
            <li> Anyhow, the sink clean up afterwards takes a lot less time.  </li>
            <li> Others have stated quite clearly it&#x27;s benefits, which I fully agree with.    </li>
            <li> It literally catches about 90% of the hair, so there&#x27;s way less to clean up after.  </li>
            <li> A lot less to clean up around the sink.</li>
            <li> Nowhere in the instructions do they show a clear photo of a guy using the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I love how it sucks up the hair.</li>
            <li> I had devised all sorts of ways to alleviate the clippings problem and none solved it completely.  </li>
            <li> I was replacing an old conair that wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  </li>
            <li> My plan is to now get a much simpler version of this type trimmer and go back to trimming as I have always done it.</li>
            <li> But I see no reason to use it with Turbo off because then it&#x27;s just like the old underpowered version.</li>
            <li> and I think I could have gotten at least one more.  </li>
            <li> far I&#x27;ve had four shaves off the one charge</li>
            <li> So those of you that got the old fashioned NiCad batteries, they&#x27;ve updated it since then.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s bound to be loud.</li>
            <li> Meanwhile the beard trimming functions have worked well so far.  </li>
            <li> and/or there was a lock switch to lock the trimmer off completely when traveling.</li>
            <li> if you turn your hand too far over, the hairs will start to spill out - that&#x27;s happened twice in the eight times</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it so far.</li>
            <li> After 6 plus years it was time to replace my old Wahl.</li>
            <li> Was looking online for a solid trimmer for detailing my goatee, and after much research settled on the Norelco T980 Turbo Vac Trimmer.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair very short and this trimmer works very well.  </li>
            <li> This replaces my old Norelco trimmer of 5 years.</li>
            <li> Once I figured out how to use it properly, however, it worked fast to trim my beard and mustache.  </li>
            <li> This thing actually works really well.</li>
            <li> beard trimmer is really the only way to go.</li>
            <li> I purchased the T980 after my old Norelco died and I found they no longer made it.  </li>
            <li> This trimmer works well, i always use it on turbo mode just because it cuts and sucks more hair.</li>
            <li> So far, I have not had to charge it</li>
            <li> I cut the bulk of his hair with our Oster clippers, but I thought the Norelco was much easier to handle for detail work (i.e. shaping, sideburns, back of the neck).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d used my old trimmer for over 3 years with no problems whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> depth adjustment on the T980 does have a slightly soft \\&quot;click\\</li>
            <li> &quot; as definitively as the old one ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used to use my old trimmer to trim my mustache, but I&#x27;ll probably use the trimmer on my shaver for that now</li>
            <li> The turbo is a bit loud but trust me its not the end of world.</li>
            <li> My old T965&#x27;s battery gave up after 4 faithful years of service.  </li>
            <li> being said, I still LOVE this trimmer and would buy it again, but be careful when you are emptying out the cup and possibly think about only opening it over the trash can just in case.</li>
            <li> Continue using it until the battery is completely empty\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> Well to sum it up, about halfway into it I was surprised with a slip to level 2.     </li>
            <li> The old version was an AccuVac T870.    </li>
            <li> I got another trimmer to replace the old one</li>
            <li> The old one took 12 hrs.</li>
            <li> and I used it that way at times which may have compromised the battery for the old one.</li>
            <li> My bf loves it -- he threw away his old one.</li>
            <li> It also sucks up the hairs better than I&#x27;ve ever seen it.</li>
            <li> Not as loud as people are saying on here.</li>
            <li> It needs to be emptied after each use, naturally.</li>
            <li> some others have mentioned it being way too loud-</li>
            <li> in my opinion its not too loud.  </li>
            <li> (I don&#x27;t know why some referred to unexpected changes in that regard.</li>
            <li> They normally last reasonably well.</li>
            <li> many have complained about the height adjustment changing on them...</li>
            <li> I can add that for me, none of the settings match my old Remington.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it so far.</li>
            <li> I believe it&#x27;s an old style battery</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer nearly 6 years ago and it has served me well.</li>
            <li> I put it to use nearly every day of ownership.</li>
            <li> I can use the battery to complete depletion and then finish the trim using the cord.  </li>
            <li> If I had my choice, at this point, I would have preferred to stick with the old one (it was worn out).</li>
            <li> Works well enough, but doesn&#x27;t shave very close.</li>
            <li> the shaver&#x27;s really loud.  </li>
            <li> Needs frequent charging:  </li>
            <li> so     far.</li>
            <li> This battery is about shot and the trimmer is getting old</li>
            <li> Old one was a 270, el cheapo</li>
            <li> Earlier version had removable cup which seemed much easier to use.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer after my old Norelco stopped charging.</li>
            <li> This problem would not happen with a fixed blade trimmer.</li>
            <li> Just like my old T760 that I had for 5-6 years, you adjust the guard by twisting the zoom lock till you see the numbered setting you want.</li>
            <li> You become attached to the weight and feel of a trimmer and losing an old friend</li>
            <li> You can save time by forgoing the retail search and buying direct from Amazon.</li>
            <li> That only happens if you&#x27;re REALLY pressing this thing into your face, and there&#x27;s no need for that unless you&#x27;re Sasquatch.  </li>
            <li> You get a complete package of accessories too.</li>
            <li> The length adjustment does not snap into place like my old Norelco trimmer and will shift while you are shaving.</li>
            <li> When the battery no longer takes a charge, as with my old trimmer, the trimmer will not run even when the cord is plugged in.  </li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see any Norelco trimmers comparible to my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Too big, too much bling.  </li>
            <li> But the quality of its trimming is far below that on my Norelco shaver.  </li>
            <li> I got this for my 22 year old boyfriend.</li>
            <li> Works well as far as trimming your beard is concerned but the suction system isn&#x27;t as thorough as advertised.</li>
            <li> enough so that I really miss the sense of control and precision</li>
            <li> I have also been using it on the back side of head now too, cuz the hair gets really bushy there</li>
            <li> Because these buttons are where the fingers naturally sit to hold the trimmer</li>
            <li> I tried a Wahl to replace my 8 year old Norelco Maverick.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace and old Wahl vacuum-style trimmer I had for years.</li>
            <li> So far after a couple of weeks I can&#x27;t complain about this unit.</li>
            <li> The result is always neat and professional looking.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a 3.5 year old Norelco T990 when its batteries died.</li>
            <li> Many people complained that these either shifted or fell off.  </li>
            <li> If it is too loud, you are too picky.  </li>
            <li> It still misses some of the cut hairs, but it does catch nearly all of them.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer died.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s loud.  </li>
            <li> it closed, because you need to be able to open it.&lt;br /&gt;2)The spring-loaded trimmings hatch stuck open, and lost its spring.</li>
            <li> /&gt;5)The turbo is LOUD.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-Turbo does not seem too loud at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I purchased this electric razor when my old Phillips Norelco razor died on me.</li>
            <li> It does not get every hair but nearly all.  </li>
            <li> Even though it may be fairly loud</li>
            <li> WELL worth the money I spent for it.</li>
            <li> It also has a turbo option, but is already powerful enough on its standard setting to do the job.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s solid, powerful and holds a charge through several trimmings.</li>
            <li> Good product, but seems expensive.  </li>
            <li> i still get hair in the sink, though a little less.... not really a big difference from the old model but an amazing feature!  </li>
            <li> The vacuum wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected, since it still misses a few hairs.  </li>
            <li> I keep my beard pretty short and the vacuum under normal power does the job.    </li>
            <li> Still - there&#x27;s definitely LESS left over for me to clean up after he trims his beard!</li>
            <li> I had a crappy old vacuum beard trimmer by Remmington that I replaced because It would never trim evenly, even if I really really tried, I&#x27;d always end up with a bald spot on my chinstrap</li>
            <li> The vacuum is definitely worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> so I think its worth the extra money for the vacuum.   </li>
            <li> vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch enough hair for it to be worth all of the inconveniences of its design flaws.</li>
            <li> I let it drain the battery until it indicated it was time for a charge (neat new flashy light thingy does that), but it let me use the trimmer for full trim (I do my head and my beard) about 6 - 7 times before it needed to be re charged.    </li>
            <li> This is quite an improvement as far as vacuuming almost all the tiny hairs, which is to say, Norelco finally got the speed right.</li>
            <li> I say unfortunately, because the vacuum actually works pretty good when the unit is new.</li>
            <li> The vacuum really works and emptying is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really follow the vacuum or turbo descriptions but bought it anyway based on price.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t really need the vacuum however.   </li>
            <li> Really appreciate the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco 7980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer a couple of weeks ago and really like it.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum really works but you gotta have turbo on.  </li>
            <li> My real issue is the vacuum shield gets in the way while I trim my beard.</li>
            <li> I really like the Turbo Vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum works very well, and the cut is even with NO pulls on my hairs.</li>
            <li> It collects all the trimmings very well, and does not leave lots of stray hairs on my shirt.[[ASIN:B000FED5D0 Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ll still need to trim over a sink or trash container, which really takes away from the advantage of having the vacuum (even on the Turbo setting).  </li>
            <li> The vacuum does work really well, and the noise does not bother me -as</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t really care about the vacuum function you might want to keep in mind that trade off.  </li>
            <li> My sink drain and my wife are quite grateful with the vacuum, the cat not so much.</li>
            <li> However, cleanup is much much easier than it would be without any vacuum</li>
            <li> The vacuum works very well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum didn&#x27;t work very well</li>
            <li> Not to mention that the vacuum is much stronger on this newer model also.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum really works.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature was much appreciated.  </li>
            <li> But the vacuum feature tends to obscure your view of the blade edge making it much trickier to aim the thing at your beard&#x27;s edge while looking in the mirror.</li>
            <li> I really like the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> It trims well and the vacuum really works.</li>
            <li> but yes the vacuum really works.</li>
            <li> And the vacuum feature works really well.</li>
            <li> My son appreciated the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer!</li>
            <li> a major difference in this model compared to the old one - you can use it connected to the outlet!  </li>
            <li> After one day of use the blue piece that gathers the hair into the vacuum broke right off.</li>
            <li> It has an integrated vacuum that pulls out more than 90% of the mess!  </li>
            <li> Strong battery, at least new.</li>
            <li> and even then I&#x27;ll have to clean both the sink and the little transparent bin</li>
            <li> This Norelco shaver works well if there is not much hair to remove; however, if one is shaving a substantial amount of hair, it takes several passes to clean it up.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several other beard trimmers, and was very excited about the features this one provides: adjustability, turbo vacuum, EASY-adjust, ability to use corded</li>
            <li> Cordless feature is great to trim in shower and not make a mess in bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;The bells and whistles such as turbo power and vacuum chamber are more annoying than useful.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works reasonably well, and the vacuum on the high setting (why did they bother with a low?) gets almost all the hair.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint about the unit is that the button is very easily depressed when it&#x27;s in the case.  </li>
            <li> Products works great with only a few small issues.    </li>
            <li> I like this razor because it has a long lasting battery, which makes the whole process much easier.</li>
            <li> I use it also to buzz cut my hair and there is virtually no mess now</li>
            <li> I trimmed the Fuzz and it made no mess whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> By now, he&#x27;s used it all around the house, and still no mess.</li>
            <li> It is a bit bigger than my old small Wahl, but it has more features that require that.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t see why hair should get trapped under there, but it does and reduces the trimming ability significantly.</li>
            <li> now there is no mess.  </li>
            <li> no mess.</li>
            <li> I had no mess from when I did trim it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this quite a few years now, and it&#x27;s still going on the original battery.</li>
            <li> They said they&#x27;d send a new one out and that I should just put the old one back in the same box, apply the PP label they&#x27;ll include and drop the whole enchilada in the mail.</li>
            <li> Its various settings are easy to work with, give you enough range for whatever length you&#x27;re looking for, and the closest setting will give you the short stubble length that is very short.     </li>
            <li> , it had a lot more positive reviews than negative and it was the most expensive trimmer on amazon at the time</li>
            <li> The decibel level of the vacuum should not bother any red blooded man who enjoys going to sporting events and screaming at the top of his lungs, or watching a dragster blast down a quarter mile in 4 seconds.  </li>
            <li> Finally, while the adjuster ring generally performs well, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;click\\&quot; at the right spot in the low number range.</li>
            <li> It shaves cleanly and hasn&#x27;t given me any trouble.  </li>
            <li> The battery only lasts for about three shaves (maybe less considering how many times you have to go over the same patches to get everything even).</li>
            <li> Although the mechanics look the same this one felt like it delivered a smoother shave than my older model.</li>
            <li> The only thing that I don&#x27;t like as much as an older model of this trimmer that I had is that it has a hinged door to remove the clippings from the trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I used my T980 about 2 to 3 times a week for a fast trim and did not need to re-charge it since I first got it, which was a few weeks ago.</li>
            <li> The back of the trimmer guide looks odd, but it works fine.  </li>
            <li> In other words, if you travel, you can&#x27;t charge this trimmer in most other countries.</li>
            <li> The height adjustment doesn&#x27;t seem quite as pronounced as my older Norelco trimmer (meaning you can obviously tell when it clicks into place...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend starting on a higher length setting and adjusting it shorter until it cuts at the desired length.</li>
            <li> The button to operate the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature (totally unnecessary) is extremely cheap and came off the first time I pressed it.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I have no faith that this one will perform and hold-up any better than the first.</li>
            <li> The T-980 is larger around and heavier than the older unit...</li>
            <li> The beard cutting is very uniform, seems to be plenty of height adjustment settings, and about 95% of the trimmings magically got sucked into the little chamber instead of all over my bathroom counter, which is a huge boost for my marriage!  </li>
            <li> (the little metal rod under the head that spins to move the blades back and forth) to solve a decrease in performance, but this is easily done by turning on the trimmer and poking with the brush provided until the hairs come out.</li>
            <li> As advised in the operating manual, I started with a longer length and worked my way down to a setting that fit what I wanted by simply turning a dial.  </li>
            <li> Since this model is no longer available, (I would have bought it again), and since Remington, no longer offers a vacuum trimmer for some odd reason, I had to look elsewhere.  </li>
            <li> Not bad, but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature actually works pretty well.</li>
            <li> trimmer might be the best compromise of cost / features / functionality out there, but was disappointed with the vacuum capabilities even on Turbo.  </li>
            <li> It has the vacuum and a extra Turbo function that your first time you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s going to pull off all the hair.</li>
            <li> The other reviews are right about the turbo mode, though.</li>
            <li> What little the vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch is easily wiped with a sponge.  </li>
            <li> Because of the vacuum, you cannot do close trimming with the main head and switching heads is a pain.  </li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an older model Norelco trimmer without a vacuum function.  </li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer because the older version I had died after about 3 years of use.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older model norelco vacuum trimmer with this one.  </li>
            <li> What a major upgrade it was!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;While the trimmer itself is a little bigger than most, it charges with just a power cord and has only one precision attachment.</li>
            <li> Vacuum: Like me, you may be interested in the included vacuum, rather than getting hair all over the place.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few years, and it&#x27;s held up to regular use and still going strong.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too loud and for those very early morning trimmings you can turn the turbo off as to not disturb anyone who may be sleeping in the next room over.</li>
            <li> Anyway, hope to prevent people from having the same frustrations I have after spending $40 for something that could barely shave your head much less something a bit more technical, like your face!</li>
            <li> I just find the whole set up \\&quot;gimmicky\\&quot; and I will take the old standard guides and no vacuum any day.    </li>
            <li> I use the vacuum on the high setting.</li>
            <li> In short, I can find only positive to say about this trimmer</li>
            <li> A potential positive is not having to oil the blades, but only if this does not shorten product life.   </li>
            <li> My only complaint would be that the settings are very easy to change mid shave (as some have pointed out) and you can very easily have an uneven beard if you arent careful.</li>
            <li> to long (9), works really well.</li>
            <li> The zero feature makes it look like you shaved that morning and the stubble has just barely started to grow in, and if you wanted to be completely hairless</li>
            <li> but the charge lasts so long it really isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> Just through normal wear, it is time for a replacement, but I will keep my current one as a backup.    </li>
            <li> Also, just be sure to open the window and chuck out some hair along the way (few times only).</li>
            <li> Last but not least, watch out for the settings.  </li>
            <li> Overall, this is a good but not great personal appliance.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok trimmer, nothing bad per say, wish it had a bit more vacuum.  </li>
            <li> No, the vacuum doesn&#x27;t pick up everything, but it makes clean up much much less bothersome than the old trimmer I used.    </li>
            <li> The vacuum intrigued me -- would it really be worth the extra $20-25 over a standard trimmer?</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried quite a few, and this one is pretty decent.    </li>
            <li> I use the # 2 length setting, and thats just right for a stubble - just enough to feel, but too short to actually grip any of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> For the guys who are able to keep their beards a little longer this is probably not much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I had a few reservations due to other comments about the settings changing mid trim but after watching the great video review posted on here decided to go for it.</li>
            <li> It takes me much less time to trim my beard and cuts much better than any other trimmer I have tried.  </li>
            <li> I have to say in some ways I don&#x27;t like it as much as the plain Norelco trimmer it replaced, but I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars because the main reason I bought this, for the vacuum, works very well.  </li>
            <li> : it provides an even cut in difficult areas, it is light and not noisy, and the vaccum works better than in other models I tried.</li>
            <li> The vacuum captures most (but not all) of the hair trimmings, it has a wide range of length settings, and battery holds a charge for a long enough time that it has never been a bother.</li>
            <li> and I am only leaving this review as I am on Amazon looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> It was exchanged when I returned and the new one seems to work properly.</li>
            <li> the new plastic guide is bigger on this one.</li>
            <li> I decided it was finally time to just go for it and get a new one, and based on the reviews of this trimmer I decided to try it out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely the trimmer to get if you&#x27;re in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li> but because the overall trimmer function has worked well for over four years decided to purchase a new one.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I purchased a new one is the charger broke</li>
            <li> The major complaints I had with all of these products were that a) they pulled my beard hair and hurt and b) were very messy and not at all precise.  </li>
            <li> Does a clean job of cutting, vacuums cut hair up  well, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> The trim time takes less than one minute, and only seconds to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> The vaccum feature sucks all the cut hair and is easy to wash, charge and carry in the provided pouch.</li>
            <li> i started running the trimmer first on my arms, which was not nearly as thick as face and noticed it was uneven after two runs.  </li>
            <li> but, at some point in the next several days, when it isn&#x27;t too much of a bother, could you please plug me in for a bit?\\&quot;  Nothing urgent about it whatsoever.  </li>
            <li> I would say as long as you shave in the proper direction (where the blade cuts first and the suction thingy follows)</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a few weeks (based on using it 2 x week, 5 min each), recharges quickly, works with or without the cord.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum works much better than expected and the trimmer works without any pulling or biting like other trimmers.  </li>
            <li> Also, product arrived quickly, within a few days.</li>
            <li> Very fast with little (if any) cleanup required thanks to the built-in vacuum functionality.</li>
            <li> So, as a trimmer (used very frequently and with very short hair trimmings)</li>
            <li> , no more \\&quot;little hairs all over\\&quot; -- of course a few leak out here and there, but I usually do a good enough job to keep my wife happy with a little wipe down around the sink, etc.</li>
            <li> i will note that if you are cutting off a lot of long beard hair it will miss more than if you do it regularly and trim short hair more frequently.</li>
            <li> And then I found the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, that has the close to skin blade trimmer attachment that is very useful in getting sharp edges of the style on your facial hair.</li>
            <li> When I had used a scissors to trim my beard, the results were just so-so and there was always a big mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is made so that there is less of a clean up</li>
            <li> I think because of the vacuum this trimmer seems a bit louder during operation than my last trimmer but by no means is it a chainsaw (haha).    </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature HELPS so much; much less to clean up on the sink afterwards.</li>
            <li> As for the vacuum part... it is a marked improvement over the old method of covering the sink with a towel or just wiping all the stubble off after trimming.</li>
            <li> The T980&#x27;s vacuum actually DOES work very well...</li>
            <li> The head is easily manipulated for different cutting lengths, as well as be removed for the fine trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Well, I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews!  </li>
            <li> This is not a big deal, properly seating the guard on the device is pretty simple.      </li>
            <li> What totally amazed me is after the first initial charge (following instructions)</li>
            <li> This is a major advancement in retail trimmers.</li>
            <li> major pros of this product:  </li>
            <li> This vacuum works very well; the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; vacuum setting is somewhat louder but does not bother me at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a little over a year, and prior to this I&#x27;d been using a similar product by Norelco, so I came to love the vacuum concept.  </li>
            <li> A full charge last me long enough for me to forget when was the last time I charged it</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s true that because of the vacuum, there is less hair in the sink.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;edging\\&quot; operation was a little less successful, but I think that new personal care products like this always take a little while to get used to.  </li>
            <li> I think this one cost less than my previous and has more features.</li>
            <li> I bought the T980 to replace my older model Norelco trimmer, which died after several years of regular use.  </li>
            <li> Overall, the trimmer has a lot of positive points (quiet, efficient, vacuum works well, etc)</li>
            <li> The storage pouch is a little weird, but I found I can fit both the trimmer and my electric razor in it without any problems, so all the better.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I spent the little extra.    </li>
            <li> the big lesson here is to be sure buy a wet/dry beard trimmer that won&#x27;t die if it gets a little wet.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is decent, but won&#x27;t keep the occasional stray hair from hitting the counter.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard that Norelco is the best, but the T980 turbo vacuum trimmer is a little disappointing.  </li>
            <li> In general I like Philips products</li>
            <li> I generally like the shave.      </li>
            <li> The hairs generally grow up toward the ear and this thing, on \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; or not cannot cut them.  </li>
            <li> Apparently this model has been upgraded to this unit:  </li>
            <li> My old one seemed to like to die occasionally when I wasn&#x27;t quite finished using it</li>
            <li> but I like my choice and have no regrets..             </li>
            <li> Not much to complain about, really.</li>
            <li> Philips has now replaced the old standard coiled power cords with specialized adapters.  </li>
            <li> Even with the guide off it could barely shave my beard.  </li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my old Norelco, only because the batteries died and they could not be replaced.</li>
            <li> ive spent so much money on crappy shavers</li>
            <li> I guess I expected too much.  </li>
            <li> My old Remington had a built in mini-trimmer that flipped up on the back side - nothing to remove - just flip up and use.  </li>
            <li> That said, unless you&#x27;re worried about waking a sleeping baby in the same room, it&#x27;s not obnoxiously loud.    </li>
            <li> The only thing i would improve is a charge meter which was on the old version.</li>
            <li> I have not tried the Turbo mode since the regular setting works perfectly so far.    </li>
            <li> Speaking of the adjustable guide, check the setting often, or you&#x27;ll end up with a surprise...a much closer cut than you expected.</li>
            <li> Apparently, the thing was on backorder, but nobody at Phillips/Norelco Customer Service bothered to disclose that fact, nor did they provide a tracking number.</li>
            <li> I bought the T980 to replace my old T760, which has a similar shape and size.     </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it about seven or eight times so far and still haven&#x27;t recharged it from it&#x27;s initial charge.</li>
            <li> Never wet.</li>
            <li> Possible for pressure to turn on clipper when in soft case; it&#x27;s happened to me.  </li>
            <li> Of coarse buying a product from Amazon directly</li>
            <li> Never have I owned a more poorly designed device.</li>
            <li> All in all, the T980 works OK but not great.</li>
            <li> Good except the mustache trimmer requires changing the head blade, which can be inconvenient.</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas, but it was more for me than for him because I was tired of cleaning up his beard hairs from around the sink when he was done trimming.  </li>
            <li> it sure doesn&#x27;t leave much behind to be cleaned up.</li>
            <li> it gets worse the more you use it.</li>
            <li> It does struggle a little bit with longer bushy hairs (as most do), but works like a champ when keeping previously trimmed ones in check.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is nice and makes cleaning up small jobs easier, especially since I don&#x27;t have to sweep hair off a wet sink afterwards.</li>
            <li> The blades on this are not very sharp, and the length adjustment collapses when in use.</li>
            <li> The vacuum part of it doesn&#x27;t work well unless its in &#x27;turbo&#x27; mode, and its not quite as loud as a blow-dryer.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have used this trimmer for one month and was surprised at how well the trimmer and vacuum system work.  </li>
            <li> There&#x27;s a sliding plastic panel that I guess is there to help direct hair into the vacuum, but it makes trimming without the guide a bit of a pain.  </li>
            <li> Despite the vacuum action, whiskers collect in every nook and cranny.</li>
            <li> I can now trim my beard at the sink with a fraction of the cleanup that was required with my old trimmer that didn&#x27;t have a vacuum.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the vacuum action to work so well.</li>
            <li> Two years later still don&#x27;t have the same features for new trimmers.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a bit loud, but it is a vacuum!</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does leave a few hairs in the sink, but that&#x27;s expected with all trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> The T980 comes with a 2 bristle (one soft, one hard) brush for cleaning out the clippers but what really is unique about this trimmer is the vacuum that is attached to it.</li>
            <li> I also had no mess when I used on my back.    </li>
            <li> Until then, save your money and use a regular shaver with replaceable trimming attachments and put down a paper towel to catch the hair.s design right.</li>
            <li> (my goatie had gotten long, waiting for a new trimmer)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty large, and the blades are set back about 1/2 inch from the edge, so it&#x27;s hard to get close in some areas (nose and ears).</li>
            <li> The new vacuum feature allows for the capture of only about 60-70% of the hair trimmed.  </li>
            <li> As it stands, I&#x27;m going to wait for this product to evolve a little further before purchasing from Norelco again -- unless a competitor comes up with an improved design first!</li>
            <li> the only problem i found is that it doesn&#x27;t gives you look like you have after doing a shave...which could be obtained by using other higher models of philips...</li>
            <li> Hair at the top of the upper lip is difficult to reach with the main trimmer, but put on the mini-trimmer attachment (which takes about 5 seconds) and it&#x27;s a breeze.</li>
            <li> I have tried several trimmers over the last ten years - Wahl, Panasonic, an older Norelco -</li>
            <li> and it is better than all the other trimmers he owned in the past.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little bulky, so getting the hairs under the nose takes just a little more effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The sideburn attachment is a little small to my liking which makes it had to get an accurate straight trim of sideburns.  </li>
            <li> So I bought it thinking they couldn&#x27;t possibly sell it at such a high price point with such an unsuitable battery.      </li>
            <li> This is somewhat frustrating, as one has to go over the same areas more than I used to with my old similar model.  </li>
            <li> And the vacuum, when using the turbo, gets all the hair; it leaves no mess at all.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so much improved over the older trimmer that I had been using for the past couple of years.</li>
            <li> Main downsides: Made in China and has non replaceable battery, no removable hair chamber-only small door opens and have to shake whole trimmer over garbage can to get hair out.    </li>
            <li> Just to check this, I deliberately applied enough pressure on levels 2 and 3, hard enough to punch my face with it but the trimmer stayed at the selected level, did  not slid down to 1, probably i was not hammering it into my face as other guys did, lol.  </li>
            <li> I just trimmed my beard, which had grown out over the past two weeks, and amazingly, the sink below me only had a few pieces of hair in it.</li>
            <li> but since we&#x27;re triming hair and not a full lawn of grass it seems pretty</li>
            <li> I travel a lot for work and this tool is small enough to fit in my travel medicine bag along with my standard razor.  </li>
            <li> , you have to blow really hard on the comb in order to clean the path.  </li>
            <li> Normally when i trim my beard the bathroom counter is covered in hair which is annoying to clean, but with this buzzer about 85% of the hair gets contained in the buzzer and is easily emptied.  </li>
            <li> The batteries in some other devices (which use other chemistry) do not require any of these special maintenance routines to remember.</li>
            <li> Using it on a mustache is useless especially right underneath your nose.</li>
            <li> Brush falls out of small compartment in case (will be easy to loose it someday).  </li>
            <li> Cuts well enough, vacuum doesn&#x27;t really seem to work for me (I suppose it may be because I wait too long between trimmings).  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial real estate to cover, so I don&#x27;t have to empty it as often as others might.</li>
            <li> Well in today corporate world I&#x27;m really surprised when the product actually is what the advertisement say.</li>
            <li> So far, with my weekly usage I&#x27;ve only had to do 2 charges since the initial one.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a 5-6 year old similar version that finally gave out on me.   </li>
            <li> still has a tendency to go down a trimmer level while you shave if you&#x27;re not careful and put too much pressure on it.</li>
            <li> it got all but two little hairs the first time out..and the rest is history..</li>
            <li> the battery seems to hold its charge really well.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a cinch.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s noisy with turbo on, but certainly not in the same vicinity as a hair dryer.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised that the vacuum feature actual does work.  </li>
            <li> However, I&#x27;m also not really seeing much benefit from the vacuum part.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The vacuum is power and made more powerful over earlier models through the use of the \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; button that amps up the cutting power and vacuum power substantially.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I can think of is that I&#x27;d prefer finer granularity between settings, meaning I&#x27;d like to be able to trim at number 3 and 1/2 (3 is a bit too short for my linking, 4 a bit too long).</li>
            <li> &quot; right out of the box, but contrary to what I&#x27;ve read, it holds the setting at least as firmly as my old one.  </li>
            <li> No more damp toilet tissue wiping of the sink basin to clean up the clippings.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is loud, but then again, it&#x27;s a vacuum</li>
            <li> I was left with a funny looking longer part of the mustache and looking like a dictator from the previous century which i will not name.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is gimmick that works more or less, but the recepticle can pop open without warning and dump lots of little trimmings everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Love the vacumn collection space as the mess leaves very little cleanup.</li>
            <li> This new trimmer is great so far, except for one feature: the vacuum system has a plastic sheath right infront of the trimmer teeth, and if you want to cut or shape your beard using the naked trimmer without the numbered head, it becomes difficult to gauge where the trimmer is cutting because of the obstruction.</li>
            <li> The vacuum and container make this a no mess beard trimmer, go from stubble to short hair by adjusting the guide.</li>
            <li> It gives a really neat trim and can get places with the additional smaller clipper than other trimmers I have used.</li>
            <li> Admittedly though I have only used the turbo vacuum on my person as I cant imagine a situation when you&#x27;d want less suckage... except to make this more stealthy when you have a few beers and decide its time to shave the cat...</li>
            <li> I am not a fan of the trimmer when you take the guard off, I still prefer my old Norelco for this, and I do wish it had a nose/ear trimmer also, but these are minor gripes.  </li>
            <li> I had an old norelco that lasted 10 years, but the internal battery only lasted about 3 minutes before i finally threw it out...</li>
            <li> This machine has a cool resevoir for hair- which makes cleaning up easier because it sucks in a lot of the hair.  </li>
            <li> So, I used it for the first time this AM, put the setting on 5 or 6, but after a few strokes on the beard, it reset itself to the lowest setting.  </li>
            <li> He said it is a handy little trimmer and works well, but it is rather noisy at regular speed and sounds like a small jet engine in his ear with the turbo on!</li>
            <li> I am so mad about trying to register for this trimmer for warranty service on the Phillips Norelco web page that I can&#x27;t actually say whether or not the trimmer is any good.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had the Turbo Vacuum Trimmer for a few weeks, but my experience so far has been mostly positive.  </li>
            <li> Sure the Trimmer has 9 different settings, but what they don&#x27;t tell you is that you&#x27;ll usually end up with a 2 every time unless you tape it down.</li>
            <li> Finally, it is not easy to remove the beard length piece to perform a close trim right above the lip.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be returning it and looking for a different vacuum trimmer with a battery that will be useful for longer than a few months.</li>
            <li> The only exception is a neat little detail trimmer that stands eternally at the ready in itsown clear and obvious pocket inside the travel pouch.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not any louder than any other electric razor I have tried (even on turbo), and it doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a mess to clean up.</li>
            <li> The turbo is not that loud (no significant difference between normal mode and turbo).</li>
            <li> I recall one guy saying he was pressing super hard</li>
            <li> The other brands that I used consisted of clip on guards, a single guard that slid to the proper length and in most cases never locked correctly giving an uneven cut.    </li>
            <li> I love that feature as my beard is grey and tough.</li>
            <li> First, the \\&quot;on\\&quot; and \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; buttons are too easy to push while handling, and I&#x27;m constantly startling myself with the turbo setting (it is a little loud).  </li>
            <li> This is my third Norelco trimmer, none of them seem to have much staying power, my other two had similar clogging issues with the blade, and both had the rechargeable battery die.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is also loud enough that it would wake up someone sleeping in the same room but not the next room.    </li>
            <li> With the vacuum set on low, I barely see any clippings now!</li>
            <li> The setting indicator is so small I need my reading glasses to insure I&#x27;ve got it right.</li>
            <li> In short, the T-980 feels clumsier, less maneuverable, and less accurate.</li>
            <li> This thing works well and it really does create much less hair in your sink.  </li>
            <li> I typically charge it while I am in the shower and then remove the charger to trim (it holds charge very well).</li>
            <li> My first, a Remington was at least 15 years old and worked like a champ.</li>
            <li> : I typically get several weeks worth of trimming (every 2-3 days) on a single charge.</li>
            <li> (while neat) doesn&#x27;t put up much resistance to being knocked down to the next setting.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the vacuum, but it really does the job keeping the bathroom clean.  </li>
            <li> the vacuum feature is pretty gimmicky.</li>
            <li> The unit is a little large, but not unwieldy.  </li>
            <li> but it doesnt leave you with a whole lot of mess.</li>
            <li> After leaving my beard a patchy mess I decided to just shave the whole thing.  </li>
            <li> The vacumn works great, which alone makes my purchase of it worthwhile to me; in the past the sink always had a lot of nasty looking hairs all over it.</li>
            <li> reviewers have complained about the noise but to me it seems about average as far as sound goes.  </li>
            <li> Really the only reason to replace my previous trimmer was that the battery no longer held a charge and the batteries are not replaceable.  </li>
            <li> You get a reasonable use time before re-charging, but ever now and again you will have a situation where your trimmer or shaver gets turned on while packed tight in your luggage - then you will be out of luck.</li>
            <li> Worked will at first then within the first couple months of ownership plastic parts began to fail, generally when the unit was being taken apart for regular cleaning.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle trimmer, it doesn&#x27;t suck up every single hair, but is a vast improvement over his old method.</li>
            <li> If you are in a bit of a rush and trim quickly, it will of course miss a few more hairs but manages to still suck up about 70% of what its cutting.  </li>
            <li> The fine tuning length control works well, although I recommend you always start a little long and work down.  </li>
            <li> For me the 2 is a little on the short side and 3 is a bit much.  </li>
            <li> and i understand this is not a vacuum cleaner, its a trimmer and as a matter of fact i dont even use turbo mode, its just not required.  </li>
            <li> The hair catcher was a cup that could be removed and be easily dumped into a waste basket; this model has a fragile door, the hairs do not easily come out or off of the filter and tapping the unit could damage it.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is good, keeps the mess to a minimum, but not perfect.  </li>
            <li> Also, due to the added bulk of the vacuum, it&#x27;s a little less precise than my old Norelco trimmer, which it replaced.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature works very well, leaving little to no cleanup.  </li>
            <li> My only problem is that when I try to trim my stash straight along my lip a little piece of plastic associated with the vacuum mechanism gets in the way.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting a trimmer with a vacuum option on it, so when I was buying some other new trimmers and shavers, I decided to get this one too.  </li>
            <li> The &lt;br /&gt;difference between a good haircut and a bad haircut is two weeks.</li>
            <li> Of course it would be great if it were completely silent, but really it&#x27;s not that bad.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it yet, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much advantage to it vs my old, clumsy trimmer.</li>
            <li> you empty - which I suspect won&#x27;t last long unless you&#x27;re pretty careful.</li>
            <li> Only negative is with vacuum rectangular hole next to cut line the exact location of cut line while trimming less certain.</li>
            <li> To get a closer shave, I had to use the smaller mini-trimmer attachment which unfortunately doesn&#x27;t work as well with the vacuum, so a lot more hairs were all over my sink.  </li>
            <li> Very little hair to clean up due to the vacuum feature which is a big issue for me.</li>
            <li> Reasonably quest unless you turn on the turbo vacuum, which I only use with the narrow trimming tool.    </li>
            <li> but the vacuum simply cannot handle the sheer volume and coarseness of his facial hair.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is not perfect, but a lot better than not having one.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum always seemed kinda useless, mostly hype.</li>
            <li> Anything finer than coarse facial hair jams up the vacuum system,</li>
            <li> The somewhat bulky size to accommodate the vacuum unit requires an initial adjustment if you&#x27;re used to smaller units.  </li>
            <li> So I said to the woman I can either get the 15$ beard trimmer or one that is more expensive but is supposed to have a vacuum in it.  </li>
            <li> When I open up that compartment and throw away the clump in there and think that all that could be spread around the sink, floor, entire bathroom, I bless the vacuum.</li>
            <li> So if you apply a normal amount of pressure to the device, your number 5 beard setting will be pushed down to a number 1.</li>
            <li> They claim that because the warantee period is up on the ORIGINAL defective unit, that they can do nothing about the replacement unit they supplied, i.e., they won&#x27;t stand behind the product even though any other new one has a TWO-Year warrantee.</li>
            <li> , if only Braun would make the same trimmer with a vacuum function!  </li>
            <li> I just bought a Phillips-Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, and if any of you men or women are looking to give your beard that perpetual &#x27;George Michael-esque&#x27; look, search no further.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum will only catch about 3/4 of the hair.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is a big plus.</li>
            <li> the turbo vacuum is terrific.</li>
            <li> The vacuum, the rechargable batteries, the low noise.  </li>
            <li> The fact that I don&#x27;t have to use oil is a big plus, and the vacuum feature saves a lot on cleanup.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t vacuum up all the hair, but makes the overall cleaner process.  </li>
            <li> The T980 is an improvement over my last because of the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li> I recently bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Especially like the vacuum feature</li>
            <li> This is my second vacuum trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I especially like the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the vacuum to catch everything (especially since I&#x27;m using the trimmer to leave my beard at a 1/2\\&quot; length- setting 7 of 9).  </li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco Vacuum Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum works well enough.</li>
            <li> I purchased the T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer as a replacement for a Norelco trimmer I had cherished for ten years.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum does its job and sink cleanup is definitely faster.</li>
            <li> you remove the trimmer guard to just use the trimming blade itself for detail trimming, the blue plastic vacuum guard blocks the trimming blade.</li>
            <li> Vacuum actually works to get 90% of the hair into the chamber instead of on the counter/sink.</li>
            <li> At any rate, the T980 is the current state-of-the-art in vacuum beard trimmers, and I recommend it, the packaging notwithstanding.</li>
            <li> function that increases the speed of the blades and increases vacuum at the same time.</li>
            <li> My old Norelco had a stiff rotating switch that could never cycle on/off unexpectedly.     </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Norelco really messed up what they had right to begin with.</li>
            <li> The vaccum is not good or better than the previous model.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works well, but the blue collection piece gets in the way when shaving, and also causes the vacuum to miss some.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is not strong enough to prevent lots of hairs everywhere, but post-trim cleanup is much faster now.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum is not strong enough to pull the hair in, and it clogs the whole works.  </li>
            <li> However it is very hard to clean.</li>
            <li> I do have to empty the vacuum container a few times but less mess is far better.  </li>
            <li> The batteries last much longer than necessary (at least, in the first few months of ownership) but using the trimmer corded isn&#x27;t a problem.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;this will really clog up and create a super mess if you try to use it when your hair is the least bit wet.</li>
            <li> It takes longer to complete the job due to the hassle of changing the regular blade and the trimming blade.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer had a switch that just caused a smaller trimmer blade to pop out, so I didn&#x27;t have to remove all of the other stuff this trimmer makes you remove.</li>
            <li> The vacuum misses a lot, collects maybe 75% and misses the rest.</li>
            <li> The vacuum collects perhaps 90% of your trimmings.  </li>
            <li> The one star is for the vacuum.</li>
            <li> I owned another Norelco beard trimmer with a vacuum in it ... until my wife broke it by knocking it off the shelf.</li>
            <li> I wanted results, and the vacuum was just a perk anyway.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum function works well and makes clean-up a ten-second job.  </li>
            <li> My biggest problem is that the vacuum hair container broke after about 10 uses (the plastic shell snapped off the clip-in part of the container).</li>
            <li> &quot; On two of three sites I checked, the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer was tops.     </li>

            <li> buy the one without the vacuum.</li>
            <li> (and the vacuum feature rocks cleanup)</li>
            <li> Not everyone who sells a \\&quot;vacuum trimmer\\&quot; truly means it.  </li>
            <li> When using the trimmer without the comb/guide, like for neck cleanup, the vacuum tube blocks your view of the cutter.</li>
            <li> The vacuum picks up about 75-80% of all the hair that falls but WILL not pick up everything.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum picks up 95% + of the hair it cuts.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because of it&#x27;s built in guard and vacuum capabilities.  </li>
            <li> I like the vacuum suction.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum system draws in cuttings to minimize clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The vacuum attachment works well even when it&#x27;s not on Turbo</li>
            <li> There have been a lot of complaints about the vacuum option of this trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I speak of the vacuum.</li>
            <li> So I decided to try &amp; find him a vacuum trimmer for christmas.</li>
            <li> the latch to the vacuum receptacle broke almost immediately.</li>
            <li> While it&#x27;s difficult to get close to the nose because of the larger size of this unit, I don&#x27;t see that as a big deal because with the smaller precision tool you can do this quite easily with a mustache comb if you are not much for completely manual operations.  </li>
            <li> The only negative I can think of is that the small trimmer head and brush don&#x27;t fit neatly into the soft case.  </li>
            <li> This vacuum system works!</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature of this model works!  </li>
            <li> That means you&#x27;ve got this small trimmer head that you have to keep in the medicine cabinet or when you travel in a safe place where you won&#x27;t lose it; the depth indicator is hard to read and the numbers aren&#x27;t always centered in the tiny viewing window.  </li>
            <li> It does come with a cheap attachment for linings, but I prefer cutting from the blade, like in the older models.    </li>
            <li> For me, this unit replaced an older model Norelco from a few years back.  </li>
            <li> After nearly a year of use, the blades have stayed sharp and haven&#x27;t pulled.    </li>
            <li> I spent all this time growing), but really, any concern of this at all can be eliminated by holding the trimmer so that your grip doesn&#x27;t allow the height guide to move (which, at least for me, is a perfectly normal way to hold the trimmer).    </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that the guard is pretty big</li>
            <li> /&gt;Another annoyance is that it doesn&#x27;t get the occasional whisker that lies almost flat to the skin without repeated passes.  </li>
            <li> It has been 4 1/2 years since I bought one (use it 3x a week) and only recently do I notice the battery not lasting as long as it use to.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of life or my morning routine, but it is still pretty annoying.  </li>
            <li> The holding space for clippings is pretty big and unless you have a thick beard, you probably won&#x27;t have to change it until after several uses.  </li>
            <li> As others warn, it can trim pretty close if you set the dial too low, I found out the hard way with a \\&quot;2\\&quot; and eventually settled on \\&quot;4\\&quot; for my setting.  </li>
            <li> PLUS it&#x27;s got this vacuum-device on it that sucks up the stray hairs into a special chamber, which you then pull out and empty when you&#x27;re done trimming.   </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m going to look for the G390 or another similar model from Norelco - the G390 was about half price, didn&#x27;t have vacuum or direct AC but did have multiple attachments, upright stand and lasted 4 years despite the antiquated battery technology.</li>
            <li> no mess with the hairs due to the vacuum.</li>
            <li> but it is a small problem that doesnt really diminish the overall usefullness of the product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go close enough -- not nearly close enough.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair short and for me 3 is too long and 2 is too short.  </li>
            <li> This thing should last me a long time (it comes with a 2 year warranty) and will pay for itself becuase it allows me to keep the beard/goatee at my corporate job and fight the man!</li>
            <li> It holds a charge for a long time inbetween trims (I maybe trim 2x a week and only charge it every 3rd week or so).  </li>
            <li> Poor design clogs easily and requires frequent and messy cleanings to keep in operation.</li>
            <li> I used to have trouble with the older model T770; the dial that regulates how close a trim you get would slip a notch.  </li>
            <li> There is very little mess to clean up.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t cut the beard hair evenly and the length guide slips so that it will suddenly cut your beard down to nearly bald with no warning.  </li>
            <li> Very little hair to clean up (might be poor technique on my part); keeps its charge, very efficient.</li>
            <li> It seems absurd that the only removable part on the unit, a part that is removed regularly as a part of its function, a part that is made of fragile plastic, would not be available for replacement.</li>
            <li> As I said above, I always use the trimmer in &#x27;Turbo&#x27; mode and it&#x27;s not supposed to last very long that way.  </li>
            <li> No more trying to clean up those little hairs.  </li>
            <li> The trimming head actually bends to the contours of your face and trims every single hair to the same height when shaving upward.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a 4 year old Norelco G390 which served me reasonably well for the past 4 years till its NiCd battery died (bought at a \\&quot;warehouse\\&quot; store for just under $20).&lt;br /&gt;There are over 600 reviews with an average of 4 stars</li>
            <li> The smaller trimmer head also cuts rough and felt more uncomfortable.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to do with the turbo though, don&#x27;t see much use for it in my case.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s build quality is solid and the battery charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> The internal battery holds a charge for a remarkably long time  </li>
            <li> but maybe I let it grow too long for proper use.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enought to speak for the longevity, but would definitely have to recommend it based on the experience I have had.  </li>
            <li> Overall, as long as it works well, he shouldn&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> and I dont have to risk it with the long 2 inch trimmer blades i have used earlier.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product in 2007, and it just broke for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> It catches short hairs, but long hair tends to clog the inlet.</li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t expect it to last as long as lithium</li>
            <li> besides the one charge does last really long.</li>
            <li> Charge doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Was my fault, I put guard on 4, tried and was too long, put on 2 and well... was too short.    </li>
            <li> I think it will last a long time</li>
            <li> The other reviewers complained about close trimming without the full guard</li>
            <li> few hairs do escape the vaccuum, but use the trimmer for a few weeks and then check out the chamber, you would be surprised how much has been caught in.  </li>
            <li> so I am unable to get a nice tight, trim look.</li>
            <li> Enhancements that my old Norelco didn&#x27;t have include the turbo vacuum, which works well at containing the mess and the separate moustache trimmer, which worked well.</li>
            <li> I like the older design with a flip-out small trimmer head for the latter functions.</li>
            <li> And then twice a year you are advised to run down the batteries completely to condition them.</li>
            <li> , it pushes the guide down to level \\&quot;2\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;1\\&quot; which are closer to the blades and lead to considerably shorter hair.  </li>
            <li> There is a plastic part near the blades which moves up and down when pressed against your face, why not just have it stationary?  </li>
            <li> Unless you old it by the setting dial, it&#x27;ll slip down with even the slightest pressure.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps a little big, but not heavy.  </li>
            <li> I wish they had a slide button to push up the thinner blade and would have sacrificed the vacuum for the thinner trimmer as it is used (in my case) for trimming hair that isn&#x27;t long to begin with.  </li>
            <li> Still, the vacuum picked up probably 80% of my long hair with the turbo setting.</li>
            <li> The fact that it doesn&#x27;t vacuum up all the hairs is, in my opinion, minor.</li>
            <li> The vacuum function sucks most of the hairs, so there is less mess around when I am done trimming.</li>
            <li> This contributes to dry, coarse membranes which develop into flat tender sources for infection.</li>
            <li> This contributes to dry, coarse membranes which develop into flat tender sources for infection.</li>
            <li> The unit is apparently not designed for heavy, thick or long beard hair, as it does not trim that well, the vacuum just clogs up and then blades tend to pull rather than cut smoothly.  </li>
            <li> like my bikini area to be well groomed and this does the trick easily and leaves no itchy cut hairs behind afterward like my other trimmer did.  </li>
            <li> which really doesnt make a difference since u still have to waste the same amount of time cleaning up that you would with other non-vacuum trimmers.  </li>
            <li> A built-in vacuum sucks 95% of the wiskers into a small cup that is easily emptied.</li>
            <li> I had purchased, about 3 years ago, a version of the same trimmer and the battery eventually stopped holding a charge for very long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;As far as reliability it has lasted longer than my previous Panasonic so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> It makes cleanup a lot less involved than it used to be with my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> previous product had a cord that plugged directly into the socket...</li>
            <li> The swivel adjuster for setting beard length moved when I was using it and suddenly I was cutting off more than I wanted.</li>
            <li> The detail tool is pretty darn small, not very practical for neck line cleanup.    </li>
            <li> no mess over my sink, only a little bit here and there</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but I have no complaints.</li>
            <li> &quot; (how close to trim) is firmer, so there is less chance of it moving on you while you trim (making for a shorter than expected cut at times - a risk with the older one).    </li>
            <li> The vacuum function works really well, hardly any stray clippings on the sink.  </li>
            <li> The charge is lasting longer than I expected it to, but I have only charged it once.     </li>
            <li> One setting for the length, go over it a few times each week in minutes, another setting for a few other areas and usually no clean-up thanks to the vacuum.</li>
            <li> The vacuum chamber fills really fast and if you have black hair you can not distinguish it against the groomer&#x27;s black body color despite what the advertisements claim.</li>
            <li> granted I&#x27;ve only used it a limited number of times.  </li>
            <li> in a week my beard grows fast 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon and the vacuum got at least 95-99% of the hair.  </li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer is all that I had hoped it would be, with a powerful vacuum that leaves hardly any mess in my sink.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Older model of Norelco very plain, simple and still working.</li>
            <li> Not sure who designed the springy gaurd but its clear just from looking at it that none of the hair actually gets close enough to the blades to get cut.    </li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little bulky because of this feature and that when he wants to trim around his mustache or ears he can&#x27;t just pull off the plastic guard like he could with his old Panasonic</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t get every little hair, but there&#x27;s hardly any clean up.  </li>
            <li> Maneuverability right under the nose is difficult resulting in longer whiskers near my nostrils.  </li>
            <li> was that it would be so loose that it would not keep the proper height adjustment</li>
            <li> The only problem is the covering on the hair chamber is quite loose.</li>
            <li> There tends to be some slight creeping of the setting as you use it, although not enough to leave the general setting.  </li>
            <li> - not good enough still I have the mess to clean afterward.</li>
            <li> So, even holding the clippings-door closed, trying to \\&quot;make-do\\&quot; and not have to discard this so soon, is very frustrating because the trimmings don&#x27;t get captured - they stay at the top and spillover</li>
            <li> After due diligence shopping online and local stores I decided to go with my second Norelco beard trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I had previously broken all the others I had tried due to cheap parts rusting or just breaking...</li>
            <li> I like my husband with a little bit of scruff but was tired of the tiny fine hairs that covered the sink after he trimmed.</li>
            <li> In my mind the only two small items that keep it from being a 5-star product are: 1) it does not have a pop-up trimmer like my old model did - you have to take the regular blade off and put on the trimmer blade, but that is the price you pay for having the vacuum feature, and 2) its harder to get up close and trim under my nose -</li>
            <li> But with Turbo on it collects nearly all those little hairs.</li>
            <li> My young son who is fasinated with having a beard loves this little trimmer.</li>
            <li> I disagree with the noise complaints, I thought the vacuum was only slightly louder than the actual trimmer</li>
            <li> With the old Norelco my wife used to complain about little hairs all over the sink.  </li>
            <li> I did buy some cheaper models, but they turned out woefully bad, so much that I dropped the idea of keeping a goatee and just went with clean shaven for a while.  </li>
            <li> The only glitch is the Turbo switch is cleverly located so that one of my fingers or thumb inadvertently turns off the Turbo at least once per trim.</li>
            <li> Whatever extra noise is probably due to the vacuum feature.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature ensures that you can not use this for anything other than basic beard and moustache trim.</li>
            <li> The problems with the new T980 are: the new body is a hard slick plastic which is more difficult to grip (slips out of the hand); the small/fine trimmer is now an attachment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve found that keeping a slow &amp; steady pace, as opposed to trying to race around your face, allows the vacuum to do</li>
            <li> The T980, however, actually captures every single whisker, every single time.  </li>
            <li> no mess and no clean up of hairs required.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very convenient as it sucks up hair into the chamber.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the sales department has downgraded quality by packaging the trimmer with a cheap recharging system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My only complaint, and it&#x27;s not really a complaint, is</li>
            <li> The flip open door to empty the contents is convenient.  </li>
            <li> I have had no difficulty with the \\&quot;grade\\&quot; of shave slipping mid shave</li>
            <li> simply remove the protector and do the last few hairs freehand with the open shaver or a pair of cuticle</li>
            <li> and I can not believe that it took me this long to get a trimmer.</li>
            <li> - so when I was shaving and turned the trimmer on its side, I was not surprised when hairs fell out of the vaccum trap.    </li>
            <li> minor andonly have to do with the vaccum.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s minor; I&#x27;m getting used to #3.</li>
            <li> adjustable length long battery life..</li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a long time.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t owned it long</li>
            <li> The plastic collection door on  front front flips open, but stays hinged and thus gets in the way, when you are trying to empty hair.   </li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;m going to focus on the long-term (minor) issues I&#x27;ve had</li>
            <li> It has a long battery life too -</li>
            <li> It is strange this day and age that products come with 110-120v transformers one vs. 110-240v; esp.</li>
            <li> Charge is lasting a while, although i just got it so not much time to judge.</li>
            <li> The Long:    </li>
            <li> Just as long as you start off with not too long hair.</li>
            <li> The old one stayed plugged up all the time because he didn&#x27;t want it it be dead when he needed to use it.  </li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  </li>
            <li> The battery holds a charge for a long time between uses.  </li>
            <li> &quot; long, for instance, I bet it would work well.  </li>
            <li> Long battery life.  </li>
            <li> Charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> &quot; long while others are closer to 3/8\\</li>
            <li> &quot; long.</li>
            <li> With the bathroom door closed, you can only hear it when close to the door anyway.</li>
            <li> I have a long beard, so I use the #9 setting.  </li>
            <li> (though not nearly as loud as a Wahl 9918C beard trimmer I had to use).</li>
            <li> A minor problem    </li>
            <li> We bought this to replace a 6 year old Norelco trimmer with a dead battery.</li>
            <li> Also, the hair reservoir isn&#x27;t big enough and if you have a moderate or heavy beard, you&#x27;ll find yourself cleaning this trimmer out every time you use it (which is what it recommends in the manual).</li>
            <li> Gave a long life (10 years)</li>
            <li> Battery quit holding a charge a month ago, but that was not unexpected.</li>
            <li> When I go long periods of time between trimming, the long hairs tend to clog up the port that feeds into the hair collector.</li>
            <li> I have been using this since a long time.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s a minor thing.  </li>
            <li> The negatives are minor, but are as follows:     </li>
            <li> Even with that amount of use it holds a charge for a really long time.</li>
            <li> Battery lasts a long time and you can use it plugged in to the wall if you don&#x27;t have time to charge it.</li>
            <li> charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Only minor drawback is if you want to keep a longer beard or goatee, because the settings go approx 1 finger length, not much longer.  </li>
            <li> This is rechargeable trimmer with a long lasting battery (~8 beard trims) but it is not really a travel trimmer.</li>
            <li> I finally decided upon this one and am now just utterly confused with what must be wrong with those who didn&#x27;t give the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo a good review.     </li>
            <li> My biggest peeve is that there is a little blue rectangular spring-loaded vaccum mouthpiece right in front of the blade, which sucks the hair into the vaccum.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine why after all these years Norelco has not come up with a better system for locking down the shave length so that it does not get changed by the mere act of shaving.  </li>
            <li> On the old one, the vacuum was fairly useless because just as much hair ended up in the sink and all over the blade as in the catcher bin.</li>
            <li> no stand/dock (only a neg for people who have no place to hide it)  not a smart charger  </li>
            <li> While the Norelco is certainly not in the same universe as Braun in quality, neither are they in price.</li>
            <li> vacuum intake vent makes it a bit harder to maneuver the trimmer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It catches roughly 90-95% of hair in the vacuum in turbo mode.</li>
            <li> The Plus and Minus factors are:   - The Vacuum works.</li>
            <li> If this clipper lasts as long as the previous one I&#x27;ll probably go back to PN and buy whatever the current version is then too.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco trimmer and the previous one did the same.    </li>
            <li> so when the battery dies on you in the middle of a trim, you are not left with half your face unshaven.    </li>
            <li> After a few uses I quickly realized why some of the negative reviews said the trimmer didn&#x27;t trim.  </li>
            <li> My old Maverick had no recharging option and that was not a very good thing if the batteries dies all of a sudden, but</li>
            <li> My old Norelco had a stiff rotating switch that could never cycle on/off</li>
            <li> than those three annoyances, I can live with the vacuum not catching ALL of the hair (the Remington flung ALL of the hair everywhere).  </li>
            <li> The trimmer is a sleek black color, comes with a carrying case, and in general looks well built.</li>
            <li> I always find that other trimmers were just a bit too long or too short in trim height.  </li>
            <li> Oh it does suck some of the hair into the chamber, but it left just as big a mess of the trimmed hair all over my bathroom counter,</li>
            <li> This is a slight upgrade to my last model which I gave away due to the battery barely holding a charge.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum definitely reduces the mess.</li>
            <li> I really like the vacuum feature and would put it the 90% range for effectiveness when taking your time and not trying to trim your beard when you&#x27;re already twenty minutes late!</li>
            <li> only reason I haven&#x27;t given this 5 stars is because of the area just under the nose, the other reviewers that have mentioned this are correct</li>
            <li> One other thing, where the beard meets my hairline just above the ear, I&#x27;ve found the guard obstructs the view a bit</li>
            <li> + its ahead of all other brands selling there models at this same price range..</li>
            <li> The blades remain sharp, never requiring further sharpening, nor rinsing or oiling.</li>
            <li> I will be getting a different model due to the closeness issue.</li>
            <li> My only complaints (and the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars) are:  1) the pouch is extremely flimsy, 2)</li>
            <li> My only other trimmer was a Norelco adjustable trimmer.</li>
            <li> I went through 3 other trimmers before I finnally went back to the norelco.</li>
            <li> Not only does this eager little trimmer solve several problems at once</li>
            <li> The constant recharging, sweeping up afterward, seemingly endless search for single-tasking components that had wandered off and an assembly/disassembly process for cleaning the tool that would make Bill Gates weep.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand how you can not see what you are shaving due to the blue guard.  </li>
            <li> Is this the same as all other trimmers or are these blades</li>
            <li> Like all, figure , in a few years you&#x27;ll be buying a new one due to wear and tear</li>
            <li> The charge lasts a very long time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be shaving my beard for a very long time to come, and something tells me this shaver ain&#x27;t gonna make it.</li>
            <li> This happens at least once during each shave, usually when shaving the left side of my face (I am right handed).</li>
            <li> The difference this time is that Norelco is hanging me out to dry and is refusing to do anything to repair</li>
            <li> I now stand at the sink, instead of in the (dry) tub with a hand held mirror.</li>
            <li> If you work in an industry where you don&#x27;t have to be clean shaven every day, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this.</li>
            <li> This is due to the vacuum duct.</li>
            <li> The vacuum works extremely well.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s noisy (probably due to vacuum.)    </li>
            <li> having done so, the cat is now afeard of both the trimmer and any other vacuum noises.  </li>
            <li> As some other reviews I read have stated, this trimmer does not trap all the hair with its vacuum.  </li>
            <li> Because of the vacuum, it is noiser than the other trimmer</li>
            <li> It is plastic, so you need to be careful when sliding it back on not to get it jammed or stuck.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t empty it each day, whiskers end up all over the place, including inside the floppy, soft case that has trouble keeping its contents inside.</li>
            <li> trimmers are still made in the USA like Wahl but some of the features in this Norelco I have not found in other trimmers like the vacuum trimmer feature.</li>
            <li> I know all this may come as a surprise to those of you who have had success with previous Norelco trimmers, but the fact is that this thing is a serious piece of Sh_t.  </li>
            <li> The suction action on the old went out after 3 years of use but that may have had to do with a broken guard (</li>
            <li> Then the battery finally gave up a few months back.    </li>
            <li> I also wonder if some of the negative reviews are for this particular model (Philips Norelco T980 for $39.99 @</li>
            <li> What is worse is even though I found that I disliked the same things as others I kept it, and only after the 60 day return did I decide I didn&#x27;t really like it enough to use it.  </li>
            <li> Unit shipped with a decent (not great) flip-cover travel case, large enough for the trimmer &amp; charger, and with a small net pouch for the narrow trimming head (which has not been used).</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was not very impressed.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum thing works like a champ, only leaving a few hairs in the sink.  </li>
            <li> I firmly believe my last vacuum trimmer was designed by a consortium of housekeepers seeking job security.  </li>
            <li> When the hair&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s harder for the vacuum to pull it in.  </li>
            <li> the vacuum feature is still not really what i expected it to be.</li>
            <li> Noise level is unusually high, but that&#x27;s least of my concerns.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think it will last as long as my last trimmer, which was a Norelco T7500 that I had for at least ten years.</li>
            <li> Therefore, I feel obligated to report I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it yet.    </li>
            <li> The single thing that I miss is the slide up mini trimmer.</li>
            <li> Hair collector works but has limited benefit in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Feels a little plastic-y, not cheap but not as solid as my old unit -</li>
            <li> The clipper is a little loud but nothing out of the ordinary for a clipper in general.  </li>
            <li> I researched several alternatives but came back to the PN due to price and my experience with the previous version.  </li>
            <li> Other than those three annoyances, I can live with the vacuum not catching ALL of the hair (the Remington flung ALL of the hair everywhere).  </li>
            <li> Points:  Vacuum not strong enough to suck up all clippings...</li>
            <li> Norelco / Philips trimmers are definitely the way to go, but don&#x27;t shell out the extra money for the shoddily designed extra features.</li>
            <li> The Norelco T-980 price was not much more than the cost of replacing the battery in my 10-year old Norelco Maverick T-3000</li>
            <li> I used to go out back to trim my beard (real drag when it rains) and let it fall in to the lawn</li>
            <li> Even a long drag</li>
            <li> Even with the vacuum, expect a little clean-up at the end, but not nearly as much as there would be without the vacuum.  </li>
            <li> Hair guard came loose almost immediately.  </li>
            <li> , however loosely that term is applied.</li>
            <li> Well with this new one I pushed so hard that the trimmer length setting was reduced.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all too easy to put the comb on wrong which is typical of the Norelco beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> The distance from the comb interface to the blade - the part that goes up and down and stays at the same distance from the blade - is 1/8 inch longer than on the G390.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t actually had the battery run down yet --</li>
            <li> This trimmer only goes down to what represents 7-8 days growth for me.  </li>
            <li> on switch is just a big button you press down on and not a switch.</li>
            <li> Until then, save your money and use a regular shaver with replaceable trimming attachments and put down a paper towel to catch the hair.</li>
            <li> On a couple of occasions I&#x27;ve forgotten that I set it really low, and have already shaved off an eyebrow and one side of my mustache, and ran a bald furrow down my beard on the side of my cheek.</li>
            <li> And the carrying case is big enough to carry the razor, the attachments, and the charger with a little room to spare!    </li>
            <li> I had the previous (vacuum but non-turbo) version of this trimmer and after only a year, the battery life decreased to about 5 minutes (even though I don&#x27;t keep it in the charger, let it discharge almost completely - all the proper care and feeding of a NiCad battery...).</li>
            <li> One shortcoming is that this likely would not work well for long thick beards as the longest setting does not seem that long to me, but I&#x27;m just speculating since I keep my beard short</li>
            <li> The vacuum keeps me from cleaning the sink of hair so it doesn&#x27;t go down the drain.  </li>
            <li> never thought of getting one with a vaccuum on it...seemed simple enough just to wash the mess down the sink..and off the sink..and shake out my shirt</li>
            <li> The variable height cutting guard works well and the battery easily lasts a month on a charge for me.</li>
            <li> Another issue was that it was relatively easy to move the height adjustment by accident when taking off and replacing the plastic trimmer guard, which you need to do in order to switch cutting heads.</li>
            <li> With some success, I use a lower trim level, but generally, I need to do dangerous manual cleanup with the edger attachment.    </li>
            <li> The only downside, and a small one at that, was the learning curve for figuring out how to take off and replace the different heads</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s less work even though I have to reach for a second gadget.  </li>
            <li> i had the previous model and it actually shaved closer.</li>
            <li> Unlike the previous model this comes with a compact case where the charger (smaller and lighter than before and now rated 110- 240V) and attachment can be kept.</li>
            <li> I only have a few minor complaints:    </li>
            <li> My previous trimmer was a Norelco T7500 which I have used for the last 7 or 8 years.  </li>
            <li> and i&#x27;ve had a half dozen or so of various brands -</li>
            <li> It took me less than 20 minutes to read the instructions and trim my entire beard.  </li>
            <li> I had a previous Norelco model for about 4 years and finally it just stopped holding a charge</li>
            <li> for my beard, the previous product set on #2 was too close and on the turbo trimmer, the setting is not close enough (</li>
            <li> so I only charge it every month or even less.  </li>
            <li> I can do this if I use my index fingernail to carefully hold down the blue piece.  </li>
            <li> Because of the vacuum attachment you can&#x27;t do that with this trimmer, you need to remove the comb, and then replace the trimmer head with a smaller trimmer attachment that sticks up past the vaccuum catch.  </li>
            <li> It came completely dead with no power at all, after like 20 minutes it ran at full power for about 30 min and didn&#x27;t even start to slow down!  </li>
            <li> Loud, high pitched motor (particularly annoying in turbo mode), weak motor if used in standard mode, too easy to accidentally hit the on switch, guard is difficult to put on (doesn&#x27;t allign easily), cheap plastic cover for hair collector broke after just a few uses.    </li>
            <li> Although I&#x27;ve enjoyed Norelco products in the past, this one has been a disappointment and will be on its way back to Amazon tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I was simply looking for a trimmer for my sideburns that wouldn&#x27;t create a mess all over the sink.</li>
            <li> slight improvement is the vacuum chamber, which catches about 85% of the clippings.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum does not capture everything, and only makes less of a mess.</li>
            <li> For example, they have upgraded the vacuum and container so now even less hair falls out on the sink.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer a year and a half ago, so I now have some experience using it.  </li>
            <li> Previous norelco vacuum trimmers did not either,</li>
            <li> high end rechargeable items nowadays can be left in the recharging base constantly, always ready for use.</li>
            <li> TRimmer a little large for hard to reach areas.</li>
            <li> Also, the vacuum functionality doesn&#x27;t work quite as well with the mini-trimmer, so there will be some mess.    </li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband hoping to avoid those \\&quot;little tiny hairs\\&quot; that end up all over.  </li>
            <li> And it was only a little. 2.</li>
            <li> and there&#x27;s little residue hairs that are left on my bathroom counter,</li>
            <li> Using the trimmer without the guide though to try to shape the sides of my beard was a little bit of a hassle, though I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer once, so maybe with some experimentation it will get easier.  </li>
            <li> There is still a little bit of hair that gets to the counter, but maybe 1/100th of the total amount trimmed.</li>
            <li> Lastly, though it has little plastic nubs so it doesnt roll, I wish it came with a stand or holder.</li>
            <li> This little bit of extra work probably took me under 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> 5 also proved a little short for me.  </li>
            <li> I was not really excited about purchasing another model with this same design</li>
            <li> I can imagine situations where with a death grip on the adjustment ring and extreme down pressure on the cutting head, one might be able to duplicate the problem during a direction change.</li>
            <li> After using it I can&#x27;t imagine using anything that does not clean up after itself (vacuum that is)  </li>
            <li> The vacuum feature, which I was actually pretty skeptical about, works extremely well: there are only a few clippings that fall to the sink or countertop requiring cleanup after trimming.  </li>
            <li> So far, this setting has not slipped to a lower setting, but I have been careful to avoid pressing the trimmer hard against my face.  </li>
            <li> This time I did a little research and got the Phillips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.</li>
            <li> However, the vacuum clogs sometimes and that is problematic, but with a little care it is workable.</li>
            <li> The vacuum doesn&#x27;t get every little stray hair</li>
            <li> Though its not perfect, and for sure hairs do fell off but again way less messy than other trimmers.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not much hair, but the little vacuum can&#x27;t solve everything.    </li>
            <li> When it does cut, on the really short setting, the vacuum does actually work, but theres a plastic thing that gets in the way and makes it tough to shave with any accuracy.    </li>
            <li> Not too bad but could be better.  </li>
            <li> I have a sneaky suspicion that many of the bad reviews are from people who complain about anything when given the opportunity.</li>
            <li> this trimmer is a huge step up with cutting and the vaccum.</li>
            <li> in batteries, or at least design a by-pass circuit so that the unit can be powered directly from an outlet.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have to mess with different heads or other attachments which you will probably lose over time anyhow.</li>
            <li> The device is completely useless at trimming my beard, and only works on the lowest setting (which is a really close trim).  </li>
            <li> ...until this morning, when it shifted silently from a 5 (Late Winter Academic Beard) to 3 (Peach Fuzz) in mid-shave.</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble keeping by beard as short as I like and this trimmer solved that problem.  </li>
            <li> I used to put off shaving my head, but it is so simple now that I do it every few days.  </li>
            <li> I sometimes have to empty it twice in one setting.  </li>
            <li> There is a plastic door that opens to readily empty the vacuumed clippings.     </li>
            <li> it keeps slipping out of my hand and breaking.</li>
            <li> Also, it does not have numbered markings on the length settings, making it harder to reset the device to my preference if it gets out of adjustment.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different options for trying to trim up my beard.  </li>
            <li> He has only used it a few times but he likes it now.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace the one that I had purchased a few years back.</li>
            <li> but PLEASE read this review and know that you WILL have problems with it slipping trim guards</li>
            <li> but if you empty it out, you will have no problem with all those hairs getting sucked into the machine.</li>
            <li> He had worn out a trimmer of another brand which had done a minimally acceptable job on his beard and mustache.  </li>
            <li> I have no problems with the guard slipping to shorter lengths.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;i bought it a few months ago and now and just going to buy a regular one.</li>
            <li> you will have to partially charge and then finish your trim.  </li>
            <li> I find no real problem with mine.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt matter as there really is no need.</li>
            <li> I try to be careful as to not cause damage.     </li>
            <li> Cons: Big and bulky, gimmicky \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in facial hair, but often try to avoid that shaggy look.  </li>
            <li> I have to remove the gate and carefully trim the hairs using the height of the surrounding hairs that the trimmer did get as a guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other</li>
            <li> so you have to hold the unit over the garbage can to empty</li>
            <li> and it is a drag as I blow out remaining hair instead of using the supplied brush</li>
            <li> (some hair ends up in the sink, but not much.)</li>
            <li> When he uses it in the bathroom I can hear it through the closed door.</li>
            <li> This is not the beard trimmer to use if you are wanting to maintain the rough look.</li>
            <li> Some hairs endup in the sink, but I expected this.  </li>
            <li> From these reviews, it seems like only a few of the T980s have this problem; still, you might want to try the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> Only thing missing is a recharger/storage stand.  </li>
            <li> If you empty it every day, it falls apart.</li>
            <li> The spring-loaded dial adjuster with \\&quot;digital\\&quot; read-out doesn&#x27;t hold its settings as you press harder to get an even cut...</li>
            <li> - This one has a door with a hinge to empty the hairs.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say about 90% of the hair is trapped in the canister, about 3% on the sink, and about 7% left in my beard.</li>
            <li> /&gt;There&#x27;s a wide range of length settings.</li>
            <li> Beard trimming takes longer than I had expected.  </li>
            <li> The instructions say that you should charge it only when dead, and charge it fully.</li>
            <li> All this means is I have to empty it every time before stowing it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d spend the few extra bucks and pick up the norelco.</li>
            <li> so not really an issue.</li>
            <li> it comes to life with the expected amount of noise and vibration.  </li>
            <li> Everything moves faster, unnecessary in my view, and it is very noisy.</li>
            <li> Spend a few extra bucks and get the Norelco.</li>
            <li> Just empty the chamber the hair is caught in</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why my husband has so much trouble trimming and maintaining his facial hair!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve had no difficulties with the guard slipping to a lower setting as others have reported.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The swing-out door to empty</li>
            <li> This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem were it not for the \\&quot;Lockable\\&quot; length settings which it turns out is not very lockable.</li>
            <li> They will change if you push it to the point where you think you would break it if you pushed any harder.  </li>
            <li> It just seems like something that will break at some point and adds no real functionality.    </li>
            <li> this blade when used without the trimmer ,is rough crappy metal that snags and pinches your skin and pulls your hair, to the extent of blood..</li>
            <li> but you could always empty it while clipping in the garbage and continue clipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was unable to find replacement parts online, and I must say I was relieved to be forced to replace this unit with a better designed model.</li>
            <li> Still drops a few trimmings on regular mode but not much.</li>
            <li> It would have been nice if it had come with a charging base rather that</li>
            <li> Kind of annoying.</li>
            <li> The trimmer also has two clipper heads, one for tight trimming, and the other for overall work.  </li>
            <li> And the vacuum feature cuts down on cleanup!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the vacuum feature, but it actually works quite well, capturing nearly all of the clippings.  </li>
            <li> Remember to trim it before you get in the shower because when the hair is wet the vacuum still has trouble collecting the hairs, even on Turbo.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that the vacuum, even on turbo, still doesn&#x27;t catch all of the trimmings.  </li>
            <li> i got this, it&#x27;s huge, not a great shave, hard to get sharp lines around the sideburns or neck line.  </li>
            <li> Also the trimmings jam in the narrow vacuum slot.</li>
            <li> it is a little larger then other trimmers</li>
            <li> Closest setting is really short, like a stubble slightly longer than average 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
            <li> Overall, not a bad trimmer if you don&#x27;t expect the impossible of it...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not anything that&#x27;s a detraction from the shave.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not all that.</li>
            <li> This suffering will take down its operating ability and cause the charge to last less each time you use it.    </li>
            <li> and I was just plain curious about the vacuum part.</li>
            <li> If it lasts half as long as my Remington</li>
            <li> removal of trimming heads is not easy enough...</li>
            <li> Second, the shaping parts around the cutting head are all plastic, so this device wouldn&#x27;t last long in a professional environment (where it might get dropped).    </li>
            <li> The 30% increase in vacuum power it provides helps out in situations where you have to hold the T980 in contorted, odd positions  to get the job done (i.e. upside down), and you don&#x27;t want hair that&#x27;s being cut coming out of the device.    </li>
            <li> Two options: shave my entire beard to a 3, which is inappropriate for my face type, or look deranged because half of my face is at 5 and half is at 3.    </li>
            <li> It does leave a few trimmings on the sink but those are few enough to simply rinse down the drain with no worries.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature really does work pretty well-doesn&#x27;t pick up every clipped whisker, but I would guess it sucks up about 90%, which ain&#x27;t bad.  </li>
            <li> It also silently switches from trim number 3 - 2 if you press down hard enough.</li>
            <li> It cuts evenly, has a long battery life, prevents a mess, and is sturdy.</li>
            <li> Less mess, lighter device, overall this is an acceptable upgrade.</li>
            <li> It does leave some hairs in the sink still, but just a bit and little enough to wash down the sink.    </li>
            <li> Actually, if you press down a little, you can get closer.    </li>
            <li> When he first used it, he trimmed over the trashcan, and he was shocked to see that the vacuum actually caught all of the hair!</li>
            <li> Either Norelco has fixed this or the reviewers with that problem like to press down really hard while trimming.    </li>
            <li> I was used pushing down hard to get an even trim with my old one.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum makes trimming so much less of a mess.  </li>
            <li> Edit: after several use, I saw that actually this is not a good product at all.</li>
            <li> One minor issue was the cut level, it isn&#x27;t the easiest to read through that little window.  </li>
            <li> There is a retractable shield in front of the blade that is designed to facillitate trimmed hair going down into the curved waste basket of the vacuum instead of falling in the sink.  </li>
            <li> To suck the hair completely one has to hold it straight, which is impossible while you trim.</li>
            <li> The hair length selector is firm to adjust but the guide comb wiggles slightly front to back when raised.</li>
            <li> a little annoying, but way better than the ones without vacuum capability</li>
            <li> This one sounded like the right choice plus it had the bonus vacuum feature, but some of the negative reviews about sudden cutting length changes almost made me pass it by.</li>
            <li> When the chamber is full cutting ability drops dramatically.</li>
            <li> Tried other trimmers that just couldn&#x27;t maintain their settings.  </li>
            <li> The other 1/4 will be all over your sink and need to be cleaned up.  </li>
            <li> Lots of power and stays sharp.  </li>
            <li> I have no experience with any other brand to compare.  </li>
            <li> There needs to be some sort of setting lock that prevents it from just slipping and ruining your beard!  </li>
            <li> Charge lasted for &gt; 1 month of trimming every other day.  </li>
            <li> I agree with other reviewers:</li>
            <li> I wish this was designed so that the mini-trimmer attachment was on the other side of the head, so that there are no attachments at all.</li>
            <li> all d other trimmer from other companies get problematic soon...</li>
            <li> Noting some of the issues in other reviews, I would have to add:    </li>
            <li> I tried to use this device for other parts of the body and it works.</li>
            <li> I do not have an experience with other trimmers and cannot compare it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been multiple Norelco trimmers over the past 7 years.</li>
            <li> I agree with all the other reviews</li>
            <li> I had never retained facial hair in the past.  </li>
            <li> A pho-hawk is pretty difficult to do, but the 9 length settings helped me to create it.</li>
            <li> I have had to replace each one due to battery life.  </li>
            <li> The other one star reviews are correct, the auto lock mechanism does not work.  </li>
            <li> so in other words, the vaccum doesn&#x27;t work because even if it cleaned 95%</li>
            <li> I have read from other reviewers that the trimmer will switch settings</li>
            <li> This unit works extremely well.  </li>
            <li> I experience none of the problems commented by the other reviewers.  </li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> It can also be taken off for trimming necklines or other areas.</li>
            <li> only negatives are that the hair capture cup is a tad small.</li>
            <li> so you&#x27;ll need to read other reviews</li>
            <li> As a result I was simply not able to get all the way up my mustache to trim it - it simply hit the nose.</li>
            <li> Other angles of approach or even the lowest trim setting didn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> After all the other reviews I read on this</li>
            <li> Sharp both in trimming comfort and apearance.</li>
            <li> I have only a small goatee and med. sideburns</li>
            <li> Literally on any setting past the shortest setting, it won&#x27;t actually trim any hair.    </li>
            <li> Comes with a small touch up blade that is simple to swap out.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why there are two speeds; maybe the lower speed is for different whisker types or for longer lengths.  </li>
            <li> The \\&quot;mowing\\&quot; operation -- getting my beard to an even length -- went extremely well.  </li>
            <li> as all the other trimmers, that don&#x27;t have one.</li>
            <li> The turbo feature helps speed up morning trims, and the vacuum makes the sink area less messy.</li>
            <li> I was expecting from past experiences only 25-40%.  </li>
            <li> but I found two flaws, that seem to concur with other reviewers complaints.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t trim often enough), and the small trimmer isn&#x27;t built in; it requires changing the head of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> (I was worried about this from other reviews), and don&#x27;t see how you could.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure yet, but it seems to catch only the shortest cuttings.      </li>
            <li> Ignore what people said about it jumping to other settings.  </li>
            <li> Aditionally, the price I paid for the item with Amazon.com was around $20.00 cheaper than the other stores and sites I had shopped.</li>
            <li> mentioned in other reviews.  </li>
            <li> Be careful what you wish for!</li>
            <li> A small amount of tiny trimmings does fall in the sink, but turning on Turbo does fix this.</li>
            <li> He wouldn&#x27;t consider anything other than another Norelco.  </li>
            <li> I also had issues with the other trimmers pulling hair out without trimming it but with this one there are no problems...</li>
            <li> I find such design decisions reprehensible from an environmental perspective, and shady from a business perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has</li>
            <li> For the price this beard trimmer works extremely well.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Norelco T908 Turbo based on other customer reviews.</li>
            <li> other than that.   </li>
            <li> I did not feel any pulling or other discomfort.</li>
            <li> Adding insult to injury, the first time I called Norelco for help, the woman rep on the phone -- adding helpfully that she had never used a beard trimmer herself -- gave me the wrong answer.  </li>
            <li> I recommend a different tool for nose and small hair trimmmings.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d always put off shaving my beard due to the necessity of cleaning up afterwards.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who has used several types of clippers in the past, both corded and cordless</li>
            <li> The only other thought I have about it is the clipping trap itself is small if you have a heavy beard or let it grow to long before clipping again</li>
            <li> (my old eyes find the number a little hard to read without glasses).  </li>
            <li> But have to give it a 4-star as it still has some hairs falling down on you or on the sink, I expected this to suck the hairs it cuts all up.  </li>
            <li> I was careful not to hold the trimmer by the click wheel to avoid accidentally going down a setting...</li>
            <li> A few little ones can get by the trap, but it is extremely efficient with proper use.   </li>
            <li> find the guard over the clippers a little awkward to fit</li>
            <li> I like my older razor where the small cutter popped up from the main unit instead of having to change cutting heads.</li>
            <li> The vacuum storage is a touch on the small side.  </li>
            <li> The reservoir that the vacuum goes to is a bit small</li>
            <li> Use this everyday, the only things I can say on the nagative side is that it&#x27;s just a little bulky</li>
            <li> The huge trimmer head makes it impossible to cut evenly under the nose.</li>
            <li> T980 has the same old battery technology, and that is the reason for my mediocre rating.   </li>
            <li> As with all products, I would recommend that you read the instructions on proper use and not just pull out of the box and wonder what is wrong or why it does not perform like your old trimmer.</li>
            <li> It is a slight drag to change heads.</li>
            <li> Unlike my T370, this trimmer lets you know when it&#x27;s fully charged or about to go dead, and even if it does die in the middle of a session from a dead battery, plugging it in finishes the job.  </li>
            <li> Carrying case is so soft it is useless if you travel and want to protect the product, and the second trimming head...</li>
            <li> Got this as a replacement for a 10+ year old Conair beard trimmer that finally was unable to hold a charge anymore.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it a few times so far and haven&#x27;t had the problem others complained about where the setting is changed mid-trim.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few trimmers over the few years, and none had a built in vacuum.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m not thrilled about in the redesign is that they&#x27;ve replaced the pull-out canister that holds the clippings with a small door that swings open and</li>
            <li> Overall it&#x27;s served me well for the past year and a half.  </li>
            <li> I misplaced the guide comb attachment on a trip, and despite the fact that every other Norelco trimmer&#x27;s guide comb is easily purchased online, it is impossible to find the T980&#x27;s guide comb.  </li>
            <li> I will agree with other reviews that it and its carrying case are a little bigger than I had hoped for the sake of portability, but I can get past that.</li>
            <li> I had a simular older model before and the battery went bad, the cost of the replacement battery was half of this new unit.</li>
            <li> Only negative point is \\&quot;not easy to cut long hair\\&quot; ...   </li>
            <li> However, the comb is difficult to re-attach after cleaning and ultimately busted completely after less than 2 months of use.</li>
            <li> Just hold the thing below the dial, and not right on the dial.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not ineffective, but just a little harder to get the hairs close to the nose.</li>
            <li> The only negative I have noted is that the trimmer settings are not real precise.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sometimes hard to get the guard back on on the head, takes some finesse.      </li>
            <li> know what the blue plastic floating shield thing is in front of the cutters, but it makes hard to judge depth when trimming without the adjustable guide on.</li>
            <li> The twisting feature makes it hard to accidentally change mid trim.    </li>
            <li> My box did not come with a cleaning brush which was a surprise and the packing is just incredibly hard to open up.</li>
            <li> The settings window is tiny and it&#x27;s hard to read the number.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other manufactures so called vacuum units and found that not only did they not work they were a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> I realized I might have been pressing too hard and actually pushed the mechanism down inadvertently.</li>
            <li> The mustache/sideburn trimmer is average and does the job.    </li>
            <li> I have found the supposed mustache trimmer not worth the effort to put it on the unit.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about the only negative aspect I can think of.    </li>
            <li> but if anything goes wrong Phillips is very honorable about replacing.</li>
            <li> If I ever have a complaint on this trimmer I will repost or add if possible to this review...</li>
            <li> However, not worth the $40.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the size of the trimmer head.  </li>
            <li> The only thing I can say negative about it is the</li>
            <li> Again, not so much a complaint on the product, just personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> there is NO way for the guard to drop to a lower setting unless you turn the setting dial--i guess all the negative reviews where the setting dropped while in use were on a different model?</li>
            <li> i am really picky and read all the reviews and was a bit skeptical...</li>
            <li> I like to use my trimmer to cut very close and never use the hight adjustment piece, but with the sliding plastic sheet getting in the way it gets difficult to get a close cut.</li>
            <li> The first few times you change them or remove the hair catcher they seem to be difficult to remove.</li>
            <li> At least with the 60 day money back</li>
            <li> I would only buy this if I was cutting facial hair only.</li>
            <li> Hope it will last at least a year.</li>
            <li> So, I&#x27;ll rate it as below average.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the location of the blades when the guide is attached.  </li>
            <li> My husband has an incredibly thick and coarse beard...</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I was tired of leaving hairs all over the place and because I had lost the charger for my old trimmer.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t find the extra few decibels of sound to be as annoying as some have said.</li>
            <li> I have a heavy beard and have to empty the collection chamber often</li>
            <li> As long as you trim relatively slowly and carefully it will pick up about 90% of the hair its clipping.</li>
            <li> I use a cheaper Norelco to even up corners and other tight spaces.  </li>
            <li> The noise in my opinion is to be expected given the cutting and vacuum action being performed.  </li>
            <li> Too bad, as the vacuum function worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> vacuum sucks hairs well.</li>
            <li> The vacuum function sucks up about 75% of the clippings</li>
            <li> Also the blade has a &#x27;shield&#x27; that aids in sucking the cut hair down into the collection chamber.</li>
            <li> The nine-position trimming guard allows you to work down to the length you want and prevents accidental mess-ups.  </li>
            <li> The Philips literature says the lowest (#1) setting trims your beard down to stubble</li>
            <li> On those mornings when the batteries run down you will plug in the cord and therefore be using AC.</li>
            <li> Played around with the trimming guard by pushing on it and moving it up and down</li>
            <li> In fact, I pressed down on the head of the unit to see if I could get it to change length settings, but it didn&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize what was happening until it was all the way down to \\&quot;1\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> If you have this issue, you are either pushing down _way</li>
            <li> My T900 has it attached to the trimmer, and it can be popped up or down when needed.</li>
            <li> So, one spot on my beard is now down to a stubble.  </li>
            <li> So if you are on the 2 setting and you apply pressure on the face, it jumps down to 1.</li>
            <li> I tried putting it on length \\&quot;3\\&quot;, but when I started to trim, it went down to length \\&quot;2\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Then I started on length 2 and it went down to length 1.  </li>
            <li> am not putting the T370&#x27;s abilities down in any way.  </li>
            <li> i knocked it down realllll close</li>
            <li> and I have not been let down with my purchase of this one.  </li>
            <li> I have to go all the way down to the lowest setting and</li>
            <li> Come on, I mean simply let everything fall in the sink, scoop and flush.</li>
            <li> so sharp that if I stroke my beard they penetrate my skin like splinters and I have to dig them out of my fingers with tweezers agh!  </li>
            <li> it is hard to reach that little moustache area directly under the nostrils, but that is usually the case for trimmers and razor blades.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t gave it 5 stars because the order of stupid buttons is confusing, the turbo is like extra and actually should be the normal mode (it&#x27;s a still a product of corporate mentality) and</li>
            <li> Although there were some negative reviews about the trimmer not functioning properly or leaving a mess unless you start the turbo mode</li>
            <li> My only real complaint is that the unit I received has a flaw in the clear plastic window that covers the \\&quot;length\\&quot; number making it hard to see the number.   </li>
            <li> I read a few articles from other users saying they had hair all over the place when they used it.</li>
            <li> Be careful the first few times, it does not seem to be doing anything because no hairs are flying around, but rest assured it is cutting.</li>
            <li> Very sharp blades.</li>
            <li> It is difficult to get it back in place without breaking it but as long as you are careful it will not be a problem.</li>
            <li> My only beef is the filter cup that hold the cut hair is a little clumsy to work with.  </li>
            <li> Usually I have very little hair left on the sink after I shave.</li>
            <li> Many people complained about the noise, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad.    </li>
            <li> Have used a half dozen times without need for recharging.</li>
            <li> Not a disaster but slightly annoying.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I  bought it to replace a previous Norelco trimmer that I had for years.  </li>
            <li> Not any louder than my previous trimmer, even on \\&quot;turbo\\&quot;, which I always have on.  </li>
            <li> It caught maybe half the hair on turbo, so whoopie.    </li>
            <li> It catches over half of the hairs, may closer to three-quarters.</li>
            <li> The cleaning is not very easy, probably because of the brush.</li>
            <li> Norelco is also bulkier and less ergonomic than the Braun, but I guess that&#x27;s the price of having the vac feature.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer (Silver)]] which was almost half the price of the Phillips Norelco unit</li>
            <li> However, having to change the mustache and beard blades manually is much less convenient than the pop-up mustache trimmer on the T990. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> I also got it in less than 2 days after I purchased.</li>
            <li> The previous version never said it could be</li>
            <li> For a device like this where you can&#x27;t swap the battery yourself and you can&#x27;t leave the job half done</li>
            <li> I had previously a BabyLiss product that lasted 3 years</li>
            <li> Less than $25 fits in the price  </li>
            <li> Owned a previous model that worked</li>
            <li> I tested it over and over, and slight pressure resets the length mechanism.   </li>
            <li> Previously had a [...] that was powered by 3 AAA batteries.  </li>
            <li> I ordered this trimmer online and in less then a week I had the product delivered.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it a year and a half and the whisker tray already broke.</li>
            <li> Perhaps the manufacturing has changed slightly?</li>
            <li> and then when I went without it I got the 5 o&#x27;clock look when I set it on a 3 which is odd.  </li>
            <li> I then went to target and for 25 dollars (10 less)</li>
            <li> That means a lot less cleaning up to do.    </li>
            <li> The only thing that&#x27;s difficult about that is you have to keep using it until the battery runs out, which makes having the corded/cordless feature necessary.</li>
            <li> I assumed I&#x27;d be sweeping half my body hair off the floor</li>
            <li> I have owned two previous \\&quot;accu-vac\\&quot; models.  </li>
            <li> And it really tries my patience having to be so careful not to beak one of those delicate, sliding, plastic prongs or the vacuum-compartment cover.</li>
            <li> the pies for adjusting the height of the trim is black and you can&#x27;t see were the blade</li>
            <li> Amazon price was significantly less than retail (25%).  </li>
            <li> because why would you ever want less power?  </li>
            <li> in LESS than 3-5 yrs this is just trash.  </li>
            <li> The rotating zoom on this sometimes moves slightly out of place which changes the length of the trim slightly</li>
            <li> The non-turbo setting is less noisy...    </li>
            <li> Previously, I&#x27;ve owned two Panasonic trimmers/clippers.  </li>
            <li> When the second failed similarly, I purchased the Norelco.  </li>
            <li> The only issue I had with my old one and this model which I just purchased is the \\&quot;door\\&quot; in the front just under the cutting blades.    </li>
            <li> The last Norelco trimmer, the battery life become so short, so quickly that it would not even let me finish trimming my beard on one charge, which is quite pathetic.    </li>
            <li> With the older model you merely slid the trimmer forward.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the vacuum only captures maybe half the trimmings.  </li>
            <li> At any rate, the T980 is the current state-of-the-art in vacuum beard trimmers, and I recommend it, the packaging notwithstanding.e woman rep on the phone -- adding helpfully that she had never used a beard trimmer herself -- gave me the wrong answer.  </li>
            <li> but it reduces the clippings in the bottom of the sick by about 85% which means less clean up.  </li>
            <li> With this unit, you don&#x27;t have the mess.  </li>
            <li> so don&#x27;t think that you will have zero mess.</li>
            <li> I still found a mess in the sink after using it on my beard, irregardless of what they advertise.  </li>
            <li> and ultimately I was hoping the people having troubles were just incompetent.     </li>
            <li> - i like not making a mess of shizz.</li>
            <li> Did find the depth control a bit awkward at first but gets easier</li>
            <li> trimmed beard and mustache hair instead of letting it fall into your sink to make a mess.</li>
            <li> so if your looking to buy a trimmer that spares you the mess and saves time, this ain&#x27;t the one.</li>
            <li> I bought this because my wife complained that my beard was too long and shaggy.</li>
            <li> Beats the mess that I used to make all over the counter.</li>
            <li> I can trim my beard without mess.     </li>
            <li> Small minus.   </li>
            <li> Small     minus.   - Trimmer.</li>
            <li> its vaccum feature does help a bit to reduce the mess</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a long time, at least a year, and it works well trimming my goatee.  </li>
            <li> But it made a mess of the bathroom counter and sink even when I spread newspaper to catch the clippings.</li>
            <li> As long as you go slowly</li>
            <li> There is a flashing light on the charger that can get annoying in a completely dark room unless you turn the shaver upside down while shaving.    </li>
            <li> It needs no special oils for lubricating.  </li>
            <li> But you learn to hold it tight so it won&#x27;t change while trimming.  </li>
            <li> These problems have occurred over a 5 year span though, so that&#x27;s pretty typical for plastic American crap?</li>
            <li> even that complaint is really a very minor one.</li>
            <li> I have been using a generic Wahl trimmer for the past two and a half years, and have always complained about it because it would always leave my beard completely uneven around the jawline and by my sideburns.</li>
            <li> Naturally, a few veer off at odd angles.  </li>
            <li> - he was a character on The TV show Gunsmoke that never had a beard but also was never clean shaven -</li>
            <li> Long title, but descriptive enough to avoid purchasing the wrong product.</li>
            <li> On the Philips, pulling the gate off and swapping the basic trimmer for the mini trimmer is pretty annoying.  </li>
            <li> The vaccume does help pull your beard from your face which results in an even trim but if you are looking for a trimmer that requires no clean up afterwards this is not it.</li>
            <li> Quite true, you can dial into their computer and navigate circles around their voicemail system for a few hours until your anger dissipates.  </li>
            <li> the vacuum feature is pretty worthless.</li>
            <li> The construction seems a little flimsy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s probably just a thing of practice and the length of my beard, but I figured I&#x27;d let everyone know where I find myself taking a little bit of time when shaving.    </li>
            <li> There is a little netted pouch inside the case that stuff gets caught in too.  </li>
            <li> Took a little looking to find the rotating ring that sets the height (or depth) of the hair</li>
            <li> and I can do my head without any little prickles getting under my shirt and making the rest of the day torture.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried about purchasing it however because I read some users were having problems with the trimming guard moving position.</li>
            <li> There is also a plastic piece that guides hair into the cup that makes neck and cheek-line trimming a little tricky until you get the hang of</li>
            <li> I find it a little bit noisy in turbo mode.  </li>
            <li> I went to pull out the little plastic trimmings compartment and the front of the compartment pulled off, leaving the rest inside the unit.</li>
            <li> The cat mistakes my face and starts nuzzling a little too enthusiastically.      </li>
            <li> Yes, trimming with a mini-vacuum is a little louder than without.  </li>
            <li> I wanted to use it a little before posting a review.</li>
            <li> Otherwise, you will get little hairs all over your shirt during the day.</li>
            <li> I was a little dubious when I bought this.</li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a little noisy, and ,</li>
            <li> However, I kept the cheapie because it cuts a little bit closer without a guard than this one does.</li>
            <li> I use a little bit of force to try to change and it did not budge.    </li>
            <li> Little to no clean-up.  </li>
            <li> but, just a little bit on the heavier side.</li>
            <li> It makes it a little akward to do a mustache</li>
            <li> This puts my finger quite close to the blade and makes me a little nervous that I&#x27;m going to slice through my finger.    </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d prefer to live with a few hair clippings than put up with a mediocre, albeit flashier, trimmer.</li>
            <li> the shaver will suck in at least 85% of the loose hair it cuts.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect even on turbo but catches nearly 90% of what previously was 100% of hair on my sink.</li>
            <li> I can take the comb off and cut the stubble down to about one day&#x27;s length and then let it grow back a few days, but I&#x27;m getting really tired of doing that.  </li>
            <li> I read the reviews here and was prepared for a somewhat weak vacuum- even on turbo.  </li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s not overly large which would make for awkward use.    </li>
            <li> It was a tough choice between the lesser model and the one with the vacuum/turbo.      </li>
            <li> Since I wrote my review, the little cup that holds the cut hairs has broken open twice.  </li>
            <li> although I know \\&quot;change\\&quot; can be tough after using something for several years, there are a few things I just can&#x27;t get past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I bought another make to replace the broken one and didn&#x27;t like it at all, it wouldn&#x27;t get close enough to trim my beard to the length I want.  </li>
            <li> Let me start off with I am not what you would call a heavy user.  </li>
            <li> It also has a few counterintuitive add ons that make it seem like you&#x27;re putting together a jalopy just to shave.</li>
            <li> Tired of my wife busting balls on a daily basis, I needed something to take care of the whiskers.  </li>
            <li> The plastic hair chamber fell apart after just a few months.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed when I found out that this shaver WILL NOT cut short hair, it has to be at least 1/4 inch or so before the blades can pick it up.</li>
            <li> It trims beard and mustach well and is free of any defects or annoying inconveniences.</li>
            <li> Plus, once I used it a few weeks, it loosened up and now \\&quot;clicks\\</li>
            <li> The zoom dial adjusts by itself even with the slightest pressure while trimming giving an uneven cut and closer trim than was desired.</li>
            <li> While using the device a few times the length setting moved to a lower setting unintentionally.     </li>
            <li> I have to go over an area a few times to remove all the hair no matter which mode I&#x27;m using.  </li>
            <li> it cuts well, but is a messy process to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> There are still a few hairs that don&#x27;t get sucked up</li>
            <li> just means i need to trim everyday instead of skipping days.</li>
            <li> Where it counts, this fails completely.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another Norelco beard trimmer with a dead battery.  </li>
            <li> The charger unit is so bulky and heavy that it will not hang on the wall socket.  </li>
            <li> There should be a price protection for few days for consumer confidence.</li>
            <li> few uses ago</li>
            <li> Otherwise it has worked well for the few weeks</li>
            <li> Needless to say he had to shave completely.</li>
            <li> If I don&#x27;t firmly grip the length setting wheel it will jump from, say, a 5 to a 3 -- as it did this morning -- embarrassing me either by giving me a patchy trim or by forcing me to shorten my beard length.    </li>
            <li> I am a guy who never likes to shave, I maintain the \\&quot;few days of stubble\\&quot; look throughout the week, and dread the day when I have to go through the hassle of lathering up &amp; shaving.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t shave everyday, so</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s last leg (thin plastic holds in the \\&quot;springs\\&quot; and</li>
            <li> Only time will tell if Norelco stands behind their product (and their promises).    </li>
            <li> Hopefully, there will be no missed trims because the bats are dead.    </li>
            <li> If it&#x27;s dead and I need to clip now, all I have to do is plug it in while I trim.    </li>
            <li> The weight and feel are comparable, not bulky or heavy.  </li>
            <li> After years of trimming by beard over the waste basket, I now have a product that eliminates 99.9% of the hairs flying off the trimmer blades.  </li>
            <li> This is a replacement for me for a T990 Norelco trimmer, with a dead battery.  </li>
            <li> I now have to disassemble that trimmer to get at and remove the dead battery for recycling.  </li>
            <li> When the battery is dead, the trimmer is done for.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not even a year later, and it has broken already.  </li>
            <li> But ask those people who rave on and on about this unit how well their trimmer is working after a few months use and</li>
            <li> The suction power substantially decreases after a few months of use it and it drops clumps of hair every where.</li>
            <li> The adjustable blade guard works well, but it leaves an uneven cut.  </li>
            <li> Few notes...</li>
            <li> I have zero trouble.  </li>
            <li> I bought this a few years ago</li>
            <li> It is still a messy procedure,</li>
            <li> Unfortunately with ni-cad batteries you cannot use the unit even with direct power from the charger unit after the battery is dead.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the AccuControl System with flexing guide comb.</li>
            <li> What I mean is, when you&#x27;re trimming with it, and press to hard, the settings will actually change.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several trimmers and a couple that claimed a vacuum ablility, most failed miserably.</li>
            <li> trimmer setting can change while in use if you push the trimmer too hard against your face...trimmer settings different than previous norelco trimmer (not a good difference)...</li>
            <li> the only reason i got this trimmer was because of its vacuum function and its disappointing.   </li>
            <li> Vacuum seems to work well enough, but the trimmer itself is awkward to use.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;finally, even if you want to use it for close shave without the comb, you can&#x27;t because of the stupid vacuum where the lid gets hair stuck in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the vaccum is the biggest problem, so if you want a norelco trimmer, dont get the vacuum one, because it will simply render the trimmer useless.s your beard, or body 4 times without cleaning it.  </li>
            <li> I like the concept of this trimmer with the vacuum and all, but I&#x27;m really annoyed that the people who make these things won&#x27;t tell you what lengths the comb settings will trim to.  </li>
            <li> When I refused to do the survey to register and complained through the  webmaster contact I then get an answer back from Phillips wanting me to waste my time calling an 800 number for Norelco - we all know how those calls go!!   </li>
            <li> With that said, the introduction of the vacuum and \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode seem really unnecessary.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s much less messy to use this trimmer than those I used in the past.  </li>
            <li> and it stood upright, taking up less space on my small sink.</li>
            <li> All my previous Norelcos had the small trimmer built in.</li>
            <li> I replaced it wth this model and it works as well as the previous version if not better.  </li>
            <li> but there was always a small mess in the sink.</li>
            <li> Ever though this unit is slightly bigger than my last one (T990)it is not more awkward in my hands.</li>
            <li> , this has been my main disappointment with this product.  </li>
            <li> very odd.</li>
            <li> no more little hairs all over my daughter after daddy kisses and snuggles her.</li>
            <li> The reservoir is a little small</li>
            <li> This attachement works well, but it is a little on the small side</li>
            <li> Most products on the market today are slapdash clumps of flimsy plastics and mechanics that are carefully designed to fail at the worst possible time.  </li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about buying an expensive trimmer, and wondered if a less expensive one would do the job of just keeping the goatee that I wanted to just the right length - just a stubble length.  </li>
            <li> and I hope the first one was just a bad luck ...</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature seems about useless; it seems to pick up about half the hair, but the rest falls to the sink below.</li>
            <li> The hair waste container is small</li>
            <li> It did not magically switch levels causing my beard to be cut unevenly.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;There is at least one caveat, which other reviewers mentioned:  For detailed, close trimming, you&#x27;re cutting blind with this razor.  </li>
            <li> After going through at least a dozen trimmers over the past 4-5 years I came across this one and had to try it due to the price...</li>
            <li> Unless you must have the vacuum and one-hour charge time, buy the less expensive T765.</li>
            <li> I have not experienced any of the \\&quot;down shifting\\&quot; on the trim height dial due to pressure, as reported by others.  </li>
            <li> A few times, it accidentally turned on and started buzzing in my suitcase and caused a few stares, and even a few chuckles, if you know what I mean.</li>
            <li> however this little bad boy has a tendency to change its clipper size mid-trim with a gentle nudge against the face.</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned after reading a few of the negative reviews.  </li>
            <li> Find it difficult to read the \\&quot;zoom\\&quot; - that is, cutting depth - setting from certain angles / lighting conditions, but this is not a major problem.  </li>
            <li> The vacuum must be emptied by using thumb pleasure to disengage one side of a rather flimsy, curved compartment cover that swings open on a hinge that looks so weak that I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s just a matter of time before I accidentally break either the hinge or snap the cover in half.</li>
            <li> The good the bad and the ugly.</li>
            <li> If you only have a goatee or similar, it may not be quite as bad.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;sheet were of little help!)</li>
            <li> Whenever I purchase an item from Amazon, I check the reviews, usually the bad ones first to decide if the reviewers are being hyper-critical which we tend to be in this spoiled, lazy society.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little hard to take the guard on and off to trim the neckline.  </li>
            <li> Remington MB-300/200 has a close to skin trimmer blade that pops up for cutting sharp edges on the breed/facial hair styles; and I have been look everywhere to find a similar blade trimmer.</li>
            <li> The door that holds the trimmed hair is a little delicate in my opinion</li>
            <li> The guard is a little delicate and needs to be handled with care.  </li>
            <li> Very little cleanup.    </li>
            <li> Although, some hairs still fall from you, it minimizes the amount of messy, hard to pick up hairs that will fall in your sink or on you.  </li>
            <li> An okay design and a horrible execution.</li>
            <li> The one I received was basically a small pouch with a flap that seems almost like an afterthought design-</li>
            <li> Design includes a small sliding plastic guard which can be a problem when attempting to use the trimmer to &#x27;edge&#x27; a beard, mustache or sideburns.  </li>
            <li> no more extraneous hairs all over the sink.</li>
            <li> , don&#x27;t waste your time with scissors or a \\&quot;bunk\\&quot; trimmer, get this one!</li>
            <li> I do usually have to follow up with scissors to get a even cut.</li>
            <li> What looks like a power button is the turbo button, so at first I picked the thing up and was stabbing at what I thought was the power button, and nothing was happening!</li>
            <li> The packaging was extremly difficult to open....</li>
            <li> Small container for hair.........  </li>
            <li> In my opinion this last issue makes it a dud product that fails at its intended function, and I would recommend against buying it.</li>
            <li> After 3, almost identical, super-solid, Panasonic trimmers over the past twenty years, they discontinued the model.   </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to sit here and tell Philips how to design a trimmer though, they&#x27;ve done it correctly in the past.     </li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for my husband in the past.  </li>
            <li> , it keeps those small wiskers in the built in collector.</li>
            <li> It does everything it is supposed to do, and I usually complain about SOMETHING with every buy, but I have nothing to complain about with this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I set the ring to &#x27;2&#x27;, but it doesn&#x27;t usually \\&quot;click\\&quot; until I get to ~2.5.</li>
            <li> (yes, I&#x27;m a bit lazy like that).</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Not sure who would need the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; option.  </li>
            <li> I tried small bladed products.</li>
            <li> When I take the \\&quot;Clipper Guide Comb\\&quot; off for manual cleaning, it is difficult to put it back on.</li>
            <li> it is small, sleek, and gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how it works on beards and mustaches, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for \\&quot;touch-ups\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I suppose my biggest complaint is how messy it is.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last mere hours, days or weeks.  </li>
            <li> No more trimmings on the sink for my wife to spot.</li>
            <li> no more pinching.</li>
            <li> So, I bought the lower model at Target without the vacuum earlier today and plugged it in, realizing that it didn&#x27;t have enough power to do the deed, and the battery seemed pathetic.  </li>
            <li> Vacuum filter is not perfect, some small hair pieces go to the air around.</li>
            <li> No more mess or little pieces of hair stuck behind the faucet or elsewhere.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is useless.</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature is not perfect, but I&#x27;d say it gets about 90% of the trimmings.  </li>
            <li> I was never particularly impressed by the vacuum function.  </li>
            <li> the vacuum maybe does something but with my beard it is completely useless</li>
            <li> and I do agree that it is awkward to pull down the vacuum sleeve for a close trim</li>
            <li> Very disappointing, especially after years of satisfaction with a trimmer from the same company.</li>
            <li> There are just a very few misses on this product for me though.  </li>
            <li> Because the idea of replacing an entire damn unit because one little plastic part is just stupidity, and I&#x27;m not in the habit of encouraging that.  </li>
            <li> The trimmers adjustment knob does have some wiggle as other reviewers have mentioned, which hopefully will not get worse over time.</li>
            <li> , I was sorry to see that Wahl apparently no longer makes that model.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;finally, even if you want to use it for close shave without the comb, you can&#x27;t because of the stupid vacuum where the lid gets hair stuck in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the vaccum is the biggest problem, so if you want a norelco trimmer, dont get the vacuum one, because it will simply render the trimmer useless.</li>
            <li> The only downside i see with this trimmer is if you have a really thick mustache that goes all the way up to your nose, it may be difficult to get just under your nose....</li>
            <li> I ended up growing a thick holiday beard on few occasion!</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco beard trimmers for at least the past 10 years.</li>
            <li> for trimming quality, i read someone saying it can&#x27;t hold the levels and slides down to 1 if you apply even a little pressure but its all wrong, probably they don&#x27;t know how to use a trimmer correctly.</li>
            <li> Besides this, the cutting block is too far away from the thing that touches your face (not sure what it&#x27;s called), so it&#x27;s very hard to cut any hair at all unless you choose the length setting 3 or lower.  </li>
            <li> Little tough under the nose</li>
            <li> Unfortunately their is supposed to be no hair falling out, since it has a collection chamber which is supposed to gather all the loose clippings.</li>
            <li> The only negative is that the cutting blade is inset too far into the head making it very difficult to trim close to the nose.  </li>
            <li> How hard would that be?  </li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to see where to stop.</li>
            <li> I wind up having to take off that cover, which makes it really hard to get an even trim.  </li>
            <li> I have pressed hard on the guard on this and it has never dropped from the 4 or 5</li>
            <li> Having read some of the other reviewers&#x27; complaints of \\&quot;excessive noise\\&quot; and \\&quot;soft\\&quot; depth settings, and considering the somewhat vague description of the T980 Turbo, I was hesitant, but bought it anyway.&lt;br</li>
            <li> One thing, don&#x27;t press hard while using it, as the adjustable height</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to go without a trimmer</li>
            <li> I just don&#x27;t push as hard</li>
            <li> _ too hard, or you have (in my opinion) a defective unit.    </li>
            <li> I find that if I press really hard in the 3 setting, I can get close, but it seems to take a lot of work.  </li>
            <li> but i pushed on it really hard</li>
            <li> If you set it on level 5 and you push too hard, you may not have a beard.</li>
            <li> So even though I wanted a 5, I pressed too hard and ended up with a 4</li>
            <li> Then when you&#x27;re shaving to make it all an even 4, you accidently press too hard on one spot.</li>
            <li> It hardly leave any hair let fall.</li>
            <li> Time will tell if parts fatigue plus pressing hard against the face will cause this in the coming months.    </li>
            <li> is hard.  </li>
            <li> Also, the \\&quot;Flexing Contour Guide\\&quot; requires one to push the shaver fairly hard against the face for an even shave.</li>
            <li> I dont see why anyone would need to push it that hard.</li>
            <li> Also, it makes it hard to use the trimmer with the comb  </li>
            <li> and my wife was not happy about the \\&quot;little hairs</li>
            <li> The turbo is a little louder than regular, but I don&#x27;t think its that bad.  </li>
            <li> Well, it sucks and it cuts.</li>
            <li> Also the power and turbo buttons are somewhat confusingly placed for my taste.</li>
            <li> There is also a \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button for extra power in cutting.  </li>
            <li> like this one and was concerned by some of the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> Others complained about getting up under the nose.</li>
            <li> This thing really sucks ....</li>
            <li> We all know it sucks cleaning hair out of the sink.    </li>
            <li> Some complained about the noise level.</li>
            <li> The parts seem somewhat delicate.</li>
            <li> I bought it through Amazon, in late October 2007.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Now, if you use this on a daily or every 2-3 day basis, and are cutting hairs taht are 1/8\\</li>
            <li> I have not had some of the negative experiences others have had.  </li>
            <li> I agree...with the negative reviews.</li>
            <li> SUCKS as it CUTS!\\&quot;  </li>
            <li> at least it works and isn&#x27;t falling apart.</li>
            <li> At least I won&#x27;t have to buy another until this one breaks.    </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t heard any negative feedback from the receiver, so I guess it does well.  </li>
            <li> Again, does not get 100% of clippings, but I would say at least 80% are caught.  </li>
            <li> The length selector doesn&#x27;t lock and I ended up cutting my hair too short.</li>
            <li> After reading the negative reviews on this trimmer I was worried about the adjustable guard height because the folks rating this product with one star that was their biggest complaint.  </li>
            <li> The turbo feature really sucks in the hair.</li>
            <li> Some people are just too eager to complain and be negative.    </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t bother with the negative feeback.</li>
            <li> Some people think the closest cutting position is still not close enough for that short-stubble look and that does seem to be the case.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where some of the negative reviews were coming from.  </li>
            <li> He always cleaned up after himself but without fail there were always stragglers left behind.</li>
            <li> Uneven cuts, poor battery life, hair spraying in all directions, all of you bearded gentlemen out there know the drill.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick beard.</li>
            <li> and when i say cleaning it, i mean blowing really hard on the comb to get the hair</li>
            <li> and when i say cleaning it, i mean blowing really hard on the comb to get the hair</li>
            <li> so it could take you at least a few minutes to get everything out without cutting yourself on sharp plastic edges</li>
            <li> The vaccuum is realitively useless with the shaper as other reviewers have mentioned.    </li>
            <li> What I mean by this is I have a goatee</li>
            <li> The flexing Guide Comb seems difficult to work with, probably due to my inexperience.</li>
            <li> No more!  </li>
            <li> I have owned various panasonic beard trimmers for past 20 years, untli the non-replaceable batteries go bad.  </li>
            <li> It will come off and spill if I lay the thing down on the wrong side.</li>
            <li> the controls are positioned such that I find myself accidently hitting the on/off switch as I am shaving, no huge deal but annoying, 2)</li>
            <li> The package was impossible to open, I had to cut and rip it in shreds.</li>
            <li> I wish Philips would seriously consider this issue and improve on the product, hence two star rating.</li>
            <li> It is simply impossible to angle the trimmer in such a way as to trim the hair.</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading terrible reviews of the earlier vacuum models.</li>
            <li> The cutting blades do seem to get jammed up with cut hair</li>
            <li> Cons:  Not good for trimming to skin w/o Guard.    </li>
            <li> Not a good trimmer, period.  </li>
            <li> No good for a goatee.</li>
            <li> The Norelco has a wide range of cutting depths and my beard comes out a uniform length.</li>
            <li> The cover over the blade is either too thick, or poorly placed.</li>
            <li> Naturally, a product that causes grief should be down-rated, but I won&#x27;t here because this shaver is just doing its job.    </li>
            <li> but the plastics are prone to failure in small details that are required of a complicated device.</li>
            <li> I went to this after using a Braun Cruzer which had a trimmer attachment which was MUCH closer, but unfortunately broke after I stupidly put it in my checked luggage during a transatlantic flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have owned several other norelco trimmers and this is the worst.</li>
            <li> After several months of continuous use (as a body hair trimmer), I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> The only complain I have is from Amazon which dropped the price immediately after I bought it :(</li>
            <li> Duh!</li>
            <li> I think people like me would not be disappointed (and would not have purchased the product) if it had been called the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Beard and Mustache Vacuum Trimmer.  </li>
            <li> - it&#x27;s very hard to get to this area without contorting your nose</li>
            <li> and it just cuts you down to whatever stubble-level you want in like 2 minutes!!!!</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s tough to trim my mustache without jamming the thing up against my nose.</li>
            <li> It was a tough decision to purchase the Norelco instead of another Panasonic.  </li>
            <li> I have a very thick beard.</li>
            <li> , it keeps it a lot cleaner than without, just a little disappointing...</li>
            <li> It took a little getting used to because of the floating cutting head</li>
            <li> Difficult to switch razer heads and the design makes it hard to see to cut a line.</li>
            <li> Negative is when when removes the trim gaurd to use the edge trimmer, it is hard to see beyond the lip to see where the blades are cutting.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product if you hate cleaning up all the stubble on the sink after ever time you shave.</li>
            <li> Worse, the plastic guard broke off after six months    </li>
            <li> I had been holding the length guard the wrong way, and it had seemed rather slow trimming.</li>
            <li> Also, I find that the guide/vacuum design is poor.  </li>
            <li> this clipper has some design flaws that make it a poor choice for trimming.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thin curly beard that this trimmer just could not handle.  </li>
            <li> That may be even worse...  </li>
            <li> but I have not experienced any that were listed in the 1-2 star reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have not experienced any issues with the beard length setting changing while in use that others have remarked on.  </li>
            <li> because I hate cleaning up all those tiny hairs from the bathroom sink.  </li>
            <li> /replace this poorly designed and manufactured product.</li>
            <li> Complaints about this product are splitting hairs (sorry) to say the least.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> turbo is unnecessary, and there does not appear to be a benefit...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always inadvertently pressing the poorly placed on/off switch.</li>
            <li> Alas.    </li>
            <li> After picking up the half-dozen pieces, I found that none were broken</li>
            <li> Frustrating.</li>
            <li> The worst part is the vacuum feature makes it impossible to use the bare blade to trim edges; you have to use a separate attachment for this.</li>
            <li> I know its the trimmer because he has owned at least 10 different ones with terrible outcomes.</li>
            <li> So I busted this beast out set it to 4 turned it on and put it on turbo (sorry I&#x27;m a sucker for a things that say turbo hah)!</li>
            <li> So, then, the T980 is a warning shot fired over the bow of companies everywhere who treat their clients like stupid, slobbering monkeys, devoid of choice or rights.  </li>
            <li> Odd, and annoying.   </li>
            <li> and I bought a different brand and was very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> What used to take me 15 minutes annoying minutes with scissors and the little trimmer attachment on my electric shaver, now takes 2 minutes.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my husband because it&#x27;s so annoying to see all the little hairs on the sink after he trims his mustache, sideburns, etc.  </li>
            <li> I do not think you can go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> but I was unable to find it.  </li>
            <li> and he finds it difficult to get an even trim.    </li>
            <li> -- I get a mediocre result.</li>
            <li> my beard got longer and didnt want to make the wrong choice...</li>
            <li> Turns out I was wrong.</li>
            <li> Plus was a bit uncomfortable in</li>
            <li> the adjustable whisker guard in its track and correctly in place is difficult    </li>
            <li> But even as a trimmer, if the hair is cut at any length (and there are 9 settings to the guide), this thing is useless.    </li>
            <li> and I cannot find anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s unfortunate because the titanium blades still cut well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m wary of the plastic hinge.</li>
            <li> I tried to press this trimmer so as to force a change in the setting and was unable to do so.</li>
            <li> this thing had a base, then the base could be placed far from the sink for safety in using AC around water.</li>
            <li> and after i thought about it, i realized it was a waste and a stupid idea to incorporate a vaccume unless it was running on AC power with about 3AMP power to .&lt;br</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong.  </li>
            <li> Not impressed.</li>
            <li> Sadly; that&#x27;s not going to happen.</li>
            <li> If it ever fails I&#x27;ll be buying another Philips/Norelco.</li>
            <li> I dunno what people are doing to make this thing randomly change lengths</li>
            <li> mediocre.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you start out reading the 1 star reviews to find out what&#x27;s wrong with a product.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because blades are too expensive these days</li>
            <li> so im writing now to tell you that for under 40 bucks, you cant go wrong.</li>
            <li> Assumed the vac was a gimmick, but it works perfectly - no cleaning the sink or floor.  </li>
            <li> - wrong.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical after reading some of these reviews but decided to try it anyway.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately they do not make the Maverick anymore, so I brought this one as the closest thing.</li>
            <li> It did do that well; unfortunately, that&#x27;s all it did well.</li>
            <li> I guess I was wrong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect</li>
            <li> Mine has stayed on the 3 setting that I chose for everytime without fail.     </li>
            <li> One thing that I might complain about is the ability to cut the longer hair, lets just say its not perfect for that.</li>
            <li> When the rechargeable battery on this unit (and I owned two of them over the years) finally failed to recharge the product&#x27;s life is over.</li>
            <li> Difficult to replace to guard if you remove it.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s unrealistic to think a mechanical device in this price range won&#x27;t make any noise at all.  </li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for I believe it was 18 dollars on a random sale day I guess .</li>
            <li> the bag is worthless, and probably a step up from a thick ziplock bag but with velcro&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The other problem with the packaging is the dreadful plastic blister pack holding the trimmer and accessories inside the box.  </li>

            <li> I was so tired of being disappointed in cordless trimmers.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m always afraid I will break it.</li>
            <li> I use this for cutting off my hair........</li>
            <li> I used some crazy glue to fix it</li>
            <li> and i see the hair just clumped on the contact point where the cutting blades meet the comb.  </li>
            <li> You have to be holding it really awkwardly for that to happen.</li>
            <li> When you are done cutting your hairs are captured in a removable tray for disposal.</li>
            <li> The adjustable attachment for length fell off between cutting strokes &amp; I gouged me beard.  </li>
            <li> I like the beard trimmer, but you have to change the cutting blade to do close trimming.  </li>
            <li> so you can get maximum control of where you are cutting.  </li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t have a dirty, clogged sink.  </li>
            <li> I also like the nine cutting positions.  </li>
            <li> I have tried trimmers made specifically for beards, trimmers made for cutting hair and everything in-between.  </li>
            <li> The mini trimmer is an inconvenient attachment.</li>
            <li> A feature that I like is that you adjust the cutting length with the turn of a dial, not by changing heads.  </li>
            <li> Cutting head can be raised or lowered to suit closeness of shave.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Very dangerous if your cutting a line for your moustache-- your literally cutting blind.</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t make your lady mad, and everyone is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am slightly disappointed how difficult it is to use the piece for under the mustache.</li>
            <li> However, the \\&quot;thing\\&quot; on my chin was getting out of hand and scissors just weren&#x27;t cutting it (bad pun intended).</li>
            <li> , this is the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used at least a dozen trimmers in my lifetime.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The air intake plastic lip made a close shave VERY DIFFICULT to achieve.</li>
            <li> It is nearly impossible to get the area under the nose/above the lip with the guard on, its just too bulky...</li>
            <li> but for the look given by this norelco...its not that bad...</li>
            <li> The bad news is 1)</li>
            <li> Who can predict what bad things might happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other cautions in Norelco&#x27;s documentation: \\&quot;...</li>
            <li> Overpriced in stores, not too bad on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bad news all around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had 4 of these cordless trimmers and have always replaced them because rechargeable batteries go bad.  </li>
            <li> I also agree with another review in regards to the ON/OFF and Turbo buttons being in a bad location.</li>
            <li> I bought in spite of some bad reviews.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately the razor has a VERY bad spring/strength mechanism for holding the desired length in place; i.e.: I like to shave at a \\&quot;3\\&quot; and by the mere act of pressing the razor against my face [HEAVAN FORBID!!]</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> What a disappointment!  </li>
            <li> for it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> and I was slightly disappointed to see that they are not being made in Austria anymore.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Disappointing build quality!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> Stupid.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is virtually worthless.</li>
            <li> I hate knocking off a star for this</li>
            <li> Also doesn&#x27;t have base and can&#x27;t be put upright.</li>
            <li> I wanted to get away from having a bunch of attachments, a bulky base station, and hair all over the sink.</li>
            <li> The comb attachment has a spring-loaded base feature.</li>
            <li> The rotating ones are worthless and I don&#x27;t like sticking those oscillating trimmers up my nose.</li>
            <li> Bad idea!</li>
            <li> and I was sick of seeing hair in the sink!</li>
            <li> Norelco rotary razor years ago which I hated.</li>
            <li> /&gt;However, in practice, I&#x27;ve been very frustrated by this one.</li>
            <li> I have not been disappointed!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is a terrible product.</li>
            <li> so if thats the look you want, you wont be disappointed !!  </li>
            <li> in all this is the worst product ever</li>
            <li> One of the worst products I&#x27;ve every purchased.</li>
            <li> this thing is insane.</li>
            <li> Those people at Norelco are insane!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pathetic.  </li>
            <li> Worst of all, the trim height setting moves when you press it against your face...</li>
            <li> This is very annoying.</li>
            <li> Also very annoying.</li>
            <li> This product is terrible.</li>

            <li> The vacuum misses a lot, collects maybe 75% and misses the rest. Plastic pieces are brittle and prone to cracking. Recently, started turning on by itself in the middle of the night. Leave it uncharged now so it doesn&#x27;t wake me and just use it with the cord. I&#x27;d try something else.</li>
            <li> www.huntfishgolfwork.com</li>
            <li> Still use it ...... well when I hve a beard or stash.....been clean for a while</li>
            <li> BEST BEST BEST. . . I was so tired of being disappointed in cordless trimmers. This is the absolute best product out there. . . Long run time between charges, great vacuum, easy to clean, and the trim settings are well determined, and it stays at that setting until you change it.&lt;br /&gt;Could not be happier with this product. . . except for one thing. . .&lt;br /&gt;THEY STOPPED MAKING THE T980 !!!&lt;br /&gt;BRING THE T980 BACK PLEASE!!!</li>
            <li> I have always had trouble keeping by beard as short as I like and this trimmer solved that problem.  In addition it allows me to make a smooth line where I trim the beard completely.</li>
            <li> I started shaving my head over ten years ago and I am so glad I found the T980.  I can get a just clippered look without leaving tiny pieces of hair everywhere.  I am a neat freak so this device is perfect for me.  It is powerful and easy to use.  The vacuum really works and emptying is a breeze. It is also more comfortable on sensitive areas like my neck than other clippers I have used in the past.  I used to put off shaving my head, but it is so simple now that I do it every few days.  I would reccomend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is pretty good. Trims well. Mostly used for personal body grooming. It is easily cleanable with most important parts just pulling off. The price is fair.&lt;br /&gt;The battery capacity is excellent. Have used a half dozen times without need for recharging. Cordless feature is great to trim in shower and not make a mess in bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;The bells and whistles such as turbo power and vacuum chamber are more annoying than useful. The vacuum chamber fills really fast and if you have black hair you can not distinguish it against the groomer&#x27;s black body color despite what the advertisements claim. When the chamber is full cutting ability drops dramatically. The work around is just pull off or keep open the chamber door while grooming.&lt;br /&gt;I have not figured out what turbo is for, sure the blades move faster and the device is louder but since we&#x27;re triming hair and not a full lawn of grass it seems pretty pointless.&lt;br /&gt;The power button is very sensitive and an inadvertant flick of a finger easily shuts off (or turns on trimmer). Not a disaster but slightly annoying.&lt;br /&gt;As far as reliability it has lasted longer than my previous Panasonic so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
            <li> My fiance is quite pleased with this vacuum trimmer- as am I since there&#x27;s no longer bits of his hair all over the place! He&#x27;s had it for a few months now and is very happy with it. It&#x27;s very easy to adjust the setting for different lengths as well. His beard is looking great!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I researched beard trimmers and the customer reviews I found were very positive for this model.  So I ordered it on Amazon.  I am very pleased with the purchase.  It does a good job, maintains a nice charge, and I was amazed at how well it vacuums the trimmed beard hairs into the waste compartment.  When I had used a scissors to trim my beard, the results were just so-so and there was always a big mess to clean up.  But this produt does a very nice job and it makes very little to no mess.  I reccomend this purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect tool for trimming long or short beard/ mustache.  Easy to use and quite friendly to your face&#x27;s skin.   Short recharging time  Also a good solution for quick adjustments on those \\&quot;in a hurry\\&quot; mornings.</li>
            <li> Bought this for my husband hoping to avoid those \\&quot;little tiny hairs\\&quot; that end up all over.  This works WONDERFUL. Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works great!  Only problem that I see with it, is the vacuum could work better.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this item to trim his beard, sideburns and the back of his neck.  It is an excellent bargain.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen many of these types of trimmers and they come with all these attachments for the different hair lengths but the fact that this one has 9 adjustable lengths built in is just great! also the vaccuum is a great feature where the hair just gets sucked into a clear little compartment that is easily emptied. if you like beards but you like keeping them trim this is the trimmer to buy!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is marketed toward facial hair and sideburns, and that&#x27;s all it&#x27;s good for.  Anything finer than coarse facial hair jams up the vacuum system, so forget about buzz cuts or body grooming.  When the vacuum part is backed up, it blocks hair from entering the blades, forcing you to clean it several times per trimming session.  The vacuum is weak at best, and left me cleaning up almost as much hair from my counter as my previous, non-vacuum trimmer.  Although I&#x27;ve enjoyed Norelco products in the past, this one has been a disappointment and will be on its way back to Amazon tomorrow.</li>
            <li> I use this to cut my hair and maintain my haircuts. It works great, but it does get clogged with long hairs. I love how it sucks up the hair. This is a necessity for men, you should own one.</li>
            <li> Have had this trimmer for a couple months now and love it. This trimmer holds a charge for a good amount of time and is very easy and comfortable to use. With the addition of the turbo feature, almost no hair trimmings in the sink.Would definitely recommend this trimmer to anyone with a beard.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works very well.  I would definitely recommend this to someone.  The battery lasts a long time between charges and the trimmer is quite powerful.  Be sure to start at the longest trim setting the first time you use it and then work your way shorter to your desired length.  The vacuum could be a little better.  I usually have to have the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; turned on for it to be really effective. Even with the vacuum, expect a little clean-up at the end, but not nearly as much as there would be without the vacuum.  The vacuum storage is a touch on the small side.  I sometimes have to empty it twice in one setting.  Still, it&#x27;s a lot easier than having all that hair flying all over the sink.  Overall, I have been very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I love this trimmer. Different parts of my beard require different settings. Many other trimmers require you to change heads. With the twist action settings on this razor, I quickly change settings and get my beard right every time.  The vacuum works pretty well. It doesn&#x27;t get all the trimmings, but it does get a majority of them. It&#x27;s easy to clean after use. The best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> I grew a goatee a couple of years ago and was using what I thought was a decent groomer.  That perspective changed once I started using the T980 Turbo.  What a difference!  It has dramatically cut the amount of time that it takes to groom my goatee.  And it&#x27;s more comfortable and much more accurate for a far superior result.  Plus, this one does a great job of catching all of the clippings making it a very clean and effortless experience.</li>
            <li> I just bought a Phillips-Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, and if any of you men or women are looking to give your beard that perpetual &#x27;George Michael-esque&#x27; look, search no further.  This thing is frikin&#x27; sweet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works as advertised.  Trims fast.  Does not pull the hair.  Does not need to be used on turbo mode, works great on regular mode.  Set the dial to (1), and you&#x27;ll be in that 1.5mm length mark.  I was concerned that this trimmer would get that close, but not too close trim.  The shaver effortlessly leaves you with that 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.  Turn the dial a couple clicks to (3 or 4), a bit longer, and then thin-out your sideburns.  Travel case included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vacuum:  worked great on regular power (non-turbo) mode, and let only a few hairs drop to the sink.  I think the hairs just fell because I was trimming so quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adjustable Guard:  Glides smooth.  Adjusts quickly.  Durable, not flimsy.  Removes instantly for a closer trim.  Open the compartment door, and brush out the trimmed hairs.</li>
            <li> I bought this solely on the reviews and I was not disappointed.  Prior to this purchase, cleanup in the bathroom was a chore.  I had devised all sorts of ways to alleviate the clippings problem and none solved it completely.  While this item is not 100% spotless after a trim, the clean up takes less than a minute.  I do not think you can go wrong with this item.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I was replacing an old conair that wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore.  This is a big step up and I am happy as always when buying small electronics from amazon.  Price is right, no tax, free shipping...buy with confidence.</li>
            <li> The first one that I bought (as a gift for my boyfriend) stopped functioning after it was used 5-6 times. Amazon was very understanding and offered me a new one free. This it is still functioning ... and I hope the first one was just a bad luck ... In general I like Philips products so I have hope that this time everything will be ok :)</li>
            <li> This real does the job.  If only Philips-Norelco got with the modern-day L-ion rechargeable batteries.</li>
            <li> The Philips T980 trimmer is excellent.  The best feature is the adjustable trimmer length - no need to change guides.  Simple and efficient.</li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m happy with the product but it turns on when it&#x27;s in my bag consuming battery.</li>
            <li> Tried other trimmers that just couldn&#x27;t maintain their settings.  This one stays where you want it.  Little tough under the nose but otherwise I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This was my first beard trimmer, and I am satisfied with the purchase. Does a great job, very quick to use, no mess at all (vacuum cleanup is awesome). When it&#x27;s full, just dump it out. Like that it is easily adjustable. Has a turbo mode which I haven&#x27;t needed to use yet too. For the price, I can&#x27;t complain. Would recommend.</li>
            <li> The vacuum part of it doesn&#x27;t work well unless its in &#x27;turbo&#x27; mode, and its not quite as loud as a blow-dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great trimmer!</li>
            <li> After reading many reviews of this product I was sold and went ahead and ordered it.  My mistake.  The unit is apparently not designed for heavy, thick or long beard hair, as it does not trim that well, the vacuum just clogs up and then blades tend to pull rather than cut smoothly.  The blade guard (?) just lets hair jam up against the blades, which again makes for a less comfortable trim.  My plan is to now get a much simpler version of this type trimmer and go back to trimming as I have always done it.</li>
            <li> Purchased the T980 trimmer in January (is now mid-Oct), and it has worked well. This replaced an earlier Norelco whose battery finally gave up (+ it got dropped a couple of times...), and - for once - the replacement actually seems better than the original.  Unit shipped with a decent (not great) flip-cover travel case, large enough for the trimmer &amp; charger, and with a small net pouch for the narrow trimming head (which has not been used). Have also never needed the \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; mode.  The \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; feature on the T980 works somewhat better than the earlier unit: it does not catch everything, but certainly captures most of the clippings. The flip open door to empty the contents is convenient.  Don&#x27;t care for the hard body, but there is a nice rubber ring (used to change the cutting depth) that makes a good grip point. Find it difficult to read the \\&quot;zoom\\&quot; - that is, cutting depth - setting from certain angles / lighting conditions, but this is not a major problem.  After some 9 months of use, this unit still looks great, cuts great, and has a pleasingly long battery life. It lacks a multi-LED charge indicator, but does have a \\&quot;Low\\&quot; battery warning light (+ a Charge light) &amp; the unit will still run for several beard trimmings once the warning light comes on. All-in-all, a good purchase.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;It does leave a few hairs in the sink, but that&#x27;s expected with all trimmers.&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this over a year and it does the job.  The provided pre-set lengths are pretty good and usually work for the style I need.  It shaves cleanly and hasn&#x27;t given me any trouble.  Battery lasts well over a week with daily trimming, but I do notice the motor begins to turn a bit slower after several days on the battery.    The mustache/sideburn trimmer is average and does the job.    The beard trimmer is pretty good, but has trouble getting really close under my nose.  I sometimes have to go over that area several times to get it as close as I like.    The vacuum will only catch about 3/4 of the hair.  The other 1/4 will be all over your sink and need to be cleaned up.  Emptying the vacuum chamber is easy though.  The vacuum is also loud enough that it would wake up someone sleeping in the same room but not the next room.    There is a flashing light on the charger that can get annoying in a completely dark room unless you turn the shaver upside down while shaving.    Apparently this model has been upgraded to this unit:  [...]</li>
            <li> I took a chance getting this. The trimmer I had been using was Philips but it was dropped and it broke. I bought another make to replace the broken one and didn&#x27;t like it at all, it wouldn&#x27;t get close enough to trim my beard to the length I want.  This trimmer is pretty good, it vacuums up most of the loose hair when I trim my beard and leaves little mess. I used to go out back to trim my beard (real drag when it rains) and let it fall in to the lawn but no need for that now. It cuts evenly and doesn&#x27;t miss any hair. It also has a reasonable price. I give it two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is great. I bought it for my husband after reading all the reviews and he says it is the best one he has owned. The vacuum function is great - no more hair all over the bathroom floor. It appears well made and feels substantial in the hand. Very happy hubby-very happy me!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s very convenient as it sucks up hair into the chamber.  Although, some hairs still fall from you, it minimizes the amount of messy, hard to pick up hairs that will fall in your sink or on you.  But do not exspect this product to fully suck up all the hairs it shaves, it still leaves some hairs to fall on you or on the sink/floor.  I use this on my beard and to stubble-look my own hair, if you use this on your hair aside from your beard, some hairs get stuck and clog the opening of the vacuum that leads to the chamber, you have to remove the clippers and cutters to remove it.  Have to use the Power mode on my hair though. But overall, nice product.  But have to give it a 4-star as it still has some hairs falling down on you or on the sink, I expected this to suck the hairs it cuts all up.  It just minimizes the mess, and it&#x27;s good though.</li>
            <li> The T980 works very well for a consumer-grade device.  The batteries last much longer than necessary (at least, in the first few months of ownership) but using the trimmer corded isn&#x27;t a problem.  And it&#x27;s a snap to use.    There are a couple things you should know.  First, the highest setting is about 3/4\\&quot; so if you want parts of your beard longer, you won&#x27;t have the automatic height setting available.  Second, the shaping parts around the cutting head are all plastic, so this device wouldn&#x27;t last long in a professional environment (where it might get dropped).    The vacuum collects perhaps 90% of your trimmings.  Plan on changing shirts after use. :)</li>
            <li> Well, it sucks and it cuts. This is a terrible product. I have owned several other norelco trimmers and this is the worst. The only reason I did not return it is because it will work with AC power. The last Norelco trimmer, the battery life become so short, so quickly that it would not even let me finish trimming my beard on one charge, which is quite pathetic.    Pros: Uses AC power, okay triming attachment, vacuume is an okay idea  Cons: Loud, high pitched motor (particularly annoying in turbo mode), weak motor if used in standard mode, too easy to accidentally hit the on switch, guard is difficult to put on (doesn&#x27;t allign easily), cheap plastic cover for hair collector broke after just a few uses.    Bottom line: An okay design and a horrible execution. I will eventualy find something else to replace this. I don&#x27;t understand all the positive reviews. My old Panasonic was awesome and lasted several years but died last year and I can&#x27;t find a good replacement that will also use AC power.</li>
            <li> I have tried alot of trimmers, and this is hands down is the best in the market. Cuts smoothly as well as the easy changing of lengths with just 1 turn makes it easy to use. It is worth it 100%</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for about 28 years and used manny a trimmer.  This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.  There&#x27;s very little mess and does a great job.  I find no fault with it, been using it for over 1 year.</li>
            <li> trim length goes from stubble (1) to long (9), works really well. vacuum sucks hairs well.</li>
            <li> Finding a shaver that works well for me has been more than a challenge.  This is the best one I have found so far.  While the little vacumn may seem like a gimmick, it actually works very well compared to not using a vacumn at all - don&#x27;t expect perfection - BUT it is very good.  It is nice not to have to do a major sink clean.    As with all shavers I have not been able to catch the hair right below my nose - and thus require and additional device (the flip up here is still too big...).    I will say that this is much better to use than the Remington 3000 that I have seen selling for nearly $100 on Amazon (which I originally bought for $50).     I generally like the shave.      I would recommend that this be the first one you try - you may not want to go to any others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a regular Norelco beard trimmer for years and when the battery would no longer hold a charge I decided to give this one a try.  I didn&#x27;t really follow the vacuum or turbo descriptions but bought it anyway based on price.  Boy am I glad I did!  The vacuum makes trimming so much less of a mess.  I use it also to buzz cut my hair and there is virtually no mess now where there used to be stubbles of hair everywhere before.  I do have to empty the vacuum container a few times but less mess is far better.  Great product.  The description really doesn&#x27;t do it justice.  It really works!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for over 25 years.  I&#x27;d used Wahl products before... they&#x27;re not terrible, but most trimmers leave a mess, particularly with thick coarse beards like mine.  1  This product has a \\&quot;dial\\&quot; for different height settings.  I dial a 3 for my beard (which I keep close), and change to a 4 for my moustache.  (Settings are 1-9, with 1 giving you a \\&quot;1 day growth\\&quot; look).  This trimmer does a good job vacuuming the trimmings, and is easy to clean.  There is a plastic door that opens to readily empty the vacuumed clippings.     There is a separate trim attachment for the sideburn or trim function... it doesn&#x27;t take that long to change, but I could see where this might be an aggravation for a sideburn/goatee&#x27; kind of guy. My razor has a popout trimmer that I use for this purpose, so it isn&#x27;t an issue for me.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product, well built, durable, has features that are used, many beard length settings use and no need to pick up whiskers with vacuum feature. Only negative is with vacuum rectangular hole next to cut line the exact location of cut line while trimming less certain.</li>
            <li> The last accuvac I had from Norelco lasted about 5 years and just died.  Since it worked so well and does a pretty good job of keeping the sink and counter clean I decided to stick with this brand.  This is the only one that I found that could be used while plugged in.  My old one seemed to like to die occasionally when I wasn&#x27;t quite finished using it so I had to wait for it to charge for a little while just to be able to finish up.  With this one I could plug it in finish up and then it would charge to full capacity, that is great.  I&#x27;m not so sure about the hair chamber as the old one I had had a removable hair chamber, this one only actually has a door but I guess it works fine.  Others have mentioned the power button was touchy, I don&#x27;t really agree. The way I hold it it wouldn&#x27;t get pushed unless I meant to push it.  Two thumbs up.</li>
            <li> Do not pass \\&quot;Go\\&quot;, collect $39.99 and buy this now! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this as a gift but knowing the Philips name I know this is a great product. I had the older model of this trimmer and now after years needed to upgrade, so I have no problems with this product and will continue to buy this name brand</li>
            <li> This product works great.  I bought it for my boyfriend and he loves it.  It has so many functions all in one trimmer!</li>
            <li> How in the world does this thing get 5 stars? The adjustable trimmer doesn&#x27;t &#x27;snap&#x27; when adjusting to number 2 trim. It also silently switches from trim number 3 - 2 if you press down hard enough. Also the blade has a &#x27;shield&#x27; that aids in sucking the cut hair down into the collection chamber. The problem is the &#x27;shield&#x27; blocks the head of the blade. Very dangerous if your cutting a line for your moustache-- your literally cutting blind. It does come with a cheap attachment for linings, but I prefer cutting from the blade, like in the older models.    Too much of my life depends on how good of a shave I give myself. This time Norelco doesn&#x27;t cut it. The one star is for the vacuum.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer as an upgrade to my older T900 model. The vacuum definitely reduces the mess. It&#x27;s not perfect even on turbo but catches nearly 90% of what previously was 100% of hair on my sink. The turbo is not that loud (no significant difference between normal mode and turbo). My one observation is that the moustache trimmer attachment seems less precise than the one on the T900 however it can still produce the same results. Although the mechanics look the same this one felt like it delivered a smoother shave than my older model. Less mess, lighter device, overall this is an acceptable upgrade.</li>
            <li> I owned another Norelco beard trimmer with a vacuum in it ... until my wife broke it by knocking it off the shelf. But now I&#x27;m glad she did. On the old one, the vacuum was fairly useless because just as much hair ended up in the sink and all over the blade as in the catcher bin. Maybe more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the T980 Turbo (and don&#x27;t all guys love stuff with \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; in the description?) does the job. Yes, I know it has two settings: Turbo on and Turbo off. But I see no reason to use it with Turbo off because then it&#x27;s just like the old underpowered version. But with Turbo on it collects nearly all those little hairs. (Some get away, but many fewer.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people say that the Turbo is too loud, which is why they offer an option I suppose, but in our house the bathroom is far enough away and well-insulated enough that no one can hear it running full blast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat: It&#x27;s better to trim the beard dry not wet. Remember to trim it before you get in the shower because when the hair is wet the vacuum still has trouble collecting the hairs, even on Turbo. Plus showering washes any remaining trimmings away. Yes, this may be self-evident to some of you, but I hadn&#x27;t thought of it before. Keep in mind I&#x27;m doing this before morning coffee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no more little hairs all over my daughter after daddy kisses and snuggles her. I like the T980 trimmer.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer is a fantastic beard trimmer. I use this to trim and shape my moustache as well. The vacuum works better when you use the turbo vacuum. Worth every penny!</li>
            <li> after I had ordered this item I found the same one at TJ MAXX locally for $14.99. Amazon charged 39.99. &lt;br /&gt;I will never be sucked in again by Amazon!!!</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a good job of vacuuming the hairs and keeping them out of the sink.</li>
            <li> as a first time beard grower, trimming a beard was at best enigmatic.  &lt;br /&gt;I had only the vaguest of images as to what a beard should look like. It was  &lt;br /&gt;not unlike \\&quot;what should a haircut look like.\\&quot; There is no answer. The &lt;br /&gt;difference between a good haircut and a bad haircut is two weeks. The  &lt;br /&gt;literature with the Norelco didn&#x27;t give a smidgen of help. Other than that,  &lt;br /&gt;the trimmer itself was easy to assemble (the ideographs on the instruction  &lt;br /&gt;sheet were of little help!), was easy to use, was easy to clean, and produced  &lt;br /&gt;excellent results. I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This is the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had.  The trimmer guide has 9 very precise trimming length settings  - I found a 5 setting perfect for a medium length beard.  The vacuum works great and catches all the loose hair during the trimming process.  It also has an attachment for more precise areas such as the mustache area.  It is a very comfortable size to hold as well and easy to use.  I took it on a couple trips and it is lightweight and the battery lasts forever.  I got 5 trims before charging and I think I could have gotten at least one more.  Overall a great product especially for the money.</li>
            <li> The best of the best, fast, clean and very suitable. And the Amazon price is so good.   I&#x27;ve been using trimmers since i was 20 and i can tell this is the best i tried.   Go for it.</li>
            <li> I have had this item for over a year.  Lots of power and stays sharp.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Let me start off with I am not what you would call a heavy user.  The vac feature of this product works great.  I have not noticed any hair falling on the floor provided you keep the hair collection bin cleaned out.  Best trimmer I have used.</li>
            <li> Never have I owned a more poorly designed device. Try traveling with the trimmer and you&#x27;ll soon realize the power button is activated if anything puts pressure on the device. The thing will be vibrating in your bag. Or you may turn it off accidentally while shaving. It also has a few counterintuitive add ons that make it seem like you&#x27;re putting together a jalopy just to shave. Do not buy this thing. It was designed cheaply and made cheaply. Unbelieveable!</li>
            <li> Great product but it is cheaper at drugstore.com. If you&#x27;re planning on buying this item, you might want to do some comparison shopping first to make sure you&#x27;re getting the best deal.</li>
            <li> I have worn a beard since 1970.  This is the best trimmer that I&#x27;ve has.  Easy to use.  The vacuum feature is a big plus.</li>
            <li> I gave it as a gift and he seems to be delighted. He has said that it is much better than his old trimmer in that it floats closer to all areas of his face and the turbo vacuum is terrific.</li>
            <li> With so many reviews saying this trimmer suddenly shifted the trimming length, I debated a long time whether to buy it or not.    Therefore, I feel obligated to report I haven&#x27;t had a single problem with it yet.    I&#x27;d say buy away if you&#x27;re debating.</li>
            <li> I own an earlier model, which I prefer, but the battery died. The hair catcher was a cup that could be removed and be easily dumped into a waste basket; this model has a fragile door, the hairs do not easily come out or off of the filter and tapping the unit could damage it. Both shavers require a light pressure or the setting can suddenly change to a shorter length.  Turbo speed is really not necessary. Nice 70 minute charge, comfortable to hold, and attractive style.  Overall, I feel it will work well but I am leary of the shavings door. It does a nice job, as I expected. I have no experience with any other brand to compare.  I suggest a can of compressed air be handy and to blow the shavings out after each use, which defeats the neatness of the vacuum collection, but blow lightly over a waste basket.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had four different beard trimmers and this is by far the best. It does an excellent job, and I have found little need to turn on the turbo feature. This is the second vacuum unit I&#x27;ve owned and is significantly better in performance and features than the first.</li>
            <li> I really think the T980 is a major advance in technology over the proior model.  The size and shape is comfortable; the vaccum, although not perfect, keeps your work area neat and relatively clean; the turbo function is a nice additional feature. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> This thing works well and it really does create much less hair in your sink.  I use it daily.</li>
            <li> This shaver really is a treat to use. I have had no difficulty with the \\&quot;grade\\&quot; of shave slipping mid shave and I find it a very comfortable shaver to use.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is quick and the receptacle really does seem to catch upwards of 95% of what I&#x27;m using.&lt;br /&gt;So far I&#x27;ve had four shaves off the one charge and I shave once a week, so the battery seems to hold its charge really well.&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is a cinch.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s noisy with turbo on, but certainly not in the same vicinity as a hair dryer. It&#x27;s certainly not anything that&#x27;s a detraction from the shave.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason I haven&#x27;t given this 5 stars is because of the area just under the nose, the other reviewers that have mentioned this are correct - it&#x27;s very hard to get to this area without contorting your nose and/or lip.&lt;br /&gt;I simply remove the protector and do the last few hairs freehand with the open shaver or a pair of cuticle scissors.&lt;br /&gt;The overall performance of this shaver more than makes up for this one shortcoming.&lt;br /&gt;Very nice carrying bag too included.</li>
            <li> This is an adequate trimmer.  I  bought it to replace a previous Norelco trimmer that I had for years.  The vacuum is not strong enough to prevent lots of hairs everywhere, but post-trim cleanup is much faster now.  Not any louder than my previous trimmer, even on \\&quot;turbo\\&quot;, which I always have on.  On the non-Turbo setting, the trim quality is noticeably degraded.  On Turbo the trim is pretty good.  The comb does not allow good mustache trimming.  Overall this trimmer is pretty good, but is not the all-in-one trimmer that I was looking for.  I would try a different product if I had it to do all over again.</li>
            <li> My husband has an incredibly thick and coarse beard... the trimmers work well but the vacuum simply cannot handle the sheer volume and coarseness of his facial hair.  Still - there&#x27;s definitely LESS left over for me to clean up after he trims his beard!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for a month now. It is larger than the trimmer I had been using, it&#x27;s about the size of a microphone. But that is not a problem once you get used to it. It is still working off the original charge, using it about every other day. It&#x27;s very easy to use, works very well, and I have no regrets at all with it&#x27;s purchase. As others have said, a stand to store it in would have been nice, but to be fair I knew one wasn&#x27;t included. If it was a bit smaller, I would have given it a 5, but I recommend it without reservation.</li>
            <li> I was simply looking for a trimmer for my sideburns that wouldn&#x27;t create a mess all over the sink. Certainly some bits escape, but for the most part, I think it does an excellent job and is very easy to handle and clean. Just for kicks, I did try it out on my face after a week&#x27;s growth and it seemed to work rather well. So for you guys looking to maintain that scruffy look, this is perfect.</li>
            <li> I scoured the net looking for the perfect beard trimmer to trim my beard that I brough back from Iraq.  I didn&#x27;t want to look like a terrorist, so I needed a trimmer to keep my beard looking civilized.  I read the reviews here and was prepared for a somewhat weak vacuum- even on turbo.  No big deal- I wanted results, and the vacuum was just a perk anyway.  It caught maybe half the hair on turbo, so whoopie.    Well, I should have paid more attention to the negative reviews!  I was careful not to hold the trimmer by the click wheel to avoid accidentally going down a setting... I did that once and clicked from a 5 to a 4.  I liked the 4 better anyway, so stuck with that.  I happily trimmed to a 4 once a week (sometimes twice to clean it up) for the last couple months and it worked well, until just a couple of days ago when the setting slipped all the way down to 1 when I was in the middle of shaving!  I went from a nice beard to the 5 o-clock shadow look!  I AM FURIOUS!      There needs to be some sort of setting lock that prevents it from just slipping and ruining your beard!  How hard would that be?  Just build the dial with a notch you can slide a bar into in order to lock it!    Until they build this with a locking device, avoid it, or you could lose your hard-earned beard- just like I did!</li>
            <li> It works better than former models and hair doesn&#x27;t get stuck behind the mechanism any more...  Very good product.</li>
            <li> Next to my Family Guy box sets this is the best purchase I have made in 12 months.      Tired of my wife busting balls on a daily basis, I needed something to take care of the whiskers.  This fantastic tool takes care of that for you leaving absolutely no mess on the bathroom counter.  I travel a lot for work and this tool is small enough to fit in my travel medicine bag along with my standard razor.  I just purchased this for my brother in law and will also purchase it for a buddy&#x27;s birthday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy with it. It shaves much better than the cheap ($17 at Target) Weil beard trimmer I used to use. I&#x27;m happy with the results of the trim. I use the #5 setting for a nice short trimmed beard look -- more than stubble, but not a long beard. I like the smooth look it gives, not splotchy or patchy. No, the vacuum doesn&#x27;t pick up everything, but it makes clean up much much less bothersome than the old trimmer I used.    And for the record, the battery in mine is NiMH, not NiCd, so I&#x27;m quite pleased about that.  The manual specifically says that it&#x27;s NiMH. So those of you that got the old fashioned NiCad batteries, they&#x27;ve updated it since then.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the trimmer for a couple of months now and simply love it! Philips Norelco thought of all the elements that make up a great beard trimmer and put them into a low cost product.   1. It needs no sharpening.  2. It needs no special oils for lubricating.  3. It has an integrated vacuum that pulls out more than 90% of the mess!  4. It&#x27;s easy to clean.  5. It&#x27;s easy to adjust trimming height.  6. It has a narrow head for fine trimming.  7. Charge lasted for &gt; 1 month of trimming every other day.  8. Reasonably quest unless you turn on the turbo vacuum, which I only use with the narrow trimming tool.    Did I mention that it doesn&#x27;t leave the bathroom sink full of hair trimmings?</li>
            <li> I purchased this item because I was tired of leaving hairs all over the place and because I had lost the charger for my old trimmer.  Bottom line up front: this thing trims and has lots of nice features, but is not worth leaving a working trimmer in the trash for.    The item comes with different heads, one of which will give you a wide range of length adjustments that are easily switched between.  The unit feels solid as a whole and also has a reasonable case (it doesn&#x27;t seem to be dedicated to holding each part in a certain place, but instead it holds everything in one pouch).      The vacuum action will catch most hairs, but you can&#x27;t get away with not trimming over a sink.  It will still allow some hairs to get away; it&#x27;s no Flowbee.  The end result is better than nothing, but not a complete solution.    As I said before, if you have a trimmer that works for you now, stick with it.  You can get this if the current one breaks.  It&#x27;s not going to make trimming a new experience or solve the world&#x27;s problems, but it&#x27;s a competent trimmer that reduces some of the clean-up.</li>
            <li> As some reviewers had expressed reservations I took a flyer on the many positive reviews.  I have not been disappointed!  The trimmer served my needs on my beard and also my mustache. Several reviewers criticized their inability to trim their mustache.  I have found no problems with the basic trimmer without the attachment.  I have found the supposed mustache trimmer not worth the effort to put it on the unit.  The turbo speed does indeed do its job.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had facial hair in one form or another for my entire adult life and have used a wide variety of trimmers over the years.  This one is, without a doubt, the BEST trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  It works as advertised, does everything it claims to do, is both easy to use &amp; easy to clean, holds a charge for quite a while, and I have had absolutely no complaints about it.  I&#x27;ve found that keeping a slow &amp; steady pace, as opposed to trying to race around your face, allows the vacuum to do it&#x27;s job better.  WELL worth the money I spent for it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the trimmer a few times since getting it and so far so good. The vacuum feature actually works pretty well. I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial real estate to cover, so I don&#x27;t have to empty it as often as others might. It doesn&#x27;t catch all the hair, but I&#x27;d say 95% of it.    The construction seems a little flimsy. I wouldn&#x27;t like to see how it would react to a sudden impact with a tiled bathroom floor. That&#x27;s about the only negative aspect I can think of.    What I really like is the adjustable guard. It&#x27;s much nicer not having all those attachments. All I have to do with this one is dial the length I want and I&#x27;m all set.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had no problem with my trimmer. It stays on the number I set it on and performs well. The vacuum is loud, but then again, it&#x27;s a vacuum so it&#x27;s bound to be loud. It catches over half of the hairs, may closer to three-quarters. It makes cleanup a lot less involved than it used to be with my old trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have own various Norelco Vacuum Trimmers in the past and this one is the best yet. I usually leave the &#x27;turbo&#x27; on and find it vacuums most cut hairs. I don&#x27;t find the extra few decibels of sound to be as annoying as some have said. Battery seems to hold a charge for a good length of time and the new design change where the hair catching &#x27;basket&#x27; does not come off is welcomed. I would certainly recommnend the new Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.</li>
            <li> I just received this yesterday....I have had a pro Wahl before and mostly a low end Norelco.....the vacuum feature of this is great....also, the smaller trimmer accessory is great for those pesky noise and ear hair outcroppings...what a great deal for the money.</li>
            <li> After using the regular beard trimmers for years, I was pleasantly surprised to see NO mess of hair clippings to clean up from the counter.      My previous trimmers - also from Norelco- eventually developed battery problems when the battery did not hold charge any more.  The battery in the T980 remains to be tested as time goes by.      Meanwhile the beard trimming functions have worked well so far.  I like the regular as well as the smaller blades for fine trimming.  And of course I love the vacuuming ability of the trimmer.</li>
            <li> Actually performs as advertised and even gives an excellent close haircut. Easy to empty out collected hair. Worth the price.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer allowed me to achieve and maintain the beard length I was seeking more precisely and efficiently than any other trimmer I have owned. (My wife especially likes the job it does.) The vacuum function works well and makes clean-up a ten-second job.  The battery provides a couple week&#x27;s worth of uses before it needs recharging, which takes a bit over an hour.  The somewhat bulky size to accommodate the vacuum unit requires an initial adjustment if you&#x27;re used to smaller units.  The nine-position trimming guard allows you to work down to the length you want and prevents accidental mess-ups.  This tool gets my most enthusiastic endorsement.</li>
            <li> There are a ton of reviews here, so no need to go into great detail about what everyone else mentions, but I&#x27;ll summarize anyway. It works very well, the battery life between charges is very good, it looks nice, and as many others write, it does a great job at vacuuming up trimmed hairs, even if a few escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My criticisms are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I wish the case that came with it were more compact, even form fitting. The one I received was basically a small pouch with a flap that seems almost like an afterthought design-wise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The power on button went off many times when traveling, due to the fairly sensitive button being flush with the shaver. This could be prevented if the button was recessed and/or there was a lock switch to lock the trimmer off completely when traveling. A few times, it accidentally turned on and started buzzing in my suitcase and caused a few stares, and even a few chuckles, if you know what I mean. A form-fitting case that has a space around the button would also help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. I agree with other reviewers: I wish this was designed so that the mini-trimmer attachment was on the other side of the head, so that there are no attachments at all. Perhaps this could be re-designed so that a simple switch (like on a reversible screwdriver) could switch back and forth between the beard trimmer and the mini attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I am very happy with this trimmer, but would purchase another one if they addressed the previously mentioned issues.</li>
            <li> This quality beard trimmer is excellent for catching beard hair and for making cleanup easy.  It also trims beards to desireable longer lengths well.    But, if you want a very close trim, like a two-day beard look, you must remove the adjustable head and make sure not to work from the bottom up.  That said, it then gives a fine two-day trim.      This trimmer does not need to be re-charged regularly or plugged in to maintain its charge.  That is a benefit.</li>
            <li> This shaver is the best I have ever purchased. It cuts evenly, has a long battery life, prevents a mess, and is sturdy. I would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> The T980 is ok.  It does trim your beard, although it does get all the hair, it does get some.  It is easy to maintain because it does not require any lubrication and the blades are forever sharp.  It is cumbersome to shave the hair right under your nose, I put on the attachment and trim the area manually.</li>
            <li> trims nice. the best part is its precision trimmer, gives you a very close trim. worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried several Trimmers but this one is really the best. It does the job for sure and it is simple and easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer alot except that this is the second one that I have had to buy cuz it keeps slipping out of my hand and breaking. I use it to shave my head not my beard so I have to move it around in my hands alot and it is too smooth and has no flat or grippy surfaces. This next one I plan on putting some rubber grip tape strips on it. If it was not for this I would give it a full 5 stars. It does the job it is supposed to do and vacuums good even without putting it in turbo.</li>
            <li> The power and trimming of this razor is fine. My issue is with the plastic cover that holds in your beard trimmings. Mine falls off easy, spilling the trimmings over the floor. Also the trimmings jam in the narrow vacuum slot. If you do something like take off the cover and bang out the razor over a trashcan, you will lose the filter in the trash can. I have adapted by trimming with my finger holding the cover on, and banging it out while holding onto the filter.</li>
            <li> I bought the T980 to replace a trusty T765 that had finally died after several years. Bad idea! The plastic hair chamber fell apart after just a few months. The length setting adjustment slips-- it doesn&#x27;t lock in place as advertised-- so I cut my beard shorter than I wanted to. And the turbo function doesn&#x27;t really help anyway; it drops a lot of whiskers. So I went back to the T765 and I&#x27;m glad I did-- fewer bells and whistles but it does the job!</li>
            <li> It trimmed without inflicting pain.  Thats the best I can say about this machine. The setting indicator is so small I need my reading glasses to insure I&#x27;ve got it right. Swiching to the sideburn/edge trimmer involves removing the adjustable guide, the trimmer head, and replacing with the edge trimming head.  Part alignment must be perfect of they don&#x27;t fit.  Replacing the guide comb requires precision as well.  A pop-up trimmer would have solved those problems.    The vacuum is gimmick that works more or less, but the recepticle can pop open without warning and dump lots of little trimmings everywhere.  The carrying case does not seal... just a velcro flap... so when packed, bristles can get spread around your suitcase.    I dropped it yesterday, and broke one of the trim heads.  I was unable to find replacement parts online, and I must say I was relieved to be forced to replace this unit with a better designed model.</li>
            <li> The T980 is well-balanced and easy to use. Some stray clippings \\&quot;escape\\&quot; even in turbo mode, but the vacuum captures enough to make it an easy cleanup.</li>
            <li> I found this to be a pretty decent trimmer. It, well, trims. Adjustments work, the vacuum option does a reasonably good job, and clean up is easy.    The detail tool is pretty darn small, not very practical for neck line cleanup.    My biggest problem is that the vacuum hair container broke after about 10 uses (the plastic shell snapped off the clip-in part of the container). Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:29484211]]I only review products that I use, enjoy, and want to advocate for; the T980 is one of these. It&#x27;s got a great design, from the curve of the device body, to the ease and access of the On/Off controls, and swap-able blade heads. Its height-adjustable, spring-loaded trimmer guide is the best yet.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for over 20 years and I can not believe that it took me this long to get a trimmer. I can see no fault with this product. It is easy to use, it takes less time to trim my beard, and the results are a consistent even trim every time.     I love the vacuum, as it eliminates almost all clean up after trimming my beard. A minor problem is that it too easy to hit the vacuum button while you are trimming your beard. Other than that, it is a great product.</li>
            <li> When my old beard trimmer conked out after a half dozen years, I wanted a nice new one. Not the clunker my wife had purchased for me six years ago that pulled hairs, kept my sink a mess, and looked cheap. So I typed in Google, \\&quot;What is the best beard trimmer?\\&quot; On two of three sites I checked, the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer was tops.     What sold me, was the video of one reviewer actually using the trimmer and explaining all of its functions and how to use it. As an aside, the Amazon reviews were helpful as well - so when I was shaving and turned the trimmer on its side, I was not surprised when hairs fell out of the vaccum trap.    That being said, the beard trimmer worked just as I had hoped. I look forward to taking time out once a week to trim my beard. The guard feels good against my skin and the hairs are all evenly cut. I haven&#x27;t had a pulled hair yet. The shaper works well, giving nice clean lines. And the vaccum works great with the beard trimmer and guard - 99% of hair winds up in the vaccum chamber. The pieces are easy to clean and adjust.    Negatives and these are minor andonly have to do with the vaccum. Mind you, if there was no vaccum my sink would be filled with black hairs, so having any type of vaccum is great. The negatives are: 1. if you turn your hand too far over, the hairs will start to spill out - that&#x27;s happened twice in the eight times I&#x27;ve used it so far. And it was only a little. 2. The vaccuum is realitively useless with the shaper as other reviewers have mentioned.    One other thing, where the beard meets my hairline just above the ear, I&#x27;ve found the guard obstructs the view a bit so it&#x27;s hard to see where to stop. It&#x27;s probably just a thing of practice and the length of my beard, but I figured I&#x27;d let everyone know where I find myself taking a little bit of time when shaving.    Definately a good buy. I look forward to beard trimming day.</li>
            <li> They (Norelco) wanted more to put new batteries in my Norelco 7500 trimmer then the cost of a new trimmer. Have to pop the beard head off and replace it with a mustache trimmer to do the same job the 7500 did all in one. Design going backwards. Stupid.</li>
            <li> I have tried several trimmer during the 20 years or so that I&#x27;ve been wearing a short beard. The T980 trimmer is so far the best trimmer I&#x27;ve used: it provides an even cut in difficult areas, it is light and not noisy, and the vaccum works better than in other models I tried. So far, I&#x27;m happy with this product.</li>
            <li> I first bought a 10 piece/change attachments/thin plastic trimmer.  I returned it in about 15 seconds.  I do not want to manage all of the attachments!  Then I bought this.    DIAL A LENGTH, turbo charged, and dual exhaust.  Hair today and gone tomorrow.  What a great product.  Don&#x27;t really need the vacuum however.   Ok its not dual exhaust but the rest is true.</li>
            <li> My husband has tried many beard trimmers and he says this is the best one ever.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a little over a year, and prior to this I&#x27;d been using a similar product by Norelco, so I came to love the vacuum concept.  This product does what you&#x27;d expect it to, and it does it well: Trim your beard (or hair, if you&#x27;re patient) and vacuum up the trimmings.  It doesn&#x27;t catch 100%, but it gets pretty close.  In general, it&#x27;s a worthwhile product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it is fair to mention one fatal flaw with this design:  the vacuum door hinge.  It is constructed of brittle plastic, and the hinge crumbled on me after 15 months of use.  I have since decided to try a non-vacuum product by Wahl.  If Norelco could change the design of the trimming area to eliminate the hinged door design -- say a small cup that you snap out and empty instead -- then this product would be flawless and guaranteed to last for years.  As it stands, I&#x27;m going to wait for this product to evolve a little further before purchasing from Norelco again -- unless a competitor comes up with an improved design first!</li>
            <li> excellent value for money great product and very quick delivery[[ASIN:B000FEF1V4 Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> After 6 plus years it was time to replace my old Wahl. I loved it, easy to cut the line and easy to switch the blade for a close up trim. My wife loved the vacum feature since it kept the sink a little cleaner. Over the years it just lost power and suction. Couldn&#x27;t find another Wahl with the vacum feature. This one is OK with good power and suction but awkward to use. Difficult to switch razer heads and the design makes it hard to see to cut a line. I  have trimmed my beard a number of times since 1975 and this one is just OK. If not for the great vacum not much better then the $19.99 trimer at CVS.</li>
            <li> I suppose I would still recommend this, but it&#x27;s not all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  It cuts well, but it doesn&#x27;t catch as much as it billed to.  In addition, I cannot ever use it in the non-turbo mode, otherwise, it won&#x27;t catch anything.    Still recommended though, it keeps it a lot cleaner than without, just a little disappointing...</li>
            <li> I have bought a lot of different trimmers before and I have always had a problem with clean up of the sink afterwards.  the fact that this trimmer had a built in vacuum was a deffinate bonus.      The trimmer itself works great, and the adjustable hights are easy to use.  It would be nice if the vacuum was more powerful and it was a bit quieter.</li>
            <li> This products till now ....has worked excellent..thanks to philips...all d other trimmer from other companies get problematic soon...but not philips...its vacuum power is good...though turbo power is there ...but even without cord when i used it...it doesnt needs that turbo power to cut a cm grown beard...dat means it is really a good trimmer..i would recommend to invest money in it..if u really want a quality over price....  the only problem i found is that it doesn&#x27;t gives you look like you have after doing a shave...which could be obtained by using other higher models of philips...so decide on that before buying if u need complete clean shave like look..go for higher philips models...but for the look given by this norelco...its not that bad...+ its ahead of all other brands selling there models at this same price range..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the same generic beard trimmer for 6 years now and it worked just fine but I decided to upgrade.  This product had good ratings so I gave it a try.  Overall it does an good job but the flaw lies in that it is super bulky and it isn&#x27;t good for close up trims.  What I mean by this is I have a goatee but because the trimmer is so large, it isn&#x27;t good for trimming the mustache area right above the lip.  For all other purposes and general grooming it is fine but the bulk is an issue for very detailed areas.</li>
            <li> Love this trimmer!!!  It does a very good job of vacuuming up the trimmings. It catches almost all of them. The battery on this trimmer is outstanding! It also has a turbo option, but is already powerful enough on its standard setting to do the job. Would make a great gift for any guy....  or hairy girl.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried them all in the 25 years that i have a beard and this is by far the best. Doesn&#x27;t,t pull or pinch like some do. Also, they improved the compartment that    Catches the hair with a little door that opens for easy disposal. Cuts evenly without a worry that you will make mistake! Like all, figure , in a few years you&#x27;ll be buying a new one due to wear and tear but if anything goes wrong Phillips is very honorable about replacing.</li>
            <li> Have used this trimmer for one month and was surprised at how well the trimmer and vacuum system work.  Catches most (98% or more) of the hair.  The adjustment system works quickly and easily.  If I was to nitpick I&#x27;d say the adjusment clicks for length of hair settings could be a little more positive.  There tends to be some slight creeping of the setting as you use it, although not enough to leave the general setting.  Overall a very solid performer and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> Trimmer works good.  Design includes a small sliding plastic guard which can be a problem when attempting to use the trimmer to &#x27;edge&#x27; a beard, mustache or sideburns.  Otherwise it works fine.</li>
            <li> This is by far the best beard trimmer I have ever owned.  I had a lessor model Noreloc for several years and recently \\&quot;upgraded\\&quot; to the T980 Turbo.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  It works exceptionally well and with one charge I have trimmed my beard 3 times!!  I love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 months now.  I checked for the same item in several retail stores (after I purchased, to compare price) but I was unable to find it.  The vacuum works surprisingly well but it&#x27;s best when you have the turbo button on.  Battery life seems pretty decent so far.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this product if you hate cleaning up all the stubble on the sink after ever time you shave.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s an ok trimmer, nothing bad per say, wish it had a bit more vacuum.  Very adaptable and easy to use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for quite a few months now and it has been great.  The vacuum, the rechargable batteries, the low noise.  Overall it is an outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Was looking online for a solid trimmer for detailing my goatee, and after much research settled on the Norelco T980 Turbo Vac Trimmer. Although I wasn&#x27;t interested in a vacuum trimmer I have to say that the vacuum works better than I thought it would and actually turned out to be a welcome benefit ie. no more extraneous hairs all over the sink. As far a detailed trimmer I find it very easy to use as it allows precision trimming lengths and the detail blade makes fine detailing a breeze. It even does a better job shaving my head than my Oster Turbo 111 electric razor. It&#x27;s build quality is solid and the battery charge lasts a long time. I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I just ordered a replacement after almost two years.  It has worked great the entire time, and I use it a lot.  Just through normal wear, it is time for a replacement, but I will keep my current one as a backup.    The fact that I don&#x27;t have to use oil is a big plus, and the vacuum feature saves a lot on cleanup.</li>
            <li> Having used trimmers without the vacuum feature, you get a lot of clippings all over the place.  With this unit, you don&#x27;t have the mess.  Yes, there will be a few that don&#x27;t make it in, but by far, most of them get sucked into the chamber.    The only thing that I don&#x27;t like as much as an older model of this trimmer that I had is that it has a hinged door to remove the clippings from the trimmer.  The older model had a removable tray.  The tray was much easier to clean out thoroughly.      I&#x27;m still very happy with this unit, but I think the newer method of clipping removal is not as good as the older unit.</li>
            <li> I have had this item for almost three months now, and I am quite happy with it.  Noting some of the issues in other reviews, I would have to add:    - The battery is adequate.  I use it every five days or so, and it holds a charge for close to a month.    - I have a close cropped beard, and keep it that way using level 3.  Setting it to levels 2 or 1 will give you the \\&quot;couple of days growth\\&quot; look.    - The vacuum picks up more than 90% of the clippings, leaving the bathroom sink nearly hair free.  I suspect that buyers who are having trouble with this feature have longer beards, and longer hairs might not be caught as easily.    The razor does everything I wanted it to do, and I would purchase it again.</li>
            <li> I love the way my boyfriend looks a day or two after shaving, so after doing some research I found this razor.  After using this, he has that sexy \\&quot;scruffy\\&quot; but manicured look.  He&#x27;s never owned an electric razor before, but he enjoys using this.  He says it&#x27;s easy and comfortable-doesn&#x27;t pull or hurt at all.  And now he doesn&#x27;t have to shave the old-fashioned way any more!</li>
            <li> It is OK. It does its job. You need time to become more accustomed with it. You need to pass it a couple of times until the surface is really even. But eventually you receive what you wanted. I tried to use this device for other parts of the body and it works. Of course you should be more careful. It can be easily dismantled for cleaning or razor head exchange and assembled again. The cleaning is not very easy, probably because of the brush. The vacuum collects up to 95% of the cut hairs and the rest should be collected manually, but, I think, it is still worth. A battery keeps its charge very well and a recharge process is easy and quick. It is very helpful too that it can be used with a cord power supply. I do not have an experience with other trimmers and cannot compare it.</li>
            <li> I had a previous model of this trimmer and loved it.  This one is just as good.</li>
            <li> Have been using the T980 for about a month and it works very well. This is my second beard trimmer in about 10 years and don&#x27;t often grow a beard so I&#x27;m not an expert but do think the T980 works fine to very well. The only complaint I can think of is that I&#x27;d prefer finer granularity between settings, meaning I&#x27;d like to be able to trim at number 3 and 1/2 (3 is a bit too short for my linking, 4 a bit too long). It&#x27;s minor; I&#x27;m getting used to #3. Battery life seems fine, haven&#x27;t needed to charge it since the initial charging.  A good trimmer for the $.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this for like a week now and my first time using it I was FREAKEN amazed. I had a crappy old vacuum beard trimmer by Remmington that I replaced because It would never trim evenly, even if I really really tried, I&#x27;d always end up with a bald spot on my chinstrap haha. I actually finally dropped it one day and bent one of the plastic trimming guides so I said to hell with this damn thing!    I always trimmed in a downward fashion with my old one because if I went up it would reduce it to stubble even with the right length setting. So I busted this beast out set it to 4 turned it on and put it on turbo (sorry I&#x27;m a sucker for a things that say turbo hah)! The trimming head actually bends to the contours of your face and trims every single hair to the same height when shaving upward. Now my chinstrap no longer looks patchy it&#x27;s just full and even, don&#x27;t waste your time with scissors or a \\&quot;bunk\\&quot; trimmer, get this one! I didn&#x27;t have a giant beard for my first shave but I&#x27;m sure this thing can get through the narliest of beards...not that you would ever wanna shave a good beard off. So for the beard lover and facial hair perfectionist, this thing does an A+++ job!     Just for review integrity I personally did not purchase this, my mother purchased it for me as a gift! :)  She, and the girlfriend loved the difference.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a joke.  I purchased it to replace an older Norelco for my husband.  The vacuum does catch some of the hair but there is still hair all over him and the bathroom after he has used it.  He doesn&#x27;t like the feel of it and he finds it difficult to get an even trim.    Worse, the plastic guard broke off after six months    The only good thing I have to say about this trimmer is it holds a charge for seemingly forever.      Purchase a different trimmer, this one is not as good as you hope it will be.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money.  Intuitive controls.  Makes trimming beard easy.  Has a useful attachment for shaping beard.</li>
            <li> Trimming - It always leaves some stubborn hairs which do not get trimmed, especially if the beard is a bit longer.  Vacuum - not good enough still I have the mess to clean afterward.</li>
            <li> Yep - this thing is awesome... The zero feature makes it look like you shaved that morning and the stubble has just barely started to grow in, and if you wanted to be completely hairless maybe you should have asked to have been born a woman.  The battery lasts for weeks and the vacuum, though loud, is EXTREMELY effective.  The decibel level of the vacuum should not bother any red blooded man who enjoys going to sporting events and screaming at the top of his lungs, or watching a dragster blast down a quarter mile in 4 seconds.  This thing could chisel the beard off of Chuck Norris AND Rosie O&#x27;donnel in one charge!</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco trimmer for years, and it worked quite well.  When it finally died, I bought this as a replacement.  What a disappointment!  The cover over the blade is either too thick, or poorly placed. Either way, the result is that no matter how close a trim I want -- that is, no matter what the number on trim closeness I use -- I get a mediocre result. It doesn&#x27;t go close enough -- not nearly close enough. I wind up having to take off that cover, which makes it really hard to get an even trim.  Very disappointing, especially after years of satisfaction with a trimmer from the same company.</li>
            <li> This is a replacement for the same trimmer I had for 6yrs thst  finally wouldn&#x27;t vaccum the hair anymore. I love that feature as my beard is grey and tough. It also trims at different lengths an can trim quite close to define the beard.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I like the close cut this provides for my beard.  Works great and the clipper does a pretty good job of collecting most of the trimmings.  Makes for an easier cleanup.      The battery is much better than the model I used to own.</li>
            <li> I keep my hair very short and this trimmer works very well.  It saves me from using a barber.  The vacuum helps contain the hairs.</li>
            <li> The Norelco T980 is easy to use, the turbo vacuum keeps it clean and hairs don&#x27;t fly all over the place.  The swing door on the collector is easy to clean.  Like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I was going to buy a Wahl trimmer as that is what I have been useing for years...it was a great trimmer...adjustable length long battery life..When it died on me I thought \\&quot;well\\&quot; I&#x27;ll just get a new Wahl..the problem was they didnt make the one I have any more...thats when I thought I would make a change to see what else is out there..I looked on the web for 2 days trying to figure out what would be my next purchase...my beard got longer and didnt want to make the wrong choice...I read all the articles, reviews and then this trimmer was in front of me...never thought of getting one with a vaccuum on it...seemed simple enough just to wash the mess down the sink..and off the sink..and shake out my shirt and ...well you get the point..just didnt think that the vaccuum would be that good since it was cordless...it was really a surprise when I got it ..it got all but two little hairs the first time out..and the rest is history..it has all the options I want  plus the vaccuum..If I ever have a complaint on this trimmer I will repost or add if possible to this review...but I like my choice and have no regrets..             PROS: works great, vaccuum is a plus, have not recharged it since I got  it.          CONS: none, yet.    UPDATE:  well its sept 26 and all is well..I have not had to recharge this trimmer since I bought it. I still have no problems with it. it took a trim or two to get used to the new settings from my old trimmer but what dont you have to get used to when you change brands. I read a few articles from other users saying they had hair all over the place when they used it. they either look like grizzly adams and try to mow the whole thing at once or? I cut from the bottom of my face going up and never had more than a few hairs that didnt get in the vaccuum. It might depend on your style of cutting,havnt tried from the top down to see if the vaccuum gets it all. thats not my style of trimming. In my book its perfect..do you know why things are not always perfect because everybody has their own opinion. I hope this helps you in any way..Lyndon</li>
            <li> Only had it short while, but so far it has proved simple and easy to use. Its exactly what i was looking for</li>
            <li> * No longer need to spread out sheets of paper to catch the falling beard hair. What little the vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch is easily wiped with a sponge.  * Charge lasts a long time.  * Trims well. No complaints.</li>
            <li> easy to use and clean. lives up to hype except it isn&#x27;t perfect at keeping beard in excellent trim. safety scissors still helpful.</li>
            <li> So I said to the woman I can either get the 15$ beard trimmer or one that is more expensive but is supposed to have a vacuum in it.  I got the T980 and I&#x27;m really really impressed.  I trimmed the Fuzz and it made no mess whatsoever.  Amazing!</li>
            <li> This trimmer is great. I&#x27;ve been multiple Norelco trimmers over the past 7 years. This trimmer, however, is the best one I&#x27;ve had yet. The vacuum feature keeps the sink area clean and the turbo feature speeds up trim time. No complaints thus far!</li>
            <li> It came with a sealed pakage. Well it leaves u goat-t clean and fresh looking.   It doesn&#x27;t capture the whole hairs but it doesnt leave you with a whole lot of mess.</li>
            <li> this is the best of it&#x27;s class. Precise, Reliable, long lasting battery, no mess with the hairs due to the vacuum. I can just recommend to but it</li>
            <li> Like many of the reviewers here, I was actually seeking an overall body hair trimmer when I came across the Norelco T980. After several months of continuous use (as a body hair trimmer), I have not been disappointed. Here are some of the highlights:    * The blades remain sharp, never requiring further sharpening, nor rinsing or oiling. The blades have also never pulled any hairs, making for a pain-free trim  * The vacuum component works really well to collect and house the trimmings, keeping the bathroom sink free of stray hairs  * Ease of use to change through nine different blade lengths, without needing to swap for extra components   * Turbo button to boost the speed of the blades is a nice feature  * Sideburn accessory is very handy for keeping the &#x27;burns neatly trimmed  * The internal battery holds a charge for a remarkably long time  * Travel pouch and charger make for an easy-to-travel-with item    Keep in mind that if your intended use is for a body hair trimmer, the Norelco T980 does not shave the skin completely smooth -- as that is not in its intended design. But if you are seeking a trimmer to crop and maintain body hair, especially facial hair, this is an ideal tool to have.</li>
            <li> Not much to complain about, really. Reviews were mostly positive and I agree. The one thing I will say is the vacuum is not quite as good as reviews said.     I was led to believe 90% of the hair would be collected and not end up all over the place, but it is more like 60% of the hair is captured, and quite a bit still ends up all over the sink. Other than that, fantastic.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the vacuum feature, but it actually works quite well, capturing nearly all of the clippings.  Naturally, a few veer off at odd angles.  It has very good blades, too.  I think the guide/comb part could be better.  I don&#x27;t really see that the spring and hinge arrangement is very useful, and without it the trimmer might be less bulky and feel more secure.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
            <li> Works great! This replaces my old Norelco trimmer of 5 years. Gets most of the clippings making cleanup a breeze.</li>
            <li> After due diligence shopping online and local stores I decided to go with my second Norelco beard trimmer.  This is a slight upgrade to my last model which I gave away due to the battery barely holding a charge.  It was fine, but this one operates a little smoother and catches shaved whiskers better for me (a surprising plus).  Can&#x27;t think of anything else I&#x27;d really want in a beard trimmer.  This one does it for me, after several weeks of use I&#x27;d buy it again.  I feel I have definitely gotten my money&#x27;s worth.  Hope the battery holds out (the last one worked well about 3 years).</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well. The dial adjust for the length setting is great.  The smaller clipper is a nice size for trimming areas around your nose and lip.  The vacuum function sucks up about 75% of the clippings so don&#x27;t think that you will have zero mess.</li>
            <li> This model is easier to use and much more substantial with a longer lasting battery than a competing model I bought several years ago.  I had been holding the length guard the wrong way, and it had seemed rather slow trimming. Once I figured out how to use it properly, however, it worked fast to trim my beard and mustache.  The hair vacuum capability is a nice plus.</li>
            <li> I have used this a few times and it has worked very well.  The cutting blades do seem to get jammed up with cut hair but maybe I let it grow too long for proper use.  I still found a mess in the sink after using it on my beard, irregardless of what they advertise.  I would recommend this unit.</li>
            <li> My husband is returning his Phlips Norelco beard trimmer because it leaves his beard shaggy and the trimmer doesn&#x27;t make a neat, tidy line.  He feels he does a better job with his old, non-electric razor and a sharp pair of scissors.</li>
            <li> www.missionvalleytowing.com</li>
            <li> Really like this trimmer - it&#x27;s easy to adjust, collects all of the hair cuttings, and is easy to clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for just over a year, have taken it on several business trips, and it has seem me through a beard and a goatee. That being said, it works wonderfully, trims my facial hair nicely, and is easy to use.    A good buy.</li>
            <li> I was pretty disappointed when I found out that this shaver WILL NOT cut short hair, it has to be at least 1/4 inch or so before the blades can pick it up. That was a deal breaker for me.</li>
            <li> I thought the vacuum feature on beard trimmers was a gimmick, but I figured I should give it a try. Turns out I was wrong. This thing actually works really well. My girlfriend is happy that there isn&#x27;t hair all over the place anymore, and I&#x27;m happy that I don&#x27;t have to clean up (and apparently leave a lot behind, as my girlfriend likes to point out) hair scattered around the bathroom.    The other reviews are right about the turbo mode, though. It is both necessary to catch most of the hair and very loud.</li>
            <li> I went to this after using a Braun Cruzer which had a trimmer attachment which was MUCH closer, but unfortunately broke after I stupidly put it in my checked luggage during a transatlantic flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to get this Norelco for its vac feature because with the Braun, it was kind of a pain to clean up all the little hairs on the sink after each use.  The vac feature works well, gets about 95% of the whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main drawback with the Norelco however is that with the adjustable guard off, it doesn&#x27;t provide nearly as close a trim as the Braun.  I confirmed this by looking closely at both products&#x27; trimmer blades.  The distance between the stationary and the moving blade on the Braun was maybe 1mm; on this Norelco T980, it was more like 3mm.  So if you&#x27;re buying this trimmer in order to cultivate a stubble look, be aware that with the T980 you&#x27;ll have to use it more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum intake vent makes it a bit harder to maneuver the trimmer as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another annoyance is that it doesn&#x27;t get the occasional whisker that lies almost flat to the skin without repeated passes.  This is probably the result of the aforementioned greater distance between the edge of the stationary and moving blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, this has been my main disappointment with this product.  To get a closer shave, I had to use the smaller mini-trimmer attachment which unfortunately doesn&#x27;t work as well with the vacuum, so a lot more hairs were all over my sink.  Plus was a bit uncomfortable in that sometimes it would catch on my skin more than the normal sized trimmer attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Norelco is also bulkier and less ergonomic than the Braun, but I guess that&#x27;s the price of having the vac feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh, if only Braun would make the same trimmer with a vacuum function!  I&#x27;d snap that baby up in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or maybe the truth is that *I* am paying a high price for my laziness regarding cleaning up post-shave whiskers off the sink myself, vs. having a lower-quality trimmer with a vac function.  LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 and 1/2 stars.r with a vac function.  LOL    3 and 1/2 stars.</li>
            <li> Very nice product.  Cuts well and vacuum works great.  There&#x27;s never a mess to clean up!  Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Its really a perfect trimmer... Specially for the cost. Only negative point is \\&quot;not easy to cut long hair\\&quot; ...   Charger also compatible for both 110v and 240v Outputs. Thats also an advantage, But they are not mentioning that anywhere. I also bought with a doubt on that.  Battery life also satisfied and inline with their description.  Its a great experience to use a \\&quot;Philips Norelco T980 Vacuum Trimmer\\&quot;  Thanks for the affordable great product....</li>
            <li> He had one for home, needed one for vacation home. He swears by it. Had to have this model.</li>
            <li> I have pressed hard on the guard on this and it has never dropped from the 4 or 5 I keep it at.  Since I got this 2 months ago I have charged it once, and use it every 2 days.  Fantastic.  The vacuum is decent, but won&#x27;t keep the occasional stray hair from hitting the counter.</li>
            <li> I love these - easy to use, quality cut, holds a charge for months, less mess that most.  I owuld recommend them to everyone.</li>
            <li> Overall the trimmer works well on my beard. The vacuum captures most (but not all) of the hair trimmings, it has a wide range of length settings, and battery holds a charge for a long enough time that it has never been a bother. However, there are some weaknesses. It is somewhat large (not the best for travel) and it has trouble with hair along the curve of my jawline and on the thinner, softer hair on my cheek. I do usually have to follow up with scissors to get a even cut. Also, it does not have numbered markings on the length settings, making it harder to reset the device to my preference if it gets out of adjustment.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this trimmer after going through many bargain basement off the shelf beard trimmers. Uneven cuts, poor battery life, hair spraying in all directions, all of you bearded gentlemen out there know the drill. This time I did a little research and got the Phillips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer. The variable height cutting guard works well and the battery easily lasts a month on a charge for me. The vacuum works well in sucking up 95% of the trimmings and is easily cleaned. So far, the only issue is that the power control is a bit too easily activated when you are holding the unit in your hand, meaning that you can change your grip while trimming and accidentally turn the thing off. Also the power and turbo buttons are somewhat confusingly placed for my taste. What looks like a power button is the turbo button, so at first I picked the thing up and was stabbing at what I thought was the power button, and nothing was happening! I shifted my grip to look at the button at a different angle and, you guessed it, accidentally turned it on. Overall, a great trimmer, just watch you don&#x27;t push the power switch too much!</li>
            <li> I have had several trimmers over the years, and while I&#x27;m still using this after 9 months, it isn&#x27;t what I was hoping for.  My biggest issues are as follows...  The beard setting that determines the length of the beard can shift unknowingly to a shorter length as the trimmer is pressed to the face.  Also this unit cannot trim the area of the mustache just beneath the nostrils - I still need to use scissors.  Finally, it is not easy to remove the beard length piece to perform a close trim right above the lip.  I would not recommend this and I am only leaving this review as I am on Amazon looking for a new one.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t vacuum up all the hair, but makes the overall cleaner process.  Fits well in hand.  Cuts well. Simple to use.</li>
            <li> For 5 years, I had an older Norelco model which still worked, but I was in need of an upgrade.  This newer model, the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo, is awesome.  The head is easily manipulated for different cutting lengths, as well as be removed for the fine trimmer.  There is also a \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button for extra power in cutting.  For someone with a beard like me, it&#x27;s an essential.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great. In fact, this is the first vacuum trimmer I have had that will catch almost every hair- I recommend pushing the turbo button to do so.  I haven&#x27;t had it long enought to speak for the longevity, but would definitely have to recommend it based on the experience I have had.  I will agree with other reviews that it and its carrying case are a little bigger than I had hoped for the sake of portability, but I can get past that.</li>
            <li> This is without a doubt the best trimmer that I have ever owned. It gives a really neat trim and can get places with the additional smaller clipper than other trimmers I have used. It also has many more length adjustments than most trimmers.  I always find that other trimmers were just a bit too long or too short in trim height.  The trim length also locks in so you can&#x27;t accidentally trim in a different length. There are just a very few misses on this product for me though.  The door that holds the trimmed hair is a little delicate in my opinion and I&#x27;m always afraid I will break it. There is a little netted pouch inside the case that stuff gets caught in too.  If and when this trimmer gives out, I will replace it with the same model.</li>
            <li> The extra power this trimmer delivers over comparable models is excellent.  For the extra 10 dollars this one costs, it is definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using beard trimmers for almost 30 years. This is the best so far. Light, powerful and very smooth. I had the prior version which was good, but not as good. I was surprised how much better this version is. The vacuum is much better, the alternate head for detailed trimming is easy to change back and forth, and the ability to use it plugged in is a big plus. The prior version could only be used in battery mode, and when the batteries wouldn&#x27;t recharge after a couple years there was nothing to do but tear it open, recycle the batteries and throw the rest away (the batteries were soldered, so I couldn&#x27;t just replace them). Norelco does recommend running the battery until the charge light comes on, and then recharging it (probably NiCad batteries), but this is no problem if you can use while charging. It also charges quickly and indicates when the charging is finished.&lt;br /&gt;I shopped around, and Amazon&#x27;s price (when I bought it) was the best around, online or in stores.</li>
            <li> I have tried a few different options for trying to trim up my beard.  Finally I found one that is not cheap and offers a great trim.  Not only that but it reduces the clippings in the bottom of the sick by about 85% which means less clean up.  It&#x27;s great for a 5 &#x27;o&#x27; clock shadow, but also nice for longer lengths.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll use anything else.</li>
            <li> very useful and durable</li>
            <li> the trimmer works well my only complaints are:    -getting the adjustable whisker guard in its track and correctly in place is difficult    -even on turbo mode some trimmed hair escapes the capture chamber    otherwise it works well, seldom needs recharging and does its job relatively quickly</li>
            <li> As an Afican American man I needed something to shave at a stubble level to avoid in-grown hairs. This, on setting 1, does the trick. And the vacuum feature cuts down on cleanup!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco beard and mustache for years but after a ciuple of months this one would start without even touching it, The on-off button became defective. I would pay alittle more for a better quality trimer.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a good and reliable product. It trims beard and mustach well and is free of any defects or annoying inconveniences. I have been using Norelco Trimmers for the past 30 years and I could say that the Norelco T980 is among the best so far.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a beard for 15 years, and have tried everything from full sized Oster clippers to a variety of trimmers. None compare to this item. This makes facial hair maintenance a snap. The built-in vacuum keeps the trimmings in a chamber and not all over the vanity. Can&#x27;t recommend this highly enough.</li>
            <li> Main downsides: Made in China and has non replaceable battery, no removable hair chamber-only small door opens and have to shake whole trimmer over garbage can to get hair out.    Pros: Locks guide into place much better, more comfortable to use, turbo mode cuts longer beards a little better and gets more of cut hair into holding chamber- though by no means all of the hair gets collected, seems better built all around vs older version, travel case is nice enough and has slightly better instructions on use and maintenence of product.    All in all a good buy overall and a great value, though I&#x27;d happily pay $20 more if made moslty if not entirely in USA</li>
            <li> We have recently purchased our third of these trimmers for the third male in our family- all three guys love it!</li>
            <li> Has a faulty latch on the hair compartment door. A year or so ago they replaced it at no charge but it just broke again.</li>
            <li> Until recently, I had been using a Remington beard trimmer I had received as a Christmas gift from about 5 years ago. The Remington was good but it eventually just couldn&#x27;t go any longer so I had to search for a new trimmer. I found the Phillips Norelco T980 fairly quickly and was impressed by the good reviews. And it didn&#x27;t disappoint!    The shipment came quick and I got to test it out (waited an hour for it to fully charge) to see how it would perform and perform it did! The shaver comes with 9 different preset trimming sizes so there is plenty of room for dynamic trimming. The flexible trim guard was something I immediately noticed and enjoyed, since my previous trimmer did not have this feature. In addition the flexibility really does allow you to get a precision trim really easily as it contours to the face great.    The T980 comes with a 2 bristle (one soft, one hard) brush for cleaning out the clippers but what really is unique about this trimmer is the vacuum that is attached to it. The vacuum is made so that there is less of a clean up once your done trimming your beard, although it doesn&#x27;t catch all the trimmings it did catch most of them and clean up was much faster than what I am used too. It also comes with a smaller clipper attachment for precision sculpting or just your run of the mill mustache trimming which is slid on and off with ease.    The shaver also comes with a Turbo Mode but the only thing this really does that I have noticed is give the vacuum more power, it may also speed up the clippers but I am not sure about that it seems to clip nicely whether the Turbo Mode is on or off. I think because of the vacuum this trimmer seems a bit louder during operation than my last trimmer but by no means is it a chainsaw (haha).    Finally, the trimmer comes with a travel bag for easy storage on trips which I thought was thoughtful. The only qualm I had was the packaging...it comes in a really sturdy clam shell package and with no helpful opening tabs so it could take you at least a few minutes to get everything out without cutting yourself on sharp plastic edges but since that has nothing to do with the performance of the trimmer I wont go on about that.    So all in all, this trimmer is a fine replacement; dare I say upgrade to my last trimmer, it is said, \\&quot;You get what you pay for\\&quot; well, with the Norelco T980 I think you may be getting that and then some! Precision trimming, ease of use, and convenient clean up and features makes this shaver a must buy for any man especially those on the job hunt!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the past couple of years and just love it. It has a superb cut &amp; a nice vacuum for the droppings.</li>
            <li> This Product works great,much better than other bands i own. The battery holds charge for multible uses&amp; this product has the option of using the cord supplied. The turbo vacuum is a great feature,tho it still allows some hair to fall. This apears to be a well made product&amp; i would recomend to anyone looking for a trimmer in this price range</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco T980 is a very good beard and hair trimmer.  The motor is strong, giving a very even cut.  The vacuum function works very well capturing the clippings easily.  The only negative is that the cutting blade is inset too far into the head making it very difficult to trim close to the nose.  Lip, chin, and jaw are no problem, but the area just under the nose has to have special attention with scissors.</li>
            <li> My son appreciated the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer! He said it makes grooming his beard a lot easier.</li>
            <li> Received this trimmer and went right to the instruction book.  (I learned to check this out first)  Don&#x27;t recharge this NiCad Battery unless its totally discharged because you will damage the battery by recharging every time you use it and don&#x27;t leave it plugged in either.  Just charge it when it quits that is all!!  Took a little looking to find the rotating ring that sets the height (or depth) of the hair but it works fine. I found that I look better if I use two heights for different areas.  I like the two speed and I Love the vacuum for not leaving hair everywhere.  After using it I can&#x27;t imagine using anything that does not clean up after itself (vacuum that is)  I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> What can I say, it cuts my hair well. I like it. I agree with all the other reviews so I won&#x27;t say it again but it&#x27;s legit.    A++ WOULD BUY AGAIN!!!</li>
            <li> Had this trimmer for 2 years and it died last week after sliding into the bathroom sink under running water....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it was working it was a good trimmer overall, though I really didn&#x27;t like have to switch out the trimmer heads for the standard and then the detail sized cutters--on more than one occasion I was in a hurry and fumbling around looking for the other cutter assembly than what was on the trimmer. Another issue was that it was relatively easy to move the height adjustment by accident when taking off and replacing the plastic trimmer guard, which you need to do in order to switch cutting heads. It wasn&#x27;t a really big deal, but a lot of times I wouldn&#x27;t remember which number I had the hair length set on, and then I would have to guess what setting I had it one the last time I used it.....The vacuum feature was nice I guess in that it doesn&#x27;t get too many little beard trimmings all over the sink, but then again it&#x27;s really easy to just turn on the sink and rinse it, or, use the trimmer over a rug where you&#x27;ll never see the small trimmings.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the big lesson here is to be sure buy a wet/dry beard trimmer that won&#x27;t die if it gets a little wet. I just bought the Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer [[ASIN:B000F4USF8 Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer (Silver)]] which was almost half the price of the Phillips Norelco unit and it&#x27;s a wet/dry trimmer that you can use in the shower. It also has a built-in detail trimmer so you don&#x27;t have to switch cutter heads and worry about loosing attachments. When I went to replace the T980 that died, I avoided the latest Phillips/Norelco version because I think a wet/dry is beard trimmer is really the only way to go. So far I really like the Panasonic, and I wish I had bought one of these to start with.......</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for a long time. Still works well and does the job as I want it to.  I&#x27;m constantly changing the look of my facial hair and this keeps it going.  I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a newer one by now, but  like this one still.  I believe I&#x27;ve had it over 5 years now.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always heard that Norelco is the best, but the T980 turbo vacuum trimmer is a little disappointing.  It doesn&#x27;t cut any closer than my piece-of-$#%&amp; Remington trimmer (I think the stubble is actually a bit longer) though it is much MUCH faster and more comfortable to use.  The vacuum is a nice feature, it simplifies cleanup.  The guide comb is almost a necessity, this is the only electric trimmer I&#x27;ve managed to cut myself with.  Overall, not a bad trimmer if you don&#x27;t expect the impossible of it...the close shave of a razor with the convenience of an electric.</li>
            <li> Of the trimmers I have used (have been through several brands), this one does a good job for the price.  The vacuum does help reduce the cleanup, so that is helpful.  It holds its charge well and gives sufficient warning when it is time to charge the unit.    All beards are a bit different and this shave has a problem with the hairs just below my jawline.  The hairs generally grow up toward the ear and this thing, on \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; or not cannot cut them.  With some success, I use a lower trim level, but generally, I need to do dangerous manual cleanup with the edger attachment.    For my beard, at this price, I accept the extra work but will consider a different model/brand when it is time to buy another.</li>
            <li> The packaging was extremly difficult to open....but overall the shaver is good quality and works great!</li>
            <li> Not too bad but could be better.  Instructions stink.  Haven&#x27;t owned it long so maybe it will get better with age.</li>
            <li> This is my first beard (mustaches aplenty over the years before now), and I used the reviews here to select a beard trimmer. It&#x27;s a decent product for the price and seems to work well.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband, who&#x27;s very picky about his shavers and trimmers. The last one we had was a Wahl and he was pretty adamant about getting the exact same trimmer but it was discontinued. I settled on getting him this Norelco trimmer because of the vacuum feature, something he really liked in the Wahl. He does really like it. The vacuum suction works great and there&#x27;s little residue hairs that are left on my bathroom counter, something I really like. The power is good too. The only thing about this trimmer is that it&#x27;s bigger, pretty significantly, compared to the Wahl. That&#x27;s why I gave it four stars instead of five. Overall, as long as it works well, he shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. He likes it.</li>
            <li> Really wonderful trimmer, works plugged in or on battery.  I would highly recommend this shaver.</li>
            <li> This is my story of how I came to possess quite possibly the greatest trimmer known to man:    I did a Google search for \\&quot;top trimmer.\\&quot;    I found a website that recommended this trimmer.    I went to Amazon and watched the guy who posted the video review of the trimmer.    I purchased the trimmer.    I used the trimmer.    I fell in love.    Thank you Philip Norelco.  You&#x27;ve made me a sexier man.</li>
            <li> I have been using this trimmer for about 18 months now and it still works great.  I haen&#x27;t had any issues and would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> It is good for facial hair,wont recommend for your body hair, the vacuum tube clogs up really easy.</li>
            <li> Workd great for me - I use the Norelcon to avoid having to have a \\&quot;clean shave\\&quot; every day -  I call it the \\&quot;Festus Look  - he was a character on The TV show Gunsmoke that never had a beard but also was never clean shaven - so I set my Noreelcon toi #3 and get a beard that is about 1/4 inch everwhere.   I do not use it to trim a \\&quot;real\\&quot; beard so cannot commit on its use for this prupose.</li>
            <li> I have used various trimmers but this is the best i have ever used. I am a very happy and satisfied customer. I read some reviews before buying it and I am glad I made the right decision. Although there were some negative reviews about the trimmer not functioning properly or leaving a mess unless you start the turbo mode but I never saw that happening with me. I have been using the normal mode and it just works fine, no mess over my sink, only a little bit here and there and i understand this is not a vacuum cleaner, its a trimmer and as a matter of fact i dont even use turbo mode, its just not required.  for trimming quality, i read someone saying it can&#x27;t hold the levels and slides down to 1 if you apply even a little pressure but its all wrong, probably they don&#x27;t know how to use a trimmer correctly. Just to check this, I deliberately applied enough pressure on levels 2 and 3, hard enough to punch my face with it but the trimmer stayed at the selected level, did  not slid down to 1, probably i was not hammering it into my face as other guys did, lol.  one charging gives me 2 weeks easily, now the deal is, i dont have full beard, i use it to trim my french beard and sometimes use it on armpits but anyways this is not something one should be worrying about since I can use it while its charging and plugged in.  finally, the smaller attachment it comes with, I just love that one, thank god someone thought about creating it, it helps me alot giving shape to my beard and maintaining the length of hair. If I see a couple of strands growing too big, i can use it and I dont have to risk it with the long 2 inch trimmer blades i have used earlier.  overall, i am satisfied to the core. its a 5 on 5 from my side.</li>
            <li> The device works pretty good. I use it to just keep my beard under control.  The vacuum wasn&#x27;t as good as I expected, since it still misses a few hairs.  The carrying case is pretty useful    for the price its worth it</li>
            <li> The Norelco Turbo Trimmer is great.  My only problem is that when I try to trim my stash straight along my lip a little piece of plastic associated with the vacuum mechanism gets in the way.  Otherwise it does a great job.</li>
            <li> I tried this trimmer right away when I received it and it works great.  The vaccume feature is really nice.  It also comes with different size removable heads that makes the fine trimming a breeze.  You can set it to whatever height you want and your beard always looks the same without the chance of error.  I would recommend this item to anyone.</li>
            <li> Most men do not know how to trim their beard.....That said, this is the device for you. Its cool, it works, and its simple.......I have never had this trimmer jump to a different setting.  I use this for cutting off my hair........Kick it up to turbo..It screams.  Don&#x27;t expect it to vacuum all........Small container for hair.........  I have spent many $$ looking for the right trimmer...........This is it.</li>
            <li> The seller shipped fast and was great.  It is fine although it does not have a stand.  This would be really nice if it had came with the stand but if you do not mind not having the stand then I am sure you will find this trimmer just find for your needs.  Keep in mind it was recieved on Dec 25 and it is Dec 30.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an older Norelco trimmer for my husband and this one is much better. It vacuums the hairs better. The guide is much sturdier and it doesn&#x27;t poke him like the older trimmer. This one is also very quiet. My husband is very satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Husband loved it. I love it because it&#x27;s a lot quieter than his old one</li>
            <li> My husband had one of these and our son uses it all the time, so I wanted to get him his own for Christmas.  Timely delivery and just what I wanted (couldn&#x27;t find in stores anywhere).</li>
            <li> I had never retained facial hair in the past.  I have no other product to compare, but can&#x27;t imagine finding another that would do the job better.  After finding the setting best for me it has been consistent in cutting.  It is easy to clean, and I appreciate that the hair is captured for disposal rather than covering the sink.  It exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> This was bought for our son as a gift.  He has only used it a few times but he likes it now.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works great.  I especially like the adjustable settings that are easy to change.  Would highly recommend.  The turbo vac feature is wonderful and eliminates the clippings fro going everywhere.</li>
            <li> I must say that I disagree with most reviewers on this product.  I have several problems with the design which I would like to share.      First, a disclaimer.  The product title says that it is a hair \\&quot;trimmer\\&quot; and not a \\&quot;clipper\\&quot;.  Perhaps I did not see the distinction at first, but I see that others purchase this unit as a clipper as well.  So, as a trimmer (used very frequently and with very short hair trimmings) this unit may work for you.  But even as a trimmer, if the hair is cut at any length (and there are 9 settings to the guide), this thing is useless.    First, the \\&quot;on\\&quot; and \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; buttons are too easy to push while handling, and I&#x27;m constantly startling myself with the turbo setting (it is a little loud).  Also, I find that the guide/vacuum design is poor.  This may work OK if you are trimming short guide settings, but if you get a clump of hair in the guide, which happens constantly with me, it will block the tiny opening for the hair cup.  The vacuum is not strong enough to pull the hair in, and it clogs the whole works.  If you do not notice this, the blockage will prevent the trimmer from trimming, and you may think that a lower guide setting is needed.  You can see how this sets you up for a scalp job when the low guide setting is finally low enough to make a cut.  I just find the whole set up \\&quot;gimmicky\\&quot; and I will take the old standard guides and no vacuum any day.    It does have a strong battery and if you are just lightly trimming a mustache or a beard, it may be the right choice for you.  I think people like me would not be disappointed (and would not have purchased the product) if it had been called the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Beard and Mustache Vacuum Trimmer.  Long title, but descriptive enough to avoid purchasing the wrong product.</li>
            <li> I purchased the T980 after my old Norelco died and I found they no longer made it.  The T980 does as good a job as my old one with one exception-the safety shield makes it a little more difficult to trim the edge of my mustache.  Other than that it is a great trimmer.  It would have been nice if it had come with a charging base rather that a cord but the charge lasts so long it really isn&#x27;t a problem.  I highly recommend this trimmer for both it&#x27;s performance and very reasonable cost.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works well, i always use it on turbo mode just because it cuts and sucks more hair. i will note that if you are cutting off a lot of long beard hair it will miss more than if you do it regularly and trim short hair more frequently. other than that seems to work perfectly.</li>
            <li> I was apprehensive about buying an expensive trimmer, and wondered if a less expensive one would do the job of just keeping the goatee that I wanted to just the right length - just a stubble length.  I did buy some cheaper models, but they turned out woefully bad, so much that I dropped the idea of keeping a goatee and just went with clean shaven for a while.  But then I read all the great things that I read on this and decided to go for it.  BEST PURCHASE !! I can have just the right length of trim that I want, in fact, I found that the shortest trim is a bit too short, it just gives the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow - so if thats the look you want, you wont be disappointed !!  I use the # 2 length setting, and thats just right for a stubble - just enough to feel, but too short to actually grip any of the hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the vaccuum feature, and although its not perfect vaccuum, you have to shave over the sink if you dont want stray bits of hair on the floor.. few hairs do escape the vaccuum, but use the trimmer for a few weeks and then check out the chamber, you would be surprised how much has been caught in.  the fine trimmer attachment is ok, not so great to do the fine lines of a goatee, I got to do it quite a few times, but then I suspect nothing will ever come close to the perfection a blade can offer.  This is as good as it gets !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it, you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Without question, an excellent product!   I&#x27;m very impressed.  I like to keep a short goatee - a bit longer than the \\&quot;stubble look.\\&quot;  I set my T980 on number \\&quot;2\\&quot; and - voilá!  Very cool indeed.      The device does vacuum most of the beard, but not all.  Anyhow, the sink clean up afterwards takes a lot less time.  What&#x27;s also impressive is the battery life.  I used my T980 about 2 to 3 times a week for a fast trim and did not need to re-charge it since I first got it, which was a few weeks ago. As I write this review, I have to re-charge it again for just about an hour.      The T980 comes with accessories and its own storage pouch.  I would buy this product again as a gift for someone else.</li>
            <li> The Philips literature says the lowest (#1) setting trims your beard down to stubble but this is just not so.  Mine isn&#x27;t close to that.  Overall, the trimmer has a lot of positive points (quiet, efficient, vacuum works well, etc) but this is a big drawback for me.</li>
            <li> The T980 allows a quick and non-messy trim of my beard without the residue in the sink.  Really appreciate the vacuum feature.  No more damp toilet tissue wiping of the sink basin to clean up the clippings.  The hinged trimming receptacle is easy to open and empty.  By trimming twice a week, it keeps my beard at a consistent neat length. I like my new look and the tool that keeps it that way !</li>
            <li> I ordered the trimmer but did not realize that I would not be getting the trimmer attachments</li>
            <li> Good seller, prompt shipping,  My second trimmer from Norelco. First one lasted about 5 years. Would buy another one when this one goes.</li>
            <li> I had used other brand trimmers in the past and this is by far superior. Admittedly, I only use it to trim my modest goatee but for this it does an excellent work. The adjustable head saves you from all those pesky trimming attachments and the hair compartment saves you from spreading stubble all over the place. Recharging time is very reasonable, unlike some of these trimmers. It may not work for others but I have been using it for a while and I cannot find anything wrong with it.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco 7980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer a couple of weeks ago and really like it.  It does indeed capture pretty much all of the cut hair which saves clean-up time afterwards.  And the turbo feature does work, kicking up the speed much faster to trim you beard in no time.  The only downside, and a small one at that, was the learning curve for figuring out how to take off and replace the different heads but that&#x27;s no longer a problem.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll like it!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace my Remington MB400 trimmer which I really liked. Unfortunately, after years of use, the battery will no longer hold a charge for more then a couple minutes. That&#x27;s unfortunate because the titanium blades still cut well. I liked the MB400, because it gave me a close stuble shave, its vacuum worked well and it stood upright, taking up less space on my small sink. Since this model is no longer available, (I would have bought it again), and since Remington, no longer offers a vacuum trimmer for some odd reason, I had to look elsewhere.  I was somewhat reluctant to buy the Norelco T980, because I had Norelco rotary razor years ago which I hated. However, I chalked that up to not liking the rotary system and this trimmer had some good reviews.  The trimmer is a sleek black color, comes with a carrying case, and in general looks well built. The battery much to its credit also holds a charge well. I&#x27;ve used it multiple times and I still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it yet.   The trimmer has been a disappoint overall though, mainly because unlike my previous trimmer it does not provide a close stuble shave. This may be a non issue for some buyers if they are only looking to trim longer hair, however it is a critical issue for me as I tend to use my trimmer as my primary shaver, and keep a seperate foil shaver for days I need a cleaner shave. This trimmer simply does not cut close enough with either of the provided heads. The smaller trimmer head also cuts rough and felt more uncomfortable.   The vacuum works well, but the blue collection piece gets in the way when shaving, and also causes the vacuum to miss some. The plastic collection door on  front front flips open, but stays hinged and thus gets in the way, when you are trying to empty hair.   The blue turbo button on front changes the whir of the motor, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in shave.  Overall, this is probably a decent to good trimmer for longer hair lengths, but if you are looking for anything nearing a close shave, avoid this model.   I will be getting a different model due to the closeness issue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this product for something like 3 years now and finally thought I&#x27;d write a review.    I love it.  Others have stated quite clearly it&#x27;s benefits, which I fully agree with.    So, I&#x27;m going to focus on the long-term (minor) issues I&#x27;ve had just so you know.    a) After about 2 years, the trimmings basket (the plastic container your hair gets sucked into) came apart.  I used some crazy glue to fix it and it&#x27;s been fine since.    b) It&#x27;s sometimes hard to get the guard back on on the head, takes some finesse.      And that, my friends, is really it.     The vacuum really works but you gotta have turbo on.  My girlfriend no longer has to deal with hair in the sink.  It does a great job on my beard (I like it short, I&#x27;m a #2), and it&#x27;s even fine for my neck (YMMV).    Best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned in 15 years.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed this trimmer at first, though I should say that it never cut as closely to my skin as I wanted it too.  But after a year, the motor started jumping and though it works, it doesn&#x27;t work as well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for over 35 years and used various trimmers and shapers including Norelco.  I love the fact that I can use it corded or cordless beacuse sooner or later the battery is not charged or dies.  If the battery dies (AND THEY ALL DO) in many trimmers you have to trash the whole unit. This model seems to not have that issue so that&#x27;s a plus.    What I do not like is the vacuum. Come on, I mean simply let everything fall in the sink, scoop and flush. It&#x27;s just another thing to clean and maintain. My real issue is the vacuum shield gets in the way while I trim my beard. It moves as you trim but blocks my visual for pinpoint trimming.    In anycase so far so good and does seem well made as my other Norelco products.</li>
            <li> I bought this years ago and it is still going strong.</li>
            <li> The Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer is all that I had hoped it would be, with a powerful vacuum that leaves hardly any mess in my sink. It gives a good, close trim and is easy to hold. So far, I have not had to charge it and I have used it about 5 times already. I do wish the turbo button was in a different spot on the handle, as it turns on accidentally very easily, but I can live with that. Overall, I would say this trimmer is well worth your money.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for last Christmas, and it&#x27;s been incredible! When dad started to grow out a beard, I wanted to get him a trimmer to keep it neat. When he first used it, he trimmed over the trashcan, and he was shocked to see that the vacuum actually caught all of the hair! By now, he&#x27;s used it all around the house, and still no mess. After nearly a year of use, the blades have stayed sharp and haven&#x27;t pulled.    On a whim, I used it to trim my brother&#x27;s hair. Mind you, I&#x27;m no professional stylist, but I thought it was tremendously helpful! I cut the bulk of his hair with our Oster clippers, but I thought the Norelco was much easier to handle for detail work (i.e. shaping, sideburns, back of the neck). A pho-hawk is pretty difficult to do, but the 9 length settings helped me to create it. Take THAT, Fantastic Sam&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace the one that I had purchased a few years back. The old one never failed, I simply plugged it into the wall on a trip to Europe during a lapse in judgment.     Its various settings are easy to work with, give you enough range for whatever length you&#x27;re looking for, and the closest setting will give you the short stubble length that is very short.     The best part is that with the vacuum action, there&#x27;s no mess to clean up around the sink - and it works.     The only thing I&#x27;m not thrilled about in the redesign is that they&#x27;ve replaced the pull-out canister that holds the clippings with a small door that swings open and you empty - which I suspect won&#x27;t last long unless you&#x27;re pretty careful.I&#x27;m wary of the plastic hinge. Still, that doesn&#x27;t keep me from giving this trimmer five stars.     It has a long battery life too - you&#x27;ll only need to charge it once every ten or fifteen uses, which means you can travel with it charged and not risk burning it with 220V.</li>
            <li> It really works quite well. I had another brand before this and I must say this one is much nicer and it works great. I trim my beard and cut my hair with it and it does a great job. However, the vacuum clogs sometimes and that is problematic, but with a little care it is workable. It works best in Turbo mode and is not really all that loud.  As far as rechargable cutter/trimmers go this one is a good as it gets.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a repeat Norelco user.  Having read some of the other reviewers&#x27; complaints of \\&quot;excessive noise\\&quot; and \\&quot;soft\\&quot; depth settings, and considering the somewhat vague description of the T980 Turbo, I was hesitant, but bought it anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to say the T980 is an improvement in every way over my old faithful trimmer (T970 maybe? I threw it away after a couple of days with this one).  I&#x27;d used my old trimmer for over 3 years with no problems whatsoever.  The old battery was weakening, and when I saw the Philips special promotion on Amazon, I decided it was time for an upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the lowdown:  Most important to folks wondering whether to upgrade- the T980 works EXACTLY like the old one; you can still pop the top off and do the edge trimming without adding any attachments; No. 3 and No. 2 depth on this one are the same as on the old one, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for noise, my old trimmer had no doubt gotten noisier over the years as the blades dulled or whatever, but with them side by side, the T980 was noticeably QUIETER right out of the box.  On the \\&quot;turbo screamer\\&quot; setting, it was about even with the old one as far as pure decibels.  Speaking of the turbo setting, it&#x27;s a neat idea, but the vacuum on this one works so much better than the previous one on \\&quot;normal,\\&quot; in practice I never even switch it to \\&quot;turbo.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The depth adjustment on the T980 does have a slightly soft \\&quot;click\\&quot; right out of the box, but contrary to what I&#x27;ve read, it holds the setting at least as firmly as my old one.  Plus, once I used it a few weeks, it loosened up and now \\&quot;clicks\\&quot; as definitively as the old one ever did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re using an older Norelco trimmer similar to this one and have been pleased with it, I can recommend the upgrade to the T980 without hesitation.</li>
            <li> This product is really cool one from Phillips. It is easy to use and trimming nicely.... I am so happy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d been wanting a trimmer with a vacuum option on it, so when I was buying some other new trimmers and shavers, I decided to get this one too.  I have to say in some ways I don&#x27;t like it as much as the plain Norelco trimmer it replaced, but I&#x27;ll give it 4 stars because the main reason I bought this, for the vacuum, works very well.  Didn&#x27;t even use the turbo option, the counter-top looks a lot cleaner after a shave now.  The back of the trimmer guide looks odd, but it works fine.  My biggest knock is when you take the guide off. There&#x27;s a sliding plastic panel that I guess is there to help direct hair into the vacuum, but it makes trimming without the guide a bit of a pain.  I used to use my old trimmer to trim my mustache, but I&#x27;ll probably use the trimmer on my shaver for that now, it&#x27;s less work even though I have to reach for a second gadget.  Using the trimmer without the guide though to try to shape the sides of my beard was a little bit of a hassle, though I&#x27;ve only used the trimmer once, so maybe with some experimentation it will get easier.  Anyway, the vacuum part of it certainly works well.</li>
            <li> My husband has a full beard and mustache and likes to keep it neatly groomed very close to his skin and this does the job! The travel case is wonderful for easy storage. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Overall I would recommend this product. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This unit replaces a T990 in which the battery died much too early.  Unfortunately with ni-cad batteries you cannot use the unit even with direct power from the charger unit after the battery is dead. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The T980 has the same old battery technology, and that is the reason for my mediocre rating.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The slight improvement is the vacuum chamber, which catches about 85% of the clippings.  However, having to change the mustache and beard blades manually is much less convenient than the pop-up mustache trimmer on the T990. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Come on, Norelco/Phillips!   Let&#x27;s get with the new tech. in batteries, or at least design a by-pass circuit so that the unit can be powered directly from an outlet.</li>
            <li> My wife got this for me it is a good trimmer and the vacuum works will unlike other trimmers I have owned where the vacuum makes noise but does not work...it is a little larger then other trimmers but I don&#x27;t mind...The price was good and shipped on time...</li>
            <li> Just like T970 this clipper has some design flaws that make it a poor choice for trimming. The zoom dial adjusts by itself even with the slightest pressure while trimming giving an uneven cut and closer trim than was desired. It needs to have a setting lock or the dial in a different location than right where you hold it. The vaccum function is so-so, I could live without it. Noise level is unusually high, but that&#x27;s least of my concerns. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> If you plan to travel outside the USA make sure you have a full charge and do not run out of juice while away. It is strange this day and age that products come with 110-120v transformers one vs. 110-240v; esp. personal care items like shavers and trimmers. If you run out of power when in Europe (say) plan to have to take a AC adapter or buy a new adapter while overseas. You get a reasonable use time before re-charging, but ever now and again you will have a situation where your trimmer or shaver gets turned on while packed tight in your luggage - then you will be out of luck.</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer, it trims my beard evenly in much less time then my last trimmer, and while it does not pick up ALL the hair that falls, it picks up enough to make clean-up very easy.</li>
            <li> Having used this item for several weeks, I can attest to it&#x27;s excellent performance.  Although I am not sure why you need a turbo button, when it seems to me it should be on full vacuum all the time, it is an excellent beard and mustache trimmer/shaver.  Perhaps a little big, but not heavy.  Simple to use, and many hair length settings. I have no reservation in recommending this one.</li>
            <li> I got mine around three weeks ago.  The good news is that it cuts my beard well, and the vacuum is not noisy.  The bad news is 1) the controls are positioned such that I find myself accidently hitting the on/off switch as I am shaving, no huge deal but annoying, 2) the vacuum action catches 95% of the hairs but 95% means you still have to clean up afterwards so it is of dubious value, and most importantly 3) it does not hold its distance setting.  I find that, as I shave, the shave length setting can very easily be pushed down so that I end up with a much shorter beard than I intended.  I can&#x27;t imagine why after all these years Norelco has not come up with a better system for locking down the shave length so that it does not get changed by the mere act of shaving.  In my opinion this last issue makes it a dud product that fails at its intended function, and I would recommend against buying it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works perfectly in every sense. The only thing that kills it is the fact that they decided to include an AC adapter that only works with 120 volts. In other words, if you travel, you can&#x27;t charge this trimmer in most other countries. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that much more expensive to include an adapter that accepts 110-230 volts. My last Norelco trimmer that lasted 7 years could accept 110-230 volts and was always with me in my travels.    Items such as trimmers, shavers, cell phones, laptops, etc. all should accept 110-230 volts, since they are mostly travel items.</li>
            <li> Good product.  I use this for trimming my beard and it has performed well and held up well.  I really like the Turbo Vacuum feature.  It keeps hair from going all over my vanity.  Easy to clean and easy to operate.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who has a full beard and moustache - he loves it! The vacuuum feature is particularly nice - no more hair in the sink! He says it&#x27;s the best trimmer he&#x27;s ever used - highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I owned a Wahl trimmer for 4 years; it died.  This trimmer is TWICE the trimmer that one was. The description and reviews of this Norelco Trimmer were all accurate.  The Turbo makes a difference, the battery charge remains for a long time, the speed and sharpness of the blades is perfect.  Cleaning is a bit more complicated that would appear, but the PERKS and QUALITY of the trimmer are more than worth it.  The vacuum feature HELPS so much; much less to clean up on the sink afterwards.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd Norelco Beard trimmer and I have been very happy with each one.  I have had to replace each one due to battery life.  The T980 is an improvement over my last because of the vacuum feature.  The price was also very competetive.  I think this one cost less than my previous and has more features.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer over a month ago, and it works very well. I use the vacuum on the high setting. I have seen people complain about the height setting moving to the minnimum setting; however, I do not know how they manage to do that without actually TURNIG the adjustment ring. I tried to press this trimmer so as to force a change in the setting and was unable to do so. This trimmer is excellent for my purposes... The vacuum works very well, and the cut is even with NO pulls on my hairs. I highly recomend this trimmer... Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.</li>
            <li> Cuts well enough, vacuum doesn&#x27;t really seem to work for me (I suppose it may be because I wait too long between trimmings).  One thing, don&#x27;t press hard while using it, as the adjustable height (while neat) doesn&#x27;t put up much resistance to being knocked down to the next setting.</li>
            <li> This is not a gimmick. It&#x27;s sturdy and well designed. The &#x27;vacuum&#x27; works brilliantly. I wear my hair very short and I can do my head without any little prickles getting under my shirt and making the rest of the day torture. This trimmer is for me a &#x27;break-through&#x27; product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for a few years, and it&#x27;s held up to regular use and still going strong.  It&#x27;s easy to clean out, and the adjustable guard does a good job of providing the selected shave length across the contours of the face.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice trimmer gets a very close trim on the lowest setting. Comfortable settings available for different trims. Turbo is good, but does not help you with a clean sink. Overall, great product.</li>
            <li> The Vacuum Trimmer is a good idea. It actually works. It doesnt get everything but most of it. The turbo is a bit loud but trust me its not the end of world. Any trimmer is going to make noise. Speaking from an African-American, the trimmer just doesnt give me that smooth trim i have with my current    \\&quot;Andis Professional 04710 T-Outliner Personal Trimmer\\&quot;. I cant speak for all men because all hair is different but speaking for most African Americans, it wouldnt work well. The coreless feature and Vacuum is awesome, but i need a little bit more.        Smooth transaction. Shipping was fast.</li>
            <li> It is a great product. I can recommend anybody. Vacuum really works!!!</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband who has really course hair.  He loves it.  I didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of $ on an electric trimmer, because he seems to go through them fast.  I found this one on sale here, and it&#x27;s wonderful.  It trims his goatee which is really course, and he has even had to trim his head with it, he buzzes his head, since his clippers broke.  He&#x27;s really picky about his clippers and trimmer, and he said he loves it and it works great.</li>
            <li> My old T965&#x27;s battery gave up after 4 faithful years of service.  The problems with the new T980 are: the new body is a hard slick plastic which is more difficult to grip (slips out of the hand); the small/fine trimmer is now an attachment. That means you&#x27;ve got this small trimmer head that you have to keep in the medicine cabinet or when you travel in a safe place where you won&#x27;t lose it; the depth indicator is hard to read and the numbers aren&#x27;t always centered in the tiny viewing window.  Philips has now replaced the old standard coiled power cords with specialized adapters.  This means when you&#x27;re on vacation you&#x27;ve got to bring the AC adapter for your face trimmer and then bring a different AC adapter for your beard trimmer.    Pros: It looks real pretty.  It cuts well.</li>
            <li> This is my second trimmer. My first, a Remington was at least 15 years old and worked like a champ. It had it&#x27;s problems like many of these in holding the desired length. But you learn to hold it tight so it won&#x27;t change while trimming.  I babied the batteries for years and quite honestly if you don&#x27;t, with Ni-Cads you&#x27;ll be replacing them or the trimmer a lot sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this one and was concerned by some of the negative reviews. I don&#x27;t use a lot of pressure when trimming so I haven&#x27;t seen it change (shorten) while trimming.  The vacuum feature is nice and works well. Others complained about getting up under the nose. This is no different from any others I&#x27;ve tried that use a blade guard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if I had it longer. So far so good and has lived up to or beyond my expectations.  I&#x27;m still on the first charge so time will tell. If it lasts half as long as my Remington I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
            <li> This trimmer does a wonderful job keeping my beard looking great.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it the full five stars is that it doesn&#x27;t vacuum up all the beard trimmings.  It allows for a nice range of beard lengths as long as you don&#x27;t want it too long.  But if you want anything from the popular \\&quot;haven&#x27;t shaved for a day or two\\&quot; look to a full but nicely trimmed beard, this will do it.</li>
            <li> After 3, almost identical, super-solid, Panasonic trimmers over the past twenty years, they discontinued the model.   This Norelco seemed to be the best non-pro model available, but it is quite different. Not terrible but it takes some getting used to.  Power and battery life are fine, the vacuum feature is strange.  Be careful the first few times, it does not seem to be doing anything because no hairs are flying around, but rest assured it is cutting. Because of the vacuum, you cannot do close trimming with the main head and switching heads is a pain.  I can&#x27;t imagine what it is like for people who buy trimmers with 3 or more interchangable heads.  The T980 is OK, but I long for the old days.   One head, one adjustable comb.  Everything handled.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace a T765 that I wore out after 5 years. I like that this T980 has the vacuum feature. Not 100% effective but way better than nothing. Keeps most of the trimmings out of the sink so it&#x27;s easier to clean up the sink after trimming...the wife likes that feature! A bit bulky but easy to control and gives a nice accurate trim. It&#x27;s a good value and if it&#x27;s like my last Norelco it should last many years. I give it a 4 1/2. Buy it!</li>
            <li> I *borrowed* this from my man after my own wimpy, girly trimmer broke.  I won&#x27;t give it back to him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like my bikini area to be well groomed and this does the trick easily and leaves no itchy cut hairs behind afterward like my other trimmer did.  It does a very through job and I know I will not get nicked or cut no matter what angle I use it at because of the way the hair guard is made (nice feature).  Easy to make length adjustments and easy to clean.  This one is a keeper for the ladies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why oh why do they not make well engineered things like this for women&#x27;s body grooming needs??  Why do we have to go sneaking around borrowing decent trimmers from our men or have to go to a salon to get groomed?&lt;br /&gt;Norelco take note... this is a great product that women would love if they only knew it existed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE* 12/8/08.... Since I wrote my review, the little cup that holds the cut hairs has broken open twice.  It is easy enough to superglue it back together, but it is a design flaw that you must grab the cup right at the seam in order to open it and empty it.  Tiny hairs go all over when it breaks... it is annoying.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I still LOVE this trimmer and would buy it again, but be careful when you are emptying out the cup and possibly think about only opening it over the trash can just in case.</li>
            <li> Product received in non-working condition. It would not turn on. Return from Amazon was a non-issue, easily handled.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer is a big improvement over Norelco&#x27;s earlier version (which used to be the best beard trimmer on the market). Look no further!</li>
            <li> I was a little concerned after reading a few of the negative reviews.  Nonetheless, I decided to go with this trimmer, it had a lot more positive reviews than negative and it was the most expensive trimmer on amazon at the time and I was looking for a high quality trimmer.     After a few uses I quickly realized why some of the negative reviews said the trimmer didn&#x27;t trim.  I recall one guy saying he was pressing super hard but it didn&#x27;t trim any hair.  So here&#x27;s the scoop, the plastic guard/head if improperly seated on the top of the trimmer stands 1/2 - 1 inch higher than it should.  Thus on virtually any setting, the trimmer part isn&#x27;t touching your face.  This is not a big deal, properly seating the guard on the device is pretty simple.      For me the battery on the trimmer has lasted about 25-35 trims of the my full beard.  I don&#x27;t use the turbo vacuum feature as I heard that it runs the batteries out quicker and it doesn&#x27;t seem like it&#x27;s needed anyway.  I keep my beard pretty short and the vacuum under normal power does the job.    The device has 10 length settings and an extra trimming pieces to do clean-up type work.  It doesn&#x27;t make that much noise (when the turbo button is not on) and it is a very light device.  I think the overall size of the device is \\&quot;just right\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s feels comfortable using it and it&#x27;s not overly large which would make for awkward use.    The only suggestion I&#x27;d have for Norelco is to beef up the friction on the length adjuster. While using the device a few times the length setting moved to a lower setting unintentionally.     All in all I am extremely satisfied with this trimmer.  For not a lot of $ I feel like I bought the best trimmer that was available on the market.</li>
            <li> OK. Let&#x27;s just say that I&#x27;m looking for the perfect cut, without going to the barber shop.  The Norelco T980 is good, but, it doesn&#x27;t completely live up to the claims on the product details.  Yes, it does have a turbo button that acts like a facial hair trimmer NOS booster.  However, the blades don&#x27;t seem to make a perfect cut.  Even after spending considerable time, I still have the wild hair or two left that requires special attention.  The vacuum, unlike how it is described, does NOT pick up all of the hair being cut.  In fact, you&#x27;ll find your sink littered with remains after even the briefest of jobs.  All of this said, I&#x27;ve used a few other trimmers in the past and this is one of the best.  One more thing, the device feels light (and a bit cheap).</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as good as professional trimmers, but doesn&#x27;t cost as much either.  As far as what it&#x27;s designed to do, I don&#x27;t think the turbo feature works any better than normal mode.  It still drops a lot of hair in my sink in either mode.  I have to go over an area a few times to remove all the hair no matter which mode I&#x27;m using.  All in all, the T980 works OK but not great.</li>
            <li> I recently bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.  It is advertised to trim beards and mustaches but I use it to give my husband a haircut.  He doesn&#x27;t have much hair and he just doesn&#x27;t want to look bald.  I love the rechargeable/cordless feature.  It is not noisy.  We used to have a corded hair trimmer but this is so much better.  The hair waste container is small so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to do haircuts except for balding heads.</li>
            <li> I used to love the Remington MB-300/200. After trying this trimmer Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, it is very similar to Remington MB-300/200 with the added vacuum, less noise, much more powerful motor! Remington MB-300/200 has a close to skin trimmer blade that pops up for cutting sharp edges on the breed/facial hair styles; and I have been look everywhere to find a similar blade trimmer. And then I found the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer, that has the close to skin blade trimmer attachment that is very useful in getting sharp edges of the style on your facial hair. Then after the trimming is complete I use a Straight Razor (DOVO Shavette Straight Razor [[ASIN:B0028QFHUM DOVO Shavette Straight Razor with Red Holder and FREE 100 Blades]]- The best straight razor), to shave and get the edges of the style perfected.</li>
            <li> The other one star reviews are correct, the auto lock mechanism does not work.  It slips down to the lowest setting making this effective only for a stubble look.  Too bad, as the vacuum function worked pretty well.</li>
            <li> The mechanical tech department at Norelco have produced another fine shaver/trimmer mechanism. Unfortunately the sales department has downgraded quality by packaging the trimmer with a cheap recharging system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most high end rechargeable items nowadays can be left in the recharging base constantly, always ready for use. Not this thing. The user directions warn that it must be charged no longer than 24 hours. What happens if you forget? Perhaps this item would not dangerously overheat, maybe it would just lessen the life of the batteries. Who can predict what bad things might happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other cautions in Norelco&#x27;s documentation: \\&quot;... do not recharge trimmer between trimming sessions. Continue using it until the battery is completely empty\\&quot;. And then twice a year you are advised to run down the batteries completely to condition them. The batteries in some other devices (which use other chemistry) do not require any of these special maintenance routines to remember. Those trimmers are nice to own, compared to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this thing had a base, then the base could be placed far from the sink for safety in using AC around water. On those mornings when the batteries run down you will plug in the cord and therefore be using AC. Since there is no base its tempting to just lay it down anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparing the shroud around the cutters, its exactly the same size and looks very much like my old Norelco. But this one has the shroud&#x27;s plastic teeth cut in the middle so that the head can \\&quot;float\\&quot;. Bah! Humbug! That cut reduces stiffness and the plastic teeth are now in two pieces, each of which is attached on only one end!  This allows the shroud teeth to bend inward on the end where they are not attached. When this happens it will cut the whiskers *really* shorter and that part of your beard will look funny at work a couple days. Yes it happened to me first time I used it. I was used to my older Norelco with teeth which were not bendable, but dependable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The on/off switch is right on top, and a light touch will cycle it. Wonderful! Now when you travel you pray that the thing isn&#x27;t running when you go through airport security. How hot would it get in the suitcase if it does come on and run 45 minutes? My old Norelco had a stiff rotating switch that could never cycle on/off unexpectedly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for how well it trims, on a scale 1 to 10, I would say 10. That is, when using a very lighter touch than what I&#x27;m used to so that the teeth do not compress and sculpture the result.f switch is right on top, and a light touch will cycle it. Wonderful!

            <li> This is by far the greatest trimmer I have ever own, love the Turbo , no hairs anywhere, works great</li>
            <li> For a Philips Norelco product, it was only so-so.  I subsequently bought a Wahl product and found it to be much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been a believer in correct battery \\&quot;training.\\&quot;  If your unit (phone, laptop or in this case, shaver) spends every night on the cradle or sucking juice from your home or apartment, odds are that battery will suffer. This suffering will take down its operating ability and cause the charge to last less each time you use it.    I&#x27;ve trained my battery correctly from the start (turn it on and leave it to expend itself when I opened the box and then give it the first good, solid nights charge).      I enjoy the trimmer, love that I can walk around my room and clean my beard without spilling shards of dead cells everywhere.</li>
            <li> I really want to be fair and objective, but i have to admit, this is the worst trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used at least a dozen trimmers in my lifetime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- first the motor charged quickly and fine.  i was happy to have received it to trim my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- first I noticed the flimsy bag which was shin and would not protect the machine against bumps. the bag is worthless, and probably a step up from a thick ziplock bag but with velcro&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-i noticed the vacuum and quickly tried the vacuum, which can not be turned off, and the vaccum did not pull all the hair, but maybe 80% of the hair.  so in other words, the vaccum doesn&#x27;t work because even if it cleaned 95%, i would still have to sweep afterwords and after i thought about it, i realized it was a waste and a stupid idea to incorporate a vaccume unless it was running on AC power with about 3AMP power to .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-all this was not a big deal to be as the first and the most important to me was a trimmer that did the job, which would be the bulk of the rating.  i started running the trimmer first on my arms, which was not nearly as thick as face and noticed it was uneven after two runs.  i looked at the timmer and i see the hair just clumped on the contact point where the cutting blades meet the comb.  i cleaned it by hand and tried again.  and it kept repeating, so the bottom line after every two runs, you have to blow really hard on the comb in order to clean the path.  this is non-practical and does not satisfy the purpose for me.  [...].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-also, when using the machine, i noticed i was hitting the power button, or the turbo button accidently as i shave, but i&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s something i would have gotten used to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;all in all this is the worst product ever and if you really buy after reading all this, i&#x27;m not sorry for you because you didn&#x27;t listen and you&#x27;ll just have to return it.  if you REALLY want it, just try it at any store and tell me if you can run it across your beard, or body 4 times without cleaning it.  and when i say cleaning it, i mean blowing really hard on the comb to get the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;finally, even if you want to use it for close shave without the comb, you can&#x27;t because of the stupid vacuum where the lid gets hair stuck in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the vaccum is the biggest problem, so if you want a norelco trimmer, dont get the vacuum one, because it will simply render the trimmer useless.s your beard, or body 4 times without cleaning it.  and when i say cleaning it, i mean blowing really hard on the comb to get the hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;finally, even if you want to use it for close shave without the comb, you can&#x27;t because of the stupid vacuum where the lid gets hair stuck in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the vaccum is the biggest problem, so if you want a norelco trimmer, dont get the vacuum one, because it will simply render the trimmer useless.</li>
            <li> I was incredibly excited to get this trimmer. I previously had a Norelco Trimmer that I absolutely loved and thought worked wonderful. After a few years of use the battery didn&#x27;t hold much charge and I finally lost the charger after traveling!    I looked at the trimmers available and the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer sounded great. I was a little worried about purchasing it however because I read some users were having problems with the trimming guard moving position. I thought I&#x27;d give it a try and if it didn&#x27;t work, I&#x27;d send it back... and ultimately I was hoping the people having troubles were just incompetent.     I charged the trimmer for a day. Played around with the trimming guard by pushing on it and moving it up and down and it seemed to be extremely solid and sturdy. It seemed like it locked in position just fine.    After starting to trim on a safe level 6 (my goatie had gotten long, waiting for a new trimmer) I was having success. While gliding the trimmer up the side of my goatie, WHOOPS, it slipped to Level 4. Oh well, I said, I guess I&#x27;m going to have a level 4 goatie. Well to sum it up, about halfway into it I was surprised with a slip to level 2.     The vacuum is wonderful, it works perfectly. But honestly, do you really give a crap if you have to shave at a level 2 every stinking time? Why didn&#x27;t I send it back? The package was impossible to open, I had to cut and rip it in shreds. It&#x27;s hard to go without a trimmer but PLEASE read this review and know that you WILL have problems with it slipping trim guards, I guarantee it.    The design of the trim guard dial is part of the problem. I&#x27;m not going to sit here and tell Philips how to design a trimmer though, they&#x27;ve done it correctly in the past.     BOTTOM LINE: Great idea, new innovations work great, but as a trimmer this is a piece of junk because you can&#x27;t shave at any level higher than a number 2 without risk of ending up 2 levels lower or MORE.</li>
            <li> So far it is wonderful. Holds a charge forever. Cleans easily. Vacuum feature with Turbo on works great. Quiet as a mouse. I don&#x27;t have a problem with the height adjustment but I also keep it at it&#x27;s lowest setting all of the time. Very sharp blades.</li>
            <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for my fiance last year. It was really a win-win situation - he needed a new trimmer and I was sick of seeing hair in the sink! Who would have thought you could get a trimmer with a VACUUM on it?    This thing really sucks .... but in a good way. The reservoir is a little small but if you empty it out, you will have no problem with all those hairs getting sucked into the machine. My fiance also uses this to shave/buzz his head! He rarely (if ever) goes to the barber anymore.  I have read from other reviewers that the trimmer will switch settings - I think this has only happened once for him and it wasn&#x27;t a huge deal.     Overall, this was a great price for this trimmer and the quality is excellent! I would recommend this trimmer :)</li>
            <li> I just received the Philips Nerelco T980 and I am impressed. Feels great in your hand and trims amazingly well without shooting hair all over your bathroom. Only thing is make sure you open the hatch over your garbage because it doesn&#x27;t slide out... It&#x27;s just a hatch so beware. Overall, very happy so far. I also got it in less than 2 days after I purchased.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a few times so far, but I have no complaints. The trimmer is sleek, it comes with a travel/carrying bag, and it does a better 5 o&#x27;clock shadow than the other trimmers I&#x27;ve tried. The vacuum is a nice touch. I wish it came with a stand or dock, but I really can&#x27;t fault it at that price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this trimmer as a Christmas gift for my husband.  I was particularly interested because the reviews stated it could be used plugged in or unplugged and that the vacuum feature was effective in reducing the level of flung trimmings.  He had worn out a trimmer of another brand which had done a minimally acceptable job on his beard and mustache.  He loves this one.  It is easy to use, not too noisy, and lives up to its billing.</li>
            <li> This is not the best beard trimmer.  I find that the lowest setting is not short enough, and the blades don&#x27;t uniformly hit all hairs.  I am coming off of a Remington, which worked well, but after a fall, it was damaged.  Remington doesn&#x27;t have a new model, so I tried this one.  I picked the t980 because it has the 1 hour quick charge.  The vacuum action is great, and at least 90 percent of the trimmings make it into the reservoir.  I just wish it actually cut better and with more consistency.</li>
            <li> The Norelco trimmer that I bought around five years ago just died on me so it was time to buy a new one.  I really liked the old Norelco so I thought I would get the same brand.  This trimmer had all of the features that I wanted and I figured that since the price was so high it must ba a great trimmer.  Boy was I wrong.  I have a fairly thin curly beard that this trimmer just could not handle.  It would not cut some places at all.  Using the hilarious \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button just makes it louder and does nothing for performance.  After leaving my beard a patchy mess I decided to just shave the whole thing.  Even with the guide off it could barely shave my beard.  This trimmer is virtually worthless.</li>
            <li> I have been using trimmers for years, and have found the T980 to be very good for the cost and portability. The other brands that I used consisted of clip on guards, a single guard that slid to the proper length and in most cases never locked correctly giving an uneven cut.    The T980 has the dial up cut length that locks in place, the vacuum is a nice touch although it still doesn&#x27;t get all the clippings.  Makes it easier to travel being cordless and not needing all those guards to misplace or forget.  One minor issue was the cut level, it isn&#x27;t the easiest to read through that little window.  I knew it was there but could not make out the numbers at first.</li>
            <li> Worked will at first then within the first couple months of ownership plastic parts began to fail, generally when the unit was being taken apart for regular cleaning.</li>
            <li> Very impressed with this little product so far.  It fits in the hand nicely, has swap able heads and generally cuts quite well.  My only complaint would be that the settings are very easy to change mid shave (as some have pointed out) and you can very easily have an uneven beard if you arent careful.</li>
            <li> Bought for my son for Christmas. He says it works great and really likes the vacuum feature.</li>
            <li> I love this product! Works great on any length beard and vacuum feature eliminates most of the mess. I would definitely repurchase!</li>
            <li> Excellent high end trimmer.  Vacuum catches most, but not all the clipped hairs.  Like the variable controls on hair length.  Comfortable design. Very good battery life.  Only idiosyncrasy is that the control turns the clipper on a little too easily, so anything in the suitcase can easily turn it on.  (\\&quot;What is that buzzing anyway?\\&quot;)</li>
            <li> I bought this product in 2007, and it just broke for no apparent reason. It turns out cheap flimsy plastic does not last long. I did not drop it or submerge it in water, it just stopped. I contacted the company and they told me that they would do nothing to help me since i bought it over 2 years ago (2.5 yrs ago to be exact). I will never buy norelco again.</li>
            <li> Works well, catches cut hair good, the only reason I did not give it a 5 was it is a little hard to use with the top off, working around the guard, other than that - very satisfied</li>
            <li> I gave this 4 stars because it does as advertised and has worked well. My only \\&quot;con\\&quot; is I use these type trimmers with the guard off sometimes. With the guard removed one cant see where they are trimming because the vaccuum area blocks the blades. Make sense?  If not, sorry ;)    The vacuum works well and is a very nice feature. We all know it sucks cleaning hair out of the sink.    Buy it</li>
            <li> This beard/head trimmer works as you might hope it would. I had purchased, about 3 years ago, a version of the same trimmer and the battery eventually stopped holding a charge for very long. The old version was an AccuVac T870.    I got another trimmer to replace the old one and it did not have the \\&quot;Vacuum\\&quot; part and my wife was not happy about the \\&quot;little hairs all over\\&quot; (even after I tried to clean up) -- so I returned that one and looked for a similar one to my old one. That is when I found this one on Amazon and got it.    Great upgrade from the \\&quot;older one\\&quot; I had. Every feature I liked from the old one is still there but it has been improved in many ways as well.     The old one took 12 hrs. to charge and this one takes 70 min. The adjustment \\&quot;clicker\\&quot; (how close to trim) is firmer, so there is less chance of it moving on you while you trim (making for a shorter than expected cut at times - a risk with the older one).    What totally amazed me is after the first initial charge (following instructions) I let it drain the battery until it indicated it was time for a charge (neat new flashy light thingy does that), but it let me use the trimmer for full trim (I do my head and my beard) about 6 - 7 times before it needed to be re charged.    This one also says it can be used while plugged in. The previous version never said it could be and I used it that way at times which may have compromised the battery for the old one. Now I feel fine using it plugged or unplugged since the instructions say it&#x27;s OK.    I like it, no more \\&quot;little hairs all over\\&quot; -- of course a few leak out here and there, but I usually do a good enough job to keep my wife happy with a little wipe down around the sink, etc. after trimming. I don&#x27;t even use the \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; switch but perhaps if I did there would be no hairs around at all.    Good Product, get one. I really like mine.</li>
            <li> Overall, very good piece.  Very accurate.  I hate knocking off a star for this but I really wish that the spring on the belt clip was a little more robust.  If it weren&#x27;t for the pocket locking clip, I would&#x27;ve had the device hitting the floor or ground a significant number of times.</li>
            <li> My husband has another Norelco and liked it but this upgrade made him happy. Parts fit both so he has 2 now...one to travel with if need be.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months - first such trimmer I&#x27;ve owned, and I&#x27;ve liked it quite a bit.  When the blades get dull eventually, I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll buy another just like it.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Hubby likes it as a replacement for an older model (that lasted about 6 years!).</li>
            <li> The T980 is a one piece adjustable trimmer, easy to use and works as advertised.  You don&#x27;t have to mess with different heads or other attachments which you will probably lose over time anyhow. Simple is better!</li>
            <li> This unit works extremely well.  It has 9 different settings and does an excellent job of collecting facial hairs without making a mess.  This Beard Trimmer is well worth the money.  Also, it&#x27;s been about two months and I haven&#x27;t had to charge the unit.</li>
            <li> The product overall works good. The multiple settings are a good feature. Unfortunately their is supposed to be no hair falling out, since it has a collection chamber which is supposed to gather all the loose clippings. Most of mine still fall out on the sink. Charge holds well, although turbo mode will drain it faster.</li>
            <li> Vacuum seems to work well - i like not making a mess of shizz. Charge is lasting a while, although i just got it so not much time to judge.</li>
            <li> I misplaced the guide comb attachment on a trip, and despite the fact that every other Norelco trimmer&#x27;s guide comb is easily purchased online, it is impossible to find the T980&#x27;s guide comb.  Nice trimmer, but I really can&#x27;t use it now.</li>
            <li> Good except the mustache trimmer requires changing the head blade, which can be inconvenient.</li>
            <li> My young son who is fasinated with having a beard loves this little trimmer. It keeps his beard nice and trim. It defines his beard very well. He says it works great and is easy to use. Enough said!</li>
            <li> And it does trim well! It will work much better if clean, so make sure you use the little brush that comes with it to clean it well, removing the blade.  My bf loves it -- he threw away his old one.</li>
            <li> This thing is perfect for the nice fuzz to heavy beard trimming. I&#x27;ve always prefered trimming short than shaving mostly because its easier on my skin and doesn&#x27;t give me acne. It also sucks up the hairs better than I&#x27;ve ever seen it. With the turbo setting on, I only had 3 tiny hairs that missed the vaccuum. In my impression and with previous experiences, thats the best selling point for this trimmer. No one wants a mess to clean up with.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000FEF1V4 Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer]] &lt;br /&gt;The trimmer performs as advertised. It does a neat and consistent trimming and the \\&quot;vacuum\\&quot; feature works better on this model than it did on previous models. However it did not hold its charge after one use and did not work when I went on vacation in Europe. It was exchanged when I returned and the new one seems to work properly.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco Vacuum Trimmer and as before, this one has been a fine product.  I have no problems with the guard slipping to shorter lengths.  I wear a medium length full beard and I use this trimmer to shape and trim.  The battery life is fantastic(four trims so far), the turbo mode works perfectly, and the vacuum is good.  It is not difficult to clean. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The only issues I have had are the fact that this is not a duel voltage system and the design of the vacuum places the blades more towards the center of the head instead of right at the fromt.  With a bit of care the blade placement is easy to get used to.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been about 3 months since my purchase.  It&#x27;s a great product.  I experience none of the problems commented by the other reviewers.  In fact, I pressed down on the head of the unit to see if I could get it to change length settings, but it didn&#x27;t.  My only complaint about the unit is that the button is very easily depressed when it&#x27;s in the case.  Wish the case was molded plastic than cloth.  I kept hearing a humm while driving and then realized that it was the trimmer in my suitcase.  Other than that, it&#x27;s a solid product and I use it to shave my head as well as my beard.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product for my boyfriend who happens to have high standards for beard/hair trimmers.  This machine has a cool resevoir for hair- which makes cleaning up easier because it sucks in a lot of the hair.  It also comes with a nice black carrying case.  I think the Philips Norelco T980 Vacuum Trimmer is a great trimmer and recommend it highly (because of my bf&#x27;s good experience and approval).</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a well designed and manufactured gadget. The hair length selector is firm to adjust but the guide comb wiggles slightly front to back when raised. The vacuum is great, it catches 97% of my hair. I can use it about three times before it needs emptied. Cleaning is a breeze, since most of the hair is trapped. I like to use a dust remover air can to blast the excess hair away. The Turbo works well although there&#x27;s no need for it. It adds about 30-50% more speed (you decide) and 100% more noise. The power cord attaches quite snuggly in the bottom so no worries about it falling out. Although not flawless this is hands down the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
            <li> this shaver gets clogged very easily and if you want to make precise trims, you need to remove the one attachment and add the smaller one on. it cuts well, but is a messy process to change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you have more then like 1/8 inch of hair on your face, i would not get this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i bought it a few months ago and now and just going to buy a regular one. the vacuum feature is pretty worthless. you end up dropping less hair below you, but over a bigger radius, so it makes more mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this will really clog up and create a super mess if you try to use it when your hair is the least bit wet.</li>
            <li> I really wanted to love this trimmer.  Especially given the hefty price tag.  It trims as you would expect and the vacuum works well and is a must-have feature in my opinion.      Another must have feature is either Ni-Mh battery or the more expensive Lithium ion battery.  This has Neither it is the bad/cheapo/old Ni-Cad (Nickel Cadmium) with all the memory effects and shortened life span that implies.  For a device like this where you can&#x27;t swap the battery yourself and you can&#x27;t leave the job half done you will have to partially charge and then finish your trim.  Then you will recharge it fully, boom instant battery memory and shortened life.  Or maybe you re-charge it after every use?  That may be even worse...  I&#x27;ve been through this before, you are doomed to a useful life measured in months before the battery (and therefore the whole trimmer) craps out.     I researched on line and couldn&#x27;t discover what type of battery it was so I went in person to my local WM and looked at the packaging, still no hint.  So I bought it thinking they couldn&#x27;t possibly sell it at such a high price point with such an unsuitable battery.      I got it home and found in the instructions that the battery is Ni-Cad and soldered into place and must be disposed of properly.  I&#x27;ll be returning it and looking for a different vacuum trimmer with a battery that will be useful for longer than a few months.</li>
            <li> First trimmer I&#x27;ve used. No complaints. Hair at the top of the upper lip is difficult to reach with the main trimmer, but put on the mini-trimmer attachment (which takes about 5 seconds) and it&#x27;s a breeze. I&#x27;ve had no problem with it trimming an improper length or accidentally changing the setting while trimming. You have to be holding it really awkwardly for that to happen. Bottom line, this will help you keep your facial hair looking well-groomed.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace my old Norelco, only because the batteries died and they could not be replaced. So I made sure to pick a model that could be used by either recharging or plugged in directly.    The vacuum is nice, the turbo is nice, but I got it because of the adjustable cutting length and the ease of use. It&#x27;s nicer than my old Norelco, and it even trims a little better too :)</li>
            <li> Purchased back in 11/06. I use it about once a week. My concern with these types of items is will they hold up. So far this trimmer is holding up very well. The vacuum is definitely worth the extra money. I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this one for two years and I have loved it.  But I must say the battery is still old-fashioned Ni-Cad and the product itself hasn&#x27;t been updated in years.  Come on, in this day and age you can&#x27;t get away with not changing a design for three years.</li>
            <li> I have used this trimmer three or four times now, and it works well for me.  I have a full beard, which I trim for length.  I also trim the mustache, to keep it out of my mouth.  The trimmer does all this just fine.  The selection of lengths is good for me; I keep my beard fairly short (#6). I found the vacuum to be well worth while, to my surprise.  It collects all the trimmings very well, and does not leave lots of stray hairs on my shirt.[[ASIN:B000FED5D0 Philips Norelco T780 Rechargeable Vacuum Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> It made me WANT to shave, which is amazing.  It is easy to clean up, very smooth, very easy, very affordable, very cool looking, and very powerful.  Basically, if you want a really good beard trimmer, this is what you want.  The guard also comes off, and you can even replace the &#x27;shaver&#x27; with a smaller, more detailed &#x27;shaver&#x27; (which comes with it).  You just need to make sure to charge it after it arrives, because it is sort of weak (very powerful, especially with the TURBO BUTTON, but not as powerful).</li>
            <li> This trimmer works so much better than the others I have owned. Especially like the vacuum feature and I think my wife likes it even better!  Did find the depth control a bit awkward at first but gets easier everytime I use it.  I would give it a 4.5 out of 5.</li>
            <li> Being that my previous Norelco trimmer (a T770) took 10 hours to fully charge, I greatly liked how the T980 took just 70 minutes to do the same thing. And I just LOVE the mini-beard trimmer attachment!! Now I can trim my beard line, mustache and sideburn hair (with the help of vacuum power) without having to worry about a HUGE mess to clean up!! And the turbo power option? The 30% increase in vacuum power it provides helps out in situations where you have to hold the T980 in contorted, odd positions  to get the job done (i.e. upside down), and you don&#x27;t want hair that&#x27;s being cut coming out of the device.    In short, the Norelco T980 is a BIG improvement over the trimmer that I used to have!! And the price was pretty damn reasonable, too!! I definitely feel that I got my money&#x27;s worth when I purchased this product!!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband for Christmas, but it was more for me than for him because I was tired of cleaning up his beard hairs from around the sink when he was done trimming.  The vacuum works well it picked up about 90% of the hair.  Another added bennifit is that my husband said the vacuum seems to make the hair stand up better just before it&#x27;s cut so it makes a more clean and efficient trim than his last one.  His last one was a norelco too.  The one downfall of this one is that the plastic guard is far enough from the cutter that it stops him from getting a good trim right under the nose, but that is the same with all trimmers depending on what length setting you have it on.  Overall we have been very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> I used to have an old Norelco trimmer that used for years until it just wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore and bought this as the \\&quot;new and improved\\&quot; replacement and for the most part . . . it is.    Here is the short:    Pros:  Classic Design, Same quality and function, powerful vacum  Cons:  Not good for trimming to skin w/o Guard.    The Long:    Its form, design and cut remind me of my old Norelco (which is great) with only one major difference, the vacuum.  In order for the vacum to work there is a plastic vacum \\&quot;sleeve\\&quot; or \\&quot;guard\\&quot; that goes up to the teeth.  The other reviewers complained about close trimming without the full guard and I do agree that it is awkward to pull down the vacuum sleeve for a close trim but I found that on both this model and my old one, the teeth on the trimmer were too big for a comfortable close trim anyway, so I do not use that feature.  I instead use a fine tooth slid-up trimmer on another shaver for that.  I disagree with the noise complaints, I thought the vacuum was only slightly louder than the actual trimmer and there was plenty of suction at the lower setting, which you can&#x27;t hear over the trimmer. Overall, a great classic Norelco trimmer.</li>
            <li> I bought this mainly to use on my beard, which grows quickly. Overall, I like it. It&#x27;s not the best (most powerful) trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had, but its other features make up for what it lacks in power.     The adjustable comb is easy to use and I don&#x27;t have to dig through the drawer in the bathroom to find a snap-on #3 comb I like to use and therefore always lose. The vacuum feature is nice and makes cleaning up small jobs easier, especially since I don&#x27;t have to sweep hair off a wet sink afterwards. Cleaning is straightforward as all the pieces come apart and go back together pretty easily. The turbo feature is also helpful. My beard is very coarse, and tends to jam up most trimmers. This one gets hung up sometimes, but if I go slowly and don&#x27;t try to cut too much at once, it works fine.     One note: The hair \\&quot;reservoir\\&quot; under the vacuum fills up quickly, so it&#x27;s better to use this more often on smaller jobs than waiting to do a bigger trim.</li>
            <li> Had this for about 2 years now and its pretty good. It has a nice vacuum feature but some hairs still escape the vacuum, but it&#x27;s beats cleaning up the entire sink!  What I like most about it is the option to plug in to AC directly and not have to wait for the charge.      Probably the best trimmer out there from what I researched.  Two years later still don&#x27;t have the same features for new trimmers.    Buy one.</li>
            <li> This is a great way to trim your beard. A definite step up from traditional trimmers. The magic in it is the vacuum that captures and stores trimmed beard and mustache hair instead of letting it fall into your sink to make a mess. You don&#x27;t make your lady mad, and everyone is happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer itself fits comfortably in your hand. It has an detachable cord that allows the unit to be charged. It can operate on the cord or off it&#x27;s batteries for cordless use. The trimmer is NOT submersible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attached guard can be adjusted to 9 length settings with a rotating selector. It can also be taken off for trimming necklines or other areas. There is also a separate smaller attachment that can be used for precision cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum is power and made more powerful over earlier models through the use of the \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; button that amps up the cutting power and vacuum power substantially.  When you are done cutting your hairs are captured in a removable tray for disposal. There are still a few hairs that don&#x27;t get sucked up but it a huge improvement over using trimmers without suction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only negatives are that the hair capture cup is a tad small. There is also a plastic piece that guides hair into the cup that makes neck and cheek-line trimming a little tricky until you get the hang of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a great trimmer for those of us real men with beards. A must have!!</li>
            <li> I got this shaver as a surprise for my husband. It seems to work really well for him. The vacuum part works really well and doesn&#x27;t leave too much hair in the sink, and DH gets a nice, even trim. Plus, it&#x27;s nice to have a comb that varies in height rather than a set of combs that could get lost.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this trimmer.  I had an older model that my son took to college and I was looking a bit scruffy.  The first time I set it to \\&quot;4\\&quot;.  I was used pushing down hard to get an even trim with my old one.  Well with this new one I pushed so hard that the trimmer length setting was reduced.  I didn&#x27;t realize what was happening until it was all the way down to \\&quot;1\\&quot;.  I wound up shaving it off.  I regrew my facial hair and haven&#x27;t had any problems since.  I just don&#x27;t push as hard and I make sure it is firmly set on the length I want.  BTW: the vacuum feature works great.</li>
            <li> This product is absolutley magnificant.  The turbo settings really help with the hair suction and there is virtually no mess and no clean up of hairs required.  The trimmer blades work very well and the unit is so quiet even surprisingly on the turbo setting.  Overall, this product is a must have for beginners all the way up to the most experienced beard and mustache groomers out there</li>
            <li> A great product. The vacuum feature works very well, leaving little to no cleanup.  Battery life is long-lasting as well, even when constantly using the Turbo function.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a 4 year old Norelco G390 which served me reasonably well for the past 4 years till its NiCd battery died (bought at a \\&quot;warehouse\\&quot; store for just under $20).&lt;br /&gt;There are over 600 reviews with an average of 4 stars and I thought \\&quot;how can 600+ people be wrong?\\&quot; so I bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dumb idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t go through all the pros and not even all the cons so you&#x27;ll need to read other reviews, I&#x27;ll just focus on why I simply can&#x27;t use it and had to return it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The distance from the comb interface to the blade - the part that goes up and down and stays at the same distance from the blade - is 1/8 inch longer than on the G390. This is due to the vacuum duct. As a result I was simply not able to get all the way up my mustache to trim it - it simply hit the nose. Other angles of approach or even the lowest trim setting didn&#x27;t work. I was left with a funny looking longer part of the mustache and looking like a dictator from the previous century which i will not name. I ended up taking the comb attachment off the blade and, using a real comb like hairdressers used to do, trimmer the rest of the way manually. Suffice to say I did not pay $[...] so I could do that.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll post the image comparing the G390 to this one on Amazon and you can see for yourself how it limit the reach of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The vacuum is useless. Sure, it capture a lot of the hair but enough of it drop out too. There is no way I would use it anywhere else but over a sink and even then I&#x27;ll have to clean both the sink and the little transparent bin - so why pay extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve returned it to Amazon the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to look for the G390 or another similar model from Norelco - the G390 was about half price, didn&#x27;t have vacuum or direct AC but did have multiple attachments, upright stand and lasted 4 years despite the antiquated battery technology.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome ive spent so much money on crappy shavers cause im always rocking a beard. This shaver keeps your girlfriend from yelling at you about hair every where and never loses power or charge it is the most useful product i have bought in years</li>
            <li> &#x27;Tornadoes&#x27; super warm beard trimmer and nose waxer was developed in the climates of Southern Arabia where men are known to never shave. This contributes to dry, coarse membranes which develop into flat tender sources for infection. This invention, a godsend, trims a beard, or shaves it all off, with the touch of a button and it also is great for bald patchy spots on top of the head.</li>
            <li> I like this product a lot.  All the reviews about the top of the trimmer falling off and ruining a trim seems bogus to me, but I can feel the pain of those who must have received defective products.  The vacuum feature seems about useless; it seems to pick up about half the hair, but the rest falls to the sink below. Not a big deal.  I really like the rechargable feathure and the option to plug in the trimmer if is out of juice.  My old Maverick had no recharging option and that was not a very good thing if the batteries dies all of a sudden, but I digress.  This trimmer is really nice and I recomend it, it works great, except for the suction feature, but hey when have us guys ever really cared about being neat and clean!</li>
            <li> In reading the reviews, I saw criticism over it&#x27;s lack of vacuum suction power. I don&#x27;t think so! If you need to give yourself a fade or any short length haircut, it&#x27;ll do fine. Just as long as you start off with not too long hair. Also, just be sure to open the window and chuck out some hair along the way (few times only). Really a great buy and worth the cost. Not as loud as people are saying on here. And it&#x27;s very light too. I was hesitating on these trimmers, but they have improved drastically.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the performance of this trimmer.  I use it in the high speed position and it does a very good job of trapping clippings.  Vacuum chamber empties conveniently.  I have not had any problems with the beard length setting noted in some of the posts.</li>
            <li> I was looking to find a groomer that was fast and could provide an even cut on my beard which consists of both straight and curly hair. This one sounded like the right choice plus it had the bonus vacuum feature, but some of the negative reviews about sudden cutting length changes almost made me pass it by. I am happy to say that I purchased the groomer and have had no problems at all with unwanted adjustment changes. With the amount of people complaining about this, I have no doubt that it can happen, but my guess is that in most cases if not all, it has more to do with the way the groomer is being held. I can imagine situations where with a death grip on the adjustment ring and extreme down pressure on the cutting head, one might be able to duplicate the problem during a direction change. I really like the vacuum feature and would put it the 90% range for effectiveness when taking your time and not trying to trim your beard when you&#x27;re already twenty minutes late! I have normal hearing and do not find the trimmer overly loud even in the turbo mode which for me is the only mode that I use as both the cutting and vacuum features work best at high speed and battery life remains very good.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my goatee for about 6-months.  It is hands down the best trimmer I have used to date.  Cuts are always even and neat. The vacuum does collect most of the loose hair, but there is still a ton that makes it into the sink.</li>
            <li> i love the vacuum feature. it doesn&#x27;t get every hair but it is better than a messy sink area. i had the previous model and it actually shaved closer. the new plastic guide is bigger on this one. no big deal...just means i need to trim everyday instead of skipping days.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco trimmer for over 15 years and was very happy with it. When it stopped working I bought the new T980 and really love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this unit to replace a 7-year old Norelco trimmer (that had an integral main blade and an integral mini pop-up blade, but no vacuum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Points:  Comfortable, not too noisy, even on \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; setting.  Strong blades clip everything in sight.  Mini trimmer blade is sharp and precise.  Guide pops off easily.  Comfortable to hold.  Vacuum does pick up lots of beard/stache clippings and it&#x27;s easy to empty clippings,too.  Easy to change lengths. Nice travel bag.  Battery life excellent (but do NOT overcharge and obey the drain-to-zero recommendations).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad Points:  Vacuum not strong enough to suck up all clippings...you&#x27;ll still need to trim over a sink or trash container, which really takes away from the advantage of having the vacuum (even on the Turbo setting).  Length indicator needs a stronger click-and-hold ratchet mechanism -- too easy to accidentally change length settings.  I miss the pop-up mini trimmer:  Having to manually swap out blades is a pain.  The trimmer can&#x27;t stand up, even temporarily...it can only be stored in the bag or lying down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary:&lt;br /&gt;This trimmer might be the best compromise of cost / features / functionality out there, but was disappointed with the vacuum capabilities even on Turbo.  I was very impressed by the cutting quality.</li>
            <li> Easy to adjust trim length. The vacuum works as well as expected...not perfect but fairly  effective.</li>
            <li> I just bought the Norelco T980 after reading many reviews from many different products. I had previously a BabyLiss product that lasted 3 years and then the battery died.   BIG PROS:  - Great vacuum. Takes over 95% of the hair.  - Corded in addition to Rechargeable Battery. That&#x27;s just great, because in 2 years time, if the battery dies, you can still use it.  - Very comfortable in the face.  - Nice design.  COMMENT ON CONS:  - In some reviews I read that the minimum length (1) is not short enough. I was a bit concerned before buying it, because I like to have a very short beard. Nevertheless, I find it PERFECT. It leaves you a beard of around 1mm length, so I DON&#x27;T THINK THAT&#x27;S A PROBLEM.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is a vast improvement over its predecessor from Norelco, a similar design that I owned for five years.  The battery is stronger, the motor and switch are improved, and the parts fit better.  The trim setting zoom works fine.  Only an inordinate amount of pressure would make it shift settings.  The attachment is useful for stray hairs in the nose and ears and for edging a moustache.  Unlike the previous model this comes with a compact case where the charger (smaller and lighter than before and now rated 110- 240V) and attachment can be kept.</li>
            <li> I purchased this gift for my boyfriend and it was great! He loves using it for edging up his beard and sideburns. The vaccum works descent collecting most but not all the hair. Its very easy to travel with also. Great gift for christmas or any other holiday.</li>
            <li> One of the worst products I&#x27;ve every purchased. Poor design clogs easily and requires frequent and messy cleanings to keep in operation. Even then, it takes forever to cut anything. My older Braun still does a better job (after 8 years!) than this does after one. Don&#x27;t be seduced by the specs an neat-looking design. Where it counts, this fails completely.</li>
            <li> Father and two 20 something Son&#x27;s all use this for assorted beard and mustache grooming with no complaints! Noise level is minimum, vacuum and removable \\&quot;waste\\&quot; compartment are very nice additions. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for my husband in the past.  He was very impressed with the ease of use and the length of battery life after charging.  My son recently requested a trimmer so, of course, I ordered him the same one.  Why mess with a good thing?</li>
            <li> Had an older version which used to spray hair everwhere. While not perfect, the vacuum feature on the T980 is wonderful. Much cleaner. I am slightly disappointed how difficult it is to use the piece for under the mustache.</li>
            <li> Easily adjustable from 3/4 in. to very short stubble. Vacuum works great for keeping area clean.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is so much improved over the older trimmer that I had been using for the past couple of years. It does an excellent job at capturing the trimmed hairs though not all of them it sure doesn&#x27;t leave much behind to be cleaned up. It&#x27;s not too loud and for those very early morning trimmings you can turn the turbo off as to not disturb anyone who may be sleeping in the next room over.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco Vacuum trimmer and this new design is fantistic while on turbo power rarely see any cut hair on counter or in sink. Very clean and neat. [[ASIN:B000FEF1V4 Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> Not a bad trimmer. Had a Wahl trimmer before and it broke within a year. This unit is unique in that it has a built in vacuum. It catches short hairs, but long hair tends to clog the inlet. As a result it reduces the trimming quality unless the inlet is cleaned and dispenser emptied. I am glad for the shorter blade that helps define the trim edges and areas around the moustache.&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am pleased with the product. However, not worth the $40. Less than $25 fits in the price  range .</li>
            <li> I have owned this trimmer for about a month.  It does an excellent job.  I love the vacuum.  It keeps the hair from clogging the sink.    The guard is a little delicate and needs to be handled with care.  It is difficult to get it back in place without breaking it but as long as you are careful it will not be a problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several beard trimmers over the years but the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer is the best one by far for providing an even beard and mustache trim while doing a good job in turbo mode of vacuuming up the beard clippings.    I highly recommend it and have purchased two of them; one for my main home and one for a vacation home.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer i have had upto now. I have used Remingtion/Wahl&#x27;s etc but this seems to be the best. And the best part is, the vaccum actually works for upto 70% of my hair which is very dense.    I love it.</li>
            <li> the only reason i got this trimmer was because of its vacuum function and its disappointing.   the trimmer does a good job of trimming like so many other trimmers but its vacuum function only sucks in 50% of the hair on turbo! which really doesnt make a difference since u still have to waste the same amount of time cleaning up that you would with other non-vacuum trimmers.  so if your looking to buy a trimmer that spares you the mess and saves time, this ain&#x27;t the one.</li>
            <li> This is one great trimmer. I&#x27;ve had many and they spewed the fur all over the place. I like the vacuum, it keeps those small wiskers in the built in collector. Can remove the variable adjustable clipper section for a real close trim on the beards outer fringes. One thing i&#x27;d like to see is an upright holder, no big deal though.   Great product...........</li>
            <li> Light, good power however design leaves a bit to be desired, e.g., the on/off button and the &#x27;turbo&#x27; button are easily and unintentionally turned on or off -- should have been recessed or different switch device used; similarly, the trim adjustment wheel shifts from one setting to another way to easy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this trimmer for about the last two years. It does the job pretty well. However, recently the removable hair catching unit got stuck and, when I pulled too hard, the plastic broke. I checked Norelco&#x27;s website but the catcher didn&#x27;t show up in the replacement parts list. I then called Norelco and was told that the hair catching unit is not an available replacement part. It seems absurd that the only removable part on the unit, a part that is removed regularly as a part of its function, a part that is made of fragile plastic, would not be available for replacement. This means that because I broke two cents worth of plastic, I now have to toss out a $40 beard trimmer. I&#x27;m now looking for a trimmer with no removable parts and, preferably, without the Norelco name on it.</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the trimmer, like the small attachable close edge piece.. Good value for price..</li>
            <li> I love this product! It does everything it is supposed to do, and I usually complain about SOMETHING with every buy, but I have nothing to complain about with this beard trimmer. Besides the fact that it&#x27;s a little bit loud. &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> This is an easiest and most accurate trimmer I used to own over last 10+ years.  And cheapest too! :-)    Buy it and enjoy the simplicity and efficiency.</li>
            <li> After all the other reviews I read on this I guess I expected too much.  It&#x27;s another piece of China junk.  The on/off switch is too large so it&#x27;s constantly getting turned off in use.  The adjustable attachment for length fell off between cutting strokes &amp; I gouged me beard.  That sucked!  I was expecting a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to replace a cheap-o Remington razor I bought at Walmart. This razor is great! It adjusts to provide a very close and even trim. The vacuum works extremely well. The charge lasts a very long time. And the carrying case is big enough to carry the razor, the attachments, and the charger with a little room to spare!    I only have a few minor complaints:    The blades doesn&#x27;t work well for trimming head-hair. You won&#x27;t be giving any haircuts with this razor.     It also doesn&#x27;t work well on sideburns. You have to use the mini-trimmer attachment, which works great but is on the small side (making it slightly more difficult to cut a straight line). Also, the vacuum functionality doesn&#x27;t work quite as well with the mini-trimmer, so there will be some mess.    Finally, while the adjuster ring generally performs well, it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;click\\&quot; at the right spot in the low number range. I set the ring to &#x27;2&#x27;, but it doesn&#x27;t usually \\&quot;click\\&quot; until I get to ~2.5. It _does_ lock when it&#x27;s set to &#x27;2&#x27;, it just doesn&#x27;t make the \\&quot;click\\&quot; sound to let me know it&#x27;s locked. This may just be something on the razor I got.    While I&#x27;m talking about the ring, I will say that I haven&#x27;t had any issues with the adjuster ring switching to lower numbers mid-shave. If you have this issue, you are either pushing down _way_ too hard, or you have (in my opinion) a defective unit.    All-in-all, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone wanting a good trimmer with less mess.</li>
            <li> At first, people think this is some kinda sex-toy from the future. It&#x27;s not. It&#x27;s a beard trimmer. And a pretty good one to boot. If you&#x27;re like me, you use your beard trimmer when you don&#x27;t have much time in the morning before you have to take off for work. If you trim with this thing quickly on the &#x27;normal&#x27; trimming mode, it&#x27;ll catch maybe 75% of your hair in the vaccuum. However, when you enter warp speed (turbo mode) this thing is insane. It&#x27;s really loud and sounds like it might explode, but it works great. It catches roughly 90-95% of hair in the vacuum in turbo mode. It&#x27;s quite easy to take apart to empty out the little hair-catch-all and clean trimmer attachments or swapping them out (comes with a fine-line trimmer). The height adjustment doesn&#x27;t seem quite as pronounced as my older Norelco trimmer (meaning you can obviously tell when it clicks into place...this one not so much) but it works nonetheless. I&#x27;m happy with it and recommend it to all who read this. Just be sure to take a minute out of your abnormally busy day to read the instructions and precautions and maintenance tips to prolong the life of this thing. That&#x27;s what they&#x27;re there for, after all.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I&#x27;ve used. I received it as a gift &amp; was fully prepared for the vacuum feature to be a gimmick. It isn&#x27;t. It seems to catch just about all the stubble &amp; makes trimming a lot easier. It needs to be emptied after each use, naturally. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I find the guard over the clippers a little awkward to fit but overall I think the product is excellent.</li>
            <li> I wonder if all these reviews are pertaining to this particular model, some reviews dont sound like my unit. I find no real problem with mine. Nothing is perfect. It is a bit bigger than my old small Wahl, but it has more features that require that. The vacumn works great, which alone makes my purchase of it worthwhile to me; in the past the sink always had a lot of nasty looking hairs all over it. Ive never had mine switch length setting on me, as some people describe, I dont see how it could. I think the adjustable length feature is really great, it accomodates about &#x27;any&#x27; length beard, and eliminates all the extra little clip-on guides you have to keep track of. I gave up on trying to take the top off but it doesnt matter as there really is no need. I find no problem with excess noise, or with the turbo setting. Im very happy with mine. Also, this amazon price of $39.95 is $20 less than on the Norelco website, plus you get free shipping.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is the best that I have ever used! Sharp both in trimming comfort and apearance. Cuts and vacumes fast and efficiently. It appears to be of the kind of quality that last for many years...... and when it does wear out,I will purchase another one!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace another Norelco beard trimmer with a dead battery.  The T980 works well for me, using the shortest setting (3 day stubble, I think).  The vacuum feature is good, keeps the mess to a minimum, but not perfect.  It holds a charge for a few weeks (based on using it 2 x week, 5 min each), recharges quickly, works with or without the cord.  My only complaint is the size of the trimmer head.  It&#x27;s pretty large, and the blades are set back about 1/2 inch from the edge, so it&#x27;s hard to get close in some areas (nose and ears).</li>
            <li> This trimmer seems to be more for men with full beards or thicker, fuller facial hair- I have only a small goatee and med. sideburns and it seems to be overkill for me.  Otherwise, it works great so far and seems to be a nice trimming tool.  The vacuum does work really well, and the noise does not bother me -as some others have mentioned it being way too loud- in my opinion its not too loud.  And, yes, for what its worth, as others have pointed out- it does indeed resemble a futuristic dildo!</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco trimmer.  The first one was great and lasted years.  However I needed a replacement ASAP. My local didn&#x27;t carry this one or the one I had and I bought a different brand and was very disappointed.  My old one was so good I decided to wait it out and order it online.  Exceeded expectations!</li>
            <li> This model works as well as or better than an earlier one for which I bought this as a replacement (the older battery would no longer hold a charge). The length control works perfectly well (I don&#x27;t know why some referred to unexpected changes in that regard. It does not change unless you choose to do so). Some complained about the noise level. No, it won&#x27;t make you deaf--it will just remind you of the need for recharging.</li>
            <li> The vacuum is a nice feature which keeps the hair from falling in the sink or on the floor. Trims pretty good also.</li>
            <li> This is my second vacuum trimmer.  I loved the first, but it eventually had the power circuit just die. The T 980 works even better for beard and mustache grooming.  Haven&#x27;t tried the alternate fine trimmer.  This battery has many times the life of the older model it replaced after a month or so of use.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my Norelco T-1000 (then found out I could have bought a replacement battery for 10 bucks)which worked just fine until the battery died. The decision to buy was mostly impluse, though I did check Amazon&#x27;s ratings, but I forgot to read the lowest ratings first! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; I keep a close cut beard or stubble, so I don&#x27;t need the adjustable settings above maybe # 3 ... &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t care about having a vacuum cause I trim over the sink and just rinse it out. Seems like they concentrate on that feature more than the basic design.  Not impressed. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;contour\\&quot; spring loaded thing is a joke, I removed it.  The charger unit is so bulky and heavy that it will not hang on the wall socket.  I have to use an extension cord from the wall and set the \\&quot;brick\\&quot; charger on the counter.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Did not like the feel of the unit right out of the box either, it feels rather cheap (which it is), unlike my old unit.  It&#x27;s fairly large and and bulky, like the charger! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know what the blue plastic floating shield thing is in front of the cutters, but it makes hard to judge depth when trimming without the adjustable guide on. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll use it for the time being, then donate it to the thrift store when I find a better unit.  Not worried about paying forty bucks, as I can afford to toss away cash at the this moment.   Got free shipping too, unlike Ebay sellers that are charging 20 bucks to ship!</li>
            <li> I bought the T980 to replace my older model Norelco trimmer, which died after several years of regular use.  The vacuum feature really does work pretty well-doesn&#x27;t pick up every clipped whisker, but I would guess it sucks up about 90%, which ain&#x27;t bad.  The trimmer also has two clipper heads, one for tight trimming, and the other for overall work.  One does have to use the \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; feature all the time, which boosts the suction; the \\&quot;Normal\\&quot; setting doesn&#x27;t quite do the trick.  Overall I&#x27;m very happy with this appliance, and heartily recommend it.</li>
            <li> The good the bad and the ugly. Here goes. I&#x27;ve always sworn by Norelco trimmers. I&#x27;ve owned several. They normally last reasonably well. I normally get 5 years of use out of them. I say reasonably well because in this day and age, 5 years is good but I prefer things to last 20 years like they used too. Sadly; that&#x27;s not going to happen. The adjustable guide is the best design that I have found. Far better than similar units that use multiple guides that can get lost, damaged and require additional storage space. The turbo function does work, it has enough high power that calling it &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; is not only cool but accurate. The charge/low battery lights function well. The vacuum functions well. I&#x27;ve tried other manufactures so called vacuum units and found that not only did they not work they were a total disappointment. This vacuum system works! Removing and installing the guide was a bit tricky at first but you get used to it. The single thing that I miss is the slide up mini trimmer. Frankly; I would rather have that than the vacuum. Still, I like this product and recommend it! I have had it about a year now and it still works perfect!  Update: 3 years old and like new!  Update: 5 years old, still like new! If it ever fails I&#x27;ll be buying another Philips/Norelco.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace an older model Norelco trimmer without a vacuum function.  Cuts well, I notice no problem with the height adjustment not staying locked in selected setting as others have mentioned.  Vacuum function definately works well.  I find it a little bit noisy in turbo mode.  My only complaint, and it&#x27;s not really a complaint, is I did like the simplicity of my older model in just removing the hair comb to use the trimmer head for the detail work.  Because of the vacuum attachment you can&#x27;t do that with this trimmer, you need to remove the comb, and then replace the trimmer head with a smaller trimmer attachment that sticks up past the vaccuum catch.  This attachement works well, but it is a little on the small side and I&#x27;m still getting used to it.  It works fine, but I wish you didn&#x27;t need to go that extra step of switching out the trimmer blades.  If you don&#x27;t really care about the vacuum function you might want to keep in mind that trade off.  Overall, I am very pleased with the purchase, and you can&#x27;t beat it for under $30 shipped.</li>
            <li> I like the beard trimmer, but you have to change the cutting blade to do close trimming.  Kind of a pain.  I like my older razor where the small cutter popped up from the main unit instead of having to change cutting heads.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works great, it works with and without the cord, and it is easy to use. I highly recommend it to anyone!    Edit: after several use, I saw that actually this is not a good product at all. First of all, you can easily change the size adjustment during the usage, and you can end up with uneven beard/hair! Second, you have to clean the vacuum chamber really often, once every 10 seconds or so depending on the hair size! If I could, I would remove my 4 stars and put 1 instead! I couldn&#x27;t use it anymore. I bought Panasonic ER224S All-in-One Cordless Hair and Beard Trimmer (Silver) from Amazon.  I am happy, really happy with the Panasonic. Don&#x27;t buy this Philips Norelco, buy the Panasonic, which is cheaper, easier to handle, more accurate and waterproof!</li>
            <li> Ok, here&#x27;s my summary review of this trimmer.     I&#x27;ve had a T900 trimmer for a few years now and wanted to upgrade to a new and hopefully better trimmer. I&#x27;ve had it now for two weeks and here&#x27;s what I think...    * The vacuum is great, period. When shaving with my Norelco T900, the shavings would fly all over the place --- in the sink, behind the faucet, in between the handles of the faucet, and on the floor. With the vacuum set on low, I barely see any clippings now! Now, my wife doesn&#x27;t get mad any more!    * The height adjustment can be easily set, and unlike other reviews mention, I haven&#x27;t accidentally changed the setting without knowing.    * The clipper works great and easily cuts/trims without any effort. This is an upgrade from my T900.     * Battery holds its charge pretty well. You can use it with a power cord also when the battery is low.     * The smaller trimmer is a now a separate attachment. My T900 has it attached to the trimmer, and it can be popped up or down when needed. To me, this is a downgrade as it is not as convenient.      * The parts seem somewhat delicate. I try to be careful as to not cause damage.     Overall, the price is good, it works well, and I&#x27;m glad I purchased it, and would recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer quite a bit. Feels well-made, big, and so far the battery life has been outstanding. The built-in vacuum may be the weakest part of it, but hey, it&#x27;s better than no vacuum at all. As long as you go slowly it does a fair job of sucking up the trimmings, so even that complaint is really a very minor one. I haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with the locking mechanism slipping down to a lower guard setting, and I apply a reasonable amount of pressure. Overall, great product, no regrets.</li>
            <li> Not sure how this thing got so many good reviews.  The device is completely useless at trimming my beard, and only works on the lowest setting (which is a really close trim).  Literally on any setting past the shortest setting, it won&#x27;t actually trim any hair.    Not sure who designed the springy gaurd but its clear just from looking at it that none of the hair actually gets close enough to the blades to get cut.    I have an old razor that plugs in and has 3 or 4 different adapters, and that works a lot better.    When it does cut, on the really short setting, the vacuum does actually work, but theres a plastic thing that gets in the way and makes it tough to shave with any accuracy.    Anyway, hope to prevent people from having the same frustrations I have after spending $40 for something that could barely shave your head much less something a bit more technical, like your face!</li>
            <li> I bought this because my wife complained that my beard was too long and shaggy. This did an excellent job trimming and shaping my beard, even to my wife&#x27;s satisfaction. It was easy to use and easy to clean. Well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Pros: It trims very well, nice range of adjustable settings, vacuum feature really does work, good battery and charger.  Cons: Big and bulky, gimmicky \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button and it&#x27;s noisy (probably due to vacuum.)    I was concerned about the reviewers that said it didn&#x27;t hold its setting adjustments during use but I don&#x27;t find that the case.  Either Norelco has fixed this or the reviewers with that problem like to press down really hard while trimming.    Good product, but seems expensive.  I was in hurry and bought at a local big box store so I overpaid.  The Amazon price seems about right for what it is.</li>
            <li> Price was definitely right.  Vacuum seems to work well enough, but the trimmer itself is awkward to use.  I&#x27;ve only used it three times and I&#x27;m still trying to get the trim length right.</li>
            <li> Does an excellent job with the trimming itself (I rarely shave, I just occasionally trim with this), and it definitely reduces the amount of hairs left lying all over the sink when I&#x27;m done, making cleanup easier, but it is still required. The vacuum does not capture everything, and only makes less of a mess. Don&#x27;t expect to avoid cleanup entirely with its use.</li>
            <li> This trimmer feels great on the face and in the hand. It&#x27;s sleek and smooth. The vac works great and leaves no mess. Very quite operation. Holds a charge for weeks. Have no need for the turbo mode, works fine in normal mode. Might be needed if removing beard or something. Comes with a small touch up blade that is simple to swap out. Also includes a nice large case that holds everything plus some. This is a major advancement in retail trimmers. Overpriced in stores, not too bad on Amazon.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works well in turbo mode for my beard, which I keep fairly short.  I&#x27;m not sure why there are two speeds; maybe the lower speed is for different whisker types or for longer lengths.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend starting on a higher length setting and adjusting it shorter until it cuts at the desired length. The first time I used it I set it on \\&quot;2\\&quot; which turned out to be much shorter than I would have liked.      I especially like the vacuum feature.  Prior to getting this trimmer, there was hair all over the bathroom sink and counter that had to be wiped up after every trim session.    My only real complaint is that the unit I received has a flaw in the clear plastic window that covers the \\&quot;length\\&quot; number making it hard to see the number.   I would buy it again.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco trimmer that lasted several years and loved it. The main reason I chose the T980 over the T765 is that it can be operated from the plug. However, the comb is difficult to re-attach after cleaning and ultimately busted completely after less than 2 months of use. The vacuum is a nice feature but the receptacle is not secure, sometimes sending hair flying everywhere. The worst part is the vacuum feature makes it impossible to use the bare blade to trim edges; you have to use a separate attachment for this. The button to operate the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature (totally unnecessary) is extremely cheap and came off the first time I pressed it. Norelco / Philips trimmers are definitely the way to go, but don&#x27;t shell out the extra money for the shoddily designed extra features. Get the T765, I just did as a replacement for this piece of dung.</li>
            <li> This T980 is great.  It may be a tad louder than normal trimmers but its worth it.  Having the built-in vac suck up most of the trimmings makes cleaning up a cinch.  And the turbo is a god sent for my coarse beard.  The battery life is awesome.  I would highly recommend this trimmer to anyone.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer ([[ASIN:B000UCBFKW Norelco T980 turbo vacuum beard and moustache trimmer.]]) is very fine, and I have no complaints at all about it&#x27;s use.  It takes a little learning, but is otherwise great.  I bought it through Amazon, in late October 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have a problem.  The catch basket for the vacuum is falling apart when I remove it.  Now, that&#x27;s no big.  It&#x27;s a very light and fragile basket.  So I contacted Philips Norelco today to buy a couple of backup replacements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Norelco not only DOESN&#x27;T sell any, they WON&#x27;T sell any.  The best they will do is send an RMA to replace the entire unit.  I told them that&#x27;s just damn nuts, and I don&#x27;t care if they&#x27;re willing to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what I&#x27;m asking, has anyone else had this problem?  How did you fix it if you did?  I&#x27;m thinking that it wouldn&#x27;t take much to glue or otherwise fix the thing.  Just wanted to see if anyone else had any ideas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why don&#x27;t I just take the new, free unit?  Because the idea of replacing an entire damn unit because one little plastic part is just stupidity, and I&#x27;m not in the habit of encouraging that.  Sure, some bean counter some place decided that if they didn&#x27;t have an inventory of spare parts, they could save money.  Yeah, right.</li>
            <li> The title pretty much says it all.  If this works, great.  However, getting this thing to work is the issue.</li>
            <li> Never had a problem with it.</li>
            <li> Integrated mustache trimmer and a more positive lock on the height adjustment would make this a much better product.</li>
            <li> In this day and age when almost all portable electronic products are universal power based, I regret to inform you that the Norelco Trimmers are mono voltage and cannot be operated outside the US. The unit can be charged only from (110v /120V).  Neither the Philips nor the Amazon websites point this out to buyers.    Since I travel outside of the US quite a bit, it is a big hassle to use this trimmer with a voltage converter.  I wish Philips would seriously consider this issue and improve on the product, hence two star rating.</li>
            <li> This is my 3rd or 4th beard trimmer. I bought this one because I wanted one that also worked when it was plugged in (I don&#x27;t have where to leave it plugged in). That works well but I am really impressed with the vacuum feature. It really works as advertised. Very little cleanup required afterwards - makes for a happy spouse.</li>
            <li> My husband likes this trimmer much better than the older model he had.  The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect, so some of the trimmings still get in and around the sink.  He loves that it has a battery indicator so he knows when it needs to be charged.  The old one stayed plugged up all the time because he didn&#x27;t want it it be dead when he needed to use it.  This one is much better because it has a light that comes on when the battery is low.  So far, he hasn&#x27;t had to charge it much.</li>
            <li> Look and feel is very stylish and the blade technology is pretty impressive. Only thing I feel is that the construction is not as solid as it appears specially when you hold it. The door to the compartment where all the hair gets collected seems a bit fragile when applied some force to open which it needs to be opened. Ergonomics are pretty good on this one but it may take a while to get used to it if you have been using other brands. In general, I am quite happy with this equipment.     The only complain I have is from Amazon which dropped the price immediately after I bought it :( during thanksgiving. There should be a price protection for few days for consumer confidence.</li>
            <li> This was a complete waste of money.  It doesn&#x27;t cut the beard hair evenly and the length guide slips so that it will suddenly cut your beard down to nearly bald with no warning.  The craftsmanship feels flimsy and on the shortest setting it scratches up the skin.  The suction feature doesn&#x27;t work well and you end up with hair everywhere to clean up.  Please save your money and buy something that works!</li>
            <li> Delivery was fast in a good condition. The item we were expecting. My husband enjoy using it</li>
            <li> Only tried it once so far -- for beard trimming -- but it&#x27;s very promising.    The \\&quot;mowing\\&quot; operation -- getting my beard to an even length -- went extremely well.  It was easy, the results were good, and the vacuum did a surprisingly good job of capturing most of the trimmed hair.    The \\&quot;edging\\&quot; operation was a little less successful, but I think that new personal care products like this always take a little while to get used to.  I&#x27;m optimistic that I&#x27;ll go from liking it to loving it with a little practice.    And the battery ran the trimmer strongly throughout that first session.  It&#x27;s a Ni-Cad battery, so you KNOW it will disappoint you in the end, but:    - The instructions are very clear about how to maximize a Ni-Cad battery&#x27;s life.    - You can always fall back to corded operation.  (That&#x27;s a smart design.)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this trimmer for about 1 year now. It doesn&#x27;t get a lot of use, I only trim about every 1.5-2 weeks (yes, I&#x27;m a bit lazy like that). So at most, I&#x27;ve used the trimmer about 35 times. It should work longer and better than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few uses ago I went to pull out the little plastic trimmings compartment and the front of the compartment pulled off, leaving the rest inside the unit. It appears that these pieces are just glued together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second strike is that it doesn&#x27;t catch about 20% of the trimmed hair, even in Turbo mode. I&#x27;ve tried it trimming very short amounts of hair, or longer. It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The third strike is that 2-3 times during a trimming I have to remove the trimming guide, and then the blades to remove hair from underneath the blades. I don&#x27;t see why hair should get trapped under there, but it does and reduces the trimming ability significantly. I don&#x27;t think I should have to dismantle the trimmer to trim my beard. It&#x27;s done this since day one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, it works pretty well. With some patience and a bit of mess it does a pretty good job at trimming. This is my third Norelco trimmer, none of them seem to have much staying power, my other two had similar clogging issues with the blade, and both had the rechargeable battery die.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome.  It works really well and priced right.  The battery holds a charge for a long time between uses.  The height adjusts easily.  My only concern is the strength of the door.  I think it might break off after several uses.</li>
            <li> I am a firm believer in facial hair, but often try to avoid that shaggy look.  The cat mistakes my face and starts nuzzling a little too enthusiastically.      I have trimmed with scissors, rasors, the old cip on guard trimmers and the grandfather of this trimmer which just recently died after 7 years of service (not bad Norelco!).  Like its grandfather, the click adjustable guard is the single best reason to buy one of these trimmers.      It does struggle a little bit with longer bushy hairs (as most do), but works like a champ when keeping previously trimmed ones in check.  Clean up is fairly easy, plus this one looks really cool.    The only thing I am not inlove with is, and that it has a super rechargeable battery which will have to be removed one day and recycled appropriately.  Replacement batteries and recycling can be a challenge, and I&#x27;d almost rather just have a corded mode.  Otherwise I totally love it.     The vacuum and turbo vacuum featured on this model are an interesting new rendition, and they do a fair job capturing most (not all) of the shavings.  Admittedly though I have only used the turbo vacuum on my person as I cant imagine a situation when you&#x27;d want less suckage... except to make this more stealthy when you have a few beers and decide its time to shave the cat... having done so, the cat is now afeard of both the trimmer and any other vacuum noises.  Even a long drag though a straw now makes Mitsy Boots nervous.  My sink drain and my wife are quite grateful with the vacuum, the cat not so much.</li>
            <li> I have owned various panasonic beard trimmers for past 20 years, untli the non-replaceable batteries go bad.  This is the first one I have had which sucks the trimmings into a built-in container, which is a great idea.  The problem is it clogs every 2-3 strokes, which makes it unusable.  Now, if you use this on a daily or every 2-3 day basis, and are cutting hairs taht are 1/8\\&quot; long, for instance, I bet it would work well.  But when you do trimming every 1-2 weeks, and the hair is 1/4\\&quot; or longer for head hair, it will clog, and this product is not for you.  So I would give it 0 stars if you are like me, or 4 stars if you plan on using it constantly, for an overall score of 2 stars.</li>
            <li> Such a wonderful product.  I&#x27;ve had numerous trimmers over the years and this beats them all by miles.</li>
            <li> Although no beard trimmer is perfect, this is the best I&#x27;ve ever used in 15 years and is as close to perfect as you&#x27;ll ever find. Long battery life, good vacuum that leaves sink pretty clean, great adjustable lengths, got this in the mail in less than 48 hours, great buy! The more I use it, the more I appreciate it. After you&#x27;ve used it about 3 or 4 times, you&#x27;ll really understand how to use it and love it. I cannot say enough about it. The only thing I can say negative about it is the it is hard to reach that little moustache area directly under the nostrils, but that is usually the case for trimmers and razor blades.</li>
            <li> I have had the Norelco for over a month and use it regularly.  I have not had some of the negative experiences others have had.  It did not magically switch levels causing my beard to be cut unevenly.  That was a real concern I had was that it would be so loose that it would not keep the proper height adjustment but I have not had a slip, a inadvertent level change, nor have I had a problem with the buttons switching from turbo to regular speed.  I have read one should not \\&quot;push too hard.\\&quot;  I have not had to \\&quot;push\\&quot; at all.  I read and followed the instructions and it has performed excellently.  It has functioned very well.  It is easy to clean and the vacuum actually works well.  There is very little mess to clean up.  I am sure every product purchased will have some kind of \\&quot;negative,\\&quot; but I have not experienced any that were listed in the 1-2 star reviews.  I liked it so much, that I bought the Norelco Arcitec electric razor.  That is how much it impressed me!  It is a trustworthy, reliable product that performs much better than the Remington and Wahl I previously owned. It even has done a remarkable job maintaining its charge.  I am impressed with the Norelco products, their performance, and value.  As with all products, I would recommend that you read the instructions on proper use and not just pull out of the box and wonder what is wrong or why it does not perform like your old trimmer.</li>
            <li> There are plenty of reviews on this trimmer so I won&#x27;t go into detail - but I did want to make sure I rated the item.  I think overall the trimmer is a good product - it does what it is supposed to do.  After a few months of use (1-2 times a week), I developed my own pro&#x27;s con&#x27;s for the trimmer.  It replaced a very cheap Remington trimmer that I had for years (the rechargable battery no longer held a charge) and although I know \\&quot;change\\&quot; can be tough after using something for several years, there are a few things I just can&#x27;t get past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. having to remove the general trimmer and replace it with the mini trimmer is more of a PITA than I thought it would be.  My old Remington had a built in mini-trimmer that flipped up on the back side - nothing to remove - just flip up and use.  On the Philips, pulling the gate off and swapping the basic trimmer for the mini trimmer is pretty annoying.  Granted it&#x27;s not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of life or my morning routine, but it is still pretty annoying.  When you remove the gate and start swapping parts, some of the hair that did make its way into the vacuum chamber now gets scattered about again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. many have complained about the height adjustment changing on them... I have not encountered this. I can add that for me, none of the settings match my old Remington.  This is not so much a reflection on the product, but more of a: \\&quot;keep in mind, you&#x27;ll have to adjust to this new product&#x27;s height - it doesn&#x27;t adjust to you\\&quot;.  I keep my hair short and for me 3 is too long and 2 is too short.  I needed a 2.5.  I find that if I press really hard in the 3 setting, I can get close, but it seems to take a lot of work.  Again, not so much a complaint on the product, just personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  For whatever reason, I can not seem to get the hairs on my lip that are close to the underside of my nose.  The trimmer gate seems to be so bulky that it hits my nose before the cutter can clip the hair.  I have to remove the gate and carefully trim the hairs using the height of the surrounding hairs that the trimmer did get as a guide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than those three annoyances, I can live with the vacuum not catching ALL of the hair (the Remington flung ALL of the hair everywhere).  Battery life seems solid, but I guess only time will tell.  Someone else mentioned they wished it came with a stand and I concur - it would be nice.  Overall it&#x27;s a solid product and for those with a lot of facial hair, I bet this would be a great purchase.te and carefully trim the hairs using the height of the surrounding hairs that the trimmer did get as a guide.

            <li> I dunno what people are doing to make this thing randomly change lengths but i pushed on it really hard and it didnt budge...  Vacuum gets about 95% of the hairs.  Overall I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> I read the reviews &amp; liked this model best.  So far so good.  I even used it to give my hair a buzz cut.  Only minor drawback is if you want to keep a longer beard or goatee, because the settings go approx 1 finger length, not much longer.  Easy-care &amp; low maintenance.  I like it!</li>
            <li> i got this, it&#x27;s huge, not a great shave, hard to get sharp lines around the sideburns or neck line.  mediocre.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it, I was not very impressed.  But each time I use it now, I am more pleased. Once you learn to use it, you will like it.  It is very powerful, even without the boost.  The vacuum is not perfect, but a lot better than not having one.  I have a full beard and it does not pull my facial hair when I use it. I would highly reccomend it.</li>
            <li> This has been a great beard trimmer for me.  The turbo really helps keep the hair in the trimmer.  It&#x27;s still going strong after several years.  What I don&#x27;t like is the cheap plastic hair holder, this broke after about a year and now I have to hold it in when I use it.  The way it broke can&#x27;t be replaced.  It might have broke after dropping it on the sink, I don&#x27;t remember it, but if the design were better it could be replaced.  If you are careful this will be a good trimmer for you.</li>
            <li> The early reports of issues where the blade height adjusts itself on its own seem to be gone.  I couldn&#x27;t see any way that could happen with this device now.  The vacuum feature is not perfect, but I&#x27;d say it gets about 90% of the trimmings.  I marked it down a star for that issue as well as the fact that there is a plastic spring-loaded piece that I think is there to help push the trimmings toward the vacuum, but when you remove the top for mustache trimming it would be nice if that piece moved out of the way so you can get maximum control of where you are cutting.  Otherwise it has worked well for the few weeks I&#x27;ve had it so far.</li>
            <li> I gave this product one star because the trimmer works very well, but I have had many trimmers that worked very well. What I expected when purchasing this product, and it does cost a lot more than most, is the vacuum that it advertises to work, and it clearly does NOT! Oh it does suck some of the hair into the chamber, but it left just as big a mess of the trimmed hair all over my bathroom counter, as all the other trimmers, that don&#x27;t have one. That to me is unacceptable, and I think Norelco should not be allowed to advertise as such!!! Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
            <li> Good product - vacuum (no stray bits of hair), self-sharpinging, holds a long charge, works in close quarters, very competative price</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re like me, you start out reading the 1 star reviews to find out what&#x27;s wrong with a product. You will see a lot of alarmist reviews claiming the trimmer shifts length settings without the person knowing. This does happen, but if and only if you have not set the razor attachment on correctly. The razor comes with a beard trimmer and a mustache trimmer, which involves switching attachments. Not setting the attachment on correctly will cause problems. However, if you set it up correctly (not difficult), then no problem occurs.    I like this razor because it has a long lasting battery, which makes the whole process much easier. It cleans easily, and captures a good amount of hair to prevent a giant sink mess. It cuts well, and accurately, although it does take me a while because you have to keep going over the beard to make sure all the hairs are cut to the same length. The mustache trimmer is a great addition as well, because it allows for some precision.    So assuming you can figure out how to work this product correctly, it should do exactly what you need it to!</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a dial-like setting for determining the length of hair. Unfortunately the razor has a VERY bad spring/strength mechanism for holding the desired length in place; i.e.: I like to shave at a \\&quot;3\\&quot; and by the mere act of pressing the razor against my face [HEAVAN FORBID!!], it pushes the guide down to level \\&quot;2\\&quot; &amp; \\&quot;1\\&quot; which are closer to the blades and lead to considerably shorter hair.  I thought this was simply a manufacturing fluke when I first bought it, so I returned the trimmer directly to Norelco (very friendly service).  The replacement they sent was &#x27;stiffer&#x27; for a couple of months, but now it&#x27;s back to the same ol&#x27; defect - I&#x27;m left with a beard that looks like I just haven&#x27;t shaved for a week.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product because blades are too expensive these days and I&#x27;m just not a morning person.  I like the stubble look so after searching product reviews, purchasers of the 980 seemed confident in it&#x27;s ability to take care of business on setting #1.      It does a great job, 90% of hair gets sucked into the trap.  No facial irritation.    The only thing you may need is a regular razor to shape your beard&#x27;s edges.  With the length guard removed you can get pretty close but if you want no hair there you&#x27;ll need to resort to trimming to zero length then shaping with a razor (while not perfect in that it can&#x27;t do it all, the results are perfect)!    Pros:  Light  reasonably quiet  no oiling!  grip it by the twist height adjuster and it works great    Cons:  doesn&#x27;t have a foil-like shaver attachment for removing hair to zero  no stand/dock (only a neg for people who have no place to hide it)  not a smart charger  I believe it&#x27;s an old style battery so don&#x27;t expect it to last as long as lithium</li>
            <li> Purhased the shaver about 1 month ago. Owned a previous model that worked OK but had limitations that, for the most part have been resolved in this model.      I have a gote and need to trim my mustache from my upper lip regularly.    Pros:   Long battery life.  I&#x27;ve had the unit for about a month and not had to recharge it yet.  Trimmer attachment is easy to install so I no longer have to bring 2 separate trimmers with me when I travel for business.  It looks cool. Not that looks of the shaver are important but it doesn&#x27;t hurt.  Ergonomics. Easy to hold and use. Buttons placed in easy to use positions.  Turbo adjustment. Haven&#x27;t had the need yet but it wil;l come in handy I guess for longer hair trimming.  Vacuum to suck up clippings. What can I say. Excellent. Not a gimmick.    Cons:  I wish they offerred a nose hair trimming attachment as well.  It is a slight drag to change heads. I wish they had a slide button to push up the thinner blade and would have sacrificed the vacuum for the thinner trimmer as it is used (in my case) for trimming hair that isn&#x27;t long to begin with.  The hair collection compartment is OK.  I clean if after every use but my old one had a cup that removed so I could empty it and this one has a door that opens so you have to hold the unit over the garbage can to empty and it is a drag as I blow out remaining hair instead of using the supplied brush so there is a greater chance the clippings will get on the floor as it is hard to blow it out and aim the refuse.      Months later now and it is still working very wello.  Does a great job!</li>
            <li> Best price. Seven day free shipping.  Easy to use.  Trims Mustache evenly at lowest setting.  Great for tumble look or long Mustache.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer nearly 6 years ago and it has served me well. I put it to use nearly every day of ownership.</li>
            <li> Works better than expected and better than the less expense models. The turbo feature helps speed up morning trims, and the vacuum makes the sink area less messy. I like its adjustable beard-length feature...no need to keep switching clip-on heads. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
            <li> At first I thought that this thing just doesn&#x27;t cut hair well. I have a very thick beard. But once I figured out how to position the thing and use it correctly, I found it to be just fine. Very much worth the price. It cuts hair well, most all of the hair gets sucked in by the vacuum feature (some hair ends up in the sink, but not much.) It&#x27;s comfortable and convenient ... the best I&#x27;ve been able to find these days.</li>
            <li> Best. Trimmer. Ever.    Nothing is perfect, but this gives us an idea of the perfect trimmer. Have at it!</li>
            <li> After looking high and low and doing much research I am very happy with this trimmer.  The vacuum works much better than expected and the trimmer works without any pulling or biting like other trimmers.  The only suggestion that I would make to the manufacturer is: I would like a 1.5 setting rather than 7-9.  I bought this trimmer after some shaver shop owners I spoke too told me that this was the best.  None of them had the vacuum feature, but owned the identical non vacuum model themselves.  Don&#x27;t be disappointed, buy the best.</li>
            <li> Better than expected. Vacuum keeps all the hair in the trimmer until you unload it. Beats the mess that I used to make all over the counter. Variable trim lengths work well. Charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I agree...with the negative reviews. I really like the guide on Norelco trimmers but that is about it for this latest model. I threw it away 2 days after I received it.  I practically shaved off my goatee after it switched from the 3 to the 1 setting by itself. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t work all that well and if you travel, it is so easy to accidentaly turn this on as it just takes the slightest pressure on the switch to start it up. Bad news all around.</li>
            <li> It seems fine for a battery operated trimmer, EXCEPT!  The trimmer doesn&#x27;t stay at the setting you want.  So, I used it for the first time this AM, put the setting on 5 or 6, but after a few strokes on the beard, it reset itself to the lowest setting.  So, one spot on my beard is now down to a stubble.  So, I have to go ahead and shave the rest of my beard that short.  I tested it over and over, and slight pressure resets the length mechanism.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Long and short, the thing doesn&#x27;t work.  I&#x27;m returning it.</li>
            <li> Even at the normal setting, the vacuum works great.  Battery life is good, and the comb doesn&#x27;t really get in the way.</li>
            <li> Before buying this trimmer, I would always buy the $20.00 trimmers at the local superstore. After buying this amazing trimmer, I will never go back. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The trimmer is precise, and you do not need to repeat. And the vacuum, when using the turbo, gets all the hair; it leaves no mess at all. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I am really pleased.</li>
            <li> If you set it on level 5 and you push too hard, you may not have a beard. The locking system is a joke. The Norelco trimmer I bought 7 years ago has a better locking system.</li>
            <li> As some other reviews I read have stated, this trimmer does not trap all the hair with its vacuum.  However, cleanup is much much easier than it would be without any vacuum so I think its worth the extra money for the vacuum.   &lt;br /&gt;Overall I think the trimmer does a good job trimming evenly and the attachment for detailed trimming is excellent.</li>
            <li> I have had this trimmer for about a month now.  It is easily the best beard trimmer of the many that I have owned.  Exceptionally well thought out, simple design is very user friendly.  The vacuum feature, which I was actually pretty skeptical about, works extremely well: there are only a few clippings that fall to the sink or countertop requiring cleanup after trimming.  Cleaning of the trimmer itself is a snap as well.  The depth gauge, blade head and vacuum collection chamber all simply pull off and on smoothly without any difficulty lining them up or anything like that.  I also really like the feature of running off either corded or cordless.  I can use the battery to complete depletion and then finish the trim using the cord.  This will allow me to fully discharge the battery and, hopefully, give it a longer life.  I haven&#x27;t actually had the battery run down yet -- even I use it 2-3 times per week -- so I&#x27;m liking battery life as well.</li>
            <li> I was happily surprised that the vacuum feature actual does work.  Normally when i trim my beard the bathroom counter is covered in hair which is annoying to clean, but with this buzzer about 85% of the hair gets contained in the buzzer and is easily emptied.  Also the range of buzzing lengths is very good.  Over all so far i really like the buzzer.</li>
            <li> Update:  Using the Turbo mode helps substantially in vacuuming up beard hairs.  However, it still doesn&#x27;t get them all, so you still have to do some cleanup.  I&#x27;m not changing my rating; just adding this info.  It works well enough.      Original  -------------------  I&#x27;ve only had the Turbo Vacuum Trimmer for a few weeks, but my experience so far has been mostly positive.  It trims well and is fairly easy to use.  However, I&#x27;m also not really seeing much benefit from the vacuum part.  I don&#x27;t use the turbo mode and it still leaves numerous beard hairs which I have to clean up afterwards.  Also, due to the added bulk of the vacuum, it&#x27;s a little less precise than my old Norelco trimmer, which it replaced.  If I had my choice, at this point, I would have preferred to stick with the old one (it was worn out).</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer recently for my husband to trim his beard. He said it is a handy little trimmer and works well, but it is rather noisy at regular speed and sounds like a small jet engine in his ear with the turbo on! When he uses it in the bathroom I can hear it through the closed door. Also I have noticed that despite the jet engine sucking noises there is a fair amount of very small pieces of beard that still escape and wind up on the sink. I was hopping that I would not have to clean these up after a beard trimming session any more! Definitely less clean up, but still have to clean the sink, and surrounding counter.  It does do a good job keeping his beard at an even length and is much easier to use and consistent that the comb an scissors routine that he was trying before we got the norelco. The little accessory neck trimmer works great for touch ups between haircuts, but the vacume does not work at all with that attachement in place. All in all a decent trimmer but could be quieter and it would be nice if the vacume was more effetive and worked with the neck trimmer.</li>
            <li> The electric beard razor works as promised.  It&#x27;s fast and easy.  It is easy to adjust, relatively quite, vacumms up the cuttings quite well.  The only thing that could be improved would to have a built in edge trimmer.  Changing the blade to trim is easy but when you are used to a flip out edge trimmer on your regular razor you don&#x27;t see why this could have the same feature.  Next time.</li>
            <li> The first 3-4 times I used this trimmer I had somehow shaved a bald spot in my beard. I would have to shave my beard off and start over next week then. Not to be put off I set forth to master this trimmer. I found that with practice it gets better. I still find that it doesn&#x27;t really do the best job at making my beard look consistent. On the shortest setting I will get some hairs which are like 1/8\\&quot; long while others are closer to 3/8\\&quot; long. I am not sure if it&#x27;s my technique or what, but I have just found it best to avoid using the #1 setting for the shortest hair. This is not the beard trimmer to use if you are wanting to maintain the rough look. That is ultimately what I am trying to do, and I am having an issue with it. On the other hand, its amazing at any other length, which is why I was still able to give it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> when I ordered it I knew the vacuum wasn&#x27;t going to catch all the hair.  To my surprise it almost did.  I have a beard and I trim it once every week or so,  in a week my beard grows fast 5 o&#x27;clock shadow at noon and the vacuum got at least 95-99% of the hair.  I was expecting from past experiences only 25-40%.  This product is amazing easy to empty, clean and doesn&#x27;t need oil BUY ONE.</li>
            <li> My old Remington was not giving me the shave I needed, so I thought this razor would be much improved. I am kind of disapointed. Works well enough, but doesn&#x27;t shave very close. I&#x27;m beginning to think no electric does.</li>
            <li> definitely better made and better performing than previous Norelcos.  the shaver&#x27;s really loud.  vacuum is about 90% effective.  turbo may or may not speed things up, but it&#x27;s definitely way louder.  still has a tendency to go down a trimmer level while you shave if you&#x27;re not careful and put too much pressure on it.</li>
            <li> This is a good product overall but I found two flaws, that seem to concur with other reviewers complaints. I like to trim my face close, on the 2/3 setting.    1)The length-dial clicks out of place while you are trimming. This happens at least once during each shave, usually when shaving the left side of my face (I am right handed). So if you are on the 2 setting and you apply pressure on the face, it jumps down to 1. I have been holding the dial with my index finger. Kind of annoying. Also there is significant play (wiggle room) in the dial itself. Odd, and annoying.   2) It is nearly impossible to get the area under the nose/above the lip with the guard on, its just too bulky...Overall, good power, never pulls hairs, sharp blades, and the vaccum does its job for the most part.</li>
            <li> I have been using the T980 for over 3 months now, and I&#x27;m very pleased with it.  It gives a superior, even beard and mustache trim, glides smoothly across without snagging, and catches most (yes, not ALL) your clippings.  As others warn, it can trim pretty close if you set the dial too low, I found out the hard way with a \\&quot;2\\&quot; and eventually settled on \\&quot;4\\&quot; for my setting.  I am not a fan of the trimmer when you take the guard off, I still prefer my old Norelco for this, and I do wish it had a nose/ear trimmer also, but these are minor gripes.  Overall a great product and a highly recommended product.</li>
            <li> so far so good. product works very well, gets close with a very even cut. very easy cleaning, great product!</li>
            <li> I had an old norelco that lasted 10 years, but the internal battery only lasted about 3 minutes before i finally threw it out...this trimmer is a huge step up with cutting and the vaccum. there is NO way for the guard to drop to a lower setting unless you turn the setting dial--i guess all the negative reviews where the setting dropped while in use were on a different model? works great and i am glad that i bought it...i am really picky and read all the reviews and was a bit skeptical...so im writing now to tell you that for under 40 bucks, you cant go wrong. This thing should last me a long time (it comes with a 2 year warranty) and will pay for itself becuase it allows me to keep the beard/goatee at my corporate job and fight the man!</li>
            <li> This is my first beard trimmer for use with my first beard.  I read many of the other reviews of the Norelco T980 and having a Norelco electric razor decided to give it a try.  I&#x27;ve been generally impressed, although I&#x27;ve never owned another trimmer to compare the T980 to.    Some of the concerns that others noted (followed by my own impressions):  Loudness:  Yes, trimming with a mini-vacuum is a little louder than without.  In particular, when &#x27;Turbo&#x27; mode is on, it sounds like a mini-buzz-saw.  That said, unless you&#x27;re worried about waking a sleeping baby in the same room, it&#x27;s not obnoxiously loud.    Vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch clippings:  Even though this is my first beard, I know trimmings tend to go everywhere when trimming a beard.  I didn&#x27;t expect the vacuum to catch everything (especially since I&#x27;m using the trimmer to leave my beard at a 1/2\\&quot; length- setting 7 of 9).  I always use &#x27;Turbo&#x27; mode (hoping that more suction will catch more of the clippings), and I tend to catch ~75% of the clippings this way.  The biggest issue is that the clippings it doesn&#x27;t catch tend to be the ones that go sailing across the room (for my wife to find later)-but I would assume any trimmer would do that with my facial hair.     Needs frequent charging:  As I said above, I always use the trimmer in &#x27;Turbo&#x27; mode and it&#x27;s not supposed to last very long that way.  However, I&#x27;ve been using three times a week for the last month and have charged it twice.  Charging once every couple of weeks was within my expectations.    Smaller trimmer involves removing regular trim head:  People who complained about having to change trim heads must be in a much more significant hurry than I am in the morning.  The height guide and standard trim head slip off easily (5 seconds or less-literally).  The precision trim head slips on just as easily and really does a nice job with touch-up areas.  The precision trim head extends away from the body of the trimmer more than the standard one, making it easier to clean up errant hair.    Height guide slips when trimming:  I haven&#x27;t seen this problem at all.  I was very concerned about it (I didn&#x27;t want to accidentally shave off the beard I spent all this time growing), but really, any concern of this at all can be eliminated by holding the trimmer so that your grip doesn&#x27;t allow the height guide to move (which, at least for me, is a perfectly normal way to hold the trimmer).    The storage pouch is a little weird, but I found I can fit both the trimmer and my electric razor in it without any problems, so all the better.    Bottom line- the T980 is generally a good little trimmer.</li>
            <li> The thing I like the best is the vacuum option.  My sink is a lot cleaner now.  Works well and doesn&#x27;t snag hairs.  Not sure who would need the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; option.  I think you could harvest crops with that speed.</li>
            <li> the trimmer is really good and very handy. main thing I like with this trimmer is that its not bulky and easily fits into my shaving kit. besides the one charge does last really long.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco Vacuum Trimmer.  It replaced the first one which I dropped and broke.  This trimmer is excelent in every way.  Making daily grooming easy, with easy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not all the hair you trim goes into the hair deflector but I didn&#x27;t really expect \\&quot;no mess\\&quot; or \\&quot;no clean-up\\&quot; as it claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If and when this item finally breaks (had my 1st for 4 years) i will buy another!  My Dad and Brother both own one and love it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer for my husband and he likes it for the most part. It trims evenly, is quiet and handy. It vacuums most of the hair, but he still has to stand over the sink because of the mess it makes. Otherwise, it&#x27;s been a good buy, no problems yet.    Follow-up: We returned the item because the guard slips. I would like to give this product a 1 star.</li>
            <li> Although I think it wouldn&#x27;t hurt if it was a bit cheaper this product is a very great way to style and trim of course.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. The Plus and Minus factors are:   - The Vacuum works. This is big plus. I can trim my beard without mess.     Before I had to take a shower to get off the beard trimmings or I would     itch all day. Also my sink is clean another plus   - Off On button needs to be moved. Its easy to shut off by grabbing the     handle. Small minus.   - Vacuum clip catcher. Plastic piece needs to handled with care. Small     minus.   - Trimmer. Nice even trim. I tried small bladed products. They leave your     beard loking chopped up. Big Plus.   - Overall. This is a great product for men like me who have had beards     all their lives. I have been trimming 30 years. This one is nice so     far.</li>
            <li> I have had several trimmers before and I wont rate this the best.....its vaccum feature does help a bit to reduce the mess but the I dont like the plastic movable piece which helps hold the hair and directs the vaccum. I like to use my trimmer to cut very close and never use the hight adjustment piece, but with the sliding plastic sheet getting in the way it gets difficult to get a close cut.</li>
            <li> My previous trimmer was a Norelco T7500 which I have used for the last 7 or 8 years.  I had to replace the battery once.  That is all I ever had to do to it.  This battery is about shot and the trimmer is getting old so I thought to replace it rather than putting another battery in it.  I chose the Norelco T980 trimmer.  I am pretty much bald except for around the back and sides so I use the trimmer as my hair clipper.  Because of the vacuum, it is noiser than the other trimmer but it collects all the hair, so that more than makes up for the noise. To use the nose/ear trimmer you have to pull off the clipper head and install the trimmer head.  With the older model you merely slid the trimmer forward.  All in all I am pleased with the new model.</li>
            <li> Products works great with only a few small issues.    The blue hair deflector broke after using it only 2 times, but I was able to exchange the whole unit right away.  The new unit seems to be working great.    The sideburn attachment is a little small to my liking which makes it had to get an accurate straight trim of sideburns.  This attachment does work great on mustache/beard line.    Overall, the design is great and the unit works as advertised.</li>
            <li> Having worn a beard for appx. 30 years, I&#x27;ve used a lot of trimmers, at a lot of settings. My beard has gone from 3-inch length to 1/4 inch length, rough tracing my own growth from a 20-something college kid to an AARP neophyte. By far, this is the best trimmer, I&#x27;ve used. Love the length settings--for the first time, I have a length setting that doesn&#x27;t fall between the length I desire. Also, you can&#x27;t beat the hair catcher. Makes sink clean-up a cinch. Haven&#x27;t found a use for the turbo setting yet, but I press it occasionally just to hear it rev and be reassured that all the features truly do work &lt;grin&gt;. Would recommend for anyone who wears a beard or goatee.</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer.  The vacuum works pretty well, but don&#x27;t expect it to catch every hair. Not bad, but a little pricey.</li>
            <li> A turbo button on a beard trimmer?  Those people at Norelco are insane!  For me, this unit replaced an older model Norelco from a few years back.  What a major upgrade it was!  The blade adjustment is precise.  The blades are sharp and cut quickly without hassle or pulling on the beard.  The vacuum works great and grabs cut hair.  Haven&#x27;t used the turbo feature yet but it sounds powerful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The T980 comes with a mustache trimmer, AC adapter, carrying case, and a brush to clean the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great, makes beard upkeep a non-issue, and fits into a hand naturally.  Well done, Norelco.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to replace a Norelco T970 trimmer.  The improvement in features and performance is tremendous, and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li> Sure the Trimmer has 9 different settings, but what they don&#x27;t tell you is that you&#x27;ll usually end up with a 2 every time unless you tape it down. What I mean is, when you&#x27;re trimming with it, and press to hard, the settings will actually change. So even though I wanted a 5, I pressed too hard and ended up with a 4 and I was stuck with a 4 in a spot surrounded by 5.    From a 4 I was like shoot, now I gotta shave it all to make it even. Then when you&#x27;re shaving to make it all an even 4, you accidently press too hard on one spot. OOPS!    Now I have three...and the cycle continues.    Other than that, no complaints really--just the vacuum doesn&#x27;t pick up all the hairs.</li>
            <li> Good trimmer for the money. Doesn&#x27;t cut quit as low as I would have liked. But otherwise good product.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer made!  A breeze compared to others we&#x27;ve tried.  Trims with ease and very clean.  ~Highly Recommended~</li>
            <li> Very good trimmer, used it to cut hair and did good job, son uses it on beard. turn knob and get any setting automatically, nice not to have a bunch of combs to lose.  Does a clean job of cutting, vacuums cut hair up  well, and is easy to use.</li>
            <li> This razor was just what I needed. It&#x27;s not any louder than any other electric razor I have tried (even on turbo), and it doesn&#x27;t leave too much of a mess to clean up. It does a great job and holds its charge well.    One thing holding me back from giving it five stars is the level selector. It is far too easy to accidentally switch the level of shave. I will probably need to tape this in place to avoid a disaster by accidentally switching to a lower level mid-shave.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought all types of beard trimmers before.  Cheap ones at wal-mart, the drug store, etc. and they all work just &#x27;kinda&#x27;.  This one works KINDA AWESOME!  The vacuum thing works like a champ, only leaving a few hairs in the sink.  The rest are in the bin waiting for you to dump them in the trash. My wife really likes the lack of beard hair in the sink.  It&#x27;s easy to use, self contained, powerful and flexible too.  Great, great, great buy!  Love it!</li>
            <li> Good trimmer.  Holds a charge for a couple of days. The vacuum feature works best in turbo mode, which is louder, but not enough for me to mind it, personally. Haven&#x27;t experienced the guard slipping as others have.  Can be easy to accidentally hit the power button mid-trim, no biggie.  Other than that, a good buy.</li>
            <li> For a first time beard grower this was just what the doctor ordered.  Very easy to use, the cut length adjuster is great, the vacuum captures about 80% with the turbo mode (bit noisy).  I would give it 5 stars, but this is my first trimmer and have nothing to measure against.  Overall happy with the purchase.</li>
            <li> It does a great job when I trim my beard. I also sometimes use it to shave too.</li>
            <li> First shave and my husband lost his short beard.  It shifted levels without him knowing it and left a racing strip. Needless to say he had to shave completely. Luckily he didn&#x27;t trim his mustache. The vacuum works great but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Works well and easily and vacuum element keeps beard trimmings from dirtying shirt. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> This is my second beard trimmer.  Previously had a [...] that was powered by 3 AAA batteries.  Was very underpowered and I stopped using it.  The Norelco trimmer works much better.  It is more powerful and somewhat bigger.  I like that I can plug it in also.  So far after 3 trim jobs, the batteries are going strong without a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;The turbo vac works fairly well.  Some hairs endup in the sink, but I expected this.  Quality is good, the adjustment for cutting length worked OK.  My only beef is the filter cup that hold the cut hair is a little clumsy to work with.  It is plastic, so you need to be careful when sliding it back on not to get it jammed or stuck.</li>
            <li> My T980 does almost everything perfectly: it holds a charge for weeks; its vacuum reduces the number of trimmed hairs around the sink by about 70%; it feels wonderful and it works quickly.    However, my T980 does NOT stay at the level I set it at. If I don&#x27;t firmly grip the length setting wheel it will jump from, say, a 5 to a 3 -- as it did this morning -- embarrassing me either by giving me a patchy trim or by forcing me to shorten my beard length.    This problem doesn&#x27;t seem to be a result of the way I&#x27;m, say, holding the trimmer -- I used the [[ASIN:B0001HYL0M T765]] for four years without having this problem -- but rather a flaw in the trimmer itself. From these reviews, it seems like only a few of the T980s have this problem; still, you might want to try the [[ASIN:B000FED5D0 T780]], which doesn&#x27;t seem to have this problem -- I wish I had.      Update 3/12/08: Make me look like a fool once, shame on me; make me look like a fool twice, shame on you.    I&#x27;ve used this trimmer about 12 times since writing this review, and by a combination of duct tape, a pinch grip, and a good deal of vigilance I had been able to avoid too many embarrassing shifts in beard length.    ...until this morning, when it shifted silently from a 5 (Late Winter Academic Beard) to 3 (Peach Fuzz) in mid-shave. Two options: shave my entire beard to a 3, which is inappropriate for my face type, or look deranged because half of my face is at 5 and half is at 3.    I threw my T980 in the garbage ten minutes ago.</li>
            <li> I found NorelcoT980 very good. Far more better than the one which I was using previously(Hitachi). Unlike many other trimmers, this trimmer can be used both cord and cordless. If battery dies in the middle of your trimming, you can simply plug in the cord and continue using it. Vacuum is also great feature in it. It hardly leave any hair let fall. Turbo option is also nice one.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer i&#x27;ve ever owned and i&#x27;ve had a half dozen or so of various brands - very glad i purchased this trimmer easy to use, quite, catches the hair that is cut with the vacuum makes your sink nice</li>
            <li> The T980 trimmer appears to be well made and the attachments are easliy removed and reattached. The Turbo mode doesn&#x27;t appear to be needed with short beards. This is the first electric trimmer I&#x27;ve used so I&#x27;m not used to it yet. The flexing Guide Comb seems difficult to work with, probably due to my inexperience. The vacuum picks up most, but not all, hair.</li>
            <li> I had the older model of this unit the 970 which i was happy with but there was always a small mess in the sink. The T980 works much better and leaves almost no trail of hair behind, i love the turbo button for areas with lots of hair. Great product. The only thing i would improve is a charge meter which was on the old version.</li>
            <li> Trims my beard smoothly and evenly. I have had several Norelco products and all have been good. The downsides of this model are the hair suction action isn&#x27;t very strong and still drops hair, the hair holder is small and needs frequent emptying(maybe I don&#x27;t trim often enough), and the small trimmer isn&#x27;t built in; it requires changing the head of the trimmer. All my previous Norelcos had the small trimmer built in.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the vacuum capabilities when I first read about it, but after trying it I must admit that I&#x27;m very impressed.  It literally catches about 90% of the hair, so there&#x27;s way less to clean up after.  I&#x27;m a hairy beast so I usually use it a few times a week and so far it&#x27;s been great.  If I was attracted to beard trimmers I would date this one because it&#x27;s sexy looking and cleans up after me.  Great price for a great trimmer.</li>
            <li> This T980 trimmer does everything nicely, but not as nicely as the discontinued and no longer available Philips Norelco T-3000.  There are more beard length settings on this one, but you can&#x27;t easily see them like you could on the T-3000, and more settings are not really needed.  This one has a micro-trimmer which has to be installed, instead of the pop-up capability on the T-3000.  This one has a turbo speed which the T-3000 didn&#x27;t have and which I don&#x27;t need and have never used.  In short, the company has replaced an excellent product with one that is only good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using my T980 for two years.  I appreciate that it minimizes cleanup.  I&#x27;ve found my length setting (3) and trim my beard about every 4-5 days.  I travel with this all the time.    My only complaints (and the reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars) are:  1) the pouch is extremely flimsy, 2) there is no \\&quot;travel lock\\&quot; on the trimmer so it is easily started by incidental luggage handling.    Other than that, this trimmer is awesome.</li>
            <li> This purchase was to replace a Wahl trimmer that died suddenly after a couple of years. It had done a good job but the feature I liked best about it was the built in vacuum. Stopped my wife from complaining about a trail of hair on the sink.     After a quick look thru the internet I soon discovered this vacuum feature was a rarity. Then I found the NorelcoT980 Turbo here on Amazon. It has the vacuum and a extra Turbo function that your first time you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s going to pull off all the hair. Well it doesn&#x27;t but the motor does get louder in turbo and I&#x27;m sure it also eats up more battery power. It&#x27;s a well made piece of machinery that feels good in your hand. The heigh adjustment click in nicely. The cover over the blades ride nicely over your face but this is something you&#x27;ll have to use the included cleaning brush to wipe out hair that will stick in it&#x27;s nicks and crannies.    There is a second blade that is used for finer detailing like around your mouth. It works well and enables you to keep the hair out of your mouth. Funny thing about the attachments. The first few times you change them or remove the hair catcher they seem to be difficult to remove. But soon they pop off easily. Suppose it&#x27;s just a matter of learning were to pull.    I do wish it came with a stand for the razor. It comes with a pouch that you can store a everything including the charger, but somehow I get the feeling Norelco though us guys with beards travel a lot. I don&#x27;t and would have like a place to sit the T980 where I can grab it for a quick trim.</li>
            <li> What an improvement. Spent more than planned, but well worth it. Old one was a 270, el cheapo so this is a treat</li>
            <li> THIS THING IS AWESOME.  I AM NEVER SHAVING AGAIN. I just used it for the first time and have decided that I will never use a razor again.  I am a guy who never likes to shave, I maintain the \\&quot;few days of stubble\\&quot; look throughout the week, and dread the day when I have to go through the hassle of lathering up &amp; shaving.  But this thing is so easy to use and it just cuts you down to whatever stubble-level you want in like 2 minutes!!!! PLUS it&#x27;s got this vacuum-device on it that sucks up the stray hairs into a special chamber, which you then pull out and empty when you&#x27;re done trimming.   so to quote Wayne&#x27;s World...\\&quot;It SUCKS as it CUTS!\\&quot;  I LOVE IT!! I AM IN LOVE WITH THIS TRIMMER!  I have never written a review for Amazon before and I&#x27;ve been shopping here for years! That&#x27;s how fired up I am about my new purchase!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer for a couple of months.  It is the best trimmer I have used.  It trims fast and evenly.  There has been zero pulling or pinching.  The vacuum is helpful, retaining up to 90% of the trimmed hair.  It works better than I anticipated.  I have not tried the Turbo mode since the regular setting works perfectly so far.    I have not experienced any issues with the beard length setting changing while in use that others have remarked on.  Time will tell if parts fatigue plus pressing hard against the face will cause this in the coming months.    I do agree with others about the initial awkwardness of trimming with the comb-like top guide part off.  There is a retractable shield in front of the blade that is designed to facillitate trimmed hair going down into the curved waste basket of the vacuum instead of falling in the sink.  It would be nice if you could manually lock this shield down when doing fine edge trim.  You will get used to it quickly, but the design makes fine trimming more of a blind operation, i.e. you do it by feel more than sight since the shield blocks my view.  I use a little more care when fine trimming than with my older model, but the extra seconds aren&#x27;t too much hassle and the results are fantastic.    The trimmer is of good size but handles easily and with better precision than I initially thought.  I&#x27;m still on my first charge with about 10 trims and still running strong - no recharge indicator light yet.  There is a little brush for cleaning the trimmer that works OK.  Philips Norelco recommends cleaning after every trim.  Cleaning is a drag but should keep the unit working better longer.    Only thing missing is a recharger/storage stand.  You get a travel bag instead.     Bottom line, excellent trimmer.  Would recommend to all.</li>
            <li> I bought this unit, a little concerned about some of the reviewers who said the length adjustment changed too easily.  I found that not to be an issue at all.  Even with substantial pressure on the comb assembly, the length setting does not accidentally change.    The vacuum system probably catches 85% of the clippings with the turbo vacuum on.  Which when cleaning up the sink so as to not put a hair-ball down the drain, it is a very nice assist.    The batteries last nicely even with the turbo vacuum on, certainly lasts longer than it takes for me to trim my beard.    Like the performance, handling and the results of this beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s see... to begin with, it works. The blades work, the vacuum works, the  height adjustment works. Everything works and works well. It came with a detail trimmer attachment that is really nice and a little storage case for everything.     I normally don&#x27;t give out 5-star ratings for things, but I just can&#x27;t find anything to complain about and it exceeded my expectations on every function. I think the only way they could possibly improve it would be to make it waterproof so I could use it in the shower. Please?!?!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband for two reasons: 1) because he hates how a clean shave looks, and how it irritates his skin, and 2) because I hate cleaning up all those tiny hairs from the bathroom sink.  This shaver is pretty awesome, as it hasn&#x27;t irritated his skin at all, and he really likes that it leaves a nice stubble-y look and it lets him precision trim his beard/goatee.  Plus, the vacuum works decently, and gets most (not quite all, but most) of the little hairs so I don&#x27;t have a dirty, clogged sink.  Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase.  The shaver does everything it promises, and the price is great, too.</li>
            <li> I think this thing is great.  I used to have a Braun one that was similar until it broke because of the hinge to change from beard to mustache trimming.  This has interchangeable heads so that wont be an issue.  The turbo is a little louder than regular, but I don&#x27;t think its that bad.  I don&#x27;t shave everyday, so when I do there is a lot of hair.  The reservoir that the vacuum goes to is a bit small but as people have said, even if it doesn&#x27;t get all the hair, it still makes the cleanup easier.  Highly reccomended.</li>
            <li> I ordered this trimmer online and in less then a week I had the product delivered. I wanted to use it a little before posting a review. The trimmer is awesome and I am glad I purchased it. Definitely will keep the seller in mind for the future. Very satisfied with my choice.</li>
            <li> This is the best beard trimmer I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I love the vacuum feature which makes clean up a breeze.  No more trying to clean up those little hairs.  I also like the nine cutting positions.  It makes it easier to groom your beard to exactly the right length.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer because the older version I had died after about 3 years of use. Overall, I enjoy using this trimmer. The adjustments stay in place and do not \\&quot;jump\\&quot; while in use. The vacuum doesn&#x27;t get every little stray hair but I would say 95% are caught when I use the turbo function. The vacuum power of this model is much better than other brands I have tried.</li>
            <li> Before this product, I used the T860; so my review is basically a comparison of the two experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The T980 vacuum feature is very nice.  Not perfect, but catches most whiskers.  Easy to pop off, dump in trash, and pop back on.&lt;br /&gt;- T980 Trim settings are almost exact to the T860&#x27;s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- The T980 \\&quot;Clipper Guide Comb\\&quot; is made of a thicker plastic than the T860.  Maneuverability right under the nose is difficult resulting in longer whiskers near my nostrils.  The T860 got in close under the same trim settings.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve found no use for the \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; function&lt;br /&gt;- When I take the \\&quot;Clipper Guide Comb\\&quot; off for manual cleaning, it is difficult to put it back on.</li>
            <li> Absolutely no pinching or pulling, just smooth and efficient.  It&#x27;s larger than the Wahl or the Remington I had before, but works many times more effectively than either.  The vacuum feature is great, and it is easy to clean.  The adjustable comb tilts easily, and the whole head can be removed and replaced without any effort at all.  This is probably the perfect trimmer.</li>
            <li> This thing is truly awesome...  If you are more intelligent than a trained monkey you will have no problem using this trimmer for virtually any place you can grow hair...    Works on beard and mustache great, cuts head hair, arm pits and trims other body hair places wonderfully!    Works at full capacity even while plugged in and charging.      Motor has 2 speeds.  The vacuum function works really well, hardly any stray clippings on the sink.  The hair collector cup snaps in and out with ease and rinses clean.    I can&#x27;t say much more raving about this without getting repetitive.    My wife told me that I rave about how much I love it every time I use it that I should right a comment about it.  So enough said...  Buy it, it&#x27;s absolutely wonderful for the price, especially when paired with the nose/ear/brow trimmer that I bought in the package.</li>
            <li> I have a fairly thick beard. This trimmer delivers as advertised. It is powerful, holds a great charge and the vacuum feature works as designed.  The vacuum keeps me from cleaning the sink of hair so it doesn&#x27;t go down the drain.  I have tried several trimmers over the last ten years - Wahl, Panasonic, an older Norelco - this is the best by far.  Great value.  I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I got this a while back, I think two years ago. It started dying about a year ago. I think the vacuum just sucked the life out of the battery. It did well for me. Just wished it would last longer. The vacuum on this worked fairly well. You have to make sure you clean it often or it will clog up the vacuum and your beards will fall all over the place.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s certainly not all that. I&#x27;ve had it a year and a half and the whisker tray already broke. If you empty it every day, it falls apart. If you don&#x27;t empty it each day, whiskers end up all over the place, including inside the floppy, soft case that has trouble keeping its contents inside. Despite the vacuum action, whiskers collect in every nook and cranny. If you like your grooming aids sanitary, you&#x27;ll have fun cleaning this thing (and, except the adjustable guide and whisker tray, you can&#x27;t wash it in water)! Speaking of the adjustable guide, check the setting often, or you&#x27;ll end up with a surprise...a much closer cut than you expected. The spring-loaded dial adjuster with \\&quot;digital\\&quot; read-out doesn&#x27;t hold its settings as you press harder to get an even cut...it gets worse the more you use it. This is my second Norelco trimmer and the previous one did the same.    Conclusion: I wanted Braun-quality to match their stellar shavers (I&#x27;m on my third Braun shaver in twenty years of use), but they discontinued their beard trimmer. While the Norelco is certainly not in the same universe as Braun in quality, neither are they in price. The best thing I can say about this trimmer is that at least it&#x27;s cheap to buy...a plastic throw-away you have to re-buy every year or two.    UPDATE: I called Norelco before the 2-year warrantee elapsed. Since the whisker tray broke in two pieces and the spring-loaded beard guide is on it&#x27;s last leg (thin plastic holds in the \\&quot;springs\\&quot; and is very fragile), Norelco decided to replace the unit en toto. They said they&#x27;d send a new one out and that I should just put the old one back in the same box, apply the PP label they&#x27;ll include and drop the whole enchilada in the mail. It&#x27;s nearly two weeks, and I still haven&#x27;t seen hide nor hair of the new shaver. Only time will tell if Norelco stands behind their product (and their promises).    UPDATE (3/11/09): Well, the replacement unit finally came, after three weeks and four phone callls. Apparently, the thing was on backorder, but nobody at Phillips/Norelco Customer Service bothered to disclose that fact, nor did they provide a tracking number. After my fourth call yesterday, they finally provided me a UPS tracking number which was moot as the package arrived when I returned home from work. So far, so good..at least it works and isn&#x27;t falling apart. Unfortunately, I have no faith that this one will perform and hold-up any better than the first. At least I won&#x27;t have to buy another until this one breaks.    Update (7/22/09): Well, only four months after receiving the new replacement trimmer, the whisker tray (aka \\&quot;hair collection chamber\\&quot;) has fallen apart, just like it did on my original defective trimmer. The difference this time is that Norelco is hanging me out to dry and is refusing to do anything to repair/replace this poorly designed and manufactured product. They claim that because the warantee period is up on the ORIGINAL defective unit, that they can do nothing about the replacement unit they supplied, i.e., they won&#x27;t stand behind the product even though any other new one has a TWO-Year warrantee. FYI, the original unit was bought from Amazon on 4/7/07. As such, I am downgrading the original 3-star rating to ONE-STAR and changing my review title from \\&quot;It&#x27;s Just OK\\&quot; to reflect my true feelings about this product. As such, I will NEVER buy another Phillips-Norelco product again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trimming a short beard (1/4\\&quot;) for 30 years and used several methods.  Also used an earlier version of this trimmer for 3 years.    -It&#x27;s a great trimmer, overall I&#x27;m satified with it. Easily adjustable. I can trim beard and mustache in under 5 minutes, including ALL hairs off the sink (that&#x27;s for my lovely wife).    -Particular Pro - I&#x27;ve had 4 of these cordless trimmers and have always replaced them because rechargeable batteries go bad.  Costs as much to replace the pack as a new trimmer.  This is the first where you can trim while charging.  Hopefully, there will be no missed trims because the bats are dead.    -Pro - Vacuum is significantly better than on their last version.  Not perfect but better.  Also the airway that carries the hairs to the storage chamber is wider and doesn&#x27;t clog.  This was a problem on earlier version.  Don&#x27;t know how well vacuum would work on longer hairs.    -Con - This one has a door with a hinge to empty the hairs.  Earlier version had removable cup which seemed much easier to use.  Looks like a step backwards to me but maybe I&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
            <li> My fiance bought this for me at Christmas and it has been a perfect gift. The basic product itself is sturdy but I travel for work so in the course of my travel I broke the outer guard on the blade, but for the majority of my use I don&#x27;t need it. I could use a sturdier carrying case and maybe a slightly stronger vaccum, but even with those niggling complaints this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer after my old Norelco stopped charging. For the record, I maintain a full beard with this. Overall, I am satisfied with the product, but there are some caveats.    Vacuum: Like me, you may be interested in the included vacuum, rather than getting hair all over the place. It works pretty well for this! I&#x27;d say about 90% of the hair is trapped in the canister, about 3% on the sink, and about 7% left in my beard. For this reason, I recommend using the trimmer before you shower. Otherwise, you will get little hairs all over your shirt during the day. If you only have a goatee or similar, it may not be quite as bad. It&#x27;s not much hair, but the little vacuum can&#x27;t solve everything.    Noise: The noise level is loud, but not really any noisier than an electric toothbrush. To me, it&#x27;s really no big deal. With the bathroom door closed, you can only hear it when close to the door anyway. I even run it in turbo mode most of the time, and still don&#x27;t have an issue with this. Of course it would be great if it were completely silent, but really it&#x27;s not that bad.    Trimming: Like all Norelcos, it does a great job trimming. The included adapter(s) handle just about everything I could imagine needing. I am a hairy guy, and have not felt any pulling or ripping of the hairs, just a clean trim.    Power: I typically get several weeks worth of trimming (every 2-3 days) on a single charge. To maintain the battery, always ensure you fully drain it before recharging. Using turbo mode drains it slightly more quickly. I can go a whole vacation without needing to recharge, which is nice, but the included travel bag is handy just in case.    So, overall I&#x27;d give it 4.5 stars, only because of the leftover hairs. It would be nice to have a slightly more powerful vacuum, but I realize it&#x27;s difficult to get the hairs that are trapped in a beard. I love the trimmer, and have not seen anything else out there that would beat it.</li>
            <li> I like the concept of this trimmer with the vacuum and all, but I&#x27;m really annoyed that the people who make these things won&#x27;t tell you what lengths the comb settings will trim to.  Even if you go to a store to look at one, they have it all sealed in plastic that you have to cut open just to take a look at it.  So I got this thing home to see if it would trim to my preferred length, and no it won&#x27;t.  I&#x27;m liking the stubble look, and about 3-4 days growth looks best on me.  This trimmer only goes down to what represents 7-8 days growth for me.  I have another Panasonic trimmer that works fine, but it has the same issue.  I can take the comb off and cut the stubble down to about one day&#x27;s length and then let it grow back a few days, but I&#x27;m getting really tired of doing that.  I think these manufacturers should specify their trimming lengths so you can do a reasonable buying comparison.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has a wide variety of trim lengths, doesn&#x27;t need to be charged frequently, is very comfortable to use, and even has a vacuum that makes clean-up VERY easy.  I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone looking for a high-quality, inexpensive beard trimmer (which I&#x27;d think would be anybody looking for a beard trimmer!)</li>
            <li> Only had it for a week or so but works great so far.  Good design, wireless which is great, and fairly quiet. more to come</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it 2 times however it cuts nicely and has a small attachment which is nice for trimming and getting close to skin. I like the vacuum although it doesn&#x27;t get 100% of hairs it does get most.</li>
            <li> I was a little dubious when I bought this. How many gadgets have you purchased that just didn&#x27;t \\&quot;do the do\\&quot;? I read some reviews, and they were a bit mixed. However, the \\&quot;thing\\&quot; on my chin was getting out of hand and scissors just weren&#x27;t cutting it (bad pun intended). So, I finally decided to give it a try. First pleasant surprise: Amazon shipping is pretty damn zippy. Second pleasant surprise: The thing does what it is supposed to. Yes, it&#x27;s a little noisy, and , yes, you are going to have to clean up some hair off the sink. But aside from that, they&#x27;ve really worked out the details on this thing. It was pretty quick and easy to shape up my goatee and actually make it look presentable on the first try. I think it is a keeper.</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B000FEF1V4 Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer]]    My husband is growing a beard since being unemployed for 2 months.  This was a surprise gift for him from me, and he loves it!</li>
            <li> This product looks too flimsy and it looks more like a play toy.  I am surprised they sell this seriously as real product that can cut hair.  Hair gets stuck the minute you tried to cut the hair.  Hair guard came loose almost immediately.  I don&#x27;t see how this product can work on full head of hair.    At best it trim a beard.   But I don&#x27;t grow beard.  So, this one is going back.</li>
            <li> I had the previous (vacuum but non-turbo) version of this trimmer and after only a year, the battery life decreased to about 5 minutes (even though I don&#x27;t keep it in the charger, let it discharge almost completely - all the proper care and feeding of a NiCad battery...). I generally liked the performance of the older one (except it didn&#x27;t quite vacuum \\&quot;all them tiny hairs\\&quot; as Bill Cosby used to say) so I decided to replace it with this one. This is quite an improvement as far as vacuuming almost all the tiny hairs, which is to say, Norelco finally got the speed right. The only glitch is the Turbo switch is cleverly located so that one of my fingers or thumb inadvertently turns off the Turbo at least once per trim. Otherwise works great!</li>
            <li> I purchased this in March of 2010, about 21 months ago.  I was never particularly impressed by the vacuum function.  I&#x27;m sure it sucked in some of the hair, but whats the point if you still have to clean your sink?  Recently it broke.  Since I only used it every 3-4 weeks, that means it probably broke after about 30 uses.  The springs that flexed the comb popped out.  I would not recommend anyone purchase this item.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my boyfriend so he&#x27;d keep his sexy new beard, and he was thrilled.  The vacuum gets the vast majority of the hair, it&#x27;s super easy to clean and keeps a charge well.  He gets a cool gadget, and I get a bearded, manly beast of a lover.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent trimmer, particularly with the vacuum feature.  It cuts cleanly and consistently, far better than my old Braun.</li>
            <li> I had a Norelco T780 Vacuum Trimmer before this one that I returned to Norelco under warranty because of a defective battery issue.Kept maybe a 10min charge. Noreclo sent this one as a replacement.It is a nicer model. As far as trimming goes, does a fine job.I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the AccuControl System with flexing guide comb.Wish it were just a simple non flexing comb.I used to get a more precise shave from my oldest original trimmer especially near my moustache.To the nitty gritty. If you trim very very slowly, the vacuum feature does a pretty nice job of picking up probably 80-90% of the trimmed hair.If you work in real time, it&#x27;s performance is sub par.If you use the turbo feature, it is still not that effective. You will get hair on your counter and freak out the wife if you haven&#x27;t wiped them all away..This trimmer is probably one of the best out there though..</li>
            <li> I am happy with this purchase. The item was shipped on time and the price was copmparable and competetive.</li>
            <li> I have tried countless beard trimmers over the last ten years.  I have tried trimmers made specifically for beards, trimmers made for cutting hair and everything in-between.  The major complaints I had with all of these products were that a) they pulled my beard hair and hurt and b) were very messy and not at all precise.  This T980 takes care of all of that.  First of all, it&#x27;s a well-made product.  All the parts fit cleanly, the charger works well, the directions are great, the packaging is terrific.  Secondly, it is easy to use with a cursory understanding of the instructions.  It took me less than 20 minutes to read the instructions and trim my entire beard.  The two things I like the most about this trimmer would be the vacuum feature (actually gets about 90% or more of the hair) and the smooth feeling it gives you when you use it.  It does not pull, yank or grate your face at all.  It makes beard trimming a very enjoyable experience. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Philips Norelco T980 for the last couple months.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a wide range of length settings. The vacuum works very well. Battery life is good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A couple times the &#x27;length dial&#x27; moved by itself, changing the closeness in the middle of the shave/trim. I realized I might have been pressing too hard and actually pushed the mechanism down inadvertently. This problem would not happen with a fixed blade trimmer. Overall, I&#x27;m very pleased. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product exclusively for beard trimming, but tried trimming my head once. The vacuum didn&#x27;t work very well and I would recommend trimming your head over the sink. Besides the mess, it did a very good job.</li>
            <li> biggest complaints goes on the noise of the trimmer thanks to the vacuum and very unprecise cut of the beard</li>
            <li> The trimmer works reasonably well, and the vacuum on the high setting (why did they bother with a low?) gets almost all the hair.  It&#x27;s a little hard to take the guard on and off to trim the neckline.  I have had no problems with the length setting sliding (I was worried about this from other reviews), and don&#x27;t see how you could.  Perhaps the manufacturing has changed slightly?</li>
            <li> Ok I took note of the reviews and some issues folks had with this model and I still purchased it.  What is worse is even though I found that I disliked the same things as others I kept it, and only after the 60 day return did I decide I didn&#x27;t really like it enough to use it.  So I am at fault, but I don&#x27;t want others to make the same mistake.  The length setting is easily shifted while in use.  There is a plastic part near the blades which moves up and down when pressed against your face, why not just have it stationary?  I removed the plastic piece and then when I went without it I got the 5 o&#x27;clock look when I set it on a 3 which is odd.  The vacuum does work well (when in turbo mode) but I really didn&#x27;t need it.  I donated it to the veterans, and I hope they get some use out of it.  I then went to target and for 25 dollars (10 less) I purchased the remington mb-300, which is much like the old norelco I had but better in several ways.  If anyone is thinking of purchasing the t-980 please reconsider and get the remington mb-300.</li>
            <li> I have owned the Norelco T980 for a few months now, and it is great.  I had a previous Norelco model for about 4 years and finally it just stopped holding a charge so I bought the T980.  With the old Norelco my wife used to complain about little hairs all over the sink.  No more!  It may not capture every single hair, but I would say it gets a good 90-95% of them.  Regardless, it vacuums up enough of the hairs to keep my wife happy!    In my mind the only two small items that keep it from being a 5-star product are: 1) it does not have a pop-up trimmer like my old model did - you have to take the regular blade off and put on the trimmer blade, but that is the price you pay for having the vacuum feature, and 2) its harder to get up close and trim under my nose - it can be done, it just takes more effort than before; again I think its the price you pay for the vacuum feature.  Overall I have had great luck with Norelco trimmers and this one is no exception.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Norelco beard trimmer for years. I bought the first T100 which used 2 AA batteries. I&#x27;ve seen the improvements over the years and they have definitely added to how well the products functioned. Right off the bat I&#x27;ll tell you my exception. This beard trimmer was made in China. That might not matter at all to some and you are entitled to your opinion. But it matters to me and I was slightly disappointed to see that they are not being made in Austria anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I am impressed with this trimmer. The turbo vacuum system works great. I have not had to clean my bathroom sink even once. The self-sharpening blades no longer need to be lubricated with oil. Ever though this unit is slightly bigger than my last one (T990)it is not more awkward in my hands. Even the Accu Control System&#x27;s flexing guide comb is easier to clean than the last one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to recharge the battery after 2 or 3 uses but it does have a quick charge feature that takes about 1 hour. So I can&#x27;t really complain about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not noticed any problems with actually trimming my beard. The 9 lockable length settings have not slipped for me as others have reported (I am currently using a number 4). I have not had any problems with trimming under my nose but I have been used to using a Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some trimmers are still made in the USA like Wahl but some of the features in this Norelco I have not found in other trimmers like the vacuum trimmer feature. If this Norelco was still made in Austria I would have given it a 5 star rating. But other than that it is a good beard trimmer and I am enjoying using it.</li>
            <li> I chose this trimmer mostly because of the vacuum feature.  Unfortunately the vacuum only captures maybe half the trimmings.  I am not sure yet, but it seems to catch only the shortest cuttings.      Also:  The directions say that charging more than necessary will reduce battery life.  Modern decent-quality rechargeable devices automatically prevent overcharging so you can plug it in and forget it.  For the price this product should have that feature.</li>
            <li> I have a long beard, so I use the #9 setting.  So far, this setting has not slipped to a lower setting, but I have been careful to avoid pressing the trimmer hard against my face.  Beard trimming takes longer than I had expected.  It takes time, and a lot of strokes to get all the hairs into the clipper teeth.  The Turbo Vacuum does work well, and the chamber is large enough to hold about two weeks worth of hair growth.  If you are not pressed for time, the T980 is a lot of fun to use.</li>
            <li> Works well, but has three flaws:      Length setting selector moves too easily and slips in use    110 volts only    clunky transformer on cord instead of built-in adapter.    If you travel outside of North America, you have to carry a transformer with you to recharge this product.</li>
            <li> I recently grew a goatee and was looking for a no-nonsense, easy to use trimmer that would not break the bank and I found it with this product. I get a close trim, never pulls the hair on my face, easy to clean and no mess. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I bought the T980 to replace my old T760, which has a similar shape and size.     Vacuum works well enough. I bet it would work even better if I didn&#x27;t wait 2-3 weeks between beard trimmings. Still, the vacuum picked up probably 80% of my long hair with the turbo setting. That means a lot less cleaning up to do.    Accu-Control is the reason I bought the T980. Just like my old T760 that I had for 5-6 years, you adjust the guard by twisting the zoom lock till you see the numbered setting you want. The twisting feature makes it hard to accidentally change mid trim.    Corded/cordless-The instructions say that you should charge it only when dead, and charge it fully. The only thing that&#x27;s difficult about that is you have to keep using it until the battery runs out, which makes having the corded/cordless feature necessary. If it&#x27;s dead and I need to clip now, all I have to do is plug it in while I trim.    Turbo really works well, even if it does make it louder (though not nearly as loud as a Wahl 9918C beard trimmer I had to use). I liked that the turbo not only boosted power to the vacuum, but also to the blades making a much more even and short cut the first time eliminating the need to do a second pass.</li>
            <li> I purchased the T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer as a replacement for a Norelco trimmer I had cherished for ten years.  You become attached to the weight and feel of a trimmer and losing an old friend is hard.  Finding a replacement is a risky challenge.  The T980, however, fit the bill.  The weight and feel are comparable, not bulky or heavy.  The fine tuning length control works well, although I recommend you always start a little long and work down.  The shortest setting will leave you with a \\&quot;very\\&quot; short stubble.  The best innovation in that ten year time span is the vacuum system for the T980.  No longer do I need to devote an additional 3 minutes to cleaning out the sink and counter after Trimming my beard.  What a blessing.  The one thing I should warn people of is the Trimmer&#x27;s availability.  I looked all over for the instrument in retail stores as I needed a trimmer post haste for a trip I was taking.  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  Lots of lower price point Norelcos, but not the T980.  Amazon was my salvation.  You can save time by forgoing the retail search and buying direct from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Nothing beats turbo.  There&#x27;s no reason to even have the button.  It should be the only setting.  Ignore what people said about it jumping to other settings.  That only happens if you&#x27;re REALLY pressing this thing into your face, and there&#x27;s no need for that unless you&#x27;re Sasquatch.  Battery life seems great so far.  Attachable trim piece adds an extra space, but it works well and vacuums the hairs as well.</li>
            <li> I replaced an older model norelco vacuum trimmer with this one.  The &#x27;low battery&#x27; and smart &#x27;charge&#x27; indicators are great.  Really the only reason to replace my previous trimmer was that the battery no longer held a charge and the batteries are not replaceable.  With the indicators on this trimmer, it is much easier to try and extend the life of the battery.  Not to mention that the vacuum is much stronger on this newer model also.  A lot less to clean up around the sink.</li>
            <li> My only other trimmer was a Norelco adjustable trimmer. So I can only compare it to that one.     The T980 is much larger and trims quite well.    The biggest drawback in my mind is when you want trim around your beard or mustache or ears, you can&#x27;t simply pull off the plastic guard and expose the  blades. You must replace the guard with a much smaller head that has exposed  blades designed for this purpose.</li>
            <li> Bought this to replace my older model.  This one runs faster and has a Turbo setting. (for beard trimming speed contests i guess)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall this does the job, and there&#x27;s nothing similar to this one.</li>
            <li> I had a simular older model before and the battery went bad, the cost of the replacement battery was half of this new unit. I decided to replace the whole unit with the new version and am so glad I did. The vacuum and container make this a no mess beard trimmer, go from stubble to short hair by adjusting the guide. Clean out container once a month for stubble trimming (more for beard trimming I am sure).    I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> So, I bought the lower model at Target without the vacuum earlier today and plugged it in, realizing that it didn&#x27;t have enough power to do the deed, and the battery seemed pathetic.  It was a tough choice between the lesser model and the one with the vacuum/turbo.      I exchanged the crappy one for this one and found its capabilities supersede my needs, and then some.  I could probably trim the hedges with this thing.  The vacuum is also very impressive.  I assumed I&#x27;d be sweeping half my body hair off the floor (yeah, \\&quot;bodyhair\\&quot; trimmers don&#x27;t actually do what I want them to, so I use beard trimmers.  Most people that I know do, too).    So, what&#x27;s the drawback?  The setting doesn&#x27;t stay put.  Unless you old it by the setting dial, it&#x27;ll slip down with even the slightest pressure.  It&#x27;s pathetic.  The box says something about setting \\&quot;lock\\&quot;, but that&#x27;s just a norelco company inside joke.</li>
            <li> Flawless - I use it for self-inflicted haircuts.  Assumed the vac was a gimmick, but it works perfectly - no cleaning the sink or floor.  First used it when my hair was \\&quot;long\\&quot; - 1/4\\&quot;+ - and the vac sucked up the all the clippings.  Great value and delivers on the promises made in the product description.</li>
            <li> I find that the smallest setting--#1--does not give a real stubble shave. After about five-days without shaving, the trimmer would not cut anything when set at #1. The only way I can get a closer shave is to take the head attachment off and shave with the blade exposed, but this can result, and has resulted, in bald spots where I&#x27;ve tipped the blade too close to my face. This also defeats the vacuum function.</li>
            <li> The only problem is the covering on the hair chamber is quite loose. It will come off and spill if I lay the thing down on the wrong side. All this means is I have to empty it every time before stowing it. A minor problem    Otherwise, it works perfectly.</li>
            <li> Whenever I purchase an item from Amazon, I check the reviews, usually the bad ones first to decide if the reviewers are being hyper-critical which we tend to be in this spoiled, lazy society. Complaints about this product are splitting hairs (sorry) to say the least. Its a well made device that does what it says and I am very pleased with it. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t vacuum up all the hairs is, in my opinion, minor. It&#x27;s not really loud either, when you consider how good it works. It does take a little training, but it is a great little tool.</li>
            <li> This is the best trimmer I have used.  When on &#x27;turbo&#x27; mode, the vacuum catches almost all hair.</li>
            <li> I am pleased with the product and its ease of use. The trim time takes less than one minute, and only seconds to clean the razor.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the Older model of Norelco very plain, simple and still working. This one has too much bell and whistle but not as good as the older model. I would&#x27;ve returned it back to Amazon if shipping wasn&#x27;t an issue.</li>
            <li> This product does everything the manufacturer says and does it very well.    You get a complete package of accessories too.</li>
            <li> I have it now for several years and using 2 to 3 times a week. Still works great. The only problem I have is the top flap on hair collecting chamber came off at the joint where it swivel.</li>
            <li> This product lived up to my expectations and continues to produce the desired results. Phillips makes a great line of trimmers.</li>
            <li> The vacuum really works.</li>
            <li> I have owned two previous \\&quot;accu-vac\\&quot; models.  The vacuum always seemed kinda useless, mostly hype. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Well.....the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode on this puppy REALLY vuccums!  If you can tolerate the noise that the turbo mode produces, I would recommend using turbo mode at all times.  If noise is a concern, like in early morning, the standard mode does an ok job too. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The price is right on this thing, and it LOOKS sweet.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;95% mess free.   Very Nice!</li>
            <li> If you are considering getting this trimmer, all you need to know is this: The 9 lockable length settings don&#x27;t actually lock!! I tried putting it on length \\&quot;3\\&quot;, but when I started to trim, it went down to length \\&quot;2\\&quot;.  Then I started on length 2 and it went down to length 1.  Besides this, the cutting block is too far away from the thing that touches your face (not sure what it&#x27;s called), so it&#x27;s very hard to cut any hair at all unless you choose the length setting 3 or lower.  I know all this may come as a surprise to those of you who have had success with previous Norelco trimmers, but the fact is that this thing is a serious piece of Sh_t.  In my estimation, their aspirations to achieve the fancy \\&quot;vacuum effect\\&quot; has clouded what should be their primary goal with this device: to trim facial hair EVENLY and EFFECTIVELY!  I would have given this 0 stars if it would have been an option.</li>
            <li> It does a nice job, but has way too many little, fragile parts. It needs to be built more simply, more durable, less prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> After years of trimming by beard over the waste basket, I now have a product that eliminates 99.9% of the hairs flying off the trimmer blades.  So far I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product (after a couple of weeks of use).  I don&#x27;t find the noise of the turbo mode to be a problem at all.  Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This was purchased as a gift.  I haven&#x27;t heard any negative feedback from the receiver, so I guess it does well.  The vacuum feature was much appreciated.  I would give it an overall good rating.</li>
            <li> I had used another Norelco trimmer for many years and had been looking for a new one for some time. According to the Norelco site the T980 was the most popular seller, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. After nearly a month of use with this trimmer, I&#x27;m very pleased. The blades are very sharp which has resulted in cleanly cut whiskers. The vacuum does an exceptional job, especially in the turbo mode. Aditionally, the price I paid for the item with Amazon.com was around $20.00 cheaper than the other stores and sites I had shopped. Not to mention shipping was free.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, Norelco really messed up what they had right to begin with. The length adjustment does not snap into place like my old Norelco trimmer and will shift while you are shaving. If you want to get a clean shave, go ahead and purchase this product, because that is exactly what you will have to do after using it. Disappointing build quality!</li>
            <li> I had a norelco trimmer I bought about 10 years ago that just finally ran out of breath. I figured there isn&#x27;t much to a trimmer so it shouldn&#x27;t matter what I get to replace it - wrong. I went through 3 other trimmers before I finnally went back to the norelco. This particular model had a built in vacuum - I figured it was more of a gimic than anything but I figured as long as it cut good I&#x27;d be happy and I was just plain curious about the vacuum part. To my surprise the vacuum actually works pretty good - if you keep a bushy beard you&#x27;ll need to empty out the pouch a few times per trimming (it fills up pretty fast). If you are looking for a good dependable trimmer (that doesn&#x27;t pull more hair than it cuts) I&#x27;d spend the few extra bucks and pick up the norelco.</li>
            <li> I am so mad about trying to register for this trimmer for warranty service on the Phillips Norelco web page that I can&#x27;t actually say whether or not the trimmer is any good.  I went on the web page for registration and they require you to answer a full privacy invasive survey to register the product.  When I refused to do the survey to register and complained through the  webmaster contact I then get an answer back from Phillips wanting me to waste my time calling an 800 number for Norelco - we all know how those calls go!!   At least with the 60 day money back guarantee maybe I can calm down and decide if I like the unit - sure don&#x27;t like the service so far!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  I was skeptical after reading some of these reviews but decided to try it anyway.  Well, I am certainly glad I did!  My husband loves it.  He was just using regular hair clippers before to trim his gotee and hair would get everywhere!  Now with this trimmer he gets a much better trim and the hair is vaccumed up and never reaches the sink!  It is awesome.  The trimmer is easy to use he has NO problems with it \\&quot;slipping\\&quot; to a different cut level.  I would recommend this wholeheartedly!  A+++++</li>
            <li> This is my first electric beard trimmer and it is great.  I feel my experience is consistent with most reviews presented.  The trimmer does a great job, is easy to adjust, and the vacuum function works very well.  Again, does not get 100% of clippings, but I would say at least 80% are caught.  One shortcoming is that this likely would not work well for long thick beards as the longest setting does not seem that long to me, but I&#x27;m just speculating since I keep my beard short so this is not a problem for me.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I travel a lot between two places and one of the things I bought for the 2nd place was this razor, so I wouldn&#x27;t have to carry one back and forth.  This razor impressed me so much I bought one for my 1st place to replace what I had been using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The major pros of this product:  Solid feel, the vacuum feature definitely reduces the amount of hair in the sink (and on the counter, on the floor, etc.), the Turbo mode, while loud, is awesome.  The razor cuts well, fast, and can do very straight lines (and I don&#x27;t have very steady hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is at least one caveat, which other reviewers mentioned:  For detailed, close trimming, you&#x27;re cutting blind with this razor.  I use a cheaper Norelco to even up corners and other tight spaces.  Also, the power brick is a bit large, and there&#x27;s no included charging base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the product works well, feels solid in my hands, and it looks cool :-).  I have about 6 electric razors and I highly recommend this one.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer but I like my old one better that broke after 10 years of good use. Unfortunately they do not make the Maverick anymore, so I brought this one as the closest thing. I like the vacuum and turbo function. Also the carrying case is convinent. Over all I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works pretty well.  It trims my beard and moustache adequately and to the length I want, but not on first pass.  Most of the trimmings make it into the collection chamber, but not all of them.  I would say about twenty percent of the trimmings end up in the sink not the collection chamber.    This is a replacement for me for a T990 Norelco trimmer, with a dead battery.  I now have to disassemble that trimmer to get at and remove the dead battery for recycling.  That is a problem with this trimmer too: it has a rechargeable but not replaceable battery.  When the battery no longer takes a charge, as with my old trimmer, the trimmer will not run even when the cord is plugged in.  I would prefer a trimmer that is corded, with no battery, or with a replaceable rechargeable battery.  What Norelco has done is created a trimmer with built in obsolescence.  When the battery is dead, the trimmer is done for.  And batteries are not environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> My Norelco T900 was great, but broke recently, so I went out looking for another one, only to find it was discontinued. Didn&#x27;t see any Norelco trimmers comparible to my old trimmer.  Bought a T980, took it home, and found out the first trim... its junk (I&#x27;m being nice with my wording).  Overall, its too big to easily hold.  Worst of all, the trim height setting moves when you press it against your face... so during my first trim, it ruined my goatee.  Not a good trimmer, period.  Too big, too much bling.  I don&#x27;t need a vacuum cleaner built into my trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have been using a Norelco T370 trimmer for several months.  I bought it for the mini-shaver initially, decided to grow a beard, then trimmed the beard with the beard trimmer attachment.  It did a great job of shaping and trimming, but left a mess of clippings in the sink.  After reading a million reviews, I decided to try the T980 for it&#x27;s vacuum feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The T980 is great!  It does a perfect job of trimming my beard evenly (setting at 7, ultimate beard length to be a 9).  The best part is that about 90% of the clippings go into the vacuum receptical with only about 10% being lost.  I have not come across any of the negatives (adjustment slips, tugs hairs and on and on) mentioned in other reviews.  Unlike my T370, this trimmer lets you know when it&#x27;s fully charged or about to go dead, and even if it does die in the middle of a session from a dead battery, plugging it in finishes the job.  Most other trimmers only work when charged, not on house current.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t think of anything this trimmer could do better.  In my estimation it&#x27;s looks, design and operation are flawless.  The clipper works well on my beard&#x27;s &#x27;neckline&#x27; and the mini-trimmer keeps the bottom of my mustache trimmed perfectly.  I really think the T370 does as good a job trimming as this one does, but will not run with a dead battery when plugged in, and does make a mess with beard clippings all over the place.  For those two reasons alone, this trimmer is a BEST BUY!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not putting the T370&#x27;s abilities down in any way.  For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  It trims well and the mini-shaver is still the best way to shave the short hairs on my cheeks above my beard on a daily basis.  I use it daily along with the T980 and will continue to.  They both have their place.  If you don&#x27;t mind the beard trimmings everywhere, you will be happy with the T370, however if you are serious about perfect beard grooming (and I DO mean PERFECT), with none of the mess, both tools are a must.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a Norelco 8000 series shaver with a trimmer for awhile.  When I grew a beard, I bought this unit based on the reviews I read here at Amazon.  It&#x27;s true that because of the vacuum, there is less hair in the sink.  But the quality of its trimming is far below that on my Norelco shaver.  If I&#x27;d known then what I know now, I would have passed on this item. It may be good for those who don&#x27;t have a Norelco shaver with the trimming feature, (and don&#x27;t want to pay a hundred dollars or more for such a shaver).  But for those who have such a shaver, this product is, at best, superfluous.    January 29, 2008    It&#x27;s not even a year later, and it has broken already.  I&#x27;m not a happy camper.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is sharper than the devil himself.  My cat, Loid, was once 10lbs of fur and bones.  Now, he&#x27;s just bones.  A lot of people say that the blade level switches on them during use.  So let me get this straight.  Our boys are in Iraq fighting for the George Bush war machine and these guys talk about the level&#x27;s switching on their trimmer?  I wish that was my biggest problem of the day.  I have never had that problem with the trimmer.  Most of the hairs are captured in the hair cage.  Let me tell ya, after I butter myself up for a nice shave, I let the Norelco do the work, and the result makes my face make a baby&#x27;s butt feel like sandpaper.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is exactly what I needed. I read all the positive reviews and decided to give it a try. Truly impressed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum suction keeps the basin clean and it is a breeze to use. The charge lasts a long time and pulling it apart for cleaning is very easy. I occasionally use a compressed air can to thoroughly clean it once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the way you can choose the size of trim with a simple twist, but I use the trimmer bare or at setting \\&quot;0\\&quot; to get that fashionable stubble look. The stubble helps because my skin does not respond well to razor shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It probably takes me 5 minutes in the morning to do and lasts all day. The given attachment also helps with closer trims and helps fine tune the trim, so no need to follow through with a razor shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also the carrying case they included was useful during travel too and accommodates other toiletries. :)</li>
            <li> turbo is unnecessary, and there does not appear to be a benefit...vacuum is great addition to product...trimmer setting can change while in use if you push the trimmer too hard against your face...trimmer settings different than previous norelco trimmer (not a good difference)...for my beard, the previous product set on #2 was too close and on the turbo trimmer, the setting is not close enough (#1 setting is too close)...Carrying case is so soft it is useless if you travel and want to protect the product, and the second trimming head...previous product had a cord that plugged directly into the socket...this trimmer has a bulky transformer attached...removal of trimming heads is not easy enough...on occassion the trimming head came off so strangly that it was dropped on the floor...not happy with this product although, as previously stated, the vacuum is really a great addition</li>
            <li> Trimmer works quite well, especially on \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode.  In Turbo, the vacuum does indeed catch almost all the cut whiskers.</li>
            <li> Works just as I&#x27;d hoped.  The vacuum isn&#x27;t perfect, nor should that be expected.  However, it does collect by far most of the cut hairs.  So long as it&#x27;s kept clean, it&#x27;ll keep working.</li>
            <li> Works well. Good ergonomics. Convenient length adjustment. Hair collector works but has limited benefit in my opinion. Charge doesn&#x27;t last long but it is rechargeable so not really an issue.</li>
            <li> great razor trims very good not a linner and be careful with the Vac. it will take more than you want</li>
            <li> 1. Noisy  2. Vacuum filter is not perfect, some small hair pieces go to the air around. I don&#x27;t use it indoors.  3. Trimming level can be accidentally changed in process, which is unacceptable. You should check it all the time.  4. Strong battery, at least new. Holds charge for 3-4 sessions.  Overall quality is good.</li>
            <li> This was a gift I gave to my son-in-law, but he has told me several times how much he is enjoying it.  Says the vacuum feature works very well, and that he is able to keep his beard at an even length.  My daughter says there is no unwanted hair in the sink, so that&#x27;s a big YIPPEE right there!</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to reduce the hair particulate that was building up in my bathroom from daily trimming. It did do that well; unfortunately, that&#x27;s all it did well. The air intake plastic lip made a close shave VERY DIFFICULT to achieve. Also, the blades did not move quickly enough to avoid occasional pulling of hairs. Also, I noticed far more skin irritation using this product than any past trimmers. I bought an Oster trimmer for nearly the same price on amazon and been supremely happy with it. I&#x27;d prefer to live with a few hair clippings than put up with a mediocre, albeit flashier, trimmer.</li>
            <li> I have had several trimmers and I would say this one does a nice job.. the vac only OK.</li>
            <li> I got this for my 22 year old boyfriend. He loves it b/c it is small, sleek, and gets the job done. Not having a beard myself :) I had no idea what the heck to get so I just researched a bunch of different ones and this one appeared to be the best for beard trimming.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve worn a beard for over twenty five years and have used many types of trimmers--plug-in, cordless, scissors, and this is the best yet.  It has the power of a plug-in trimmer, the convenience of a cordless, and the precision of scissors.  The vacuum feature really does work, and the waste receptacle is easy to clean.  In short, I can find only positive to say about this trimmer and I&#x27;m very glad that I bought it.</li>
            <li> Works great on beard, although it doesn&#x27;t get close to your nose which can be a hassle.  Haven&#x27;t used similar products and assume this is par for the course.</li>
            <li> I purchased this norelco to trim the hair on my head. I had an older model and it worked great. The length selector doesn&#x27;t lock and I ended up cutting my hair too short. It&#x27;s just an OK product. I know it may not be designed to cut head hair but, I thought it would work as well as the older model. I guess I was wrong. I would only buy this if I was cutting facial hair only.</li>
            <li> Out of the box, one of the best looking trimmers that is offered.  however, this is not why i buy a beard trimmer in the first place.  i need my beard trimmed.  i charge the t980 up in about an hour and go at it.  it comes to life with the expected amount of noise and vibration.  i hit turbo to see what that is all about.  it seems to double its rpm.  the trimmer works flawlessly, as though the blades were sharp and efficient.  the vacuum is a nice touch.  but curly beard hairs have a mind of their own.  when cut, they seem to want to escape the suction.  turns out the vacuum gets about 90% of the hairs -certainly better than nothing.  it has an easy to read dial to adjust the length of your cuts.  light and ergonomic,  i give it my recommendation.</li>
            <li> This my 4rd trimmer in 15 years and by far the best yet. Love the vacumn collection space as the mess leaves very little cleanup.</li>
            <li> Bigger than I thought, which makes it a little bit harder to use, but it works great!</li>
            <li> We bought this to replace a 6 year old Norelco trimmer with a dead battery. It works quite nicely, just as the previous trimmer worked nicely. With that said, the introduction of the vacuum and \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode seem really unnecessary. Our experience has been that little bits of hair still fly all over the place, even with the vacuum--although perhaps to a slightly lesser degree. I haven&#x27;t found the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode to be that helpful. From my perspective, it seems to be a marketing tool designed to convince guys that they&#x27;re getting a really powerful, studly shaver. Power in a car, I can understand. But in a trimmer? Anyway, this is a great little trimmer. I just question the degree to which the new features are improvements.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works fine. Except it could have a couple of setting more after the 1 setting. The blades are easy to clean and battery last for a long time once fully charged.  Overall really good product.</li>
            <li> Works well as far as trimming your beard is concerned but the suction system isn&#x27;t as thorough as advertised. I always end up with hair on things.</li>
            <li> This is the first trimmer I&#x27;ve ever used.  I found it very easy and am satisfied with the quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never used it without turning Turbo on, so I don&#x27;t know what the regular is like. I&#x27;ve used it about seven or eight times so far and still haven&#x27;t recharged it from it&#x27;s initial charge. The length adjuster is very nice, much nicer than my old crappy walmart cheapie. However, I kept the cheapie because it cuts a little bit closer without a guard than this one does. And this way I don&#x27;t have to remove the guard. I usually use setting 1 for a close, stubble plus a little more look, and then shave my neck clean. Easy and convenient.    The Vacuum feature is nice, as it gets 98% of my hair. I now stand at the sink, instead of in the (dry) tub with a hand held mirror. Very little cleanup.    It cuts very smooth! I&#x27;ll see how it holds up over time, but for now it&#x27;s very nice, no pinching, no pulling.    Many people complained about the noise, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad.    The only complaint I have is that the guard is pretty big and it&#x27;s tough to trim my mustache without jamming the thing up against my nose.</li>
            <li> &#x27;Tornadoes&#x27; super warm beard trimmer and nose waxer was developed in the climates of Southern Arabia where men are known to never shave. This contributes to dry, coarse membranes which develop into flat tender sources for infection. This invention, a godsend, trims a beard, or shaves it all off, with the touch of a button and it also is great for bald patchy spots on top of the head.</li>
            <li> The Norelco T-980 price was not much more than the cost of replacing the battery in my 10-year old Norelco Maverick T-3000 and I was excited about the addition of a vacuum feature. Be careful what you wish for! The vacuum does its job and sink cleanup is definitely faster. But the vacuum feature tends to obscure your view of the blade edge making it much trickier to aim the thing at your beard&#x27;s edge while looking in the mirror. The vacuum must be emptied by using thumb pleasure to disengage one side of a rather flimsy, curved compartment cover that swings open on a hinge that looks so weak that I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s just a matter of time before I accidentally break either the hinge or snap the cover in half. Equally delicate-feeling are the two sliding, plastic prongs used to hold the primary blade in place. Yet it must be removed each time one wants to use the smaller, more accurate trimming blade. And of course the trimming blade uses similar prongs to hold it in place. My older T-3000 had a self-contained trimming blade that slid forward with a simple thumb push whenever needed and then retracted just as easily. The T-980 is larger around and heavier than the older unit... enough so that I really miss the sense of control and precision I was used to. In short, the T-980 feels clumsier, less maneuverable, and less accurate. It takes longer to complete the job due to the hassle of changing the regular blade and the trimming blade. And it really tries my patience having to be so careful not to beak one of those delicate, sliding, plastic prongs or the vacuum-compartment cover. I&#x27;m really tempted to pay the $30 it will cost to restore my old T-3000.</li>
            <li> No good for a goatee.It won&#x27;t fit under ones nose for mustache trimming. It&#x27;s just to big and bulky. Might be good for shearing sheep. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the money back guarantee, you still have to pay for shipping and insurance.</li>
            <li> I have used trimmers on my facial hair for over 40 years and this is by far the best one that I have had.</li>
            <li> Well in today corporate world I&#x27;m really surprised when the product actually is what the advertisement say. The most surprising part is that the vacuum pump really does the job. It&#x27;s not perfect but I&#x27;d say 95% at turbo mode. I didn&#x27;t gave it 5 stars because the order of stupid buttons is confusing, the turbo is like extra and actually should be the normal mode (it&#x27;s a still a product of corporate mentality) and the pies for adjusting the height of the trim is black and you can&#x27;t see were the blade exactly cuts. Should be transparent. Also doesn&#x27;t have base and can&#x27;t be put upright. (did I mention corporate thinking). Other than that is a good product. Definitely much better than Wahl at double price. Hope it will last at least a year. I have it in use for about a month.</li>
            <li> i love the fact that it has a vacuum on it.  now there is no mess.  definately worth buying.</li>
            <li> Like many other reviewers, I experienced the annoying nuisance of the trimmer length setting decreasing with normal pressure applied while trimming. This is really a huge problem. I have cut my beard too short twice as a result of this design flaw. Norelco should send us out new trimmers, guys! I also agree that the vacuum is a waste, as unless it retains most of the hairs (which it doesn&#x27;t), you still have to clean up the sink. Finally, having to manually change out the trimmer head to trim your mustache, ears, etc is a pain, and really not all that easy. I like the older design with a flip-out small trimmer head for the latter functions. The T980 is an example of \\&quot;newer is definitely not better\\&quot;. Back to the drawing board, PLEASE, Norelco.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about whether or not the vacuum would be able to get most of the falling hair, but it does a very good job. There is still a little bit of hair that gets to the counter, but maybe 1/100th of the total amount trimmed.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty good trimmer. The vacuum is not 100% effective, but it does a pretty good job. The battery is also pretty reliable. Cleaning is very easy, and I don&#x27;t believe it ever has to be oiled, which is quite a convenience.</li>
            <li> I always wondered how my doctor maintained that \\&quot;I just shaved yesterday\\&quot; look, now I know.</li>
            <li> i bought this to keep my beard nice and trim and it works GREAT.  I have also been using it on the back side of head now too, cuz the hair gets really bushy there and this is nice to keep it trim.  the vacuum aspect of it is the best, because you can really do the shaving anywhere, on the go, and not worry about leaving trimmings all over the place.</li>
            <li> The trimmer works very well however the vaccume does not collect much.  The vaccume does help pull your beard from your face which results in an even trim but if you are looking for a trimmer that requires no clean up afterwards this is not it.</li>
            <li> fantastic product. i&#x27;m very picky, and this trimmer lacks in no area. not noisy at all. no mess. many settings to get just the right length. very, very pleased with this purchase.</li>
            <li> Design flaw #1:&lt;br /&gt;The \\&quot;lockable\\&quot; length settings don&#x27;t lock. So if you apply a normal amount of pressure to the device, your number 5 beard setting will be pushed down to a number 1. They should&#x27;ve built some sort of locking switch onto this thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design flaw #2:&lt;br /&gt;When you remove the trimmer guard to just use the trimming blade itself for detail trimming, the blue plastic vacuum guard blocks the trimming blade. You have to push it against your hair line for the plastic guard to move out of the way. Trying to catch the hair is good, but this is not a good design for precise trimming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design flaw #3:&lt;br /&gt;They give you an additional smaller trimming blade for detail work on the moustache, but it isn&#x27;t built into the trimmer, so you have to remove the outer guard, remove the inner trimming blade, usually clean out all the hair, then attach the new trimming blade. My old trimmer had a switch that just caused a smaller trimmer blade to pop out, so I didn&#x27;t have to remove all of the other stuff this trimmer makes you remove. That would&#x27;ve been a better design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design flaw #4:&lt;br /&gt;The on switch is just a big button you press down on and not a switch. So if you want to stick this in the supplied travel bag and into your suitcase, expect it to accidentally turn on. You can also accidentally turn it off while shaving if you don&#x27;t watch your grip. A better design would&#x27;ve been a switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Design flaw #5:&lt;br /&gt;Since it&#x27;s a vacuum, it has a hair reservoir. They did one good thing this time and actually made the beard reservoir window clear. But it&#x27;s not removable and it&#x27;s just a door that opens up - so it&#x27;s harder to clean out. Also, the hair reservoir isn&#x27;t big enough and if you have a moderate or heavy beard, you&#x27;ll find yourself cleaning this trimmer out every time you use it (which is what it recommends in the manual). Who has time for that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum doesn&#x27;t catch enough hair for it to be worth all of the inconveniences of its design flaws. Maybe one day they can get this design right. Until then, save your money and use a regular shaver with replaceable trimming attachments and put down a paper towel to catch the hair.s design right. Until then, save your money and use a regular shaver with replaceable trimming attachments and put down a paper towel to catch the hair.</li>
            <li> Never really got a good shave out of this.  The chamber would fill up so quickly and I could only get what I needed after several passes in turbo mode.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had various Norelco&#x27;s over the past couple decades and they all work wonderful fo a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> This seemed like a great idea.  Doesn&#x27;t cut that well if you have a thicker beard.  I think I used it for about a month before I gave up on it.  You would be better off buying a set of clippers with the different guards and trimming your beard that way.</li>
            <li> This trimmer is probably one of the best ones I have ever owned. The vacuum is probably the best part - everyone knows how much hair goes everywhere when you trim your beard, but this one significantly cuts down on that. My wife could practically write Norelco a thank you note. You also can trim in the shower if you&#x27;re prone to manscaping (no judging, I promise!) since this model is waterproof. Overall, a solid buy that I would do again in a heartbeat.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer in March 2009 to replace an older Norelco T770 model trimmer whose battery was dying.  I have been using the T980 regularly (roughly weekly) since then and am very happy with it.  The T980 is a nice upgrade.  It looks and feels sturdier than the older T770.    I used to have trouble with the older model T770; the dial that regulates how close a trim you get would slip a notch.  I haven&#x27;t had that issue with the new trimmer at all.    The vacuum works well and the vacuum compartment is easy to empty and clean.  To clean out the drive compartment you must still remove the trimmer head and use the included brush.    I can&#x27;t comment on the Turbo setting because I haven&#x27;t really used that; for me it works just fine at the normal setting.  Battery life so far has been good, noticeably better than the older model even when it was new.  So far, with my weekly usage I&#x27;ve only had to do 2 charges since the initial one.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this trimmer for about 5 months. Overall, this is a good but not great personal appliance. Yes, it trims quite well and holds a charge for an acceptable number of uses. But product design could be better. I&#x27;m always inadvertently pressing the poorly placed on/off switch. However, the trimmer&#x27;s phallic-like shape is good for a laugh with the ladies.     The \\&quot;Turbo\\&quot; feature is simply a marketing gimmick. Happily, a gas compressor used for forced-induction of an internal combustion engine is not to be found here. This battery powered device does not have an internal combustion engine. Duh! The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature generates a little more noise and vibration. The ladies like that too.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a cheaper Philips Norelco product that I bought a while back. I wanted to get away from having a bunch of attachments, a bulky base station, and hair all over the sink. This trimmer does pretty much everything I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the trimmer itself is a little bigger than most, it charges with just a power cord and has only one precision attachment. This makes it incredibly easy to store and keeps it out of the way. The vacuum built into the trimmer works pretty well, with the \\&quot;regular\\&quot; or \\&quot;non-Turbo\\&quot; mode successfully capturing most of the hair that&#x27;s trimmed off. A small amount of tiny trimmings does fall in the sink, but turning on Turbo does fix this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned the T980 for 6 weeks now and am very satisfied.  I&#x27;d buy it again.    Product works very well.  I was skeptical about the vacuum, but it really does the job keeping the bathroom clean.  Powerful.  Holds a charge well.  Guard is sturdy.  No complaints.    The manual says it&#x27;s only for 110v, but I took it to Spain and charged it with no problems.  (It needs a plug adapter for this, but otherwise it worked fine for me.)</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer to replace an aging Wahl trimmer that could no longer hold a charge. I have been very happy with the design of this machine, the settings adjustments, the vacuum for clippings- just about everything. I have already gotten 7 trims out of the initial charge.</li>
            <li> For everyone&#x27;s information: I got mine in August 2009 and it came with a \\&quot;universal\\&quot; charger (110-240V) that works overseas. Awesome!</li>
            <li> After reading the negative reviews on this trimmer I was worried about the adjustable guard height because the folks rating this product with one star that was their biggest complaint.  I can only assume that Norelco heard those issues because the locking mechanism on mine is very solid.  I use a little bit of force to try to change and it did not budge.    The vacuum is also more powerful than the previous Remington model I had.  Although I did like the hair collection system on the Remington better.  I little drawer pulled out that you could easily dump out in the basket and wash out if desired.    The first time I opened the Norelco compartment I was holding the device vertical and the hair clippings spilled out.  Now that I know, it is not that big of deal, just not optimal.     I like the Norelco&#x27;s sleek design and the feel of it in my hand. However, I liked the way the Remington could sit on the sink counter in the vertical position, taking up less counter space.</li>
            <li> Very fast with little (if any) cleanup required thanks to the built-in vacuum functionality. Would have been great if it came with a stand; just an opportunity for improvement.  Amazon price was significantly less than retail (25%).  Great shaver for beard or goatee.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I have to agree with some of the more critical reviews of this product. I say unfortunately, because the vacuum actually works pretty good when the unit is new. But ask those people who rave on and on about this unit how well their trimmer is working after a few months use and i bet you will get a totally different answer. The suction power substantially decreases after a few months of use it and it drops clumps of hair every where. And this is despite cleaning the unit thoroughly after each use.    There are just too many other problems with this trimmer to recommend it. Most namely, it keeps breaking. I&#x27;m on my fifth unit in 3 years. Luckily it does have a 2 year warranty and Philips/Norelco has been terrific at replacing them. But, still, this continually breaking is a problem. I think this is mostly due to the cheap plastic build.      I also agree with another review in regards to the ON/OFF and Turbo buttons being in a bad location. Because these buttons are where the fingers naturally sit to hold the trimmer I&#x27;m constantly, unintentionally, turning the trimmer off. This is very annoying. And I too have had the unit change to a shorter setting during use. Also very annoying.</li>
            <li> I have been using a generic Wahl trimmer for the past two and a half years, and have always complained about it because it would always leave my beard completely uneven around the jawline and by my sideburns. I decided it was finally time to just go for it and get a new one, and based on the reviews of this trimmer I decided to try it out. I just used it last night, and I&#x27;m completely happy with it. It&#x27;s the first time I had a completely even shave--including my jawline and the vacuum works better than I expected. Of course it did not catch all of the hair; however, I would say it got about 90% of it which really eased the clean up. The nine settings lock into place which is nice (and was an improvement over my previous trimmer, which would slip into lower settings now and again), and it is possible to take the comb off and do detailed trims with the detail blade included. The only criticism that I have is that the blade doesn&#x27;t work too well to do extreme details because of the bulkiness of the unit, but for me the rest of the package more than compensates for this. I definitely recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> Good at sucking up hair. Depth gauage works well. Other options for triming around lips good.</li>
            <li> My son had an earlier model of this Phillips Norelco trimmer and wanted another of the same when his finally died.  He wouldn&#x27;t consider anything other than another Norelco.  He was thrilled to get the new version for Christmas and was happy that the new features make it even better than the original.</li>
            <li> I bought my husband a Philips Nnorelco T980 Turbo Vacuum [beard]Trimmr, for Christmas.  He had asked for a new beard trimmer and I was happy to oblige.  The reason I chose this particular one, is that it vacuums up the bits of beard rather than finding them in the sink.  As a result, there are two happy people in our home. Husband is getting the control and settings he likes for his beard and mustache.  I am not finding beard hair in the sink, or clogging the pipe.  Very pleased with this choice and happy to recommend it to anyone considering purchasing a new trimmer.</li>
            <li> This is my second Norelco trimmer, the first was before Philips acquired Norelco. The T980 is an improvement. The vacuum feature saves a lot of cleaning up time, and I am free of the irritations caused sometimes by a single hair. The settings need a bit of study, not the same as my earlier model. I have already paid for the trimmer, because with the vacuum feature, I can shave my head easily myself, saving $19:00 per head-shave. I don&#x27;t understand or use the turbo feature. Everything moves faster, unnecessary in my view, and it is very noisy. Here&#x27;s to a quieter world. The trimmer is rechargeable. I don&#x27;t know whether it will be possible to replace the battery.    Ian Yeomans</li>
            <li> I tried a Wahl to replace my 8 year old Norelco Maverick. Brought it back to Wal-Mart the next day.    The T980 is a much better product. Adjustments are easy and there&#x27;s no additional blade guides to snap on and lose. It will hold the adjustment if you need to remove the guide to trim closer.    This is a superior product to the Wahl in every respect. Spend a few extra bucks and get the Norelco. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Works great!  Little to no clean-up.  Just empty the chamber the hair is caught in and you are done.</li>
            <li> This is a great trimmer and the vacuum works really well.  I wish there was a 2.5 setting.  For me the 2 is a little on the short side and 3 is a bit much.  Besides that I love it!</li>
            <li> this product is the best trimmer i ever had with a vacuum. no external mess,the variable speeds,and depths make it a product to meet anyone&#x27;s needs.</li>
            <li> Got this as a replacement for a 10+ year old Conair beard trimmer that finally was unable to hold a charge anymore.  My only real requirement was that it had to be able to be used corded OR cordless, for those times when you realize you shouldn&#x27;t look like a deadbeat just as you are about to walk out the door, only to find out that the unit needs charging!  The beard cutting is very uniform, seems to be plenty of height adjustment settings, and about 95% of the trimmings magically got sucked into the little chamber instead of all over my bathroom counter, which is a huge boost for my marriage!  Feels a little plastic-y, not cheap but not as solid as my old unit - will be fine if you are not an equipment trasher and as long as you pay a little attention when sliding the moveable pieces off and on and make sure you have them in the right groove.  Hope I get another 10 years out of this one!</li>
            <li> I really like the vacuum feature. Having a regular shaver before I used to spend more time cleaning the space after myself than actually shaving. This thing is simply amazing!</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace a 5-6 year old similar version that finally gave out on me.   The suction action on the old went out after 3 years of use but that may have had to do with a broken guard (my fault not Norelco&#x27;s).   Then the battery finally gave up a few months back.    I researched several alternatives but came back to the PN due to price and my experience with the previous version.  The T980 does all I ask it to:  I clip my goatee 2x per week and with this usage the battery lasts about a month.  I haven&#x27;t felt the need to use the turbo button so that might be contributing to the good battery life.    The clipper is a little loud but nothing out of the ordinary for a clipper in general.  The consistency of the cut length is superb.  If this clipper lasts as long as the previous one I&#x27;ll probably go back to PN and buy whatever the current version is then too.</li>
            <li> I have an previous Model of the same company trimmer and that is better than this. The vaccum is not good or better than the previous model. There is an obstruction for the saw that cut hair and it does not work smoothly. So, I&#x27;ll rate it as below average.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much more you can say about a product like this.  \\&quot;It does what it is supposed to do\\&quot; means it works perfectly for the job intended.</li>
            <li> Been using the T980 for a few weeks now and it works great! The price and free shipping made for a good deal. Also holds a charge quite well and so far very happy with it.</li>
            <li> I have had my T980 for a couple weeks now.  It works great.  What used to take me 15 minutes annoying minutes with scissors and the little trimmer attachment on my electric shaver, now takes 2 minutes.  It saves me a lot of time.  It hasn&#x27;t snagged a hair yet, it cuts clean and true.  It&#x27;s not only a beard trimmer, but it will edge for you too, so you can get a nice clean neck line or shape up your sideburns.  There are no attachments for me to otherwise misplace or lose.  It is easy to pick up and start operating as soon as it&#x27;s charged the first time.  The \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button turns up the speed of the trimmer, but I can&#x27;t think of a reason why I would ever need to do that.  I like this trimmer.  All of the reviews and articles that I read online pointed me to this particular grooming tool.  I know there are other big names in beard trimmers, but I am glad I chose the T980.  Seems to have a nice long battery life too; I don&#x27;t have to charge it up every time I get done using it.  Great beard trimmer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard since 1975 and this is the best trimmer I&#x27;ve ever had. The vacuum catches almost all clippings and the trimmer gives great, reproducable settings from very short to very long.    It rocks!</li>
            <li> This is the greatest trimmer I have ever used! The vacuum on it is impeccable and literally sucks up every hair! LOVE this trimmer! Light and handy!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never owned clippers before, but since I started growing a beard they were a necessity. The Philips has been in use a month and is remarkable. No changing heads, just turn a dial. The vacuum works surprisingly well, almost none of the clippings escape. It is rechargeable, removing the power cord, and I simply love this thing.</li>
            <li> I had an earlier version of this trimmer but it died.  Gave a long life (10 years) but I couldn&#x27;t complain.  I replaced it wth this model and it works as well as the previous version if not better.  I wish it had a removable collector rather than a door on a hinge.</li>
            <li> Vacuum works well but not as good as i thought. Still an awesome trimmer!!!</li>
            <li> Very short beard...bit longer than a 5 0&#x27;clock shadow.    Tried them all over the years.    This is in a class by itself.    Perfect even trim. Collects the cuttings. And very comfortable in the hand.</li>
            <li> This probably deserves 5 stars but I have no experience to compare. I can only say that it works great, does what its supposed to do, and I would never, ever buy any product without the vacuum. When I open up that compartment and throw away the clump in there and think that all that could be spread around the sink, floor, entire bathroom, I bless the vacuum. That&#x27;s why when I say it sucks, I mean that in the best of ways.     Now worth 5 stars.  It is now mid September and I can report that this is just wonderful. In my 6 plus decades on this planet I have grown a beard probably 10 - 12 times. The end always comes with the upkeep. Shaving has always been one my life&#x27;s peeves and growing a beard was a way to avoid that but then trimming and upkeep became a new peeve. Suddenly I have this wonderful piece of equipment that makes all of that child&#x27;s play. One setting for the length, go over it a few times each week in minutes, another setting for a few other areas and usually no clean-up thanks to the vacuum. I admit that I use my old electric razor for the trim around the mouth and the part of the cheeks kept clean, takes a few seconds, and maybe every 2 weeks a couple of minutes with a safety razor to make sure that the clean area hasn&#x27;t shrunk. A joy to use, no peeve, looks like this time the beard will stay. Oh yes, no problems to report with the way it works, the fit of the guard and the shaving heads. I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I have had a beard for 30 years and have purchased my share of trimmers. So far this has really impressed me. Hope it holds up!</li>
            <li> The adjustable blade guard works well, but it leaves an uneven cut.  I&#x27;m not sure how it works on beards and mustaches, but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for \\&quot;touch-ups\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s have dual voltage charger, so you can use it (with an adapter) in every country that support 110-240v from outlet.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve trusted Norelco for years, and this product doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  Trimming is easy, the vacuum feature is very convenient, keeping your bathroom counter and sink hair-free, and the multiple trim settings is also a plus.  The only gripe is that it&#x27;s loud, especially first thing in the morning, but it&#x27;s not a big issue to me.</li>
            <li> I had a Philips trimmer that lasted me 7 years. It&#x27;s still running but the battery can no longer be charged. This new trimmer is great so far, except for one feature: the vacuum system has a plastic sheath right infront of the trimmer teeth, and if you want to cut or shape your beard using the naked trimmer without the numbered head, it becomes difficult to gauge where the trimmer is cutting because of the obstruction.</li>
            <li> I bought this to replace and old Wahl vacuum-style trimmer I had for years. So far after a couple of weeks I can&#x27;t complain about this unit. I have still not drained the initial charge, but it is a much better trimmer than the Wahl ever was. It gets about 95% of the clippings (I can trim with a dress shirt on) and I only need one pass, where the Wahl needed two or three. The trimmers adjustment knob does have some wiggle as other reviewers have mentioned, which hopefully will not get worse over time. I wish the trimmer guide was made out of better plastic, it looks/feels somewhat brittle. Lastly, though it has little plastic nubs so it doesnt roll, I wish it came with a stand or holder. My holder for my Wahl trimmer will have to suffice.</li>
            <li> This is a great product,the only downfall I see is the vacuum guard in front of razors gets in the way of making straight lines.  Easily fixed though I just pulled it out!</li>
            <li> Few notes... its NOT a shaver. Is a BEARD TRIMMER! If you buy this in hopes to remove the guard and shave smooth, youre not going to be happy.    That being said, this item is AWESOME! I keep my goatee pretty short, and my first time using this i knocked it down realllll close (more so than my liking). Was my fault, I put guard on 4, tried and was too long, put on 2 and well... was too short.    Anyway, I love the vacuum aspect. I had no mess from when I did trim it. I also had no mess when I used on my back.    Def worth getting!</li>
            <li> Good power and cut. Made for longer hair though, not for beards you want a closer cut with. Had to buy another electric for a closer trim.</li>
            <li> It is good but as not par with what it promised. To suck the hair completely one has to hold it straight, which is impossible while you trim.It trims well and accurately. Even shortest trim level doesn&#x27;t allow me to short my beard as I wished, but I could manage it by removing the comb on top of the blade. Rest are good..... easy to use, but will take some time to clean the blade and vaccum chamber after the trim. Overall it looks good and it charges from empty to full in an hour.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for my husband because it&#x27;s so annoying to see all the little hairs on the sink after he trims his mustache, sideburns, etc.  This unit has a handy little vacuum inside of it that gets almost all of the stray hairs.  For me, that&#x27;s a 5 star feature.  My husband&#x27;s only complaint is that it&#x27;s a little bulky because of this feature and that when he wants to trim around his mustache or ears he can&#x27;t just pull off the plastic guard like he could with his old Panasonic so the blades are exposed, but has to replace the guard with a smaller head that has exposed blades that made for this purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviewers have complained about the noise but to me it seems about average as far as sound goes.  It doesn&#x27;t wake me up if the bathroom door is open to the bedroom and I&#x27;m still asleep.  Whatever extra noise is probably due to the vacuum feature.  So we&#x27;d say that while it&#x27;s not perfect, it&#x27;s a pretty good trimmer.</li>
            <li> This unit has performed as advertised. Very little hair to clean up (might be poor technique on my part); keeps its charge, very efficient.</li>
            <li> After going through at least a dozen trimmers over the past 4-5 years I came across this one and had to try it due to the price...I had previously broken all the others I had tried due to cheap parts rusting or just breaking... After using this product for about a month I have zero complaints and have been very impressed with the it so far. Very little hair to clean up due to the vacuum feature which is a big issue for me. I also had issues with the other trimmers pulling hair out without trimming it but with this one there are no problems...I love it!!!</li>
            <li> Received the T980 for Christmas and have been using it for 2 months now.     As for trimming... outstanding. Gives excellent repeatable results. I have had no problems with the length changing as some reviewers reported. Mine has stayed on the 3 setting that I chose for everytime without fail.     As for the vacuum part... it is a marked improvement over the old method of covering the sink with a towel or just wiping all the stubble off after trimming. I would say that the vacuum catches about 85% to 90% of the hairs. But it is not 100% mess free as the package and the manufacturer suggest. So I can&#x27;t go 5 stars, because it isn&#x27;t 100%... but a noticable improvement.     Overall, very pleased with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> This Norelco shaver works well if there is not much hair to remove; however, if one is shaving a substantial amount of hair, it takes several passes to clean it up.  The battery seems to hold a charge fairly well, and it has decent vacuuming power considering its size.</li>
            <li> This beard trimmer works very well, and the included narrow trimmer is very good for trimming mustaches.  However, the trimmer seams to be somewhat cheaply made.  I don&#x27;t think it will last as long as my last trimmer, which was a Norelco T7500 that I had for at least ten years.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why my husband has so much trouble trimming and maintaining his facial hair! He has had it for 30 years. I bought him this trimmer and out of the bathroom he came, all smiles. His beard looked great!! I know its the trimmer because he has owned at least 10 different ones with terrible outcomes. Its easy for him to use and to keep clean. The result is always neat and professional looking. I will never buy a different trimmer!!!</li>
            <li> The trimmer combines the features of multi-functional and simplicity in impressive fashion.  It provides a wide variety of settings, its handling is pleasant and easy to adjust, and recharging is a breeze.</li>
            <li> I searched quite a bit for a great facial hair trimmer and I have not been let down with my purchase of this one.  The vacuum works great...it doesn&#x27;t get every little hair, but there&#x27;s hardly any clean up.  Some reviews said that this would not work in Europe, but mine works fine.  Of course you have to have an adapter but the razor itself is 220/110 so it does the converting of the power...so I don&#x27;t need a transformer/converter, just a plug adapter.  Makes it still very convenient to travel with too!  Lastly, battery life is very impressive.  It holds a charge for a long time inbetween trims (I maybe trim 2x a week and only charge it every 3rd week or so).  All in all, I am very pleased with this purchase and would definitely recommend it to someone else too!</li>
            <li> This trimmer does exactly what it is supposed to do, and does it very nicely. The turbo function though a bit noisy, but very handy. The vacuum function sucks most of the hairs, so there is less mess around when I am done trimming. Though its not perfect, and for sure hairs do fell off but again way less messy than other trimmers. Battery time is good, easier to handle, its a little but, just a little bit on the heavier side. One thing that I might complain about is the ability to cut the longer hair, lets just say its not perfect for that. But I think its a very good purchase for the money, and after I&#x27;ve used it now, I would buy it again. Thumbs up from me !!</li>
            <li> Closest setting is really short, like a stubble slightly longer than average 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. Like a second day length for me. Still drops a few trimmings on regular mode but not much. So far its perfect for keeping an even tamed beast on my mug.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the T980 for a year and a half and it still works great.  I&#x27;ve tried several trimmers and a couple that claimed a vacuum ablility, most failed miserably. Most others also felt like junk compared to the T980&#x27;s construction.  The T980&#x27;s vacuum actually DOES work very well...with a couple of caveats.  You must switch it to turbo mode to be effective, and if you&#x27;re trimming more than a light amount of hair you need to dump out the cut hair once or twice (which is easy to do with the way it is made) for the vacuum to still work effectively.  Great quality product and the storage pouch is such a nice simple touch but so very handy.  UPDATE 2/2012: 3 years of use and still works well. Battery quit holding a charge a month ago, but that was not unexpected. One reason I bought this model was that it will work corded even after the battery quits holding a charge.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is pretty good. It has an option to trim more close than other trimmers I have tried. And the vacuum works fine, keep things tidy.  I trim once every week and it has been more than a month since I last charged my battery, so it seems to have a good battery life. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> I was using an older Norelco model of this device and was happy with it except that now it was so old that it was acting up. This one works just as well and maybe better in some respects. For example, they have upgraded the vacuum and container so now even less hair falls out on the sink. I&#x27;m not sure what to do with the turbo though, don&#x27;t see much use for it in my case. My box did not come with a cleaning brush which was a surprise and the packing is just incredibly hard to open up.</li>
            <li> Fast to Cook Good to Eat, this is not a edible product &amp; what I ment to say is that it quick to use when you are in hurry and nobody notices any difference between rgular blade and the close shave this product provides. I had just bought this one &amp; my son going to collage used it once before I could, now I have to buy another for myself.</li>
            <li> I like it.  It cuts well.  The little vacuum works for the most part.  It does leave some hairs in the sink still, but just a bit and little enough to wash down the sink.    The clean-out and length of cut adjustment are easy enough to use.  The unit seems sturdy and it has plenty of battery life for me.    The head is large enough that it does get cumbersome up under the nose.  It&#x27;s not ineffective, but just a little harder to get the hairs close to the nose.</li>
            <li> I did the same thing you are doing right now. I researched a number of competing trimmers and read all of the comments. I finally decided upon this one and am now just utterly confused with what must be wrong with those who didn&#x27;t give the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo a good review.     -the vacuum works great, not a hair on the floor yet  -not once have i experienced the standard \\&quot;ouch\\&quot; moment when shavers catch  -The charge lasts for a looong time and recharge is really quick  -the length setting is solid and doesn&#x27;t slip    I have a sneaky suspicion that many of the bad reviews are from people who complain about anything when given the opportunity. Relax, just buy the thing. It trims, and does a great job.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband and he loves it! He says it works great and it is better than all the other trimmers he owned in the past. Also the sink is hair free now!</li>
            <li> Have been using this for the last 4 months. easy clean up because of the vaccum action. charges holds for decent amount of time. very satisfied with the trimmer</li>
            <li> This product is terrible. The settings slip, especially between 3 and 2. The vacuum feature ensures that you can not use this for anything other than basic beard and moustache trim. I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> This shaver is amazing. I&#x27;ve used quite a few shavers, and this one has been the best so far. The Turbo setting is *kind* of loud, but honestly, a shaver is loud regardless.    The vacuum is great as well. My fiancé used to whine about the hair on the sink after I shaved, so I looked for a better one, and saw this. It was even cheaper on Amazon than in Walmart.      I highly recommend this shaver. If you&#x27;re thinking of getting a new one, you might as well go all out and get the good one that is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve tried quite a few, and this one is pretty decent.    i don&#x27;t get the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; because why would you ever want less power?  so i just put it on turbo all the time.  that being said, some older trimmers (that have more metal) have more power than this one.     the adjustable head works well, then you can take it off for close shave. it could be closer... not the quality of a barber&#x27;s tool with a really clean, sharp cut.    the vacuum feature is pretty gimmicky. yes, it does capture quite a bit of hair when you&#x27;re trimming a longer beard (making clean up a bit easier), but this does not mean that hair does not fall. it does and you still need to clean your sink afterward.    that being said, this is still my daily beard trimmer and i don&#x27;t see a need to change yet, but i would if i found a better one.</li>
            <li> The trimmer is great.  I have gone thru several and none compare to this one.  Easy to adjust.  Does a great job</li>
            <li> [[ASIN:B002LORQ14 Philips Norelco Turbo Vacuum Trimmer Model T980 1 ea]]    I love it. Tried to buy one for my son and can&#x27;t find one anywhere.</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my husband not even a year ago and it worked great.  We saved a lot of money on his weekly haircuts by using this.  Only problem is it died on us yesterday.  No given reason.  Never dropped. Never wet. Nothing ever done to compromise the trimmer.  It just stopped working.  I will say, I placed an order for a new one the QT4070.  I hope this one lasts longer...This time, I will keep the box ad the receipts.  One suggestion: be sure to save the box and receipts so you can get it fixed or replaced with whatever warranty they offer.</li>
            <li> These trimmers have come along way since I bought my first one. The turbo feature really sucks in the hair.</li>
            <li> This product has done all that a beard trimmer should do. Good battery, sharp cutter. I would recommend to a friend</li>
            <li> If you have fine short bear the vacuum maybe does something but with my beard it is completely useless buy the one without the vacuum.</li>
            <li> vac isn&#x27;t strong and clogs up easy other wise it is a good product.  It hold charge pretty good too.</li>
            <li> This is great.  Yes, I can get a closer shave with a razor, but I can also get irritated skin, ingrown hairs, etc.  This thing gets rid of the hair without any of the irritation.  If you work in an industry where you don&#x27;t have to be clean shaven every day, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this. (and the vacuum feature rocks cleanup)</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad trimmer, but it&#x27;s not what I was hoping for when I bought it.  I suppose my biggest complaint is how messy it is.  I was really looking forward to the vacuum feature but doesn&#x27;t work particularly well for me.  Sure, it collects some hair, but plenty more ends up on the sink and the floor.   I was hoping to make trimming a no-cleanup operation.  Alas.    Beyond that, seems to work as advertised.  I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it yet, but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much advantage to it vs my old, clumsy trimmer.</li>
            <li> Pretty good so far. Only issue is a lack of different size attachments for beard length and cannot easily trim mustache directly under the  nose. Otherwise, I&#x27;ve got no complaints</li>
            <li> If we&#x27;re completely honest, we&#x27;ve been conditioned by manufacturers these days to accept rubbish without complaint.  Quite true, you can dial into their computer and navigate circles around their voicemail system for a few hours until your anger dissipates.  Or is transferred to computer answering systems.  Whichever comes first.     Happily, however, such is not the case with the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer.      Not only does this eager little trimmer solve several problems at once but it does so with a composure and aplomb that will sweep away the corporate fog and, suddenly, everything else you own will seem completely and utterly inadequate.    Trimming whiskers used to be such a chore that the ZZ Top look began to show some sense, if not appeal.  The constant recharging, sweeping up afterward, seemingly endless search for single-tasking components that had wandered off and an assembly/disassembly process for cleaning the tool that would make Bill Gates weep.  Philips, however, decided to go in a slightly different direction.    For a start, the battery holds on to a charge with a grip that would make Chuck Liddell cry. It doesn&#x27;t last mere hours, days or weeks.  Under standard use, mine lasts well over a month.  Even when the battery light does begin to blink, what it really means to say is, \\&quot;Pardon me but, at some point in the next several days, when it isn&#x27;t too much of a bother, could you please plug me in for a bit?\\&quot;  Nothing urgent about it whatsoever.  And once the lead is connected from socket to trimmer, a scant hour will have it fully refreshed and ready for another month on the road.    Then there is the all-in-one design.  Unlike most trimmers, which require that you dig around to find the correct attachment in order to trim your left eyebrow now that you&#x27;re done with the right, nearly everything is built directly into this sleek little unit.  The only exception is a neat little detail trimmer that stands eternally at the ready in itsown clear and obvious pocket inside the travel pouch.  That&#x27;s it.  Nothing else to search out when you&#x27;re dashing to work.  It&#x27;s all right there.    Not everyone who sells a \\&quot;vacuum trimmer\\&quot; truly means it.  Most generate just a bit of wind, sufficient to scatter your whiskers over the widest possible surface.  I firmly believe my last vacuum trimmer was designed by a consortium of housekeepers seeking job security.  The T980, however, actually captures every single whisker, every single time.  And then there&#x27;s a Turbo button that doubles the already adequate force of the vacuum&#x27;s suction so that you can give yourself that wind-blown look if you so choose.    But, by far, my favorite thing about this trimmer is the way it feels.  It sits in your hand as if it were custom designed specifically for you.  It&#x27;s lightweight and nimble around the bends, falls effortlessly into its case when deeds are done and assembles as if there is an invisible force guiding your hand at every step of the way.  I am genuinely amazed at the simplicity of removing and replacing the grille guard.  For a time, I thought it must be drawn together by magnets.  But it isn&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s just a set of exceptionally well designed tabs and slots that quickly correct a hurried approach and seat the grille home with a satisfying, subtle click.      Most products on the market today are slapdash clumps of flimsy plastics and mechanics that are carefully designed to fail at the worst possible time.  And, for some reason, we have accepted this corporate abuse in the hopes that prices would compensate us somehow.  But they don&#x27;t really, do they?  When you&#x27;ve re-purchased the same device five times because it keeps breaking, whose interests are truly being served?    So, then, the T980 is a warning shot fired over the bow of companies everywhere who treat their clients like stupid, slobbering monkeys, devoid of choice or rights.  With it, Philips is saying, \\&quot;See, everyone?  You needn&#x27;t accept rubbish in exchange for your hard-earned money.  We&#x27;ve done it properly and at a price point that is competitive.\\&quot;  And why wouldn&#x27;t we honor that?    I wish my hair grew faster.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned this quite a few years now, and it&#x27;s still going on the original battery. It does a good job of collecting the trimmings, but it won&#x27;t capture 100%. It seems the shorter the hair trimmings, the better it does at capturing them. When I go long periods of time between trimming, the long hairs tend to clog up the port that feeds into the hair collector. It&#x27;s a little bulky, so getting the hairs under the nose takes just a little more effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I dropped the trimmer, and trying to catch it accidentally slammed it onto the tile countertop. Pieces went flying everywhere, and I thought I had to buy another one. After picking up the half-dozen pieces, I found that none were broken and I was able to assemble the trimmer back to normal working order.</li>
            <li> The blades on this are not very sharp, and the length adjustment collapses when in use. I would not recommend this trimmer.</li>
            <li> great machine, had the previous version and that was great this works just as well</li>
            <li> Functionally, this trimmer worked fine. Not even sure they make it any more. However, I have a problem when the design philosophy is based on designed obsolescence. When the rechargeable battery on this unit (and I owned two of them over the years) finally failed to recharge the product&#x27;s life is over. I does have a cord but won&#x27;t run off a wall outlet if the battery won&#x27;t recharge. I&#x27;ve been left with two perfectly mechanically functional beard trimmers that will no longer run because of the design. I find such design decisions reprehensible from an environmental perspective, and shady from a business perspective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has Norelco fixed this in their more recent models? Don&#x27;t know. I won&#x27;t buy the brand any more.</li>
            <li> Well-designed, Easy to use cutter height adjustments. Reliable, easy to clean. I threw away several cheap, battery-operated, trimmers before getting this, which I&#x27;ve had for quite a while.</li>
            <li> This trimmer has to be one of the best trimmers that I have ever owned.  It&#x27;s quick, easy to use, and the adjustable settings make it very versatile.  The fact that it can be used while plugged in or cordless is also a plus.  It&#x27;s definitely the trimmer to get if you&#x27;re in the market for a new one.</li>
            <li> I purchased this to replace a 3.5 year old Norelco T990 when its batteries died. I *loved* the T990 and would buy it again, but it&#x27;s no longer available. (The current T765 is a similar design to the T990.) T980 issues: The electronic power and turbo switches are touch sensitive and too easy to press while trimming. The settings window is tiny and it&#x27;s hard to read the number. The mini trimmer is an inconvenient attachment. When using the trimmer without the comb/guide, like for neck cleanup, the vacuum tube blocks your view of the cutter. These were enough to make me return the trimmer to Norelco with their 60-day return policy. There was also an issue that may be a defect in the trimmer I received. It would not hold the selected setting. While using it, it would change to a shorter setting! Yikes! I ended-up replacing the batteries in my beloved T990 for about the same price as the T765. Unless you must have the vacuum and one-hour charge time, buy the less expensive T765. [[ASIN:B0001HYL0M Philips Norelco T765 AccuTrim Beard and Moustache Trimmer]]</li>
            <li> This works very well.  I had a different brand before and this one works great.  I shave my face and head with it and it does a nice job.  However, it only works well in Turbo mode and it feels like it will fly apart at any minute in Turbo mode.</li>
            <li> This trimmer, overall, works very well and is a great buy for the money.  The vacuum picks up about 75-80% of all the hair that falls but WILL not pick up everything.  The blade works great and the trimmer piece is very sharp which helps for precise cutting.  The plastic trimmer guide which guides the blade thickness is not that great but it is a small problem that doesnt really diminish the overall usefullness of the product.</li>
            <li> It trims well and the vacuum really works. I have a heavy beard and have to empty the collection chamber often but yes the vacuum really works. It is functional and handy and trims well. I would give it 5 stars but I don&#x27;t like changing the head for moustache trimming. Those that complain about the battery life probably didn&#x27;t charge it fully and use it until the charge was depleted before re-charging. All and all another good Norelco.</li>
            <li> I like this trimmer.  The turbo vacuum catches most of the hair, though not all, especially when switching from the accessory heads.  I can now trim my beard at the sink with a fraction of the cleanup that was required with my old trimmer that didn&#x27;t have a vacuum.  I really like the \\&quot;specialty Mini-Beard trimmer attachment\\&quot; which allows me to easily shape my beard and moustache while still using the vacuum.  That was one of my hesitations before purchasing the trimmer, but it has exceeded my expectations.  Overall, I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase and the value I&#x27;ve recieved for the money spent.</li>
            <li> This unit does an entirely adequate job of beard trimming.  The settings match up well with those from earlier units and, once set, there is no slippage from one setting to another.  In my estimation, the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; feature adds no functionality, only noise and increased battery drain.  The new vacuum feature allows for the capture of only about 60-70% of the hair trimmed.  A potential positive is not having to oil the blades, but only if this does not shorten product life.   And as with the last trimmer I owned, the NiCad battery is not replaceable, but it should be.  The battery is the size of a standard AA but it is soldered in place.  Directions are given as to how to remove the battery prior to disposal, but Norelco could have gone the final step and made the battery replaceable.  My old trimmer worked fine; only the battery needed replacing.  But then again, I would guess that product longevity does not rise high on the list of marketing features.</li>
            <li> I had some hesitation as to whether or not to buy this from reading some of the reviews.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  The vacuum picks up 95% + of the hair it cuts.  You do need to take some care in locking in the length setting.  You can not use it by holding the length setting dial or by the trimmer attachments.  Many people complained that these either shifted or fell off.  I have not had a problem yet.  If you use some caution in how you hold it, it works great.  It takes only about 3 - 5 minutes to trim my entire beard &amp; moustache.  I would recommend this product.</li>
            <li> 20 years of beard trimming and this unit is the best trimmer used.  The trimmings are quick and clean.  A built-in vacuum sucks 95% of the wiskers into a small cup that is easily emptied. This also creates a noticeable breeze on the face.  Negatives are the lightweight construction where it would probably explode if dropped from counter?</li>
            <li> When I retired, I decided to grow a beard.  I read the Amazon reviews and bought a T980.  It is used twice a week to trim a short beard with the length adjustment set on three (my old eyes find the number a little hard to read without glasses).  Length adjustment never changes.  Turbo mode is never used.  I seldom see even a stray hair on my towel or sink.  Recharging has been done six times and unplugged when full charge is reached.    I bought in spite of some bad reviews.  Now, the criticisms baffle me.  The purchase was made with confidence, because it came with a 90 day return guarantee.  I haven&#x27;t a clue about reviewers who abandoned or threw away the trimmer when it didn&#x27;t work for them.  It will be more economical than a 5 blade razor if it only lasts about year.    It fits my hand well and is easy to use for thorough trimming.  I like it!</li>
            <li> For the price this beard trimmer works extremely well. It took a little getting used to because of the floating cutting head but once I started using it properly it does a great job of trimming quickly and evenly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone thorugh many beard trimmers and electric shavers, this one is TOPS!  I love the vacuum, it even gives a bit of a coolin effect.  There is little to no mess and the bettery life is amazing, love the travel ouch and small wal charger.  Best gift ever!</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t liked is that the hair container is SUPER fragile. The rest is great.</li>
            <li> This trimmer works great.  It takes me much less time to trim my beard and cuts much better than any other trimmer I have tried.  The only negative is the location of the blades when the guide is attached.  It makes it a little akward to do a mustache so I have to change the blade to get it done.  All in all it is great.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer because of it&#x27;s built in guard and vacuum capabilities.  I&#x27;ve been using it about once a week for the past 4-5 months and have been extremely satisfied so far.  It does not catch or pull while trimming and I&#x27;ve had no difficulties with the guard slipping to a lower setting as others have reported.&lt;br /&gt;The vacuum works great catching most of the trimmings.  It does leave a few trimmings on the sink but those are few enough to simply rinse down the drain with no worries.</li>
            <li> Excellent razor and beard trimming device...however this little bad boy has a tendency to change its clipper size mid-trim with a gentle nudge against the face. I had to duct tape mine to make sure that this doesn&#x27;t constantly happen. Since then, I have been very satisfied with this product.</li>
            <li> Update:I&#x27;ve now owned this trimmer for 6 years. It still runs amazingly well with no maintenance! The battery life is still great even with the age and thousands of uses. When this one dies, I&#x27;m buying another.           I don&#x27;t understand how you can not see what you are shaving due to the blue guard.  I have zero trouble.  I don&#x27;t understand how you can reset your level by pressing it agains your skin.  During my test, I applied 12 pounds of pressure without ever resetting or reverting to a lower level thusly chewing up my facial hair.    If it is too loud, you are too picky.  This is a fine trimmer with no serious draw backs. Some people are just too eager to complain and be negative.    Don&#x27;t bother with the negative feeback. Buy this product. It will serve you very well...unless you are a finicky turd.</li>
            <li> This is just a great product!!! The only downside i see with this trimmer is if you have a really thick mustache that goes all the way up to your nose, it may be difficult to get just under your nose....that being said, i really don&#x27;t have the \\&quot;Tom Selleck\\&quot; stache, so It works fine for me....It still misses some of the cut hairs, but it does catch nearly all of them. It&#x27;s a bit loud, but so are most trimmers....It came completely dead with no power at all, after like 20 minutes it ran at full power for about 30 min and didn&#x27;t even start to slow down!  all in all, i give it a B+</li>
            <li> This product is excellent. I have been using this since a long time. The vaccum feature sucks all the cut hair and is easy to wash, charge and carry in the provided pouch.</li>
            <li> I bought the Philips Norelco T908 Turbo based on other customer reviews. I wish I hadn&#x27;t. The thing is a piece of junk. The swivel adjuster for setting beard length moved when I was using it and suddenly I was cutting off more than I wanted. Also, the plastic catcher broke after about a month. Avoid this like the plague!</li>
            <li> ni-cad batteries - so last decade.  not replacable - in LESS than 3-5 yrs this is just trash.  other than that.   a very good shaver</li>
            <li> A bit large but that&#x27;s a minor thing.  I&#x27;m getting used to it already.  Works VERY well.  The vacuum and the turbo speed is nice.</li>
            <li> This is a good trimmer.  I like the vacuum suction.  Also, you can make  adjustments to trim level without taking off the clipper guard/guide.  Very convenient product.    Also, product arrived quickly, within a few days.</li>
            <li> My old trimmer died. I saw this trimmer with the vacuum and said this will be great! No more trimmings on the sink for my wife to spot. I charged the trimmer and gave it a good run for the money. It worked great! The vacuum is a true blessing. No more mess or little pieces of hair stuck behind the faucet or elsewhere. I love it and my wife loves me for not messing up the bathroom any more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for about 2 weeks now and have used it about 6 times.  This is the first trimmer I have used.  It provides a very clean trim, and the vacuum feature makes this product worthwhile over others (from what I can assume).  The benefit of having one-size cuts all is very nice, but a trimmer with interchangeable trimming lengths would probably be more sufficient.  The rotating zoom on this sometimes moves slightly out of place which changes the length of the trim slightly (my neurosis brings this to my attention since I prefer everything to be precise).  I typically charge it while I am in the shower and then remove the charger to trim (it holds charge very well). Having a wireless trimmer makes it easier to maneuver.  Shaving while plugged in often makes it slightly more difficult to use.  Overall, this is a great product, granted I&#x27;ve only used it a limited number of times.  My suggestion, if you&#x27;re neurotic about trim length, is to look around and find a trimmer with trimming attachments for varying lengths because of the occasional twist of the zoom feature that changes the trimming length.</li>
            <li> This thing is super powerful.    The first time I used it I had turn on the power thinking it was in Tubro mode and accidentally hit the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; button this and was like what the heck.    The shave is much more enjoyable on this.   I&#x27;m glad I spent the little extra.    This puppy is good.  The vacuum catches about 80% of the hair which is really nice.    And, unlike most trimmers in this price range don&#x27;t allow you to use the cord when the battery gets low. That is a very good thing.    I would spend the extra $20 for this trimmer any day.</li>
            <li> Very good shaver.  This is about my 4th electric shaver.  I have a short beard and this is by far the best shaver I have had.  I like the fact that as I cut my beard the shaver vacuums the cut hair so there is not big clean up at the end of the trim.  I hope the battery holds out longer than my others.</li>
            <li> Now that I bought and used the T980, my cool slacker goatee is attracting too many women. I&#x27;m not getting any rest.    Naturally, a product that causes grief should be down-rated, but I won&#x27;t here because this shaver is just doing its job.    And, we all like things with \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; in the description, however loosely that term is applied. It makes it go faster with a cool noise, so even in a shaver that is attractive to many.    Electric shavers for beards sure beat the heck out of scissors! The Norelco has a wide range of cutting depths and my beard comes out a uniform length. I did not feel any pulling or other discomfort. The charge seems to last for days and the charger itself, like the shaver, is a decent and modern design.    The little detail cutter is easy to attach and does a great job of defining the beard area and also clipping any stray hairs under the nose where the big cutter head cannot reach.    Some people think the closest cutting position is still not close enough for that short-stubble look and that does seem to be the case. I don&#x27;t want mine that close, but I understand those who do and I take off a star for brotherly solidarity. Actually, I&#x27;m sure that if it was to cut more closely, that would take it into the realm of regular shavers, an expensive world of high-tech blades and lubricants. Actually, if you press down a little, you can get closer.    The turbo thing works well. It vacuums almost every hair into the storage chamber. I didn&#x27;t expect the vacuum action to work so well. I think the turbo button should be the only button, but there it is. The non-turbo setting is less noisy...    The parts detach easily and the little supplied brush works well to clean it out. The little travel pouch is nice.    The T980 works just as it should, for me, and the price is reasonable. I think it will last a long time and I am glad I bought it.     As for the women, I did exaggerate. One did make a favorable comment which is one more than before.  That is animprovement, eh?</li>
            <li> The vacuum works better on this one than my older Norelco. I&#x27;m not sure why I need to press 2 buttons to get the good vacuum speed. Fast and easy to use. When putting the comb back on the trimmer, make sure it responds to the height adjustment ring. It&#x27;s all too easy to put the comb on wrong which is typical of the Norelco beard trimmers.</li>
            <li> I purchased this trimmer to deal with the upkeep of a newly grown beard.  A feature that I like is that you adjust the cutting length with the turn of a dial, not by changing heads.  As advised in the operating manual, I started with a longer length and worked my way down to a setting that fit what I wanted by simply turning a dial.  This trimmer also comes with a separate head to trim sideburns or a mustache--straight cut trimmer.  The head is easy to change and works well. The vacuum feature of this model works!  Almost all the trimmings get sucked into a small chamber that is viewable and easy to clean.  The vacuum collection certainly helps keep the sink area clean.  One last comment-- the rechargeable system works well--- battery holds charge and recharges quickly.  I am very satisfied with this trimmer.</li>
            <li> My DH loves his trimmer. He uses it more often than the one he had previously. He would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer in 2009 and have been using it every week since. It is easy to handle and provide a comfortable clean cut. However it is very hard to clean. The trap&#x27;s hinges broke twice already. This is rechargeable trimmer with a long lasting battery (~8 beard trims) but it is not really a travel trimmer. It charges only on 110v and the on/off switch place atop tends to turn the trimmer on in its traveling bag. I ended up growing a thick holiday beard on few occasion! As for the turbo, I never figured it&#x27;s use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, it is a good value home trimmer to handle delicately.</li>
            <li> Everything is Awesome!!!</li>
            <li> started falling apart after a year.</li>
            <li> Battery no longer holds and charge.....</li>
            <li> it works excellent has a pretty strong charge you won&#x27;t be disappointed. It adjusts easy and is quiet.  lightweight as well</li>
            <li> I purchased the Philips Norelco T980 Turbo Vacuum Trimmer a year and a half ago, so I now have some experience using it.  Previously, I&#x27;ve owned two Panasonic trimmers/clippers.  Both worked well for a number of years, but eventually suffered from the same problem; the battery lost the ability to hold a charge.  When this happened to the first trimmer, I had the battery replaced locally; the replacement battery did not hold a charge as well.  When the second failed similarly, I purchased the Norelco.  It was a tough decision to purchase the Norelco instead of another Panasonic.  However, the Panasonic models readily available differed from those I had used previously and the Norelco had good reviews and a nice price.  I was also a fan of the understated styling and Japanese build of the Panasonic units, so this Norelco was a bit of a departure.  I don&#x27;t recall the exact model number for the Panasonic, but something similar to the ER389K or ER205.  Overall it&#x27;s served me well for the past year and a half.  So, time to share my thoughts. The Norelco is built in China; I haven&#x27;t noticed any quality problems as of yet.  Positives:  ---------  Vacuum is a great improvement.  It&#x27;s much less messy to use this trimmer than those I used in the past.  Power is sufficient, even without the boost.  Battery (still pretty new) holds a charge for a long period of time and recharges relatively quickly.  Comb stays in position (one of the older Panasonic could switch to a lower position under pressure).  Negatives:  ---------  It&#x27;s loud.  Bothersome enough for me that I put insert earplugs before using.  The circumference is large; it&#x27;s a pretty large clipper.  I&#x27;d prefer something more narrow.  Difficult to replace to guard if you remove it.  Brush falls out of small compartment in case (will be easy to loose it someday).  Possible for pressure to turn on clipper when in soft case; it&#x27;s happened to me.  Gaudy looks.  Why does it need shinny highlights?</li>
            <li> These are okay but the plastics are prone to failure in small details that are required of a complicated device. Frustrating. Contour feature of beard comb no longer contours and door to hold hair opens at will. Expect 1-2 year life span max.</li>
            <li> Very powerful and versatile shaver. See below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Ergonomically-shaped housing.&lt;br /&gt;- Low battery warning light is very useful.&lt;br /&gt;- Charges quickly. Pilot light indicates when fully charge.&lt;br /&gt;- Cutting head can be raised or lowered to suit closeness of shave.&lt;br /&gt;- Interchangeable shave head for close work.&lt;br /&gt;- Whisker catch compartment is easily cleaned with enclosed brush.&lt;br /&gt;- Vacuum system draws in cuttings to minimize clean-up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None:</li>
            <li> Love the vacuum feature - keeps mess to a minimum.  Have been using this trimmer for 3 years, still going strong!</li>
            <li> The vacuum feature would be great if it got all the hairs, but it only gets some of them, so kind of pointless.  You&#x27;re still going to have them on you and the sink either way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blade leaves my beard hairs so sharp that if I stroke my beard they penetrate my skin like splinters and I have to dig them out of my fingers with tweezers agh!  Is this the same as all other trimmers or are these blades especially bad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic part of the cutter broke and was $27 with shipping to replace.  Now the plastic of the comb part broke and I&#x27;m not going to bother replacing it.  These problems have occurred over a 5 year span though, so that&#x27;s pretty typical for plastic American crap?</li>
            <li> Decent settings, decent battery life, turbo button is required - and not an option but the reason I gave it two stars is because it simply cannot do the mustache area because the prongs hit my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found I have to remove the prongs and then very cautiously trim my mustache. For the beard it works as it should.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone through several other beard trimmers, and was very excited about the features this one provides: adjustability, turbo vacuum, EASY-adjust, ability to use corded OR cordless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, in practice, I&#x27;ve been very frustrated by this one. Adjustability was fine. The easy-adjust ring was nice. It functioned great plugged in or not. The problems I encountered were:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 The swing-out door to empty the clippings broke. It&#x27;s cheap, and has barely any material supporting it. It&#x27;s not like you can just tape it closed, because you need to be able to open it.&lt;br /&gt;2)The spring-loaded trimmings hatch stuck open, and lost its spring. So, even holding the clippings-door closed, trying to \\&quot;make-do\\&quot; and not have to discard this so soon, is very frustrating because the trimmings don&#x27;t get captured - they stay at the top and spillover the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;3)The turbo has no extra sucking effect. It&#x27;s useless.&lt;br /&gt;4)The turbo is too easily turned on by accident.&lt;br /&gt;5)The turbo is LOUD.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday, the only things I can say on the nagative side is that it&#x27;s just a little bulky</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had this a long time, at least a year, and it works well trimming my goatee.  The trimmer is adjustable for different lengths of  goatee.  It&#x27;s a snap to keep my goatee looking good.</li>
            <li> I bought my first Philips Norelco  trimmer in 1993 and it worked very well. Since then I have bought three more Norelco trimmers and they have all broken after a fairly short time and under quite light use. I&#x27;m looking for a better trimmer.</li>
            <li> Best trimmer I have ever used on my beard.  Vacuum actually works to get 90% of the hair into the chamber instead of on the counter/sink.</li>
            <li> The vaccuum is the reason for purchasing this model. I&#x27;d say it is more than moderately effective. Makes the sink clean up MUCH easier and keeps the wife happy.</li>
            <li> My first impression at taking my $44 trimmer out the box, was \\&quot;Gee, this feels cheap.\\&quot; But I was impressed by the vacuum (which does collect a good 80% of the hair) and thought I&#x27;d try it out for the 60 day money-back time period. That time has come to an end and I&#x27;ve decided the nifty vac is just not enough. The huge trimmer head makes it impossible to cut evenly under the nose. Also, the \\&quot;Flexing Contour Guide\\&quot; requires one to push the shaver fairly hard against the face for an even shave. This wouldn&#x27;t be a problem were it not for the \\&quot;Lockable\\&quot; length settings which it turns out is not very lockable. It&#x27;s alot of fun when you realize that what you thought was length 3 has suddenly become a length 1 shave. The battery only lasts for about three shaves (maybe less considering how many times you have to go over the same patches to get everything even). And last, but not least, my original impression of this being an overpriced piece of cheap plastic does count. I&#x27;ll be shaving my beard for a very long time to come, and something tells me this shaver ain&#x27;t gonna make it.</li>
            <li> I also wonder if some of the negative reviews are for this particular model (Philips Norelco T980 for $39.99 @ Amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Does not feel cheap at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Settings click into place.  They will change if you push it to the point where you think you would break it if you pushed any harder.  I dont see why anyone would need to push it that hard. I had to test it after reading some of the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Turbo does not seem too loud at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Vacuum works very well.</li>
            <li> I tried this after reading terrible reviews of the earlier vacuum models. I&#x27;m overall pleased with it. One needs the turbo to actually prevent the hair from not being caught. It&#x27;s a bit loud, but it is a vacuum! Negative is when when removes the trim gaurd to use the edge trimmer, it is hard to see beyond the lip to see where the blades are cutting. &lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this product.</li>
            <li> After a lot of comparison shopping and using various products over the last ten years, I finally decided to purchase the Norelco T980.  I am delighted with my purchase and it exceeded my expectations in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is light, easy to operate, rechargeable and has precision blades that cut evenly.  The extra attachment for fine detail works well and I don&#x27;t get cut using it.  The vacuum attachment works well even when it&#x27;s not on Turbo and I personally think it&#x27;s very quiet.  It&#x27;s unrealistic to think a mechanical device in this price range won&#x27;t make any noise at all.  If that&#x27;s your expectation, you might want to use scissors.  However, this product gets the job done much quicker and the sound is not annoying and unlikely to wake up someone else on the normal setting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flexible blade housing pivots smoothly and covered the contours of my face very well with an even cut at several different lengths.  While it&#x27;s difficult to get close to the nose because of the larger size of this unit, I don&#x27;t see that as a big deal because with the smaller precision tool you can do this quite easily with a mustache comb if you are not much for completely manual operations.  This little bit of extra work probably took me under 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the design of this unit is well thought out and it is quite attractive.  The holding space for clippings is pretty big and unless you have a thick beard, you probably won&#x27;t have to change it until after several uses.  The battery also lasts about 30 minutes on Turbo and you can use the plug-in adapter after that if it runs out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see any drawbacks at all with this product.  I&#x27;m completely delighted with my purchase and the value that I received for my investment.</li>
            <li> I have used Norelco beard trimmers for at least the past 10 years. I have always been happy in the past and the T980 is no exception to that. Enhancements that my old Norelco didn&#x27;t have include the turbo vacuum, which works well at containing the mess and the separate moustache trimmer, which worked well. Also, despite what many have written, I did not find the turbo vacuum to be excessively loud and the zoom length definitely *locked* into place at #3.  All-in-all, another winner from Norelco!</li>
            <li> This is a nice beard trimmer. However, it appears that the trimmer I received has a defective rechargable battery.</li>
            <li> This is an awsome trimmer at a great price. I love that it has a vacuum suction for the trimmed hair and it does a good job of capturing most of the hair. you can also use it while it is plugged in, which you could not do with the older model trimmers.</li>
            <li> A beard trimmer with a built-in vacuum to keep the trimmings from collecting all over your sink is a good thing.  So when I decided it was time to replace my Wahl Vacu-Trim, which needed new blades and battery, I was sorry to see that Wahl apparently no longer makes that model.  It seems that the only vacuum beard trimmers available at this writing are the two models from Philips Norelco.  Seeing a good price here at amazon, I sprang for the Turbo model, which promised a little extra oomph.  Well, the trimmer works very well.  Better than the Wahl, I think.  To my surprise, I like the look it gives me at the closest setting -- if I didn&#x27;t know better, I would say it makes an old geezer like me look younger.  I haven&#x27;t had the problems others describe with the length comb changing settings on me.  The nicad battery life is acceptable -- I get a week of trims on my full beard and moustache at the Turbo setting.  When you see the red light come on after turning the unit off -- figure you have one more trim at Turbo speed.  Then it&#x27;s time to recharge.  The unit is a little large, but not unwieldy.  I will be interested to see how well the blades hold up to the \\&quot;ever-sharp\\&quot; claim.  No lubrication needed either!  I am deducting one star because of failings in the instructions and packaging.  The instructions never tell you which side of the trimmer to hold against your face, and the T980 works the opposite of most other trimmers and shavers.  Most others have you hold the side with the buttons and logo against your face; when you use the length comb on the T980, however,you hold it with the buttons and logo on the side facing AWAY from your face.  I wonder how many of my fellow reviewers have been using this trimmer correctly, given this unconventional orientation.  Nowhere in the instructions do they show a clear photo of a guy using the trimmer.  There are two tiny, hard-to-follow line illustrations.  Adding insult to injury, the first time I called Norelco for help, the woman rep on the phone -- adding helpfully that she had never used a beard trimmer herself -- gave me the wrong answer.  Further experimentation -- and another call to a male rep -- confirmed that I was using the trimmer correctly.  The other problem with the packaging is the dreadful plastic blister pack holding the trimmer and accessories inside the box.  Any package requiring scissors to open needs to be redesigned with more eco- and user-friendly materials!!!  At any rate, the T980 is the current state-of-the-art in vacuum beard trimmers, and I recommend it, the packaging notwithstanding.e woman rep on the phone -- adding helpfully that she had never used a beard trimmer herself -- gave me the wrong answer.

            <li> People compalin about everything.  This product is awesome. I had a Remington vacuum shave that worked fine but I decided to get this because it looked better.  Well it looks good and outperforms my other one by battery power and performance. The blades never need to be oiled, the see through hair chamber is awesome, and the powerful hair vacuum are all you need. Not to mention it trims like a champ. This gets twice as close as any trimmer I have owned. You will love it. Quit being cheap and buy it or stay looking like an ape without a date.</li>
            <li> There have been a lot of complaints about the vacuum option of this trimmer.  Let&#x27;s be realistic....its not a Hoover, it&#x27;s a trimmer.  It catches MOST of the hairs, which is a lot better than NONE of the hairs.  I&#x27;ve used it a few times so far and haven&#x27;t had the problem others complained about where the setting is changed mid-trim.  Just hold the thing below the dial, and not right on the dial.  It gave a nice even trim all around.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of months, used it 3-4 times, and still haven&#x27;t had to recharge it.    Suggested improvement - A stand would have been great so I could put it in my medicine cabinet and not have it roll around my counter.    Tips for using - I found you&#x27;re better off with dry hair.  When the hair&#x27;s wet, it&#x27;s harder for the vacuum to pull it in.  I also found that the vacuum works much better on longer hair then on shorter hair.  Maybe the shorter hairs are too light and get blown around?  Last but not least, watch out for the settings.  The dial goes 1-9 so I started with 4, which was way too short.  I could have grown that beard from scratch in a couple of weeks.  5 also proved a little short for me.  Be sure to start a lot higher than you think you need, and work your way down if needed.</li>
            <li> The T980 is a very good trimmer.  It cuts well, has the attachment for more precise trimming, holds a good charge, has the corded/cordless feature that predecessors did not, and still has a fair price.  My only complaint is that the vacuum, even on turbo, still doesn&#x27;t catch all of the trimmings.  Previous norelco vacuum trimmers did not either, but I thought with the turbo that it would.  The height adjustment is great too, those that complain about it moving out of the number need to stop smashing it into their face and keep their hand away from the adjuster.</li>
            <li> I bought this trimmer for I believe it was 18 dollars on a random sale day I guess . I was looking at it for some time and when I found at at this price (with a coupon code), it was a steal.   The trimmer itself is very well made and sturdy. The pieces come apart pretty easily and clean quickly. I absolutely love the vacuum function. As long as you trim relatively slowly and carefully it will pick up about 90% of the hair its clipping. A few little ones can get by the trap, but it is extremely efficient with proper use.   If you are in a bit of a rush and trim quickly, it will of course miss a few more hairs but manages to still suck up about 70% of what its cutting.  The turbo mode is useful if you have a lot of hair you are getting rid of, but by no means a major factor.   I am very happy with the purchase and if you have a decently full beard you like to keep trim, it is a great product. I would recommend it at the MSRP, but if you can, keep your eyes out and maybe you can find it for the absurdly low price I found it for...Good luck.</li>
            <li> Lots of plusses:  It works and is attractive.  The charge is lasting longer than I expected it to, but I have only charged it once.     I did not experience the problems most frequently reported by others.  This vacuum works very well; the \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; vacuum setting is somewhat louder but does not bother me at all.  I have not experienced any of the \\&quot;down shifting\\&quot; on the trim height dial due to pressure, as reported by others.  I even tried to get it to do this, and mine would not. It has an attractive design, which doesn&#x27;t matter much to me but is an added plus that makes it more enjoyable to use. It works quite well without the comb housing to clean up the back of my neck between haircuts.    The negatives are minor, but are as follows:     My biggest peeve is that there is a little blue rectangular spring-loaded vaccum mouthpiece right in front of the blade, which sucks the hair into the vaccum.  I suppose something like this is necessary from an engineering point of view to get the vaccum to work effectively.  However, it seems that this also limits the ability of the hair to get to the blade from that direction, which limits the blade&#x27;s effectiveness.  This is somewhat frustrating, as one has to go over the same areas more than I used to with my old similar model.  Also, it makes it hard to use the trimmer with the comb  housing off to trim the hair around my ear, which I like to do between haircuts.  I can do this if I use my index fingernail to carefully hold down the blue piece.  This puts my finger quite close to the blade and makes me a little nervous that I&#x27;m going to slice through my finger.    The comb attachment has a spring-loaded base feature. It just seems like something that will break at some point and adds no real functionality.    I agree the case is a bit lame; it could be more rigid or padded, but if you travel with it, just roll it up inside an item of clothing and it will very likely survive just fine.  The case should have separate compartments inside for the charger and the trimmer, so the plug doesn&#x27;t scratch up the trimmer surface.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a couple of Norelco trimmers in the past, most recently the T780, and have never really been happy. This newer, top-of-the-line T980 is pretty much what I&#x27;ve been looking for. It&#x27;s solid, powerful and holds a charge through several trimmings. And the length setting holds! (Previous models would change settings as you were trimming because the change ring was right under your grip and moved too easily.) I think I&#x27;ll keep this one for a while.</li>
            <li> works pretty good all around.    the vacuum feature is pretty good but it doesn&#x27;t catch all the hairs.    the trimmer is much larger than i thought it would be.  its very loud !  charging is a pain,  your not supposed to leave it plugged in for longer than the rapid charge time (about 2 hrs for mine).      battery life is good and if it goes dead you can run the trimmer off of the charging cord.    this trimmer is  better than my Wahl and cost less    i recommend this trimmer</li>
            <li> I own an earlier model of this trimmer and over all am happy with it. The only issue I had with my old one and this model which I just purchased is the \\&quot;door\\&quot; in the front just under the cutting blades.    On my first one, the spring hold the door up broke allowing it to drop and lose much of the vacuum.   I was not really excited about purchasing another model with this same design but because the overall trimmer function has worked well for over four years decided to purchase a new one.  The only reason I purchased a new one is the charger broke and I had no way to recharge the battery and because it was over 4 years old figured the battery did not have much life in it.</li>
            <li> Of coarse buying a product from Amazon directly you know you&#x27;ll automatically get excellent shipping!!!!!!! This product works, and works well. What else can I say. Vacuum actually get 90% of clippings, huge plus!!! TRimmer a little large for hard to reach areas. For trimming it doesn&#x27;t get much better. I recommend a different tool for nose and small hair trimmmings. I have not found a good nose hair trimmer yet. The rotating ones are worthless and I don&#x27;t like sticking those oscillating trimmers up my nose. Still searching!</li>
            <li> this blade when used without the trimmer ,is rough crappy metal that snags and pinches your skin and pulls your hair, to the extent of blood..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve owned a few trimmers over the few years, and none had a built in vacuum. After losing the power cord to my last one, I went shopping and found this gem. The vacuum intrigued me -- would it really be worth the extra $20-25 over a standard trimmer? One word: Yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d always put off shaving my beard due to the necessity of cleaning up afterwards. I just trimmed my beard, which had grown out over the past two weeks, and amazingly, the sink below me only had a few pieces of hair in it. That is totally acceptable in my book, and with this I&#x27;ll be keeping my beard trimmed often because cleanup isn&#x27;t a hassle anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended. I can&#x27;t speak for longevity, except that the trimmer I&#x27;m replacing was a Norelco that I bought almost two years ago, and it&#x27;s still running (albeit it just died because I can&#x27;t charge it anymore).</li>
            <li> I researched all of the Norelco beard trimmers before deciding to buy on Amazon.  I read all of the reviews and noted some of the negatives like noise and the fact that the shaver doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;vaccum\\&quot; all of the whiskers.  I must say I haven&#x27;t seen much of these negatives.  The trimmer works great and beats my old Braun which did not collect whiskers.  I would say that 90% of the whiskers are collected in the compartment rather than on my bathroom counter.  The noise in my opinion is to be expected given the cutting and vacuum action being performed.  I especially like the carrying case and accessory trimmer that are included with this model.  The only negative I have noted is that the trimmer settings are not real precise.  If I want a real clean look I have to go all the way down to the lowest setting and my goatee needs trimming about every 3 days.  For the guys who are able to keep their beards a little longer this is probably not much of an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver if you are wanting a clean, neat trim.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know where some of the negative reviews were coming from.  This is my third trimmer since I started my beard about eight years ago.  The others were ok, for awhile, but eventually just could not get the job done.  This is my first Philips Norelco product.  It is simply amazing!  Never has beard trimming been so easy and the vacuum feature leaves almost no mess on the sink.  The trimmer operates at a higher speed than previous ones and it&#x27;s multitude of length settings allows for a perfect setting for me.  The only negative I can think of is that the small trimmer head and brush don&#x27;t fit neatly into the soft case.  Otherwise, the product is a winner.</li>
            <li> works very well and with a great deal less mess as the trimmer has a suction to keep the hair  from flying everywhere. It is easy to use. One minor problem one must clean the trimmer after each use and to take apart and to put back together and that is somewhat dificult at times.</li>
            <li> I purchased this electric razor when my old Phillips Norelco razor died on me. I had it for about 6 years so I figured I would stay with the company. This razor is way to bulky and does not get close enough for a good trim for your mustache or goatee. After one day of use the blue piece that gathers the hair into the vacuum broke right off. I returned this razor the next day for a refund. I would definitely not recommend this razor for facial use.</li>
            <li> well, i had the older model of this trimmer for a couple of years now and decided it&#x27;s time to get a new one.  wasn&#x27;t so impressed with the improvements though it is still the best trimmer i ever had. and i never shaved, so i know my trimmers.  so, why wasnt i impressed:  1. super vacuum. just makes super noise. i still get hair in the sink, though a little less.... not really a big difference from the old model but an amazing feature!  2. when i use it without the level adapter (length 0) to trim the neck shorter, it somehow pinches me. very odd. i am blaming that on the self sharpening feature and hoping it&#x27;ll improve in time.    a major difference in this model compared to the old one - you can use it connected to the outlet!  so when the battery dies on you in the middle of a trim, you are not left with half your face unshaven.    bottom line - killer trimmer. i like it.  get it.      update:  no more pinching. the self sharpening was the issue. works smoothly now.  the vacuum feature is still not really what i expected it to be. still have to clean up after i&#x27;m done.  a little annoying, but way better than the ones without vacuum capability</li>
            <li> I bought this for my dad for Father&#x27;s Day and he says he likes is</li>
            <li> I really like this trimmer. I have a full beard, and have been using this trimmer several times a week for the last couple of years or so. Even with that amount of use it holds a charge for a really long time. It has a &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; boost setting, but I rarely ever use it; it does a fine job on regular speed. And the vacuum feature works really well. I&#x27;ve been through several other kinds of trimmers over the years, but this one is by far the best. The only thing I&#x27;d change on it if I could is the size of the numbers that indicate the closeness setting. I&#x27;m getting older and can&#x27;t see the numbers very well, especially first thing in the morning. On a couple of occasions I&#x27;ve forgotten that I set it really low, and have already shaved off an eyebrow and one side of my mustache, and ran a bald furrow down my beard on the side of my cheek. But it cuts really good, I&#x27;ll give it that!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had a beard for decades and used a corded hair cutter with guide to \\&quot;mow\\&quot; it every now and then.  But it made a mess of the bathroom counter and sink even when I spread newspaper to catch the clippings. I bought this a few years ago so I know the build quality is solid.  The depth setting is easy and cutter head can be switched to a micro-head to do detail trim and borders.  The best thing is that is vacuums the clippings at the source.  It does not get every hair but nearly all.  Much improvement over the old way.  The charge lasts for some time so I only charge it every month or even less.  It was the best rated in Consumers Report and other reviews and I cannot disagree.  It is the best beard trimmer on the market.</li>
            <li> This item holds a charge for a very long time and the vacuum functionality works very good..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a person who has used several types of clippers in the past, both corded and cordless and I&#x27;ve gotta say this is one of the best! Originally discovered it on Amazon when I was in the market to replace my former cordless clipper and was impressed by the high rating. Now I&#x27;m singing its praises too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for over a year now and would definitely buy another if I had to... but I don&#x27;t! It&#x27;s still going strong with a powerful battery and the suction of loose hair even allows me to shave in the car when I&#x27;m pressed for time. I would say as long as you shave in the proper direction (where the blade cuts first and the suction thingy follows) the shaver will suck in at least 85% of the loose hair it cuts. Usually I have very little hair left on the sink after I shave. The fact that it&#x27;s cordless is a plus and the device gives just enough options with the adjustable guard and the precision blade. A full charge last me long enough for me to forget when was the last time I charged it and I love the fact that it&#x27;s a good size and weight for travel. A great buy at a good price!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed with this trimmer. The thing that made me buy it is the thing that makes this unusable. I speak of the vacuum. It does a good job at keeping the hair out of the sink, but its placement sets the trimmer so far back from the guard that using this trimmer on setting 2 (which is what I always used on my old Norelco T7500 to keep it nice and tight) is the equivalent of setting 7 or so (which is fairly long) on my old trimmer so I am unable to get a nice tight, trim look. Using it on a mustache is useless especially right underneath your nose. It is simply impossible to angle the trimmer in such a way as to trim the hair. I have attempted to use this trimmer twice and both times have had to result to pulling my very old T7500 out of the drawer and using it to get a decent trim.    Even setting this thing on the closest setting (#1) the trimmer still sets back waaaaay too far from the guard to be useful. If you contort you wrists and elbows you can get a fairly close trim on setting 1, but it is a giant pain to have to keep twisting and turning this trimmer around to achieve an even halfway decent trim. This thing is done. I&#x27;m shopping around for another brand.     I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for over 10 years, but they blew it with this one!</li>
            <li> This is defiantly a great buy! Even though it may be fairly loud it&#x27;s nothing compared to how well this product works. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> This is a great machine, but the vacuum is far from perfect.  It is still a messy procedure, don&#x27;t think that the vacuum will keep your bathroom clean.  It might still be worth buying this model over the one $10 cheaper, because in addition to the vacuum, this model works plugged in when the battery is drained.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased with the purchase of the T980 turbo vacuum trimmer. I had a Norelco trimmer before but this one is even better. Battery lasts a long time and you can use it plugged in to the wall if you don&#x27;t have time to charge it. I would recommend this trimmer to anyone!!</li>
            <li> So far so good after one month. Very powerful and smooth. Provides a nice trim.</li>
            <li> most of the items were better than my expectations</li>
            <li> I like my husband with a little bit of scruff but was tired of the tiny fine hairs that covered the sink after he trimmed. He always cleaned up after himself but without fail there were always stragglers left behind. So I decided to try &amp; find him a vacuum trimmer for christmas. I did a lot of research and was intrigued by this product. I had a few reservations due to other comments about the settings changing mid trim but after watching the great video review posted on here decided to go for it. He was excited to try and now 3 years and he still loves it. It&#x27;s not a miracle trimmer, it doesn&#x27;t suck up every single hair, but is a vast improvement over his old method. Overall a wonderful purchase we&#x27;ve had zero problems with!</li>
            <li> Bought this product 4 years back on Amazon, and its working like a charm. The battery life is just awesome - charge it once at it just keeps going, guess you need to charge it only like once in 3 months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ran into problems having to clean out the inside of the head (the little metal rod under the head that spins to move the blades back and forth) to solve a decrease in performance, but this is easily done by turning on the trimmer and poking with the brush provided until the hairs come out. Very durable and has lasted me for many years. I wish there was a new trimmer just like this to eventually replace mine.</li>
            <li> Not bad but it could have had better vacuum, or at least it could have sucked in hair better. Over all it was decent.</li>
            <li> This is the first beard trimmer I have ever liked.  It does a nice job, and I especially like the vacuum that catches all the hair so it doesn&#x27;t end up in my sink.  Adjusts well.  Good product.</li>
            <li> Husband like it&lt;br /&gt;I got it for him for Christmas last year</li>
            <li> It has been 4 1/2 years since I bought one (use it 3x a week) and only recently do I notice the battery not lasting as long as it use to.  Instead of needing a recharge every month, it seems to be every 3 weeks.  Nevertheless, it is a terrific beard trimmer.  It takes 2 minutes to give it a thorough cleaning (every 3-4 weeks).  No doubt I would buy another...in about another four years when possibly the battery will no longer hold a charge (nothing lasts forever).</li>
            <li> Very good. I bought this one about 5 years ago and still like brand new. The battery is still good. The blade is still perfect. I use this about 2 to 3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Have owned this for many years and functions perfectly!</li>
            <li> The product itself is great and shipping went well. Very happy with purchase.</li>
            <li> I have used this product for at least three years now and it still works great.  I charge it about once a month and use it daily</li>
            <li> the latch to the vacuum receptacle broke almost immediately. otherwise, it has performed well. charge lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> This is not a knock your socks off trimmer but it is an excellent trimmer for the money! I bought it as a no bull trimmer for my father who has multiple levels of a beard and mustache. He now has no problem finding the correct length trimmer guides or deal with a pile of clippings because the trimmer pretty much takes care of that for him. The only thing that could be a bit better is the regular speed vacuum misses some clippings when being rushed through the clipping of your beard, but I guess thats why they made this clipper with a &amp;#34;turbo&amp;#34; function that increases the speed of the blades and increases vacuum at the same time. The only other thought I have about it is the clipping trap itself is small if you have a heavy beard or let it grow to long before clipping again but you could always empty it while clipping in the garbage and continue clipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall an excellent trimmer! Would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this trimmer.  I bought this one to replace an earlier one that I had been using for years.</li>
            <li> My husband has been using this for a while now and it has lasted a long time with good battery power. He has a pretty thick beard and while the vacuum part isn&#x27;t as good as I had hoped, it picks up a lot more than a normal razor.</li>
            <li> I bought this freshman year of college..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5+ years later, I&#x27;m still using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely good for trimming your beard, manscaping, etc.&lt;br /&gt;The little vacuum is nice, and collects a bunch of hair.. but don&#x27;t count on it to pick up everything.&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price, there&#x27;s no reason not to buy it. (unless you don&#x27;t have hair to be trimmed xD)</li>
