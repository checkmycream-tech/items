            <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve checked the barcodes for original Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner and guess what!</li>
            <li>It does not keep it perfectly smooth, but works better than most &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; products.  </li>
            <li>worked fine but did not feel like it was the salon quality</li>
            <li>and I have fine hair.</li>
            <li>Wow, quick arrival of this great product.  </li>
            <li>smell fantastic, and the product smooths as advertised.</li>
            <li>The shampoo is sulfate free</li>
            <li>and I tend to wash twice because sulfate-free shampoos just don&#x27;t lather up like the cheap stuff.  </li>
            <li>Did I mention the fabulous smell?  </li>
            <li>So I bought this product and compare it to my original ones.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t seem to be the original product.</li>
            <li>Helps my thick, curly hair and smells wonderful.  </li>
            <li>These hair products are fantastic - leaves your hair soft, shiny and very smooth.</li>
            <li>Received my item quickly</li>
            <li>and this makes my hair feel soft and smooth for days:)</li>
            <li>this tamed my frizz by over 50% after just the first use!</li>
            <li>the conditioner is really smoothed my hair!!</li>
            <li>My hair is course and it smooths it down really well and leaves great shine.  </li>
            <li>, you only need a little bit and your hair is basically perfect out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Very unusual me.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend these products to any true Moroccanoil enthusiast.</li>
            <li>this product is exactly looks like the originals.</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li>I think I&#x27;ll be using this as my standard shampoo and conditioner from now on, rotating occasionally with the Moroccanoil Clarifying Shampoo which is also good</li>
            <li>It really does help with the frizz.</li>
            <li>This is the Smoothing shampoo and conditioner and works very well.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this line to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li>and it really does have the smoothing property</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it!</li>
            <li>It leaves your hair smooth as silk and I can blow dry it out and not even have to straighten my hair to style it.  </li>
            <li>Works fine, but I will order from the actual website next time.</li>
            <li>I love this product but 1/4 of the bottle was missing when delivered and there was no seal on the bottle!</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair (ringlets)</li>
            <li>vital~</li>
            <li>My favorite shampoo and conditioner for my thick hair .</li>
            <li>This particular product had a different smell</li>
            <li>Now I can comb it out right away without the use of any other product.  </li>
            <li>Give yourself a few more minutes for a quick blow-dry and style and your hair stays that way for at least three days!</li>
            <li>the smell was close to the original but a little bit different.</li>
            <li>It is so far good product, but it leaves hair real harsh once dried!</li>
            <li>I love all Moroccanoil products and have used a few other of their shampoo&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>the usual way and didn&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron which is pretty much always my last step because my hair is that frizzy.  </li>

            <li> A little pricey but highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I needed, relief on my hands from trying to wash and style my hair daily, and a look that stays for a few days!!!</li>
            <li> It really weighed my hair down and after it dried it looked somewhat greasy.</li>
            <li> this Product is fake, I had the original Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner  before.</li>
            <li> I have dry ends</li>
            <li> You will think your hair is really dry feeling</li>
            <li> My hair was very dry from a color processing go awry</li>
            <li> Pretty expensive for it not to work too.</li>
            <li> I have thick, coarse hair</li>
            <li> Does not weigh down</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the product everyday, because my hair would get too &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> I used it a couple of days ago, then used the smoothing lotion, dried my hair</li>
            <li> I purchased my usual &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; shampoo &amp; conditioner.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if I believe it is correct product.</li>
            <li> I have a medical condition that makes use of my hands difficult and I have very thick hair.</li>
            <li> and I swear I am addicted to the smell.  </li>
            <li> and it has a weird smell.  </li>
            <li> My hair is crazy frizzy with humidity.  </li>

            <li> I received the product in a timely manner. The issue I had was both product had leaked.  That&#x27;s the reason wasn&#x27;t given 4 stars.</li>
            <li> LOVE the smell! I have naturally curly hair (ringlets) this tamed my frizz by over 50% after just the first use! I can&#x27;t wait to see if it continues to improve.</li>
            <li> More excellent Moroccanoil products. This is the Smoothing shampoo and conditioner and works very well. I highly recommend these products to any true Moroccanoil enthusiast. Excellent pricing for the set!</li>
            <li> DO NOT BUY IT! this Product is fake, I had the original Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner  before. So I bought this product and compare it to my original ones. this product is exactly looks like the originals. the smell was close to the original but a little bit different. Also, the color of the shampoo is slightly different. I&#x27;ve checked the barcodes for original Moroccanoil shampoo and conditioner and guess what! they where different than this product.</li>
            <li> My hair is crazy frizzy with humidity.  This shampoo and conditioner didn&#x27;t help at all and it has a weird smell.  Not a fan!  Pretty expensive for it not to work too.</li>
            <li> Love Moroccanoil !! My favorite shampoo and conditioner for my thick hair . Good product!&lt;br /&gt;Signed Sherrie</li>
            <li> worked fine but did not feel like it was the salon quality</li>
            <li> Love how the shampoo and Conditioner smells and how my hair feels.  Does not weigh down and I have fine hair.</li>
            <li> Have used this for a couple years---Moroccanoil products are wonderful.  This works good on my humidity-unfriendly hair.  It does not keep it perfectly smooth, but works better than most &amp;#34;smoothing&amp;#34; products.  Love the smell---keeps my hair very nicely conditioned and in good shape.  All of their products are very good.</li>
            <li> It is so far good product, but it leaves hair real harsh once dried! Yet, it did improve hair vital~</li>
            <li> My favorite shampoo and conditioner. The smell is divine and it conditions your hair and leaves it in incredible condition.&lt;br /&gt;I have color treated hair and this shampoo makes my hair healthy and shiny. I can&#x27;t live without it! I love all Moroccanoil products and have used a few other of their shampoo&#x27;s. This is top notch!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the money!!!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product! Would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo. I do however, feel the coating it leaves on my hair when I rinse it out; therefore, I alternate it with the clarifying shampoo. I use the conditioner after each shampoo and I love  it. My hair is course and it smooths it down really well and leaves great shine.  It leaves a wonderful scent in my hair for several days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use the hydrating mask on my ends and it works well and smooths.</li>
            <li> smell fantastic, and the product smooths as advertised. Much better for my hair than the volumizing garbage.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Moroccanoil products for a while now &amp; this is not it!! I purchased my usual &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; shampoo &amp; conditioner. I have thick, coarse hair &amp; I immediately could tell that this was NOT Moroccanoil product.&lt;br /&gt;YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR.</li>
            <li> Love it no matter what!  This brand is the shiz!</li>
            <li> Caused scalp to become itchy.  Very unusual me.</li>
            <li> This is the best stuff ever. I have a medical condition that makes use of my hands difficult and I have very thick hair. My cousin recommended this line to me. I LOVE it, you only need a little bit and your hair is basically perfect out of the shower. Give yourself a few more minutes for a quick blow-dry and style and your hair stays that way for at least three days! Exactly what I needed, relief on my hands from trying to wash and style my hair daily, and a look that stays for a few days!!! I HIGHLY recommend this line to EVERYONE!</li>
            <li> This is great stuff, if you are looking for something to relax wavy hair before blowing it out and straightening. It leaves your hair soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Perfect.  Received my item quickly and I love this shampoo and conditioner.  Great experience with this vendor!</li>
            <li> These hair products are fantastic - leaves your hair soft, shiny and very smooth.</li>
            <li> I love the conditioner! This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried! :). I have dry ends and this makes my hair feel soft and smooth for days:)</li>
            <li> I absolutely love everything about this product.  My stylist used this on me and I swear I am addicted to the smell.  This is definitely cheaper than buying at the salon.  The shampoo is sulfate free and I tend to wash twice because sulfate-free shampoos just don&#x27;t lather up like the cheap stuff.  You will think your hair is really dry feeling but it&#x27;s actually because there is no residues that are being left on the hair follicles.  My hair was very dry from a color processing go awry and I had to use Argan Oil after shampooing and conditioning to comb it out.  Now I can comb it out right away without the use of any other product.  It leaves your hair smooth as silk and I can blow dry it out and not even have to straighten my hair to style it.  Did I mention the fabulous smell?  Do yourself a favor and splurge on this, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> I really love the smell of this smoothining shampoo and conditioner, expeciallt the conditioner is really smoothed my hair!!</li>
            <li> I love this product but 1/4 of the bottle was missing when delivered and there was no seal on the bottle! Bummer</li>
            <li> Absolutely love this shampoo and conditioner.  Helps my thick, curly hair and smells wonderful.  Have used many products that didn&#x27;t come close to this products.....I&#x27;m hooked for life!</li>
            <li> Just what I wanted. Great price and fast service</li>
            <li> great shampoo / conditioner</li>
            <li> Moroccanoil products are good!  I don&#x27;t use the product everyday, because my hair would get too &amp;#34;gummy&amp;#34;.  But, the product works well and smells good.</li>
            <li> I love Moroccan oil products. I would not however use the shampoo and conditioner together. It really weighed my hair down and after it dried it looked somewhat greasy. So I alternate between using the shampoo with a different conditioner and the conditioner with a different shampoo. I also noticed the shampoo doesn&#x27;t lather like regular shampoo does. I&#x27;m guessing because of the Moroccan oil that&#x27;s in it.</li>
            <li> Good product. Arrived in a timely manner!</li>
            <li> This stuff makes your hair smell amazing. I wish they had a fragrance.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this before. This particular product had a different smell so I&#x27;m not sure if I believe it is correct product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff.  It smells great and it really does have the smoothing property it says it does.  I used it a couple of days ago, then used the smoothing lotion, dried my hair the usual way and didn&#x27;t even have to use a flat iron which is pretty much always my last step because my hair is that frizzy.  I think I&#x27;ll be using this as my standard shampoo and conditioner from now on, rotating occasionally with the Moroccanoil Clarifying Shampoo which is also good (I use it the day before I color my hair).  A little pricey but highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Wow, quick arrival of this great product.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, for my hair it is great. I get compliments all the time about how good my hair smells.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to be the original product. Scent was not the same. Works fine, but I will order from the actual website next time.</li>
