            <li>Great product.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t affect how sweaty my feet get, unlike the underarm version that does seem to reduce perspiration, but this is a very effective deodorant.</li>
            <li>Amazing how it works!  </li>
            <li>This was AMAZING!  </li>
            <li>I am a very satisfied customer and will continue to purchase!!!:)</li>
            <li>My dear beloved boyfriend has had the stinkiest feet I&#x27;ve ever smelled...</li>
            <li>Your estranged loved one&#x27;s and pets will thank you.</li>
            <li>nothing helps but aluminum chloride at night/foot powder and good wool socks during the day.  </li>
            <li>in all, a good product.</li>
            <li>I think it was a good buy.</li>
            <li>it is good.</li>
            <li>Works really good ..</li>
            <li>Very pleased.</li>
            <li>the product is great, but I wish the jar would contain more of it.</li>
            <li>Am a repeat buyer and love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I love this!</li>
            <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>Amazing product.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so nice to not have to be embarrassed anymore to take off my shoes.  </li>
            <li>I must admit, I&#x27;m surprized at how effective it is.  </li>
            <li>I have noted it is not as effective on my Teva-like water sandles that I wear during the day in summer.  </li>
            <li>Effectively eliminates embarrassing odors from footwear.</li>
            <li>It would have been a nice touch.</li>
            <li>Best product I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li>Worked great right away.  </li>
            <li>It really works good!</li>
            <li>so I have to deal with the smell of cheese curls more often than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li>I have been using it for several years, it is an excellent product, esp.</li>
            <li>I love that the ingredients are not chemicals.</li>
            <li>or I&#x27;m wearing shoes or doing things that make my feet sweat more.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if the same degree of effectiveness  were available in spray formula, because this sticky paste is more time-consuming to apply, but I will keep using it since it&#x27;s superbly efficient.</li>
            <li>Outstanding product.</li>
            <li>Fabulous product !</li>
            <li>works ok for me, it did help with the smell but</li>
            <li>and then I need to take more cream out to ensure an even application.</li>
            <li>Instead, I pat the cream onto my foot and this was definitely better for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I have been able to wear them again after using this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li>I used it the night before my trip, rubbing the cream in on the bottom of my feet (mostly around the ball of my foot and between my toes).  </li>
            <li>This is a great product and works really well.</li>
            <li>it was even more embarrassing because neither my dad or brother had that problem.</li>
            <li>there are more women than you think suffering through this.</li>
            <li>there are more women than you think suffering through this.</li>
            <li>Like most of the reviews here, I tried a number of creams, lotions..</li>
            <li>If you have sweaty feet there is nothing on the market better than Lavilin.</li>
            <li>Most of the reviews and even the product information says one application should work for up to 7 days.  </li>
            <li>It eliminates most of the sweat and odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review then,</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li>It would be better in a shaving cream or toothpaste tube.  </li>
            <li>Also you should get more for your money.</li>
            <li>and so far, so good!</li>
            <li>and so far, so good!</li>
            <li>Seems to work mildly, but not 100% effective.</li>
            <li>swear, turned the stinkiest little kid feet into pleasant happy feet.</li>
            <li>have always had extraordinarily strong foot odor, and it comes up even in winter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that&#x27;s ever worked, and it was perfect from the first application.</li>
            <li>Amazing for my really stinky feet</li>
            <li>We tried dr. sholls foot spray and a bunch of powder and sprays available at the drug store and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>I was hesitant about the success of this product - but many people suggested it on Reddit</li>
            <li>and now I only need to use it a couple days a week, not even every day, so this has been great.</li>
            <li>Foot Fresh cream from Canada works much better.</li>
            <li>THIS CREAM DEODORANT IS FABULOUS.</li>
            <li>So far so good.  </li>
            <li>It is very effective and I cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li>12 FL OZ spray bottle, environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li>I have tosay is the best solution so far, it last me odorless free for about 5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I could start to funk up a pair of shoes within a couple of weeks no matter what I did (scrubbing feet, putting shoes in the washing machine on hot) and could rarely keep shoes for more than one season.</li>
            <li>i loved it,sneaker without sock ,the only thing is that my feet get dries</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li>sometimes sweet.</li>
            <li>Been using this for almost two weeks and its nowhere near as effective as advertised for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The true test of this for me will be this summer, when the weather heats up.  </li>
            <li>Great product I definitely recommend it for people who have the a very embarrassing feet odor.</li>
            <li>but that went away quickly.</li>
            <li>Really works!!</li>
            <li>This is the first thing i&#x27;ve ever used that worked!</li>
            <li>For simplicity (and since I didn&#x27;t care if my feet were &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34;), I found that Lavilin was adequate by itself.  </li>
            <li>waxy isn&#x27;t quite the right word but almost.  </li>
            <li>so what did i have to lose right?</li>
            <li>It was great for the first few days.</li>
            <li>My daughter found on Amazon this was still available in new box.</li>
            <li>It seems to have an accumulative effect, so don&#x27;t lose hope if the first couple of applications don&#x27;t work right away.</li>
            <li>compared to what i have spent before on so many over the counter products, $13.00 is nothing and a price i would pay over and over in a heartbeat to keep my feet odor free.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no scent to them, they are just normal, clean feet now.</li>
            <li>After just the first use, my husbands feet do not smell a bit.</li>
            <li>By the end of that first, maybe, 7-10 days, my feet were completely odor free.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It really did make a difference in my summer sandals!</li>
            <li>He uses it once a week and his feet are completely odor free.</li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t remember exactly when my problem started</li>
            <li>lavilin will make a better product next time ;)</li>
            <li>One of my all time favorite products on the market that gives you extra confidence when working with people.</li>
            <li>It will eliminate &amp;#34;stinky feet syndrome&amp;#34; on the first application, and by holding the bacteria balance on your feet right, it even makes old shoes smell fresh again as you wear them.</li>
            <li>I even tried using it for many days straight, still didn;t work and the &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; odor only got stronger.</li>
            <li>applied the cream (took about 3 strong applications like the directions say for first use) and it actually works!&lt;br /&gt;You have to keep up with applications</li>
            <li>First of all, i am a woman and people don&#x27;t generally view our gender to have any kind of odor problem, especially feet.</li>
            <li>Hey it really works, I first gave this two stars because I have not use it yet ,but it works.</li>
            <li>It really does work the first time it is used.</li>
            <li>At times certain materials can react with my feet as well as stress or health issues that I have had.  </li>
            <li>when i am wearing socks only no shoes, i am perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>Swear by this product for keeping my toes and feet clean, dry, and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li>and this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>It really does.  </li>
            <li>Thanks.  </li>
            <li>does what it is supposed to very well</li>
            <li>a soft, rubber like material and the odor has been absorbed.  </li>
            <li>Enjoy instant relief!</li>
            <li>Natural, fresh peppermint scent.</li>
            <li>I have to use it three days a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; the package says that the user can eventually get to a point of applying just once a week, but my feet really, really stink without Lavilin use.)  </li>
            <li>It was always so embarrassing when I needed to take off my shoes on any event, in my house if people were there and when I got home my routine was to go straight to tub, take off my shoes and wash my feet.  </li>
            <li>this if you have really smelly feet, this is a life changer for me.</li>
            <li>one morning while i was getting ready for work, i was putting on lotion on my feet</li>
            <li>but i knew the real test would come once i put on my shoes.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always had a problem with this and nothing really seemed to fix this.</li>
            <li>and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li>This really works...for some reason my feet started sweating a lot and would make my fleece lined shoes/boots get an odor...</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li>and however much I wash, there always seem to be a case of the stinky feet at the end of the day.</li>
            <li>It really does work -</li>
            <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but, in the meantime, this really is helping me.</li>
            <li>One Day an add was in the local paper about feet issues with free appointment.</li>
            <li>The smell is gone right away and stays for a considerable time.</li>
            <li>high heels).This combination works really well for me.</li>
            <li>Since then, I&#x27;ve applied it roughly every 2-4 days, more frequently if it&#x27;s extra hot</li>
            <li>- I would highly recommend it to anyone with a foot odor problem.</li>
            <li>It saves me a lot of embarrassment and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I was about to go on a work trip with others from work and was mortified about having to take my high heels off in front of coworkers at the airport for fear of foot odor.  </li>
            <li>I use no show high heel socks</li>
            <li>I have been in search of a product that will stop foot odor 15 years and this is the only product that worked the first time!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve struggled with stinky feet my whole life, and have tried every foot soak or old wives tale i could find.</li>
            <li>Now there is never an odor - even after wearing rubber boots in 90 degree heat all day and my socks are completely drenched - this product really works for me.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does fix the foot odor issue for many days and once the cream is on your foot for a few minutes it soaks in</li>
            <li>So make sure to oscillate between heavy moisturizer and then Lavilin or your skin will start to peel.</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t absorb sweat like normal cotton socks.</li>
            <li>It is extremely gentle with a light pleasing scent -- nothing harsh to cause a foot rash at all.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first product to actually get rid of my foot odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>For the first week or so, I applied it daily after my shower and before putting on shoes.</li>
            <li>, I wouldn&#x27;t say that this lasts 7 days - but I usually wash my feet more often and that could cause me to need to apply it every 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Emits a strange odor of it&#x27;s own after using for a few days.</li>
            <li>I also rub a little between my toes but not enough to be seen on the top of the toes.  </li>
            <li>If you want this to go on better, use it mixed with a little moisturizer - otherwise it cakes up and doesn&#x27;t rub in well.</li>
            <li>You only need to use the cream very sparingly and it completely stops foot odor.  </li>
            <li>I used to use it along with Awakening HANDS cream (a practice that my wife continues by applying upon feet before bed and sleeping with socks, after I introduced the combo-treatment to her) for soft skin, alternating days of application.  </li>
            <li>but once you rub it in, it blends in with no trouble.</li>
            <li>I bought this to help alleviate stink and sweating and so far it&#x27;s working well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks Lavilin, for a product that actually works!</li>
            <li>I tried the regular Lavillin deodorant for under the arms and it didn&#x27;t work for me, but this foot cream has really helped.  </li>
            <li>This stuff seems to work - for about a week, as advertised (and even then, my feet aren&#x27;t nearly as stinky as they were).</li>
            <li>It does have a dry muddy stick to the feet when you apply for the first time.</li>
            <li>I received this product the other day after reading all the positive reviews and let me say WOW!!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve used it and you only use a tiny amount</li>
            <li>I tried following the instructions that said to apply it to clean feet at night, but, like other reviewers, did not find that worked well.</li>
            <li>within 2 days we noticed a HUGE improvement, very little to no odor.</li>
            <li>I put a little on my finger (like a grain of rice sized amount), dab it around the ball of my foot, then quickly rub it around.</li>
            <li>This really did help to keep my feet dry</li>
            <li>I decided to give it another try and stayed with it for at least a week or so and sure enough, this started to work for me.</li>
            <li>Any shoes that had a little smell in them are now odor free, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that the people who say it&#x27;s messy are applying too much.</li>
            <li>Second time he used it his feet peeled a layer of old skin?  </li>
            <li>When I finish it will be going back to old deodorants.</li>
            <li>Safe, non toxic, non irritating, won&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li>It starts to become less manageable quickly, so I don&#x27;t leave it there for too long.</li>
            <li>This really cleared it up using it about every other day.</li>
            <li>At first I use it every few days when I get it then once a week.</li>
            <li>i have always has sweaty feet and so far, they have been dry and comfy, no smell.</li>
            <li>I noticed with the very first application that my gym sock didn&#x27;t smell after a hard workout.  </li>
            <li>I got a small little container, only 10cc or 12.5 grams and thought at $12 for the unit we&#x27;d go through it really fast, but you use such a small amount and it is so effective I will pay $12 again for it without a second thought.</li>

            <li> Works really good ..</li>
            <li> Very pleased.</li>
            <li> the product is great, but I wish the jar would contain more of it.</li>
            <li> Am a repeat buyer and love this product!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I love this!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> Amazing product.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so nice to not have to be embarrassed anymore to take off my shoes.  </li>
            <li> I must admit, I&#x27;m surprized at how effective it is.  </li>
            <li> I have noted it is not as effective on my Teva-like water sandles that I wear during the day in summer.  </li>
            <li> Effectively eliminates embarrassing odors from footwear.</li>
            <li> It would have been a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> Worked great right away.  </li>
            <li> It really works good!</li>
            <li> so I have to deal with the smell of cheese curls more often than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several years, it is an excellent product, esp.</li>
            <li> I love that the ingredients are not chemicals.</li>
            <li> or I&#x27;m wearing shoes or doing things that make my feet sweat more.</li>
            <li> It would be nice if the same degree of effectiveness  were available in spray formula, because this sticky paste is more time-consuming to apply, but I will keep using it since it&#x27;s superbly efficient.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product.</li>
            <li> Fabulous product !</li>
            <li> works ok for me, it did help with the smell but</li>
            <li> and then I need to take more cream out to ensure an even application.</li>
            <li> Instead, I pat the cream onto my foot and this was definitely better for me.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I have been able to wear them again after using this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This stuff is magic.  </li>
            <li> I used it the night before my trip, rubbing the cream in on the bottom of my feet (mostly around the ball of my foot and between my toes).  </li>
            <li> This is a great product and works really well.</li>
            <li> it was even more embarrassing because neither my dad or brother had that problem.</li>
            <li> there are more women than you think suffering through this.</li>
            <li> there are more women than you think suffering through this.</li>
            <li> Like most of the reviews here, I tried a number of creams, lotions..</li>
            <li> If you have sweaty feet there is nothing on the market better than Lavilin.</li>
            <li> Most of the reviews and even the product information says one application should work for up to 7 days.  </li>
            <li> It eliminates most of the sweat and odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review then,</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> It would be better in a shaving cream or toothpaste tube.  </li>
            <li> Also you should get more for your money.</li>
            <li> and so far, so good!</li>
            <li> and so far, so good!</li>
            <li> Seems to work mildly, but not 100% effective.</li>
            <li> swear, turned the stinkiest little kid feet into pleasant happy feet.</li>
            <li> have always had extraordinarily strong foot odor, and it comes up even in winter.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that&#x27;s ever worked, and it was perfect from the first application.</li>
            <li> Amazing for my really stinky feet</li>
            <li> We tried dr. sholls foot spray and a bunch of powder and sprays available at the drug store and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about the success of this product - but many people suggested it on Reddit</li>
            <li> and now I only need to use it a couple days a week, not even every day, so this has been great.</li>
            <li> Foot Fresh cream from Canada works much better.</li>
            <li> THIS CREAM DEODORANT IS FABULOUS.</li>
            <li> So far so good.  </li>
            <li> It is very effective and I cannot recommend it highly enough.</li>
            <li> 12 FL OZ spray bottle, environmentally friendly.</li>
            <li> I have tosay is the best solution so far, it last me odorless free for about 5 days.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I could start to funk up a pair of shoes within a couple of weeks no matter what I did (scrubbing feet, putting shoes in the washing machine on hot) and could rarely keep shoes for more than one season.</li>
            <li> i loved it,sneaker without sock ,the only thing is that my feet get dries</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s true.  </li>
            <li> sometimes sweet.</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost two weeks and its nowhere near as effective as advertised for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The true test of this for me will be this summer, when the weather heats up.  </li>
            <li> Great product I definitely recommend it for people who have the a very embarrassing feet odor.</li>
            <li> but that went away quickly.</li>
            <li> Really works!!</li>
            <li> This is the first thing i&#x27;ve ever used that worked!</li>
            <li> For simplicity (and since I didn&#x27;t care if my feet were &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34;), I found that Lavilin was adequate by itself.  </li>
            <li> waxy isn&#x27;t quite the right word but almost.  </li>
            <li> so what did i have to lose right?</li>
            <li> It was great for the first few days.</li>
            <li> My daughter found on Amazon this was still available in new box.</li>
            <li> It seems to have an accumulative effect, so don&#x27;t lose hope if the first couple of applications don&#x27;t work right away.</li>
            <li> compared to what i have spent before on so many over the counter products, $13.00 is nothing and a price i would pay over and over in a heartbeat to keep my feet odor free.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no scent to them, they are just normal, clean feet now.</li>
            <li> After just the first use, my husbands feet do not smell a bit.</li>
            <li> By the end of that first, maybe, 7-10 days, my feet were completely odor free.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It really did make a difference in my summer sandals!</li>
            <li> He uses it once a week and his feet are completely odor free.</li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t remember exactly when my problem started</li>
            <li> lavilin will make a better product next time ;)</li>
            <li> One of my all time favorite products on the market that gives you extra confidence when working with people.</li>
            <li> It will eliminate &amp;#34;stinky feet syndrome&amp;#34; on the first application, and by holding the bacteria balance on your feet right, it even makes old shoes smell fresh again as you wear them.</li>
            <li> I even tried using it for many days straight, still didn;t work and the &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; odor only got stronger.</li>
            <li> applied the cream (took about 3 strong applications like the directions say for first use) and it actually works!&lt;br /&gt;You have to keep up with applications</li>
            <li> First of all, i am a woman and people don&#x27;t generally view our gender to have any kind of odor problem, especially feet.</li>
            <li> Hey it really works, I first gave this two stars because I have not use it yet ,but it works.</li>
            <li> It really does work the first time it is used.</li>
            <li> At times certain materials can react with my feet as well as stress or health issues that I have had.  </li>
            <li> when i am wearing socks only no shoes, i am perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> Swear by this product for keeping my toes and feet clean, dry, and smelling fresh.</li>
            <li> and this stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> It really does.  </li>
            <li> Thanks.  </li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to very well</li>
            <li> a soft, rubber like material and the odor has been absorbed.  </li>
            <li> Enjoy instant relief!</li>
            <li> Natural, fresh peppermint scent.</li>
            <li> I have to use it three days a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; the package says that the user can eventually get to a point of applying just once a week, but my feet really, really stink without Lavilin use.)  </li>
            <li> It was always so embarrassing when I needed to take off my shoes on any event, in my house if people were there and when I got home my routine was to go straight to tub, take off my shoes and wash my feet.  </li>
            <li> this if you have really smelly feet, this is a life changer for me.</li>
            <li> one morning while i was getting ready for work, i was putting on lotion on my feet</li>
            <li> but i knew the real test would come once i put on my shoes.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had a problem with this and nothing really seemed to fix this.</li>
            <li> and nothing really worked.</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  </li>
            <li> This really works...for some reason my feet started sweating a lot and would make my fleece lined shoes/boots get an odor...</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li> and however much I wash, there always seem to be a case of the stinky feet at the end of the day.</li>
            <li> It really does work -</li>
            <li> very easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but, in the meantime, this really is helping me.</li>
            <li> One Day an add was in the local paper about feet issues with free appointment.</li>
            <li> The smell is gone right away and stays for a considerable time.</li>
            <li> high heels).This combination works really well for me.</li>
            <li> Since then, I&#x27;ve applied it roughly every 2-4 days, more frequently if it&#x27;s extra hot</li>
            <li> - I would highly recommend it to anyone with a foot odor problem.</li>
            <li> It saves me a lot of embarrassment and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I was about to go on a work trip with others from work and was mortified about having to take my high heels off in front of coworkers at the airport for fear of foot odor.  </li>
            <li> I use no show high heel socks</li>
            <li> I have been in search of a product that will stop foot odor 15 years and this is the only product that worked the first time!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve struggled with stinky feet my whole life, and have tried every foot soak or old wives tale i could find.</li>
            <li> Now there is never an odor - even after wearing rubber boots in 90 degree heat all day and my socks are completely drenched - this product really works for me.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does fix the foot odor issue for many days and once the cream is on your foot for a few minutes it soaks in</li>
            <li> So make sure to oscillate between heavy moisturizer and then Lavilin or your skin will start to peel.</li>
            <li> but they don&#x27;t absorb sweat like normal cotton socks.</li>
            <li> It is extremely gentle with a light pleasing scent -- nothing harsh to cause a foot rash at all.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first product to actually get rid of my foot odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> For the first week or so, I applied it daily after my shower and before putting on shoes.</li>
            <li> , I wouldn&#x27;t say that this lasts 7 days - but I usually wash my feet more often and that could cause me to need to apply it every 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Emits a strange odor of it&#x27;s own after using for a few days.</li>
            <li> I also rub a little between my toes but not enough to be seen on the top of the toes.  </li>
            <li> If you want this to go on better, use it mixed with a little moisturizer - otherwise it cakes up and doesn&#x27;t rub in well.</li>
            <li> You only need to use the cream very sparingly and it completely stops foot odor.  </li>
            <li> I used to use it along with Awakening HANDS cream (a practice that my wife continues by applying upon feet before bed and sleeping with socks, after I introduced the combo-treatment to her) for soft skin, alternating days of application.  </li>
            <li> but once you rub it in, it blends in with no trouble.</li>
            <li> I bought this to help alleviate stink and sweating and so far it&#x27;s working well.  </li>
            <li> Thanks Lavilin, for a product that actually works!</li>
            <li> I tried the regular Lavillin deodorant for under the arms and it didn&#x27;t work for me, but this foot cream has really helped.  </li>
            <li> This stuff seems to work - for about a week, as advertised (and even then, my feet aren&#x27;t nearly as stinky as they were).</li>
            <li> It does have a dry muddy stick to the feet when you apply for the first time.</li>
            <li> I received this product the other day after reading all the positive reviews and let me say WOW!!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve used it and you only use a tiny amount</li>
            <li> I tried following the instructions that said to apply it to clean feet at night, but, like other reviewers, did not find that worked well.</li>
            <li> within 2 days we noticed a HUGE improvement, very little to no odor.</li>
            <li> I put a little on my finger (like a grain of rice sized amount), dab it around the ball of my foot, then quickly rub it around.</li>
            <li> This really did help to keep my feet dry</li>
            <li> I decided to give it another try and stayed with it for at least a week or so and sure enough, this started to work for me.</li>
            <li> Any shoes that had a little smell in them are now odor free, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that the people who say it&#x27;s messy are applying too much.</li>
            <li> Second time he used it his feet peeled a layer of old skin?  </li>
            <li> When I finish it will be going back to old deodorants.</li>
            <li> Safe, non toxic, non irritating, won&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> It starts to become less manageable quickly, so I don&#x27;t leave it there for too long.</li>
            <li> This really cleared it up using it about every other day.</li>
            <li> At first I use it every few days when I get it then once a week.</li>
            <li> i have always has sweaty feet and so far, they have been dry and comfy, no smell.</li>
            <li> I noticed with the very first application that my gym sock didn&#x27;t smell after a hard workout.  </li>
            <li> I got a small little container, only 10cc or 12.5 grams and thought at $12 for the unit we&#x27;d go through it really fast, but you use such a small amount and it is so effective I will pay $12 again for it without a second thought.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed for my daughter&#x27;s very stinky feet (poor kid!)  </li>
            <li> so I think the jar will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it may not last as long as it says.</li>
            <li> I can wear flat w/o sock and my feet have no odor!</li>
            <li> This does not last very long.</li>
            <li> I imagine the container lasting at least a decent amount of time because I don&#x27;t even use a pea-sized amount per foot, and you don&#x27;t spread the paste over the entire bottom of your feet, just a portion.  </li>
            <li> The next morning I could still see the product on the bottom of my feet, which I expected as others said this helps eliminate smell in current shoes.  </li>
            <li> may be thinking - well, clearly this person didn&#x27;t have anything like the ginormous foot odor problem that I have - not true.</li>
            <li> We put it on every 12 hours for first 48 hours and then once every other day for a few days, then down to only once a week.</li>
            <li> (cause face it, when you ar desperate, something is better than nothing)</li>
            <li> Just one product by itself is not sufficient to keep the smell at bay for a long time.</li>
            <li> This has a strange application instruction with it.  </li>
            <li> Rely on this cream weekly as a regimen to prevent long days in my shoes and boots in the winter.  </li>
            <li> but nothing had work; i have spent close to one thousand dollars in the last 15 years and all for nothing.</li>
            <li> its really thick and doesn&#x27;t really have a pleasurable smell to it</li>
            <li> I usually immediately put on shoes, but have not found that the cream transfers to floors or other stuff, I think, because I&#x27;m not using much.</li>
            <li> This definitely saves shoes from being thrown out due to odors, for me being ballet flats that socks won&#x27;t work with.</li>
            <li> (this is summer use in a dry climate).</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product because I have tried everything I was able to find to remove the smell from my feet.  </li>
            <li> It last for days on your feet (a little goes a long way)and take stinky smells out of your shoes too.</li>
            <li> The only other product I have found that works is On Your Toes, however the powder is messy and obvious when I take my shoes off.  </li>
            <li> The odor-reduction only lasted about half a day.</li>
            <li> It is a personal preference that I find the thickness of the cream odd on my feet.</li>
            <li> A week after continuous use, the surface of my toes became very dry and itchy.</li>
            <li> It is a little drying, so I occasionally use moisturizer at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
            <li> A little dab on each foot after your shower will do yah for several days or up to one week.</li>
            <li> You only need to use it a few times a week</li>
            <li> but it beats them being wet any day.  </li>
            <li> I have spent a ton of money on foot products trying to eliminate foot odor.  </li>
            <li> Between these two products I had ABSOLUTELY no smell.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days, but I have had NO odor.  </li>
            <li> Also, kind of annoying to apply.</li>
            <li> The cream is extremely thick and will last you for a long time.  </li>
            <li> you do not need to apply that much so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Such a small jar of cream</li>
            <li> but you only use a small amount and once a week.</li>
            <li> but this is the only one for me that took care of all of the usual problems that feet have (Athlete&#x27;s Foot, cracking, and smell.)  </li>
            <li> One other thing to note though is that after application it can transfer onto other things (socks, slippers, sheets, etc.)</li>
            <li> The only problem is it dryes my feet a little, but it is the little of my problems.</li>
            <li> Now, my husband (and son) have extremely stinky feet.  </li>
            <li> I need to experiment with other solutions.</li>
            <li> Have bought this product for over five years through Amazon and any other place</li>
            <li> lasts a long time, only takes a very small amount</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> but I think applying this every other day should be sufficient.</li>
            <li> If there is a knock against the product it might be that feet are a little too dry for a while</li>
            <li> and it keeps up with active schedule.  </li>
            <li> feels awkward, but its just at night and its worth ..</li>
            <li> If you are desperate it is worth a try</li>
            <li> the cream is THICK and applies on white, it makes me think of sunscreen and after seeing Zinc Oxide in the ingredients list, turns out I was correct!!</li>
            <li> Again, I was amazed because there was absolutely no smell!!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried quite a few other brands</li>
            <li> I use a very, very, very small amount every week (on Sunday night, before sleep) and I forget about my stinky feet during 1 entire week, even if I use a stinky pair of shoes or if I use socks.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on the other products out there.  </li>
            <li> The dabbing helps distribute it across the area, since it&#x27;s less spreadable than some creams.</li>
            <li> cream is an odd texture....</li>
            <li> Follow package suggestions and use at night or you will have a mess in your shoes.</li>
            <li> Just a mess.</li>
            <li> It lasts a few months because you only use a very small amount on your finger and rub it along the area where your toes meet the ball of your foot.  </li>
            <li> Was very skeptical, but TOTALLY SURPRISED how well it took away not only the smell of feet but the smell of &amp;#34;rotten shoes&amp;#34</li>
            <li> My thyroid has been a little sluggish, so</li>
            <li> In the summer when you wear close shoes dap a little on your feet to prevent sweat and prevent feet from hurting.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t bother using the little plastic spatula -</li>
            <li> It does get a little sticky when I was on hardwood floor</li>
            <li> Messy</li>
            <li> but it works for a few days.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy, I have to put on socks on nights that I apply it so that the paste doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes and upholstery.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a few years now</li>
            <li> My wife has used this on her hands when cracks appeared upon them -- took care of the cracks within a few days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit messy to apply, which is the reason that I knocked off one star.  </li>
            <li> But kinda messy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s nothing less than a miracle!</li>
            <li> No more powders or little nylon bootie things.</li>
            <li> No more smelling feet in the summer</li>
            <li> small</li>
            <li> I use it twice a week just a small amount between my toes and sorts out years of smelly feet which used to ruin my footwear</li>
            <li> I put a small amount on her feet after a bath and they don&#x27;t smell.</li>
            <li> You put a small amount on a spatula that comes with it, and then use your fingers to wipe it off the spatula and to spread it onto your feet.  </li>
            <li> However I don&#x27;t like the small amount or the delivery vehicle.  </li>
            <li> The cream is thick, so takes just a little longer to rub in but its like giving yourself a foot massage!  </li>
            <li> /&gt;The only down side its how badly it drys your feet out, and it does dramatically.</li>
            <li> The cream certainly works, but is rather annoying to apply.</li>
            <li> I have used it for about 2 years now and it has changed my life (or at least my how I feel about my feet).</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tested it beyond that yet, though I have been using it for at least 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> I did cover the entire bottom of my foot because i was desperate that this work.  </li>
            <li> and I purchase 2 creams and since that date given out as a GIFT to others who complained about stinky feet since the 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> The cream is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t want to wash off your hands</li>
            <li> This is thick like toothpaste.  </li>
            <li> This is truly a small miracle if you want to end embarrassing foot odor forever !  </li>
            <li> Unbelievably helpful!</li>
            <li> only people who have gone through horrible foot odor know what a relief it is to finally find something that stops.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, he tends to forget he needs this stuff everyday</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant scent, and works well at deodorizing and keeping my feet dry.</li>
            <li> Inhumanly bad, and for no apparent reason.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and reminds me of clay.</li>
            <li> When my husband takes the time to use this, it really does help with his nasty foot odor.</li>
            <li> A little bit on foot pad at the base of your toes every 5-7 days and no more smelly toes.</li>
            <li> By now I had 2 teen age children and my family hated when I took off my shoes and would tell Mom your feet stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have to throw away shoes after a \\&quot;season\\&quot; because they smell so bad.  </li>
            <li> (sorry, honey)</li>
            <li> The standard drugstore remedies did nothing for it except add horrible deodorant fragrance into the mix.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical but it works.  </li>
            <li> you use hardly any per application and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son had an awfully embarrassing bad foot odor.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s shocking how little you need to use</li>
            <li> I did use my On Your Toes product in my shoes in the night before (again I was desperate).  </li>
            <li> This saved my stinky feet from ruining my expensive shoes!</li>
            <li> I probably couldn&#x27;t identify his socks in a blind smell test!</li>
            <li> My feet were bad.</li>
            <li> I made a bad choice in purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> My work shoes no longer smell bad even though I do not wear socks.</li>
            <li> it was so bad</li>
            <li> RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO HAS BAD FOOT ODER.</li>
            <li> Try it you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> the product didn&#x27;t work for seven days as promised.</li>
            <li> I would recommend this product.  It lasts a few months because you only use a very small amount on your finger and rub it along the area where your toes meet the ball of your foot.  I also rub a little between my toes but not enough to be seen on the top of the toes.  This is a shoe saver!!!</li>
            <li> This saved my stinky feet from ruining my expensive shoes! Podiatrist recommended!</li>
            <li> When my husband takes the time to use this, it really does help with his nasty foot odor. Unfortunately, he tends to forget he needs this stuff everyday so I have to deal with the smell of cheese curls more often than I&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> No more smelling feet in the summer i loved it,sneaker without sock ,the only thing is that my feet get dries</li>
            <li> After just the first use, my husbands feet do not smell a bit. Such a small jar of cream but you only use a small amount and once a week. So it was last. Very pleased.</li>
            <li> Really works!! This stuff is genius. If applied weekly, it keeps the stench at bay.&lt;br /&gt;I swear, turned the stinkiest little kid feet into pleasant happy feet. Happy feet, happy Mom!</li>
            <li> My dear beloved boyfriend has had the stinkiest feet I&#x27;ve ever smelled...(sorry, honey) and this stuff really works.  Second time he used it his feet peeled a layer of old skin?  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s nothing less than a miracle!</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve struggled with stinky feet my whole life, and have tried every foot soak or old wives tale i could find. This is the first thing i&#x27;ve ever used that worked! it&#x27;s so nice to not have to be embarrassed anymore to take off my shoes.  i use it once to twice a week, and the smell is gone.</li>
            <li> Nothing ever worked. This one definitely works. Great product I definitely recommend it for people who have the a very embarrassing feet odor. It does have a dry muddy stick to the feet when you apply for the first time. feels awkward, but its just at night and its worth ..</li>
            <li> My name is Angela, and I have stinky feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Hi Angela)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s true.  I do have stinky feet.  If I ever have oodles of money to spend, I will be getting botox injections in my feet to stop the sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because I hate wearing socks in the summertime.  But then my tennies and my sandals stink.  They&#x27;re not kidding when they say that this product lasts.  It really does.  I&#x27;ve applied once and have not had any stinky feet in over a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Amazing for my really stinky feet</li>
            <li> My feet were bad. Inhumanly bad, and for no apparent reason. My thyroid has been a little sluggish, so maybe that. Anyway, I tried this stuff, and it actually worked to my surprise. It seems to have an accumulative effect, so don&#x27;t lose hope if the first couple of applications don&#x27;t work right away. So if your feet smell like a sack of cheese and cat pee left in a dank basement, then please give it a go. Your estranged loved one&#x27;s and pets will thank you.</li>
            <li> I BROUGHT THIS PRODUCT LAVILIN FOOT DEODORANT, FOR MY SISTER. SHE HAS ALWAYS HAD A PROBLEM WITH SWEATY FEET. LAVILIN FOOT DEODORANT HAS SOLVED THAT PROBLEM.</li>
            <li> Am a repeat buyer and love this product!</li>
            <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found so far.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for several years, it is an excellent product, esp. for my husband!  Also, summertime too.  Thanks.  Gail B.</li>
            <li> This didn&#x27;t prevent my feet from sweating.</li>
            <li> This is a great product that immediately started working on my husband&#x27;s stinky feet.  You only need to use it a few times a week I recommend using it before wearing each pair of shoes.</li>
            <li> does what it is supposed to very well</li>
            <li> This product is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;It made a difference the very next day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually have to throw away shoes after a \\&quot;season\\&quot; because they smell so bad.  I used to use food powder, shoe deodorant, I even tried putting my shoes in the freezer because I read that helped with the stink (of course they were sealed in a bag).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first product to actually get rid of my foot odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this product!</li>
            <li> My 5 year old son had an awfully embarrassing bad foot odor. We tried all kinds of things recommended by various web sites and the pediatrician. He never wore enclosed shoes/sneakers, always wore flip flops or sandals to allow his feet to breathe. We didn&#x27;t wear a pair of shoes two days in a row, etc. We tried dr. sholls foot spray and a bunch of powder and sprays available at the drug store and nothing worked. I bought this by recommendation of friend and within 2 days we noticed a HUGE improvement, very little to no odor. We put it on every 12 hours for first 48 hours and then once every other day for a few days, then down to only once a week. I love that the ingredients are not chemicals. I recommend this product to anyone with a foot odor problem. I got a small little container, only 10cc or 12.5 grams and thought at $12 for the unit we&#x27;d go through it really fast, but you use such a small amount and it is so effective I will pay $12 again for it without a second thought. AWESOME Product and saves my son from embarrassing smell at kindergarten.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I have used it for about 2 years now and it has changed my life (or at least my how I feel about my feet). Zero stink. Ever. I tried following the instructions that said to apply it to clean feet at night, but, like other reviewers, did not find that worked well. For the first week or so, I applied it daily after my shower and before putting on shoes. By the end of that first, maybe, 7-10 days, my feet were completely odor free. Since then, I&#x27;ve applied it roughly every 2-4 days, more frequently if it&#x27;s extra hot or I&#x27;m wearing shoes or doing things that make my feet sweat more. Over time, it seems to eliminate existing odor in shoes. Any shoes that had a little smell in them are now odor free, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect that the people who say it&#x27;s messy are applying too much. It&#x27;s shocking how little you need to use and you really only use it on the ball of the foot. I have used about 1 jar a year. Yes, that&#x27;s correct 1 jar a year. I put a little on my finger (like a grain of rice sized amount), dab it around the ball of my foot, then quickly rub it around. It starts to become less manageable quickly, so I don&#x27;t leave it there for too long. The dabbing helps distribute it across the area, since it&#x27;s less spreadable than some creams. I usually immediately put on shoes, but have not found that the cream transfers to floors or other stuff, I think, because I&#x27;m not using much. It is a little drying, so I occasionally use moisturizer at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You may be thinking - well, clearly this person didn&#x27;t have anything like the ginormous foot odor problem that I have - not true. I could start to funk up a pair of shoes within a couple of weeks no matter what I did (scrubbing feet, putting shoes in the washing machine on hot) and could rarely keep shoes for more than one season. The standard drugstore remedies did nothing for it except add horrible deodorant fragrance into the mix. I&#x27;m sold. Try it, but be patient because you won&#x27;t likely see results immediately.s immediately.</li>
            <li> I only apply this every 3-4 days and have been using it for a year. It doesn&#x27;t affect how sweaty my feet get, unlike the underarm version that does seem to reduce perspiration, but this is a very effective deodorant. It would be nice if the same degree of effectiveness  were available in spray formula, because this sticky paste is more time-consuming to apply, but I will keep using it since it&#x27;s superbly efficient.</li>
            <li> Exactly what we needed for my daughter&#x27;s very stinky feet (poor kid!)  I am amazed that this product works as well as it does - I would highly recommend it to anyone with a foot odor problem.</li>
            <li> If you have sweaty feet nothing helps but aluminum chloride at night/foot powder and good wool socks during the day.  gave it two stars because it could help smelly feet.</li>
            <li> Messy but it works for a few days. Follow package suggestions and use at night or you will have a mess in your shoes.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent when wearing strappy sandals. Your feet  will never hurt. In the summer when you wear close shoes dap a little on your feet to prevent sweat and prevent feet from hurting.</li>
            <li> I really did not like the product, it dried my feet out, it did not accomplish for me what I had hoped that it would. I made a bad choice in purchasing this item.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know what happened but one day I noticed foot odor and it was me.  Washing and using deodorant spray did not work.  In my research I found this product.  I use it once or twice a week and it keeps up with active schedule.  Just between the toes and the ball of the foot is all you need to do.  Been telling all my tennis friends also those with teenagers.</li>
            <li> It is a bit messy, I have to put on socks on nights that I apply it so that the paste doesn&#x27;t rub off onto clothes and upholstery.  I apply it once every 3 showers, but I can squeeze another day in if I need to.  I haven&#x27;t tested it beyond that yet, though I have been using it for at least 3 weeks.  I imagine the container lasting at least a decent amount of time because I don&#x27;t even use a pea-sized amount per foot, and you don&#x27;t spread the paste over the entire bottom of your feet, just a portion.  I apply it to the ball of the foot and the lower underside of my toes.  This definitely saves shoes from being thrown out due to odors, for me being ballet flats that socks won&#x27;t work with.</li>
            <li> Outstanding product. I&#x27;m a woman who has had terribly foot odour since adolescence.  This is the only thing that&#x27;s ever worked, and it was perfect from the first application. It saves me a lot of embarrassment and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product deals with foot odor by stopping it!  I must admit, I&#x27;m surprized at how effective it is.  The cream is thick, so takes just a little longer to rub in but its like giving yourself a foot massage!  It also has a wonderful smell.  I have noted it is not as effective on my Teva-like water sandles that I wear during the day in summer.  The smelly feet odor comes back, but in the sandles, not on my feet.  I think that&#x27;s because the is a soft, rubber like material and the odor has been absorbed.  After one wearing I wash the sandals.  I can&#x27;t wait to get another pair and wear them with the cream.  Buy it-you use hardly any per application and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is truly a small miracle if you want to end embarrassing foot odor forever !  You only need to use the cream very sparingly and it completely stops foot odor.  It is extremely gentle with a light pleasing scent -- nothing harsh to cause a foot rash at all.  I have been using this product for a few years now and it&#x27;s the only deodorant that works for me -- and you don&#x27;t need to use it every day either even after you bathe.  It works for days !  And your shoes, sandals and sneakers will not be stinky and gross anymore.  Fabulous product !</li>
            <li> Amazing how it works!  Was very skeptical, but TOTALLY SURPRISED how well it took away not only the smell of feet but the smell of &amp;#34;rotten shoes&amp;#34; once you start using it - (transferrance?).</li>
            <li> I tried this product given by a girlfriend who had an extra jar.&lt;br /&gt;It works ok for me, it did help with the smell but because my feet just sweat a lot, I guess the bacteria just builds up in the shoes. Because of that, I actually use this product in combination with the WhooHoo-Clean shoes refresher,[[ASIN:B00HZ48T7A Shoes Refresher. Enjoy instant relief! Effectively eliminates embarrassing odors from footwear. 12 FL OZ spray bottle, environmentally friendly. Safe, non toxic, non irritating, won&#x27;t stain. Natural, fresh peppermint scent. Proudly made in the USA. By W...]], and spray that in all my sandals, flip flops, and pumps (high heels).This combination works really well for me. Just one product by itself is not sufficient to keep the smell at bay for a long time.</li>
            <li> This is an Excellent product. It is very effective and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Give it a go!</li>
            <li> This has a strange application instruction with it.  Very specific about which parts of the foot on which to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream is an odd texture.... waxy isn&#x27;t quite the right word but almost.  I think it has to be that way to stay on your feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does fix the foot odor issue for many days and once the cream is on your foot for a few minutes it soaks in and you don&#x27;t feel it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time I&#x27;ve used it and you only use a tiny amount so I think the jar will last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It really did make a difference in my summer sandals!</li>
            <li> Works like a champ when directions are followed.  I recommend shower and wash feet thouroughly before bed put on the cream and then socks.  If there is a knock against the product it might be that feet are a little too dry for a while but it beats them being wet any day.  The smell is gone right away and stays for a considerable time.</li>
            <li> very very bad product it dosnt work even for one day it is money wasting and im not recommend it</li>
            <li> Only foot treatment that took care of both foot odor and cracking.  I have to use it three days a week (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday; the package says that the user can eventually get to a point of applying just once a week, but my feet really, really stink without Lavilin use.)  I&#x27;ve tried quite a few other brands but this is the only one for me that took care of all of the usual problems that feet have (Athlete&#x27;s Foot, cracking, and smell.)  I used to use it along with Awakening HANDS cream (a practice that my wife continues by applying upon feet before bed and sleeping with socks, after I introduced the combo-treatment to her) for soft skin, alternating days of application.  For simplicity (and since I didn&#x27;t care if my feet were &amp;#34;tough&amp;#34;), I found that Lavilin was adequate by itself.  NOTE:  My wife has used this on her hands when cracks appeared upon them -- took care of the cracks within a few days.</li>
            <li> The cream certainly works, but is rather annoying to apply. I don&#x27;t bother using the little plastic spatula - rather, I dip the tip of my finger into the jar and then apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The instructions tell you to rub the cream in, but I find that when I do that, it cakes together and then I need to take more cream out to ensure an even application. Instead, I pat the cream onto my foot and this was definitely better for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a good product. Doesn&#x27;t have an unpleasant scent, and works well at deodorizing and keeping my feet dry. One other thing to note though is that after application it can transfer onto other things (socks, slippers, sheets, etc.) so take note.</li>
            <li> This product is excellent for controlling foot odor.  You only have to apply it once every two to three weeks.  It worked for me!</li>
            <li> This lotion did not work for me. The odor-reduction only lasted about half a day. Did not help with perspiration, although, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s designed to do that... It would have been a nice touch. Putting the lotion on before bed was a pain. It&#x27;s as sticky as tar so you have to get up out of bed to wash your hands after putting it on. And when it&#x27;s on your feet it&#x27;s so greasy that it gets all over the carpet. Just a mess.</li>
            <li> This is only thing that had ever helped my feet it&#x27;s a life saver. Nothing else&#x27;s has ever helped me and I&#x27;ve been fighting foot odor for years</li>
            <li> I think it was a good buy. I use a very, very, very small amount every week (on Sunday night, before sleep) and I forget about my stinky feet during 1 entire week, even if I use a stinky pair of shoes or if I use socks. The only problem is it dryes my feet a little, but it is the little of my problems.</li>
            <li> I was hesitant about the success of this product - but many people suggested it on Reddit so I figured I would give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;I have always had extraordinarily strong foot odor, and it comes up even in winter.&lt;br /&gt;I applied the cream (took about 3 strong applications like the directions say for first use) and it actually works!&lt;br /&gt;You have to keep up with applications, I wouldn&#x27;t say that this lasts 7 days - but I usually wash my feet more often and that could cause me to need to apply it every 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only down side its how badly it drys your feet out, and it does dramatically. So make sure to oscillate between heavy moisturizer and then Lavilin or your skin will start to peel. (this is summer use in a dry climate).</li>
            <li> I was very skeptical about this product because I have tried everything I was able to find to remove the smell from my feet.  I have been to a foot doctor because I could not find anything to help.  It was always so embarrassing when I needed to take off my shoes on any event, in my house if people were there and when I got home my routine was to go straight to tub, take off my shoes and wash my feet.  After I tried this and on the 2nd application I started to notice the difference, I thought it was some shoes that I have but I have been able to wear them again after using this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try this if you have really smelly feet, this is a life changer for me.</li>
            <li> I tried the underarm Lavilin which I was very impressed with so I decided to try the foot stuff.  Now, my husband (and son) have extremely stinky feet.  They both work out extensively and their work-out shoes were banned from the house.  There were times I asked my husband to wash his feet before getting into bed!!  This stuff is magic.  He uses it once a week and his feet are completely odor free. We don&#x27;t have to flee the room when the shoes come off! I probably couldn&#x27;t identify his socks in a blind smell test! (Not that I would ever risk it.) We will never be without this product.  Thank you Lavilin!</li>
            <li> I have spent a ton of money on foot products trying to eliminate foot odor.  The only other product I have found that works is On Your Toes, however the powder is messy and obvious when I take my shoes off.  I was about to go on a work trip with others from work and was mortified about having to take my high heels off in front of coworkers at the airport for fear of foot odor.  I decided to take the plunge and give this a shot because of the great reviews.  This was AMAZING!  I paid extra to receive this shipment the day before my trip.  I used it the night before my trip, rubbing the cream in on the bottom of my feet (mostly around the ball of my foot and between my toes).  I did cover the entire bottom of my foot because i was desperate that this work.  I slept that night with socks on.  The next morning I could still see the product on the bottom of my feet, which I expected as others said this helps eliminate smell in current shoes.  I did use my On Your Toes product in my shoes in the night before (again I was desperate).  Between these two products I had ABSOLUTELY no smell.  The test was walking around in my heels all day and even that night.  Still no smell.  I used the product again the next night since I knew I&#x27;d be wearing a different pair of heels the next day from 6am until my flight back home at 8pm.  Again, I was amazed because there was absolutely no smell!!  I&#x27;ve only had this product for a few days, but I have had NO odor.  I cannot believe it worked immediately and even in shoes that were already a bit funky.  Like others have said, this does not stop your feet from sweaty, but it does eliminate the smell.  THIS IS A KEEPER!</li>
            <li> This is a great product and works really well. My work shoes no longer smell bad even though I do not wear socks.</li>
            <li> First of all, i am a woman and people don&#x27;t generally view our gender to have any kind of odor problem, especially feet. i don&#x27;t remember exactly when my problem started but i know i was around 10. when i am wearing socks only no shoes, i am perfectly fine. its when i wore shoes that i had the problem. my feet would sweat and that in turn caused the odor. i could sometimes smell it through the shoes. it was even more embarrassing because neither my dad or brother had that problem. they would always describe my foot odor like cheetoes or stinky cheese. i would use foot sprays, lysol, perfume, lotion.... anything to mask the smel but it would just end up smelling like deodorant and cheese. one morning while i was getting ready for work, i was putting on lotion on my feet (cause face it, when you ar desperate, something is better than nothing) i thought: &#x27;there has got to be something out there. hand lotion is not for feet. i wonder if there is something out there, some lotion for feet&#x27; so i did some google searching and came across lavilin. i read the rewiews and they all sounded great so what did i have to lose right? i had lots of hope so i ordered. as soon as i got it, i tested it out that night before bed but i knew the real test would come once i put on my shoes. almost all of them made my feet smell. i have to say, as of now, my feet have not smelled at all! i read that others still had sweaty feet but with no odor. i have always has sweaty feet and so far, they have been dry and comfy, no smell. the consistency is similar to toothpaste but once you rub it in, it blends in with no trouble. there virtually no scent, just a tiny hint of it. you do not need to apply that much so a little goes a long way. compared to what i have spent before on so many over the counter products, $13.00 is nothing and a price i would pay over and over in a heartbeat to keep my feet odor free. only people who have gone through horrible foot odor know what a relief it is to finally find something that stops. there are more women than you think suffering through this. i am currently rotating my shoes while wearing lavilin and so far, so good! thank you for a wonderful product! i will order again.d something that stops. there are more women than you think suffering through this. i am currently rotating my shoes while wearing lavilin and so far, so good! thank you for a wonderful product! i will order again.</li>
            <li> I love this! I purchased this about 4 months ago.  Used it as soon as it came in the mail.  Worked great right away.  But about 2-3 wks later I needed to reapply. I just felt that my feet were getting sweaty again.  Since then... I haven&#x27;t had to use it again.  I am so happy I found this product. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am being generous and giving it two stars</li>
            <li> I bought this product based on the description and also the reviews here. It was great for the first few days. I applied it every morning before going to work. 100% no stinky foot. However I think I&#x27;m allergic to this product. A week after continuous use, the surface of my toes became very dry and itchy. Its so itchy that it hurts. Therefore, my search for a foot deodorant continues...</li>
            <li> I picked up a few samples at a trade show in March and this product absolutely works. I&#x27;ve always had a problem with this and nothing really seemed to fix this. I am a very satisfied customer and will continue to purchase!!!:)</li>
            <li> Works for me.&lt;br /&gt;To small but this is manufacture problem.</li>
            <li> Like most of the reviews here, I tried a number of creams, lotions..etc over the years and nothing really worked. Then I found this Lavilin cream and decided to give it a try based on these reviews.  After trying it for a couple days, it seemed like all the rest and I stopped using it. I decided to give it another try and stayed with it for at least a week or so and sure enough, this started to work for me. This really did help to keep my feet dry and now I only need to use it a couple days a week, not even every day, so this has been great.</li>
            <li> Been using it for years</li>
            <li> This stuff really works.  A little bit on foot pad at the base of your toes every 5-7 days and no more smelly toes.</li>
            <li> This really works...for some reason my feet started sweating a lot and would make my fleece lined shoes/boots get an odor...this stopped the problem</li>
            <li> Seems to work mildly, but not 100% effective. I need to experiment with other solutions. Also, kind of annoying to apply.</li>
            <li> Hey it really works, I first gave this two stars because I have not use it yet ,but it works.</li>
            <li> Got smelly feet ? Buy this and never smell again great product !!!  I use it twice a week just a small amount between my toes and sorts out years of smelly feet which used to ruin my footwear it was so bad</li>
            <li> My toddler boy has some nasty smelling feet in the summer. This really cleared it up using it about every other day. Great product.</li>
            <li> I had to make this correction and give this product 5 stars had the product since May 2013 and somehow have made it last between myself and my two kids its now November 7, 2013, its at the bottom of the barrel so to speak, I would buy this product again. It last for days on your feet (a little goes a long way)and take stinky smells out of your shoes too. Best product for foot stink I have ever found.</li>
            <li> If you have sweaty feet there is nothing on the market better than Lavilin. I&#x27;ve tried everything and this stuff is the only product that actually works. This product WORKS!  I&#x27;ve tried them all and nothing comes close to this stuff. My feet use to sweat and smell. Not anymore! I have Lavilin on auto refill in my cart. Try it you wont be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Rely on this cream weekly as a regimen to prevent long days in my shoes and boots in the winter.  Swear by this product for keeping my toes and feet clean, dry, and smelling fresh. Have bought this product for over five years through Amazon and any other place I can buy it in stock.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my daughter&#x27;s stinky feet.  I applied as directed and it did work.....for a day.  Most of the reviews and even the product information says one application should work for up to 7 days.  We couldn&#x27;t get two days out of it.  I have since discoverd that a vitamin deficiency can cause feet to stink and we are trying a different approach.  If you are desperate it is worth a try but it may not last as long as it says.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I wear heels to work daily and me feet sometimes sweet. I use no show high heel socks but they don&#x27;t absorb sweat like normal cotton socks. I found this product on Amazon and decided to give it a try after reading the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it about twice a week. It&#x27;s very thick and reminds me of clay. It will leave marks on your sheets if you don&#x27;t wear socks but that comes out in the wash. The next day I had no foot odor, yes my feet were still moist but they had NO odor. The effects last for days which is why I only use it twice a week. I&#x27;ve ordered this product twice.</li>
            <li> My daughter has the smelliest feet ever! I put a small amount on her feet after a bath and they don&#x27;t smell. This doesn&#x27;t have to be used every time, only 1 or 2 times per week.</li>
            <li> If you want this to go on better, use it mixed with a little moisturizer - otherwise it cakes up and doesn&#x27;t rub in well.</li>
            <li> Been using this for almost two weeks and its nowhere near as effective as advertised for me. When I finish it will be going back to old deodorants.</li>
            <li> Emits a strange odor of it&#x27;s own after using for a few days. Didn&#x27;t work for me...I even tried using it for many days straight, still didn;t work and the &amp;#34;strange&amp;#34; odor only got stronger. Foot Fresh cream from Canada works much better.</li>
            <li> been buying this for years, the zinc in the product is the key! works great ! lasts a long time, only takes a very small amount</li>
            <li> So far so good.  I bought this to help alleviate stink and sweating and so far it&#x27;s working well.  I gave it 4 stars because I don&#x27;t like the way you need to apply this cream.  I wish they could make this into a roll on form.  Other than that it&#x27;s working very well.</li>
            <li> its really thick and doesn&#x27;t really have a pleasurable smell to it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ill try something else next time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe lavilin will make a better product next time ;)</li>
            <li> This best thing we have ever found to help with foot problems.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the other products out there.  This one works!</li>
            <li> THIS CREAM DEODORANT IS FABULOUS. I USE IT ONCE A WEEK AND THAT ENOUGH.&lt;br /&gt;WOULD RECOMMEND TO ANYONE WHO HAS BAD FOOT ODER.</li>
            <li> Best product on the market and should be sold in buckets not two ounce containers!!!! It really does work the first time it is used. The only product that can preform to the highest standards. I have been in search of a product that will stop foot odor 15 years and this is the only product that worked the first time! I have tried sprays and cleaners for my feet but nothing had work; i have spent close to one thousand dollars in the last 15 years and all for nothing. This will work!!! You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Summer brings on the sweaty days and I prefer wearing closed-toe shoes to the office - this doesn&#x27;t make my feet very happy. No matter what I do and however much I wash, there always seem to be a case of the stinky feet at the end of the day. I received this product the other day after reading all the positive reviews and let me say WOW!! It really does work - the cream is THICK and applies on white, it makes me think of sunscreen and after seeing Zinc Oxide in the ingredients list, turns out I was correct!! So this cream must work by providing a physical barrier so that the stink doesn&#x27;t escape from your pores. After 5-10 minutes of application, the whiteness did go away and you are left with no evidence of having applied the cream aside from not smelling your feet anymore. It does get a little sticky when I was on hardwood floor but that went away quickly. It claims to prevent odor for 7 days but I think applying this every other day should be sufficient. I have also started wearing flip-flops on my way to (and home) from work to let my feet breathe as well as washing my insoles regularly. Thanks Lavilin, for a product that actually works!</li>
            <li> I can wear flat w/o sock and my feet have no odor! There&#x27;s no scent to them, they are just normal, clean feet now. No more powders or little nylon bootie things. Yay!</li>
            <li> Great just like the underarm product.</li>
            <li> My tennis shoes are the ultimate testing site for any deoderant product.  I noticed with the very first application that my gym sock didn&#x27;t smell after a hard workout.  I use to hate to remove my leather work boots after working all day.  Now there is never an odor - even after wearing rubber boots in 90 degree heat all day and my socks are completely drenched - this product really works for me.</li>
            <li> The products is really impressive. It is a personal preference that I find the thickness of the cream odd on my feet. It does absorb but it is something that I am not used to. I do plan to suck it up and use it over the fall and winter when I confine my feet to socks.</li>
            <li> I tried the regular Lavillin deodorant for under the arms and it didn&#x27;t work for me, but this foot cream has really helped.  It eliminates most of the sweat and odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a bit messy to apply, which is the reason that I knocked off one star.  You put a small amount on a spatula that comes with it, and then use your fingers to wipe it off the spatula and to spread it onto your feet.  The cream is so thick that it doesn&#x27;t want to wash off your hands very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The true test of this for me will be this summer, when the weather heats up.  I&#x27;ll be sure to update my review then, but, in the meantime, this really is helping me.</li>
            <li> This is a MUST when I go to the gym! I also use it when I wear my more expensive shoes, to preserve them... the product is great, but I wish the jar would contain more of it.</li>
            <li> Great product. I was skeptical but it works.  It&#x27;s a tiny tub of cream, but it lasts months.  I have used it for several years and I&#x27;m sure I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have tosay is the best solution so far, it last me odorless free for about 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try it is good.</li>
            <li> My feet always stinked from a child to adulthood. One Day an add was in the local paper about feet issues with free appointment. I decided to take advantage.By now I had 2 teen age children and my family hated when I took off my shoes and would tell Mom your feet stink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This appointment: told me it was a fungus that I had since a child.My parents would never had taken me to the doctor for stinky feet, unheard of. This doctor examine my feet and I purchase 2 creams and since that date given out as a GIFT to others who complained about stinky feet since the 80&#x27;s. My daughter found on Amazon this was still available in new box. So if you have this problem buy it and follow instructions .&lt;br /&gt;Ann</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years because I wear shoes for up to 18 hours a day at times. There are never any surprises when I take my shoes off when I&#x27;m doing a demonstration while teaching a Reiki or Spiritual Class.  At times certain materials can react with my feet as well as stress or health issues that I have had.  This product is a gem and the best around.  A little dab on each foot after your shower will do yah for several days or up to one week. At first I use it every few days when I get it then once a week. Even though I ran out of the cream for about a month now, I didn&#x27;t notice any changes with my feet.. but I don&#x27;t want to either so I have reordered the product.  The cream is extremely thick and will last you for a long time.  I think I ordered two jars last year!  One of my all time favorite products on the market that gives you extra confidence when working with people.</li>
            <li> It really works good!</li>
            <li> Seems to work.  For that I am gratefull.  However I don&#x27;t like the small amount or the delivery vehicle.  This is thick like toothpaste.  It would be better in a shaving cream or toothpaste tube.  Squeeze out what you need and cap it.  Also you should get more for your money. This does not last very long.</li>
            <li> Unbelievably helpful!</li>
            <li> Works really good .. But kinda messy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a miracle, and it works.  It will eliminate &amp;#34;stinky feet syndrome&amp;#34; on the first application, and by holding the bacteria balance on your feet right, it even makes old shoes smell fresh again as you wear them.</li>
            <li> My feet smell terribly. Really terribly. To the extent that I can smell them through leather shoes... This stuff seems to work - for about a week, as advertised (and even then, my feet aren&#x27;t nearly as stinky as they were). Nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried seems to work as well as this cream.</li>
