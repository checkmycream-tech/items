            <li> Great product and service!</li>
            <li> Good little jar, but a bit pricey in my opinion.  I use this to put homemade body butter in.  Looks cute, no problems with leaking.  I wish there was an option for a metal lid though.</li>
            <li> These are great for making my DMSO and essential oil blends for pain/inflammation/scar tissue for my own use.  I like that the cover is white so I can write on it with sharpie.  I also use filled with rice to hold our essential oil capsules upright for several days so they don&#x27;t leak or dissolve and I can make a head of time.  The lids screw on and fit tightly and are quality material and threading.  Amber is the only color for storing essential oils and glass is the only material to store DMSO or essential oils in.  These are about the size of the middle size baby food glass jars but with superior lids that stay on.  I can fit my fingers in easily to retrieve a capsule or creams.</li>
            <li> very good .chipping was very fast they amber jars r just great .i would order from this company again :thank you</li>

            <li> The Jars are a perfect size</li>
            <li> I bought these for my mother. She makes wonderful ointments and creams from natural organic products, and needed good containers for them. These work great for that purpose, as well as storage for herbs ect. She&#x27;s already used the 12 I bought her, so I will be buying more for her soon.</li>
            <li> Perfect size, not too small or big. Needed a jar with wide opening and shade out light and this does it.</li>
            <li> Two bottles were broken, and too much glass to safely return.  I&#x27;m not paying for return shipping, nor placing anyone else at risk of getting cut.</li>
            <li> These are GREAT - I will buy them again when I need some.</li>
            <li> They are nice quality jars. They close well</li>
            <li> I like the quality of the product, but it says 6 count and the company only sent 1 jar. 1 Jar is not worth the price.</li>
            <li> great quality, works perfect</li>
            <li> Loved the jar for my homemade stuff.  Only gave 4 stars bc it was pricey. Wished it was cheaper.</li>
            <li> Great size for my all my DIY Essential Oil products.</li>
