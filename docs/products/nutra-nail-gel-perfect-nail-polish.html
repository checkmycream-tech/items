    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>The shine is awesome    </li>
            <li>I invested in Gelish products now and that stuff is awesome</li>
            <li>, my nails look perfect, I thought this was a cheaper alternative</li>
            <li>Practice does make perfect!  </li>
            <li>Soaking cotton balls in polish remover and leaving them on the nails to soften the gel polish is the best way to get it off.</li>
            <li>they are shiny and beautiful until it grows out.</li>
            <li>Looks great for about two to three days and then begins to crack and chip.  </li>
            <li>Looks great though.</li>
            <li>BETTER YET OVER NIGHT!!</li>
            <li>I applied it just as the instructions said--and my nails looked good for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>This product looks good on your nails for about a day</li>
            <li>It is a good start to the product.</li>
            <li>I followed the instructions to the letter and loved the immediate results.  </li>
            <li>I had good results.</li>
            <li>Iwas so happy I was going to buy more colors..</li>
            <li>i liked it, may try just the gel harderner</li>
            <li>so i can use my own colors</li>
            <li>and I liked the results.</li>
            <li>and it won&#x27;t look like a nice salon gel manicure.</li>
            <li>How I honestly rate this product is -5 stars.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve done every kind of nail gel with the lamps...</li>
            <li>so it is great for a quick touch up.  </li>
            <li>This worked great initially, but I got cracks in it all over the nail which didn&#x27;t look so great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen this product get pretty not so great reviews.</li>
            <li>but I never really expected that it was going to be perfect.</li>
            <li>A  good steady hand and the ability to work quickly are a must!!!  </li>
            <li>Within 2 hours, every nail was chipped at the top.</li>
            <li>All in all its ok..</li>
            <li>I removed it and applied it again as the instructions stated &amp; am still seeing chipping, more every day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried adding additional coats and that seems to make the polish more brittle.  </li>
            <li>The hassle would be worth it IF the polish lasts but it chips sooner than my good quality polish.</li>
            <li>Many nail product manufacturers are now branding their polishes/laquers as gels.  </li>
            <li>They still look shiny and chip free!  </li>
            <li>It took more like 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love it for that purpose.</li>
            <li>They just have to add more colors.</li>
            <li>Love this product, you will too.</li>
            <li>But still, the one week is longer than most nail polish</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure that could cause problems if any gets on the nail bed.   </li>
            <li>If it does last I will be so happy to have found this product!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ll be buying more colors as soon as they bring out some more flattering colors:)</li>
            <li>On top of how great it looked, it stayed intact for 2-3 weeks and was removed because her nails grew out too much.</li>
            <li>I can imagine darker colors would go on noticeably streaky, but the shear color was ok.</li>
            <li>And again, a darker color would be more noticeable and problematic.</li>
            <li>It is very easy to remove, if you follow the directions, which is a huge plus.</li>
            <li>I assume this is why they sale their own special remover (I compared ingredients &amp;</li>
            <li>I got this in \\&quot;Cha-Cha\\&quot; (not off amazon) and as a nail polish junkie, I was sooo excited to try it!</li>
            <li>Nutra Nail Gel Perfect is is very different than the UV free products introduced by Revlon and Sally Hanson.  </li>
            <li>I also tried Perfect Formula&#x27;s pink gel coat at $30 for .60 oz.</li>
            <li>I am glad I gave this product a second try as I was not all that impressed the first time I used it.  </li>
            <li>Love Nutra nail and was excited to find this on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>This was easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Easy to apply.</li>
            <li>How easy this product is to use.</li>
            <li>I read and reread the directions and watched their YouTube video that shows just how easy it is.</li>
            <li>a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;The polish will crack after a day or two.</li>
            <li>An experienced nail technician recommended NutraNail&#x27;s gel perfect when I asked her about affordable \\&quot;gel\\&quot; nails that can be done at home without investing in an expensive UV light and kit.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;It is fine if your not like me and don&#x27;t scratch off nail polish.</li>
            <li>activator smells like super glue, and the color is so streaky!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m also 99.99999% sure that it is, indeed, super</li>
            <li>I experienced chipping 2-3 days later      </li>
            <li>NutraNail&#x27;s Gel Perfect takes a few minutes to remove by soaking nails in any acetone based nail polish remover.</li>
            <li>Great if you are in a rush and don&#x27;t have time to get to a salon but don&#x27;t expect it to last like a salon gel manicure.</li>
            <li>and I thought it looked fantastic.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m too cheap to spend $50 on the starter kit for at-home gel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s old and no longer really good, don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li>I was so impressed with the ease of application, the drying process and the overall look that I came online to buy more in a different color.</li>
            <li>got this and tried it, looks great and lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li>and they want a receipt and original box.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to find a non-lamp gel</li>
            <li>First of all, the product has a strong, noxious odor and chips easily.</li>
            <li>Easy application (if you are real fast at doing things) looks beautiful,hard and shiny  </li>
            <li>Got it fast, love this product</li>
            <li>I just applied it for the first time and it was quick and easy.</li>
            <li>I have had great luck with Shellac &amp; other gel manicures</li>
            <li>The activator is super glue.</li>
            <li>The activator coat is basically like super glue.  </li>
            <li>It smells like super glue, looks like super glue, and acts like super glue.</li>
            <li>Even with 3 color coats, it still turned out super streaky.</li>
            <li>It did dry very quickly, but it is not as shiny as I would have liked.</li>
            <li>I was really excited about this after I put it on for the first time.  </li>
            <li>Regular polish is much better (and easier to get off!)</li>
            <li>I followed the directions exactly!  </li>
            <li>It really works!!  </li>
            <li>exactly as if I got it at a nail salon!</li>
            <li>It looked great, dried as promised and seemed to be as sturdy as the gel manicures I&#x27;ve gotten in the salons.  </li>
            <li>I have paid top dollar for these shellac manicures in the past and I love them!  </li>
            <li>I even compared the ingredients and it pretty much is super glue.</li>
            <li>The only thing good was that it looked good for the whole hour and a half it lasted.</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t set right.</li>
            <li>, right?</li>
            <li>Tacky isn&#x27;t the right word.</li>
            <li>It was so easy and looked like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li>I will probably buy this again as it does last much longer than regular polish and is a good cheap alternative to the salon.</li>
            <li>Once you begin application, you do have to work quickly and have a steady hand, otherwise the product will look streaky.  </li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize you needed two coats at first</li>
            <li>At first look at the instructions</li>
            <li>Should have read reviews first.</li>
            <li>However, over the course of 3 days, I had more naked nail showing than polished nail.</li>
            <li>If you are willing to risk your lungs, it chipped in 2 days.  </li>
            <li>I really love the lasting power of gel nail polish but between the price and the damage to my nails from gel polish at salons, I saw this and decided to try it.   </li>
            <li>So after you polish the top, then take your brush and polish over the entire edge of your nail with all applications.  </li>
            <li>I would have had better results if I had just used regular nail</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s exactly what the &amp;#34;activator&amp;#34; is.</li>
            <li>Also, I would note that if you accidently get the Activator or Polish on your skin, you&#x27;re pretty much screwed.  </li>
            <li>Fourth, it chips easily (after 15-20 minute set) which then lead me to scratch it off.</li>
            <li>First, the activator is legitimately crazy glue, which is not the best thing to put on your nails.</li>
            <li>The only reason it gets one star is because it was easy to get off.  </li>
            <li>For the first time in my life, my nails are actually growing out beautifully without the usual breakage and spliting.    </li>
            <li>It&#x27;ll take off the first layer of the nail as well, so forget applying any other polish over the top of your nails.</li>
            <li>I had also bought the removal product, which worked just fine, but who wants to learn that lesson the very next day?</li>
            <li>When painting your nails with super glue, the polish doesn&#x27;t hold up very long and it won&#x27;t look like a nice salon gel manicure.hold up very long</li>
            <li>The cost is reasonable    </li>
            <li>My nails are very flexible and if they bend, the polish cracks and starts to chip off.  </li>
            <li>If you have ever had a real gel manicure do not be fooled.  </li>
            <li>It also was very shiny.</li>
            <li>Very embarrassing to have to go to school like that.  </li>
            <li>The activator just has an additional ingredient that makes it capable of being painted on one&#x27;s nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li>Application is quick &amp; pretty simple    </li>
            <li>It was easy enough to apply and two sets of instructions are provided (quick start and regular).</li>
            <li>/&gt;(The gel nail polish may appear thick and strong but it chips and comes of soooo easily)</li>
            <li>The first application lasted one week, far shorter than the 2 weeks that&#x27;s listed on the packaging.</li>
            <li>It does dry pretty quick though,</li>
            <li>I hope they make a hundred new colors!  </li>
            <li>Coulda paid 5x less for a better polish.</li>
            <li>The application could be more simple with bigger bottles    </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t wear bright green or blue to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was mainly hoping for a manicure that would last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>&quot; That&#x27;s right, after every 5 nails you are instructed to put the used brush in a solution to soak, as you take the already soaked brush out of the solution and continue.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, after scrubbing the same nail for 20 minutes with pure acetone, not even a dot came off.</li>
            <li>The only thing I&#x27;m glad about is that I didn&#x27;t select one of the deeper, more vibrant colors--because my nails would have instantly looked a HOT MESS!!</li>
            <li>So glad I got this on sale and didn&#x27;t waste a ton of $ on it.</li>
            <li>My package even had a $1.00 off coupon, but I won&#x27;t even waste more money.</li>
            <li>I am sure a few brain cells died during this process.  </li>
            <li>When I get my Shellac manicures, she told me that if you don&#x27;t polish the tip/edge of each nail (the part you would normally file with a nail file) then they will chip.  </li>
            <li>I put this gel perfect on today and had the same results at home for less than half the price!!  </li>
            <li>first impression when applying the activator is that I was painting my nails with slightly thinned super glue.</li>
            <li>Since it is so hard it chips very easily.  </li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t even get much of a sheer pink color no matter how many coats I applied.</li>
            <li>They did dry quickly, which is a plus.</li>
            <li>But I persisted... there are 5 steps, but it does dry quickly and the color I used was sheer pink, which actually looked nice.</li>
            <li>DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li>Well back to the review, first off, you have to follow the directions to the letter or they will come out</li>
            <li>I did my nails before I went to bed; when I took a shower the next morning, the first nail chipped.</li>
            <li>Let&#x27;s not fail to mention the constant \\&quot;gel-polish brush cleaning.\\</li>
            <li>The polish did not dry and was very tacky.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;Buyers OUTRAGE &amp; ANGER\\&quot; is just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the Activator coat smells like super glue and the actual Gel-Polish bottle is TINY.</li>
            <li>My sheer pink nails took about 12-15 minutes before they dried to a rock solid state vs. the advertised 5 minutes and they still have a patent high shine finish and look great even after 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Much to my dismay I woke up two days later</li>
            <li>I had my doubts but it really is rock solid and looks</li>
            <li>It did not make them weaker but I have naturally flexible nails and even though the gel polish maDe them feel stronger they are not.</li>
            <li>I purchased this product at big lots for $3.50 and that was still too much.</li>
            <li>but here I am on day 3 after applying it and it is already nearly completely chipped off.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s basically just acetone).&lt;br /&gt;Third, it did look shiny, not shiny enough to pass as a real Gel job.</li>
            <li>By my color being the sheer pink, it was not quite as noticeable right a way, but if you looked at my hands for 20 seconds it was very apparent, I had a very &amp;#34;jacked up&amp;#34; manicure.</li>
            <li>I used the pink, I will be ordering other colors to try them out, so excited!</li>
            <li>Not to mention that it&#x27;s a major pain trying to remove this from your nails!</li>
            <li>This works better than plain polish alone but definitely not the same as gel polish.</li>
            <li>I really wanted the reviews to be wrong because I was so pleased with how my nails looked immediately after the application.</li>
            <li>Run the other way, far away..and run FAST.</li>
            <li>Nail line is still completely visible which is a big turn off for me.</li>
            <li>The shine is nice, the nails feel hard, but TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li>Third, it doesn&#x27;t dry in five minutes completely; it sets in 15 minutes completely</li>
            <li>It does not dry in 5 minutes as advertised.</li>
            <li>Which for me is not long at all!</li>
            <li>And finally, the colors are far to limited.</li>
            <li>This really helps me with my constant splitting nail that has been splitting since I was a little kid.</li>

            <li> I read and reread the directions and watched their YouTube video that shows just how easy it is.</li>
            <li> a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;The polish will crack after a day or two.</li>
            <li> An experienced nail technician recommended NutraNail&#x27;s gel perfect when I asked her about affordable \\&quot;gel\\&quot; nails that can be done at home without investing in an expensive UV light and kit.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It is fine if your not like me and don&#x27;t scratch off nail polish.</li>
            <li> activator smells like super glue, and the color is so streaky!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m also 99.99999% sure that it is, indeed, super</li>
            <li> I experienced chipping 2-3 days later      </li>
            <li> NutraNail&#x27;s Gel Perfect takes a few minutes to remove by soaking nails in any acetone based nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> Great if you are in a rush and don&#x27;t have time to get to a salon but don&#x27;t expect it to last like a salon gel manicure.</li>
            <li> and I thought it looked fantastic.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m too cheap to spend $50 on the starter kit for at-home gel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s old and no longer really good, don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> I was so impressed with the ease of application, the drying process and the overall look that I came online to buy more in a different color.</li>
            <li> got this and tried it, looks great and lasted a long time.  </li>
            <li> and they want a receipt and original box.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to find a non-lamp gel</li>
            <li> First of all, the product has a strong, noxious odor and chips easily.</li>
            <li> Easy application (if you are real fast at doing things) looks beautiful,hard and shiny  </li>
            <li> Got it fast, love this product</li>
            <li> I just applied it for the first time and it was quick and easy.</li>
            <li> I have had great luck with Shellac &amp; other gel manicures</li>
            <li> The activator is super glue.</li>
            <li> The activator coat is basically like super glue.  </li>
            <li> It smells like super glue, looks like super glue, and acts like super glue.</li>
            <li> Even with 3 color coats, it still turned out super streaky.</li>
            <li> It did dry very quickly, but it is not as shiny as I would have liked.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this after I put it on for the first time.  </li>
            <li> Regular polish is much better (and easier to get off!)</li>
            <li> I followed the directions exactly!  </li>
            <li> It really works!!  </li>
            <li> exactly as if I got it at a nail salon!</li>
            <li> It looked great, dried as promised and seemed to be as sturdy as the gel manicures I&#x27;ve gotten in the salons.  </li>
            <li> I have paid top dollar for these shellac manicures in the past and I love them!  </li>
            <li> I even compared the ingredients and it pretty much is super glue.</li>
            <li> The only thing good was that it looked good for the whole hour and a half it lasted.</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t set right.</li>
            <li> , right?</li>
            <li> Tacky isn&#x27;t the right word.</li>
            <li> It was so easy and looked like a professional manicure.</li>
            <li> I will probably buy this again as it does last much longer than regular polish and is a good cheap alternative to the salon.</li>
            <li> Once you begin application, you do have to work quickly and have a steady hand, otherwise the product will look streaky.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t realize you needed two coats at first</li>
            <li> At first look at the instructions</li>
            <li> Should have read reviews first.</li>
            <li> However, over the course of 3 days, I had more naked nail showing than polished nail.</li>
            <li> If you are willing to risk your lungs, it chipped in 2 days.  </li>
            <li> I really love the lasting power of gel nail polish but between the price and the damage to my nails from gel polish at salons, I saw this and decided to try it.   </li>
            <li> So after you polish the top, then take your brush and polish over the entire edge of your nail with all applications.  </li>
            <li> I would have had better results if I had just used regular nail</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s exactly what the &amp;#34;activator&amp;#34; is.</li>
            <li> Also, I would note that if you accidently get the Activator or Polish on your skin, you&#x27;re pretty much screwed.  </li>
            <li> Fourth, it chips easily (after 15-20 minute set) which then lead me to scratch it off.</li>
            <li> First, the activator is legitimately crazy glue, which is not the best thing to put on your nails.</li>
            <li> The only reason it gets one star is because it was easy to get off.  </li>
            <li> For the first time in my life, my nails are actually growing out beautifully without the usual breakage and spliting.    </li>
            <li> It&#x27;ll take off the first layer of the nail as well, so forget applying any other polish over the top of your nails.</li>
            <li> I had also bought the removal product, which worked just fine, but who wants to learn that lesson the very next day?</li>
            <li> When painting your nails with super glue, the polish doesn&#x27;t hold up very long and it won&#x27;t look like a nice salon gel manicure.hold up very long</li>
            <li> The cost is reasonable    </li>
            <li> My nails are very flexible and if they bend, the polish cracks and starts to chip off.  </li>
            <li> If you have ever had a real gel manicure do not be fooled.  </li>
            <li> It also was very shiny.</li>
            <li> Very embarrassing to have to go to school like that.  </li>
            <li> The activator just has an additional ingredient that makes it capable of being painted on one&#x27;s nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!</li>
            <li> Application is quick &amp; pretty simple    </li>
            <li> It was easy enough to apply and two sets of instructions are provided (quick start and regular).</li>
            <li> /&gt;(The gel nail polish may appear thick and strong but it chips and comes of soooo easily)</li>
            <li> The first application lasted one week, far shorter than the 2 weeks that&#x27;s listed on the packaging.</li>
            <li> It does dry pretty quick though,</li>
            <li> I hope they make a hundred new colors!  </li>
            <li> Coulda paid 5x less for a better polish.</li>
            <li> The application could be more simple with bigger bottles    </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wear bright green or blue to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was mainly hoping for a manicure that would last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> &quot; That&#x27;s right, after every 5 nails you are instructed to put the used brush in a solution to soak, as you take the already soaked brush out of the solution and continue.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, after scrubbing the same nail for 20 minutes with pure acetone, not even a dot came off.</li>
            <li> The only thing I&#x27;m glad about is that I didn&#x27;t select one of the deeper, more vibrant colors--because my nails would have instantly looked a HOT MESS!!</li>
            <li> So glad I got this on sale and didn&#x27;t waste a ton of $ on it.</li>
            <li> My package even had a $1.00 off coupon, but I won&#x27;t even waste more money.</li>
            <li> I am sure a few brain cells died during this process.  </li>
            <li> When I get my Shellac manicures, she told me that if you don&#x27;t polish the tip/edge of each nail (the part you would normally file with a nail file) then they will chip.  </li>
            <li> I put this gel perfect on today and had the same results at home for less than half the price!!  </li>
            <li> first impression when applying the activator is that I was painting my nails with slightly thinned super glue.</li>
            <li> Since it is so hard it chips very easily.  </li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t even get much of a sheer pink color no matter how many coats I applied.</li>
            <li> They did dry quickly, which is a plus.</li>
            <li> But I persisted... there are 5 steps, but it does dry quickly and the color I used was sheer pink, which actually looked nice.</li>
            <li> DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> Well back to the review, first off, you have to follow the directions to the letter or they will come out</li>
            <li> I did my nails before I went to bed; when I took a shower the next morning, the first nail chipped.</li>
            <li> Let&#x27;s not fail to mention the constant \\&quot;gel-polish brush cleaning.\\</li>
            <li> The polish did not dry and was very tacky.</li>
            <li> \\&quot;Buyers OUTRAGE &amp; ANGER\\&quot; is just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the Activator coat smells like super glue and the actual Gel-Polish bottle is TINY.</li>
            <li> My sheer pink nails took about 12-15 minutes before they dried to a rock solid state vs. the advertised 5 minutes and they still have a patent high shine finish and look great even after 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Much to my dismay I woke up two days later</li>
            <li> I had my doubts but it really is rock solid and looks</li>
            <li> It did not make them weaker but I have naturally flexible nails and even though the gel polish maDe them feel stronger they are not.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at big lots for $3.50 and that was still too much.</li>
            <li> but here I am on day 3 after applying it and it is already nearly completely chipped off.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s basically just acetone).&lt;br /&gt;Third, it did look shiny, not shiny enough to pass as a real Gel job.</li>
            <li> By my color being the sheer pink, it was not quite as noticeable right a way, but if you looked at my hands for 20 seconds it was very apparent, I had a very &amp;#34;jacked up&amp;#34; manicure.</li>
            <li> I used the pink, I will be ordering other colors to try them out, so excited!</li>
            <li> Not to mention that it&#x27;s a major pain trying to remove this from your nails!</li>
            <li> This works better than plain polish alone but definitely not the same as gel polish.</li>
            <li> I really wanted the reviews to be wrong because I was so pleased with how my nails looked immediately after the application.</li>
            <li> Run the other way, far away..and run FAST.</li>
            <li> Nail line is still completely visible which is a big turn off for me.</li>
            <li> The shine is nice, the nails feel hard, but TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> Third, it doesn&#x27;t dry in five minutes completely; it sets in 15 minutes completely</li>
            <li> It does not dry in 5 minutes as advertised.</li>
            <li> Which for me is not long at all!</li>
            <li> And finally, the colors are far to limited.</li>
            <li> This really helps me with my constant splitting nail that has been splitting since I was a little kid.</li>
            <li> I thought that sheer pink that this came with was very light and tired an Essie pink instead.</li>
            <li> ugly.was surprised at how fast they dried, mine was less than 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s about how long the color will last on your nails--5 minutes!!</li>
            <li> 3 different shades of pink and only 1 red?</li>
            <li> Polish acted like it was old with uneven streaks, spots without color, just an all-around waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do wonder if it will damage my nails over the long run because the salon gel system definitely damages my nails because of the buffing they do.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would last as long as the gel stuff you get at the salon, but did not.  </li>
            <li> --my nails usually stay perfect for at least 2 weeks, so this is a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> but it does get it hard enough to were you can put on your shoes or grab your keys without too much smudging.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m much angrier about the 10 dollars I wasted on this than the 60 I spent on gelish supplies.</li>
            <li> Second, the color of sheer pink was far to pale.</li>
            <li> However, once it dried, I was removing the super glue-like activator from my skin because it was very messy and it is difficult to get it only on the nail, with the added pressure of doing it quickly because you have to apply the nail color before the activator</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is not worth the extra money or extra steps.</li>
            <li> not worth the effort for me to get it off to last only a week.</li>
            <li> I got this in Sheer Pink.  </li>
            <li> loosen the tops to all three bottles  apply 1 coat of activatot to the nail only   apply polish to immediately after while nail is still wet from activator  </li>
            <li> I know the color is &#x27;sheer pink&#x27;</li>
            <li> I use it on my toe nails and it lasts sooooo long</li>
            <li> For a $12 kit, I expected bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> I also found it harder to apply than the actual gel products.  </li>
            <li> Now the test will be to see how long it lasts.</li>
            <li> Chipped the next day, less than 24 hours later, and a pain to get off with acetone.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, this morning, I had two little chips - not terribly noticeable, but there nonetheless.</li>
            <li> If that isn&#x27;t enough to deter you from purchasing this product, then consider the fact that the remaining nail enamel (after the chipping has occurred) requires extreme chemicals to remove.</li>
            <li> Nevertheless, it does not live up to the hype.</li>
            <li> you are brusing super glue on your nails, very hard, not flexible, streaky, yuck!  </li>
            <li> I might as well have done a regular nail polish for half the price of the $12.99 product.</li>
            <li> To say that the product is difficult to remove is putting it mildly.  </li>
            <li> Allow at least 5 minutes to complete the process.  </li>
            <li> No thanks NutraNail, I&#x27;ll stick to getting Shellac done.</li>
            <li> It is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> I followed the directions carefully and the both coats looked \\&quot;streaky\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> I bought pink</li>
            <li> So I removed it and used the nutranail pink.   </li>
            <li> I just read a tip that you should carefully put petroleum jelly on your cuticles with a Q-tip to keep the activator off.</li>
            <li> After three tries, i threw the stuff away.  </li>
            <li> The fumes are really strong but the fumes from the special remover needed (to get rid of the ugly polish) are downright scarey.  </li>
            <li> Looks bumpy and sloppy no matter how fast I went and</li>
            <li> I was hoping to find all these negative reviews were wrong.. that it wouldn&#x27;t chip as quickly as the next day ..</li>
            <li> as some of the other reviews said, you need to be fast/quick on applying the coats of activator and gel polish.</li>
            <li> The explicit directions must be followed exactly or you will not only be disappointed but may ruin the product for subsequent applications.</li>
            <li> the other reviewers are correct...</li>
            <li> does make a bit of a mess if your not to careful, so i would reccomend (as they do in thier directions) to cover your area with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> So after several coat of application, as directed, the polish is rock hard.  </li>
            <li> IN LESS THEN 24 HOURS.</li>
            <li> half so</li>
            <li> In less than 10 hours (in which 6 of those I was sleeping)</li>
            <li> Chipped in less than 24 hours.</li>
            <li> placing it over the nail and tightly wrapping it in foil for about 10 minutes will remove it.</li>
            <li> So, in case you haven&#x27;t already seen enough negative reviews on this product--here&#x27;s another one!</li>
            <li> This product is definitely not worth the time and effort or hype!</li>
            <li> it takes a while to get off as well, so be prepared to spend a little bit of time trying to remove it.  </li>
            <li> The 3 brushes have skimpy bristles as only a thin amount of product is needed.  </li>
            <li> waste your money people.</li>
            <li> Had a few minutes, thought I would try this product.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this junk.</li>
            <li> may try some other colors now that I see it isnt too hard to do</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people are having trouble with this product.</li>
            <li> It does dry quickly as described, but the smell when applying it was horrible.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it is just my bottle</li>
            <li> Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy glue and you will glue your fingers together if you&#x27;re not careful!  </li>
            <li> I did get a bit on my cuticles, I&#x27;m just not very good at nail painting.</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE!!</li>
            <li> The base coat they have you put on first is just superglue so even when the color chips off your nails are still coated with superglue.</li>
            <li> No stickiness but a hard shiny surface.</li>
            <li> It may be a coincidence, but my nails are hard to grow now.</li>
            <li> and you are forced to peel it or buy their remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The 3 bottles are very small.  </li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried that it was going to be too complicated.</li>
            <li> The way the bottle and brush is made its hard not to get it everywhere because you need two hands to pull the brush out of the glue, it&#x27;s thin and it gets everywhere.</li>
            <li> After the horrible odor and the less than desirable results, you are left with a manicure that chips easily and looks terrible within a day.</li>
            <li> Not good.</li>
            <li> And it is very hard to remove.</li>
            <li> I gave it three stars because of the chipping and limited (bad) colors.</li>
            <li> It also made my nails REALLY thin, weak and brittle after I used it.  </li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll be stuck with unhealthy dried-out nails for another 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> But alas...</li>
            <li> So buyer beware...and be careful with the crazy glue!</li>
            <li> I ran it under cold water as suggested but the polish looked dull.</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a terrible habit of scratching off my nail polish under stressful situations and when I see a chip in color, so I thought that this would be the cheaper at home solution than professional acrylics and gels.</li>
            <li> disappointed, waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Yes, it is expensive at $10 - $14 for .17 oz.</li>
            <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but it just won&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> The next day came and it was an awful chip chain reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> , they get to be expensive, and I am in the healthcare field.</li>
            <li> all wrong.</li>
            <li> Even with switching the brushes, the nail color was getting sticky and difficult to work</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I did not keep my receipt &amp; they refuse to do anything without it.&lt;br /&gt;Turn</li>
            <li> unfortunately I have an allergic reaction so I can&#x27;t use them.</li>
            <li> Crazy glue...</li>
            <li> even though it was crazy glue.</li>
            <li> it chips like crazy.</li>
            <li> So sad :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> The polish smells bad once series and does not go away until the color is off.</li>
            <li> I figured it couldn&#x27;t be that bad</li>
            <li> Well, bad.</li>
            <li> This is one awful and expensive product.</li>
            <li> bad, very disappointed,  </li>
            <li> and I figured, how bad could it be?!  </li>
            <li> I know I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!</li>
            <li> This product is one of the worst I have ever used.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> I applied the product last night prior to reading the reviews. I was so impressed with the ease of application, the drying process and the overall look that I came online to buy more in a different color. That&#x27;s when I saw the reviews. I really wanted the reviews to be wrong because I was so pleased with how my nails looked immediately after the application. Unfortunately, this morning, I had two little chips - not terribly noticeable, but there nonetheless. Within 2 hours, every nail was chipped at the top. I had also bought the removal product, which worked just fine, but who wants to learn that lesson the very next day? Save your money.</li>
            <li> HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!! CHIPS IN LESS THEN 24 HOURS. BETTER YET OVER NIGHT!! HOW DOES A GEL POLISH CHIP WHILE YOUR SLEEPING??</li>
            <li> I got this in Sheer Pink.  It takes literally about 5 minutes.  The 3 bottles are very small.  It includes the activator, polish and brush cleaner along with directions.  But the directions are simple:  loosen the tops to all three bottles  apply 1 coat of activatot to the nail only   apply polish to immediately after while nail is still wet from activator  wipe polish brush on napkin and dip in cleaner  repeat.    PROS:  The shine is awesome    The cost is reasonable    Application is quick &amp; pretty simple    I didnt experience chipping for about 2-3 days.  CONS:  The bottles are kinda tiny    The application could be more simple with bigger bottles    I experienced chipping 2-3 days later      All in all its ok..I like it.  Can&#x27;t complain.  You can buy the remover or get regular acetone to remove.</li>
            <li> I was really excited about this after I put it on for the first time.  It looked great, dried as promised and seemed to be as sturdy as the gel manicures I&#x27;ve gotten in the salons.  But the next morning I noticed chipping on all of the tips of my nails.  I removed it and applied it again as the instructions stated &amp; am still seeing chipping, more every day.  I&#x27;ve tried adding additional coats and that seems to make the polish more brittle.  My nails are very flexible and if they bend, the polish cracks and starts to chip off.  I have had great luck with Shellac &amp; other gel manicures I get in salons--my nails usually stay perfect for at least 2 weeks, so this is a big disappointment.</li>
            <li> as some of the other reviews said, you need to be fast/quick on applying the coats of activator and gel polish. i liked it, may try just the gel harderner so i can use my own colors,i find the ones they do have are kinda ugly.was surprised at how fast they dried, mine was less than 3 minutes. does make a bit of a mess if your not to careful, so i would reccomend (as they do in thier directions) to cover your area with a paper towel.</li>
            <li> Easy application (if you are real fast at doing things) looks beautiful,hard and shiny  and then it chips off in a couple of hours!  Followed directions exactly.&lt;br /&gt;Too bad, very disappointed,  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!</li>
            <li> This product is one of the worst I have ever used. First of all, the product has a strong, noxious odor and chips easily. It does not compare in the slightest to salon gel nails. Once you begin application, you do have to work quickly and have a steady hand, otherwise the product will look streaky.  After the horrible odor and the less than desirable results, you are left with a manicure that chips easily and looks terrible within a day. If that isn&#x27;t enough to deter you from purchasing this product, then consider the fact that the remaining nail enamel (after the chipping has occurred) requires extreme chemicals to remove. To say that the product is difficult to remove is putting it mildly.  This is simply not a product I would ever recommend and it does nothing to restore any strength or wellness to your nails. If I was allowed to give it ZERO stars, that would be my rated review.  Please save yourself the time and aggravation and buy a non-toxic alternative such as ZOYA nail enamel.</li>
            <li> Not good. The activator is super glue. The way the bottle and brush is made its hard not to get it everywhere because you need two hands to pull the brush out of the glue, it&#x27;s thin and it gets everywhere. The hassle would be worth it IF the polish lasts but it chips sooner than my good quality polish. So glad I got this on sale and didn&#x27;t waste a ton of $ on it.</li>
            <li> Regular polish is much better (and easier to get off!) than this!  I couldn&#x27;t stand it after a day because of the chipping and cracking.  It feels like (and smells like) you are brusing super glue on your nails, very hard, not flexible, streaky, yuck!  I invested in Gelish products now and that stuff is awesome, my nails look perfect, I thought this was a cheaper alternative but it doesn&#x27;t compare at all.  I&#x27;m much angrier about the 10 dollars I wasted on this than the 60 I spent on gelish supplies.</li>
            <li> I purchased your product on Sunday, and put it on my nail immediately with such excitement! Much to my dismay I woke up two days later and I would attach a picture to show what my \\&quot;gel perfect\\&quot; nails look like if I could! Absolutely terrible. They&#x27;re chipping everywhere. And I work in am office for a living! I might as well have done a regular nail polish for half the price of the $12.99 product. I will not recommend this product to anyone I know I am very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Discovered this is cheaper on Amazon.  Many nail product manufacturers are now branding their polishes/laquers as gels.  An experienced nail technician recommended NutraNail&#x27;s gel perfect when I asked her about affordable \\&quot;gel\\&quot; nails that can be done at home without investing in an expensive UV light and kit.  Yes, it is expensive at $10 - $14 for .17 oz. gel cream, .25 oz. activator and .17 oz. brush cleanser.  The explicit directions must be followed exactly or you will not only be disappointed but may ruin the product for subsequent applications. A  good steady hand and the ability to work quickly are a must!!!  This is a 3-step process repeated twice per hand. Allow at least 5 minutes to complete the process.  The 3 brushes have skimpy bristles as only a thin amount of product is needed.  I am glad I gave this product a second try as I was not all that impressed the first time I used it.  Practice does make perfect!  My sheer pink nails took about 12-15 minutes before they dried to a rock solid state vs. the advertised 5 minutes and they still have a patent high shine finish and look great even after 2 weeks.  For the first time in my life, my nails are actually growing out beautifully without the usual breakage and spliting.    NOTE:  I also tried Perfect Formula&#x27;s pink gel coat at $30 for .60 oz. It is a faster, simpler one-step process that can be reapplied and removed like a polish.  NutraNail&#x27;s Gel Perfect takes a few minutes to remove by soaking nails in any acetone based nail polish remover.</li>
            <li> I have paid top dollar for these shellac manicures in the past and I love them!  I put this gel perfect on today and had the same results at home for less than half the price!!  I was washing dishes within 5 minutes of applying the color to my last nail!!!! They still look shiny and chip free!  This was easy to use.  I followed the directions exactly!  I used the pink, I will be ordering other colors to try them out, so excited!</li>
            <li> Gel Perfect--5 Minute Nail Color. That&#x27;s about how long the color will last on your nails--5 minutes!! So, in case you haven&#x27;t already seen enough negative reviews on this product--here&#x27;s another one! I did not purchase this product on Amazon, but in a local Wal-Mart store. Nevertheless, it does not live up to the hype. It was easy enough to apply and two sets of instructions are provided (quick start and regular). I applied it just as the instructions said--and my nails looked good for about 5 minutes. I could not believe that within 3 hours, the color had chipped, and was starting to peel. The only thing I&#x27;m glad about is that I didn&#x27;t select one of the deeper, more vibrant colors--because my nails would have instantly looked a HOT MESS!! By my color being the sheer pink, it was not quite as noticeable right a way, but if you looked at my hands for 20 seconds it was very apparent, I had a very &amp;#34;jacked up&amp;#34; manicure. I would not use this product again if someone was GIVING it away. And it is very hard to remove. The package says remove with the Nutra Nail No-Mess Express Remover, but I saw another review that indicated it does not work well either. My package even had a $1.00 off coupon, but I won&#x27;t even waste more money. I&#x27;d rather just soak in acetone (listed as an alternate method of removal)--because I know it&#x27;s cheaper to purchase. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!! This product is definitely not worth the time and effort or hype!</li>
            <li> Bought this even though it was cheaper in store. I know the color is &#x27;sheer pink&#x27; however after five coats I can still not even tell that the color is on my nails! Nail line is still completely visible which is a big turn off for me. It did dry very quickly, but it is not as shiny as I would have liked. Chipped the next day, less than 24 hours later, and a pain to get off with acetone. No thanks NutraNail, I&#x27;ll stick to getting Shellac done.</li>
            <li> This is not GEL at all. The activator is glue! That&#x27;s why it has a strong smell.&lt;br /&gt;The polish will crack after a day or two.</li>
            <li> This nail polish has a number of draw backs:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It will chip and crack by the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It does not dry in 5 minutes as advertised. It took more like 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Once you have realized you made a mistake you are stuck with it.  It will not come off with regular remover and you are forced to peel it or buy their remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The remover comes on horrible, one use, chemical dripping pads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not worth the extra money or extra steps.</li>
            <li> I got this in \\&quot;Cha-Cha\\&quot; (not off amazon) and as a nail polish junkie, I was sooo excited to try it! I just put it on 15 minutes ago and I&#x27;m not pleased.&lt;br /&gt;The activator smells like super glue, and the color is so streaky! It looks awful! I&#x27;m not sure if it is just my bottle but the brush is like split in half so when I go to paint my nail, it doesn&#x27;t spread evenly (which may have contributed to the streakiness).&lt;br /&gt;Would not recommend and would not purchase again. So sad :(&lt;br /&gt;I gave it two stars because since it has only been 15 minutes, I&#x27;m giving it hope that it won&#x27;t chip. We&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> Easy to apply. Looks great for about two to three days and then begins to crack and chip.  Great if you are in a rush and don&#x27;t have time to get to a salon but don&#x27;t expect it to last like a salon gel manicure.</li>
            <li> It really works!!  I had my doubts but it really is rock solid and looks exactly as if I got it at a nail salon! Only problem is that it is almost unremovable with acetone.</li>
            <li> If you have ever had a real gel manicure do not be fooled.  This does not even come close!  It is a total waste of money.</li>
            <li> got this and tried it, looks great and lasted a long time.  may try some other colors now that I see it isnt too hard to do</li>
            <li> This product looks good on your nails for about a day and then it starts cracking! I couldn&#x27;t even get much of a sheer pink color no matter how many coats I applied. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong, but it just won&#x27;t work for me. Not to mention that it&#x27;s a major pain trying to remove this from your nails!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen this product get pretty not so great reviews. I bought this after my mom got one for my grandma and I liked the results. However I found I did not care for this on my nails. It did not make them weaker but I have naturally flexible nails and even though the gel polish maDe them feel stronger they are not. They bend and then the solid polish cracks. HOWEVER THIS ROCKS ON TOE NAILS! I use it on my toe nails and it lasts sooooo long they are shiny and beautiful until it grows out. It&#x27;s a total pain to get off! Soaking cotton balls in polish remover and leaving them on the nails to soften the gel polish is the best way to get it off. Looks great though. I love it for that purpose.</li>
            <li> Love Nutra nail and was excited to find this on Amazon.  It&#x27;s old and no longer really good, don&#x27;t buy this</li>
            <li> Jenny, tommy&#x27;s sister speaking.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been doing nails for years and I was so excited!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did work for one day (the day I painted it!) Iwas so happy I was going to buy more colors..&lt;br /&gt;.... The next day came and it was an awful chip chain reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(The gel nail polish may appear thick and strong but it chips and comes of soooo easily) Sad.&lt;br /&gt;So disappointed, waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money people.</li>
            <li> I tried this yesterday and within 2 hours one nail chipped.  This morning, 3 nails are chipped!  The process was a bit labor-intensive, but I went with it anyway.  I followed the directions carefully and the both coats looked \\&quot;streaky\\&quot;.  I did not put on a 3rd coat as the directions did not say I needed to.  Also, I would note that if you accidently get the Activator or Polish on your skin, you&#x27;re pretty much screwed.  The directions say that Acetone is the only thing that removes the polish, but I used Acetone and I couldn&#x27;t get it off.  I ended up scraping it off - OUCH!  The shine is nice, the nails feel hard, but TOTALLY NOT WORTH IT!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I have a terrible habit of scratching off my nail polish under stressful situations and when I see a chip in color, so I thought that this would be the cheaper at home solution than professional acrylics and gels. I don&#x27;t like to get acrylics on because I cannot stand them after a 4 days, they get to be expensive, and I am in the healthcare field. Well back to the review, first off, you have to follow the directions to the letter or they will come out all wrong. I didn&#x27;t realize you needed two coats at first and it didn&#x27;t set right. Second, the color of sheer pink was far to pale. Third, it doesn&#x27;t dry in five minutes completely; it sets in 15 minutes completely but it does get it hard enough to were you can put on your shoes or grab your keys without too much smudging. Fourth, it chips easily (after 15-20 minute set) which then lead me to scratch it off. And finally, the colors are far to limited. 3 different shades of pink and only 1 red? I can&#x27;t wear bright green or blue to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is fine if your not like me and don&#x27;t scratch off nail polish. It did hold up longer than a regular nail polish would with me. It also was very shiny. It is a good start to the product. They just have to add more colors. I gave it three stars because of the chipping and limited (bad) colors. Oh, and the bottles are really tiny. For a $12 kit, I expected bigger bottles.</li>
            <li> How easy this product is to use. At first look at the instructions I was a little worried that it was going to be too complicated. It was so easy and looked like a professional manicure. Even my daughter couldn&#x27;t tell the difference. This really helps me with my constant splitting nail that has been splitting since I was a little kid. Love this product, you will too.</li>
            <li> Tried twice. Coulda paid 5x less for a better polish. Polish acted like it was old with uneven streaks, spots without color, just an all-around waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then if you wish to remove the horrid results, don&#x27;t worry. Even after soaking in acetone, you&#x27;ll still need to get out a pick to remove any of the gunk stuck around the edges of your nails. It&#x27;ll take off the first layer of the nail as well, so forget applying any other polish over the top of your nails. You&#x27;ll be stuck with unhealthy dried-out nails for another 4-6 months.</li>
            <li> This works better than plain polish alone but definitely not the same as gel polish. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
            <li> This is a horrible product.  It is not a \\&quot;gel nail\\&quot; product.  This is a two step process with an activator coat and a color coat.  The activator coat is basically like super glue.  So after several coat of application, as directed, the polish is rock hard.  Since it is so hard it chips very easily.  In less than 10 hours (in which 6 of those I was sleeping) I had chipped a nail.  It does dry quickly as described, but the smell when applying it was horrible.  I am sure a few brain cells died during this process.  I also found it harder to apply than the actual gel products.  The color coat gets stringy during application.  I do not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Bought on impulse from drug store. Should have read reviews first. I have had nails chip at the tips or peel off at the cuticle but I have never had nails chip in the middle until using this polish!  I followed the instructions to the letter and loved the immediate results.  However, over the course of 3 days, I had more naked nail showing than polished nail.</li>
            <li> Going to grandparents&#x27; day at my grandson&#x27;s school.  Had a few minutes, thought I would try this product.  Big mistake!  It was streaked and looked awful.  Then, I couldn&#x27;t get it off.  Very embarrassing to have to go to school like that.  Tomorrow is Thanksgiving.  Hope I can get if off before the family sees it.  Never again.</li>
            <li> Terrible product!  I bought pink and it went on orange.  The fumes are really strong but the fumes from the special remover needed (to get rid of the ugly polish) are downright scarey.  If you are willing to risk your lungs, it chipped in 2 days.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.  Nutra Nail Gel Perfect is is very different than the UV free products introduced by Revlon and Sally Hanson.  This is one awful and expensive product.</li>
            <li> I really love the lasting power of gel nail polish but between the price and the damage to my nails from gel polish at salons, I saw this and decided to try it.   The first application lasted one week, far shorter than the 2 weeks that&#x27;s listed on the packaging. But still, the one week is longer than most nail polish so I decided to try it again. One review here said you can use it with any nail polish. NOT TRUE!! I thought that sheer pink that this came with was very light and tired an Essie pink instead. DISASTER. The polish did not dry and was very tacky. I ran it under cold water as suggested but the polish looked dull. So I removed it and used the nutranail pink.   It is very easy to remove, if you follow the directions, which is a huge plus. I will probably buy this again as it does last much longer than regular polish and is a good cheap alternative to the salon. I do wonder if it will damage my nails over the long run because the salon gel system definitely damages my nails because of the buffing they do.</li>
            <li> I found this at the dollar store. Chipped in less than 24 hours. Tried it again and it did the same thing I followed the directions! Dont waste your money!</li>
            <li> Hmm. I&#x27;m not sure why people are having trouble with this product. I just applied it for the first time and it was quick and easy. I read and reread the directions and watched their YouTube video that shows just how easy it is. I had good results. No stickiness but a hard shiny surface. I did get a bit on my cuticles, I&#x27;m just not very good at nail painting. (I wish I could justify having it done at a salon every week or two!) I just read a tip that you should carefully put petroleum jelly on your cuticles with a Q-tip to keep the activator off. Next time I will try this - but I&#x27;m sure that could cause problems if any gets on the nail bed.   Now the test will be to see how long it lasts. Hope it gets me through my trip (10 days). Fingers crossed!  If it does last I will be so happy to have found this product! I hope they make a hundred new colors!  Update: I did not find this product any longer lasting than regular nail polish. Which for me is not long at all!</li>
            <li> This worked great initially, but I got cracks in it all over the nail which didn&#x27;t look so great.  It also made my nails REALLY thin, weak and brittle after I used it.  I used it months ago and my nails still aren&#x27;t the same.  It may be a coincidence, but my nails are hard to grow now.</li>
            <li> I bought this about a week ago and it hasn&#x27;t chipped yet.  When I get my Shellac manicures, she told me that if you don&#x27;t polish the tip/edge of each nail (the part you would normally file with a nail file) then they will chip.  So after you polish the top, then take your brush and polish over the entire edge of your nail with all applications.  This seals your entire nail.  Of course, I&#x27;m not a nail technician but my experience following this tip has worked well for me and I&#x27;ll be buying more colors as soon as they bring out some more flattering colors:)</li>
            <li> I purchased this product at big lots for $3.50 and that was still too much. The only thing good was that it looked good for the whole hour and a half it lasted. As soon as I got out of the shower all but 3 nails were chipped. The base coat they have you put on first is just superglue so even when the color chips off your nails are still coated with superglue. The polish smells bad once series and does not go away until the color is off.</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would last as long as the gel stuff you get at the salon, but did not.  It started to flake off after a week.  It does dry pretty quick though, so it is great for a quick touch up.  it takes a while to get off as well, so be prepared to spend a little bit of time trying to remove it.  It feels like glue on your skin if you get it on your skin.  After three tries, i threw the stuff away.  not worth the effort for me to get it off to last only a week.</li>
            <li> A friend of mine got a gel manicure at a salon and I thought it looked fantastic. On top of how great it looked, it stayed intact for 2-3 weeks and was removed because her nails grew out too much. I wanted that but I had two problems: I prefer doing my nails myself over going to a salon and I&#x27;m too cheap to spend $50 on the starter kit for at-home gel manicures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And then I found this product. I figured it couldn&#x27;t be that bad, right? I bought it at Walmart in Sheer Pink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression when applying the activator is that I was painting my nails with slightly thinned super glue. It smells like super glue, looks like super glue, and acts like super glue. I even compared the ingredients and it pretty much is super glue. The activator just has an additional ingredient that makes it capable of being painted on one&#x27;s nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I pressed on and continued to paint my nails with the color. Even with switching the brushes, the nail color was getting sticky and difficult to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still kept going. I finished my finger and toe nails. They did dry quickly, which is a plus. However, once it dried, I was removing the super glue-like activator from my skin because it was very messy and it is difficult to get it only on the nail, with the added pressure of doing it quickly because you have to apply the nail color before the activator dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finished my manicure and it didn&#x27;t look horrible. It wasn&#x27;t the salon quality manicure that I was after but I never really expected that it was going to be perfect. I was mainly hoping for a manicure that would last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product did not come through for me. I did my nails before I went to bed; when I took a shower the next morning, the first nail chipped. They&#x27;ve just continued to chip and crack since. I would have had better results if I had just used regular nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you have it. When painting your nails with super glue, the polish doesn&#x27;t hold up very long and it won&#x27;t look like a nice salon gel manicure.hold up very long and it won&#x27;t look like a nice salon gel manicure.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this thru Amazon but it is the same product.  I was hoping to find all these negative reviews were wrong.. that it wouldn&#x27;t chip as quickly as the next day .. but here I am on day 3 after applying it and it is already nearly completely chipped off.  I would never buy this again.</li>
            <li> How I honestly rate this product is -5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s HORRIBLE. I purchased it on sale for $7 &amp; \\&quot;buyers remorse\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t even begin to describe it. \\&quot;Buyers OUTRAGE &amp; ANGER\\&quot; is just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the Activator coat smells like super glue and the actual Gel-Polish bottle is TINY. I&#x27;ve had samples bigger than this. Even with 3 color coats, it still turned out super streaky. Let&#x27;s not fail to mention the constant \\&quot;gel-polish brush cleaning.\\&quot; That&#x27;s right, after every 5 nails you are instructed to put the used brush in a solution to soak, as you take the already soaked brush out of the solution and continue.&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, after scrubbing the same nail for 20 minutes with pure acetone, not even a dot came off. I assume this is why they sale their own special remover (I compared ingredients &amp; it&#x27;s basically just acetone).&lt;br /&gt;Third, it did look shiny, not shiny enough to pass as a real Gel job. I&#x27;m also 99.99999% sure that it is, indeed, super glue.&lt;br /&gt;Finally, after 3 days of having permanent crappy nails, I did some research and found this:&lt;br /&gt;Saturating a cotton ball in finger nail polish remover, placing it over the nail and tightly wrapping it in foil for about 10 minutes will remove it. But I suggest you take the foil off one finger at a time because you have a 5 second window of soggy gel polish that you WILL NEED to scrape off your nail.&lt;br /&gt;I emailed the company and they want a receipt and original box. Unfortunately I did not keep my receipt &amp; they refuse to do anything without it.&lt;br /&gt;Turn around and run. Run the other way, far away..and run FAST.</li>
            <li> Got it fast, love this product</li>
            <li> This product is not what it promises to be. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Seriously. Crazy glue... that&#x27;s exactly what the &amp;#34;activator&amp;#34; is. They warn you not to touch it while it&#x27;s &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34;... um, no. Tacky isn&#x27;t the right word. It&#x27;s crazy glue and you will glue your fingers together if you&#x27;re not careful!  I&#x27;ve done every kind of nail gel with the lamps... unfortunately I have an allergic reaction so I can&#x27;t use them. I was so excited to find a non-lamp gel and I figured, how bad could it be?!  Well, bad. First, the activator is legitimately crazy glue, which is not the best thing to put on your nails. But I persisted... there are 5 steps, but it does dry quickly and the color I used was sheer pink, which actually looked nice. I can imagine darker colors would go on noticeably streaky, but the shear color was ok. I went to bed thinking it might work... even though it was crazy glue. But alas... the other reviewers are correct... it chips like crazy. And again, a darker color would be more noticeable and problematic. I have been up for @3 hours now, and 7 out or 10 nails have chipped in some fashion. So buyer beware...and be careful with the crazy glue!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your time or money on this junk. The only reason it gets one star is because it was easy to get off.  Looks bumpy and sloppy no matter how fast I went and the colors are terrible. Don&#x27;t buy!</li>
