    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>This watch is perfect.</li>
            <li>This watch works perfectly, but I was looking for something to wake me up in the morning.  </li>
            <li>That would be great as an option if you could turn it on and off, but you can&#x27;t.</li>
            <li>I believe the VibraLite 3 to  be the best available for the price.</li>
            <li>If your looking for a watch that has the vibration as an optional alarm this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>Watch is good.</li>
            <li>My hearing isn&#x27;t the best, but I&#x27;ve been able to notice my watch buzzing better by ear than by feel.  </li>
            <li>So for discretion and reminders, this watch is exceptional.</li>
            <li>I do also agree with one reviewer that it is very easy to accidently turn the alarm off...</li>
            <li>This product meets most of my expectations.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Nevertheless I would still buy it again because I haven&#x27;t found anything better.  </li>
            <li>Granted, my eyes could be better, but I think this could have been made easier to read.</li>
            <li>do agree that the original band is rather a pain and use expansion bands, but still and all the VibraLite 3 is definitely the best.</li>
            <li>The vibration is sufficent to alert you that an alarm has gone off, though I am sure some people will hear the &#x27;zzzffth&#x27; sound it makes as it vibrates against you</li>
            <li>One problem, however, is that it is too easy to turn off both alarms (vibrate and ring tone)</li>
            <li>which fits my bill for being portable and easy to travel with.</li>
            <li>The dial is easy to read too.</li>
            <li>As a reminder alarm it would probably work fine.</li>
            <li>sound proofing of doors not exactly being high priority in even the best of most hotels...), I thought a vibrating watch would be a really neat way to sleep with ear plugs and yet be woken up by an alarm.    </li>
            <li>I spent much time researching and searching for the best watch to help with the task of staying alive and healthy.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Vibra Lite III about five years ago and the vibrating timer has served my special need fabulously.  </li>
            <li>We have tried  different sounding alarms through the years, from nature sounds to  soft chimes, but this vibrating  watch is the absolute best.</li>
            <li>The watch works very well on vibrate and makes it easy to set, and then forget until it reminds me of the time I need to be heading out somewhere.  </li>
            <li>So the countdown timer is extremely useful to me.  </li>
            <li>Love this watch, It not only tells Time it has Two alarm Time.</li>
            <li>My first watch, the pin connecting the watch to the band broke out of the watch casing.  </li>
            <li>I have to put on reading glasses and sit outside in the sun to be able to read it.</li>
            <li>Looks like performance for Vibralite3 is the luck of the draw, or else quality control has gone way downhill in the most recent years.</li>
            <li>I was at first very apprehensive about the vibration</li>
            <li>The vibrations were not quite strong enough for that.</li>
            <li>I certainly put it through it&#x27;s paces.  </li>
            <li>The first one lasted for many years and was extremely reliable.</li>
            <li>It works very well, and there is no way I can ignore the vibration when it goes off.  </li>
            <li>I really like this watch because i officiate youth sports games that have time limits.  </li>
            <li>and then when time runs out is great because I don&#x27;t have to lose focus on what is happening in the game at that moment</li>
            <li>The two audible alarms are very discrete with the barest of audible &#x27;peeps&#x27; as the audible alarm goes off.</li>
            <li>She says it works very well for her.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>I suggest the Vibralite 12 with the aluminum case for more active people.</li>
            <li>This watch needs to be improved to shake more and make less of an audible buzz.</li>
            <li>\\&quot;feature\\&quot; not mentioned in product descriptions is that the repeating alarm (the main reason I bought this -- \\&quot;alert</li>
            <li>I am a light sleeper and even though I do not have to get up until 7, most mornings I am also up at 5 AM (and not happily).</li>
            <li>However, the price it is too high for the product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The directions are copious, but an equal amount of patience wins out and the watch works well.</li>
            <li>The features are nice, and meets almost all of my requirements, but it&#x27;s like wearing a weight on your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the heavy usage I have found that I only have to change the battery once a year.  </li>
            <li>Plus, I&#x27;ve found that I couldn&#x27;t always hear the timers with audible alerts, either because the pitch was too high or too much action going on with the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since it buzzes so often when I don&#x27;t want it to, and the vibration isn&#x27;t as strong as the audible buzzing, it quickly becomes a minor and easily ignored annoyance, which renders the watch rather useless to me.  </li>
            <li>When my first watch finally died I immediately ordered another one.  </li>
            <li>After wearing it for one week 3 of the front screws came out, so now I&#x27;m not sure how long the top part of the watch is going to hold in place with just one screw!</li>
            <li>I would also say for the price you pay, the watch band is a little cheap.    </li>
            <li>As an adult with ADD I have used a timer for years to keep focused on household tasks etc.  </li>
            <li>And...there is no competition at or near this price.</li>
            <li>Being a traveller who frequently sleeps in noisy hotels with inconsiderate neighbours (</li>
            <li>I was frequently awake before the alarm went off.</li>
            <li>This watch replaces my identical first watch that lasted ten years through seven trips to Asia, several submersions into water, one watch strap replacement and three battery changes.  </li>
            <li>This watch is small and light</li>
            <li>He  frequently hits the snooze several times before finally getting up.</li>
            <li>I would probably recommend that if you are going to use this watch to wake up, then set the 2nd alarm as a &#x27;snooze&#x27; alarm because it only vibrates for 20 seconds and in a very deep slumber, that only seems to bring you around - the second alarm maybe necessary to wake up completely.</li>
            <li>A loss of high-pitched hearing rendered my old timer silent (to me) and made most timer watches useless with their little high pitched peeps.</li>

            <li> A loss of high-pitched hearing rendered my old timer silent (to me) and made most timer watches useless with their little high pitched peeps.</li>
            <li> Yes, I am female and this is a male watch, but I am on the last notch of the band and it still feels loose.</li>
            <li> They are indispensable for setting the end of a sitting interval in a quiet meditation hall without disturbing others.  </li>
            <li> The buttons are a little stiff at first.  </li>
            <li> The vibrations are not as audible as the current iphones and are less likely to disturb beginning meditators nearby.  </li>
            <li> accidentally (since the same button has other functions).</li>
            <li> She&#x27;s a nurse and has to wake up very early in the morning, but she&#x27;s extremely hard of hearing and uses the vibration feature to wake her up.  </li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the watch has taken my partner some getting used to as he has slept through the  vibrating alarm once or twice, although he is now getting up more promptly so he wont be late for work.</li>
            <li> The Vibra Lite II has a timer, but you have to reset it manually each time, which is a drag.</li>
            <li> My wishlist would include:  1) a glass bezel or harder plastic bezel that resists scratches; and 2) change the color of the background display to enhance contrast so that the numbers are easier to read at a glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Then I spent weeks travelling and my body was so out of whack</li>
            <li> They can also be used to remind you to terminate a meeting without offending the other attendee(s).  </li>
            <li> When I was active duty had one of these to wake up without waking others on the ship.  </li>
            <li> I found it hard to remove to shower once I finally got it on.  </li>
            <li> The only negative is that it could be a bit brighter.</li>
            <li> The second one was flaky from the start: the function button often skipped over functions, and sweat on my wrist would send the watch into spasms of function switching followed by failure to operate at all, though it eventually recovered.</li>
            <li> Of course, that&#x27;s based on the previous Vibralite 3&#x27;s</li>
            <li> that I&#x27;ve owned previously.</li>
            <li> These watches are fairly expensive for plastic digital watches but nowhere else can one get a silent alarm, and they seem to be built well.  </li>
            <li> In fact it is the most pathetic peep I&#x27;ve heard next to a Suunto watch -</li>
            <li> For the purpose I bought it for - as an alarm to wake up with, its turning out to be not to bad, and if lucky, the manufacturers will one day remedy some of these issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried the Vibralite 8, but it is way to bulky and heavy.  </li>
            <li> But now after several months, my backup alarm clock has been deemed unnecessary - the vibration from the watch seems to be sufficient to jar me from my slumber.     </li>
            <li> on the screen are really small, the screen is dim, and it is difficult for me to read.</li>
            <li> bad, while it worked, it was pretty helpful.</li>
            <li> The only con would be.. not to lose the instructions as it is difficult to set the watch without them.  </li>
            <li> Probably not a problem for men, but stiffness makes it nearly impossible to make small enough for an average size woman or child.</li>
            <li> The band is very stiff and thick.  </li>
            <li> (I learned this the hard way.)  </li>
            <li> The vibration works well for wake up, but the dial is hard to read.  </li>
            <li> I know that folks with both ADD and bad ears probably don&#x27;t represent a very big market, but this is a swell product for us</li>
            <li> The band, though, is extremely stiff and uncomfortable and has been replaced.</li>
            <li> Sadly, you will need to buy a Magnifying glass to read it.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this watch again if anything goes wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The watch is not perfect and could be use some improvements.  </li>
            <li> and I have not yet failed to be woken by the vibration on my wrist.    </li>
            <li> So that was an expensive mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very difficult to figure out to program it.</li>
            <li> The band is terrible.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love this watch, It not only tells Time it has Two alarm Time. You can either set them for Audio, So you can Hear-It. Or Vibration, So you can Feel-It, Vibrating on your Arm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m an insulin dependant Diabetic who has to keep track of Blood Glucose readings at very specific times. I spent much time researching and searching for the best watch to help with the task of staying alive and healthy. I believe the VibraLite 3 to  be the best available for the price. This is the second one I&#x27;ve owned.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do agree that the original band is rather a pain and use expansion bands, but still and all the VibraLite 3 is definitely the best.</li>
            <li> This product meets most of my expectations.  One problem, however, is that it is too easy to turn off both alarms (vibrate and ring tone) accidentally (since the same button has other functions).</li>
            <li> This product simply met my expectations. However, the price it is too high for the product. If I had bought a Cassio watch I would be happier.  Not a big deal.</li>
            <li> I needed a watch that would remind me to check on something every 15 minutes, for up to 7 hours at a time.  This watch is perfect. It resets itself and has a vibration alarm so I don&#x27;t disturb anyone who is around. The only negative is that it could be a bit brighter. The light is dim and is difficult at times to read, but I just keep the button pressed longer until I figure it out.  No Biggie...  If your looking for a watch that has the vibration as an optional alarm this is a good choice.  BUY IT !!!</li>
            <li> Item delivered on time and was as described</li>
            <li> When I was active duty had one of these to wake up without waking others on the ship.  A Deaf Friend had told me about them.  I saw this while researching something else, and got it.  Sadly, you will need to buy a Magnifying glass to read it.</li>
            <li> My hearing isn&#x27;t the best, but I&#x27;ve been able to notice my watch buzzing better by ear than by feel.  This watch needs to be improved to shake more and make less of an audible buzz. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another \\&quot;feature\\&quot; not mentioned in product descriptions is that the repeating alarm (the main reason I bought this -- \\&quot;alert me every n minutes\\&quot;) will not only buzz when the time is up, but will also buzz when 10 and 5 minutes are remaining.  That would be great as an option if you could turn it on and off, but you can&#x27;t. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;m forever bumping the &#x27;mode&#x27; button on the watch, which not only shifts the display from the time/date to the alarm screen or the timer screen, but also makes the watch buzz whenever you hit it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since it buzzes so often when I don&#x27;t want it to, and the vibration isn&#x27;t as strong as the audible buzzing, it quickly becomes a minor and easily ignored annoyance, which renders the watch rather useless to me.  I&#x27;ll stick with the &#x27;invisible clock&#x27; item instead.</li>
            <li> As an adult with ADD I have used a timer for years to keep focused on household tasks etc.  A loss of high-pitched hearing rendered my old timer silent (to me) and made most timer watches useless with their little high pitched peeps. I bought my first Vibra Lite III about five years ago and the vibrating timer has served my special need fabulously.  When my first watch finally died I immediately ordered another one.  I use that timer A LOT! The III (three) model has a timer that automatically resets and starts timing again while the alarm is sounding. I like this feature as I move from task to task, spending a set amount of time on each one.  The Vibra Lite II has a timer, but you have to reset it manually each time, which is a drag. (I learned this the hard way.)  I know that folks with both ADD and bad ears probably don&#x27;t represent a very big market, but this is a swell product for us and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this watch 2 years ago, and depend on the vibrator as a reminder to take my meds.  It works very well, and there is no way I can ignore the vibration when it goes off.  Sometimes, when I put the watch away, I can still hear the vibration in a drawer, in the next room.  The only con would be.. not to lose the instructions as it is difficult to set the watch without them.  I will purchase this watch again if anything goes wrong with this one.</li>
            <li> I really like this watch because i officiate youth sports games that have time limits.  So the countdown timer is extremely useful to me.  The vibrating that occurs when there are 10 minutes left, 5 minutes left and then when time runs out is great because I don&#x27;t have to lose focus on what is happening in the game at that moment and I still know where I stand with the clock.  Plus, I&#x27;ve found that I couldn&#x27;t always hear the timers with audible alerts, either because the pitch was too high or too much action going on with the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The watch is not perfect and could be use some improvements.  My wishlist would include:  1) a glass bezel or harder plastic bezel that resists scratches; and 2) change the color of the background display to enhance contrast so that the numbers are easier to read at a glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless I would still buy it again because I haven&#x27;t found anything better.  In fact, this is my 3rd one.  I think that because I use it quite a bit, especially during the spring/summer during baseball season.  I certainly put it through it&#x27;s paces.  I&#x27;ve tried the Vibralite 8, but it is way to bulky and heavy.  The features are nice, and meets almost all of my requirements, but it&#x27;s like wearing a weight on your arm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the heavy usage I have found that I only have to change the battery once a year.  Of course, that&#x27;s based on the previous Vibralite 3&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve owned previously.</li>
            <li> These watches are fairly expensive for plastic digital watches but nowhere else can one get a silent alarm, and they seem to be built well.  This watch replaces my identical first watch that lasted ten years through seven trips to Asia, several submersions into water, one watch strap replacement and three battery changes.  They are indispensable for setting the end of a sitting interval in a quiet meditation hall without disturbing others.  The vibrations are not as audible as the current iphones and are less likely to disturb beginning meditators nearby.  They can also be used to remind you to terminate a meeting without offending the other attendee(s).  The alarm is not totally inconspicuous but with some experience it can be made unapparent.</li>
            <li> The band is very stiff and thick.  Probably not a problem for men, but stiffness makes it nearly impossible to make small enough for an average size woman or child. I found it hard to remove to shower once I finally got it on.  The buttons are a little stiff at first.  The directions are copious, but an equal amount of patience wins out and the watch works well. And...there is no competition at or near this price.</li>
            <li> Being a traveller who frequently sleeps in noisy hotels with inconsiderate neighbours (sound proofing of doors not exactly being high priority in even the best of most hotels...), I thought a vibrating watch would be a really neat way to sleep with ear plugs and yet be woken up by an alarm.    This watch is small and light which fits my bill for being portable and easy to travel with. I also like the dual clock (since I am often in a time zone separate from those I might call).    As a reminder alarm it would probably work fine. The two audible alarms are very discrete with the barest of audible &#x27;peeps&#x27; as the audible alarm goes off. In fact it is the most pathetic peep I&#x27;ve heard next to a Suunto watch - an airconditioner&#x27;s quite hiss would be enough to render this peep inaudible! The vibration is sufficent to alert you that an alarm has gone off, though I am sure some people will hear the &#x27;zzzffth&#x27; sound it makes as it vibrates against you (yep, louder than the peep...).    But I&#x27;m relieved to say it wakes me up when I&#x27;m sleeping with ear plugs. I was at first very apprehensive about the vibration - didn&#x27;t think it would be sufficient. Then I spent weeks travelling and my body was so out of whack I was frequently awake before the alarm went off. But now after several months, my backup alarm clock has been deemed unnecessary - the vibration from the watch seems to be sufficient to jar me from my slumber.     I would probably recommend that if you are going to use this watch to wake up, then set the 2nd alarm as a &#x27;snooze&#x27; alarm because it only vibrates for 20 seconds and in a very deep slumber, that only seems to bring you around - the second alarm maybe necessary to wake up completely. But I can be a very deep sleeper and I have not yet failed to be woken by the vibration on my wrist.    I do also agree with one reviewer that it is very easy to accidently turn the alarm off... I do end up checking in a parnoid manner as I go to bed that I didn&#x27;t accidently turn the alarm off if I touched a button - because the next alarm mode after vibrate is off!      The watchband will defintely be an issue for anyone with slim wrists as well. Yes, I am female and this is a male watch, but I am on the last notch of the band and it still feels loose. I wouldn&#x27;t even consider this watch for a child... I would also say for the price you pay, the watch band is a little cheap.    So for discretion and reminders, this watch is exceptional. For the purpose I bought it for - as an alarm to wake up with, its turning out to be not to bad, and if lucky, the manufacturers will one day remedy some of these issues.</li>
            <li> If you have to arise much earlier than your bedmate, this watch is terrific for quietly awakening you when you need to get moving. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> But it only lasted about three months. Then the battery died, and no one around here would replace it. So that was an expensive mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To bad, while it worked, it was pretty helpful.</li>
            <li> Very difficult to figure out to program it.</li>
            <li> I like the watch, but the plastic watch case is problematic.  My first watch, the pin connecting the watch to the band broke out of the watch casing.  Global Assistive Devices promptly replaced the watch case, but today the same thing happened.  Now I have a vibrating pocket watch.  I suggest the Vibralite 12 with the aluminum case for more active people.</li>
            <li> The watch works very well on vibrate and makes it easy to set, and then forget until it reminds me of the time I need to be heading out somewhere.  The dial is easy to read too.</li>
            <li> This watch works perfectly, but I was looking for something to wake me up in the morning.  The vibrations were not quite strong enough for that.</li>
            <li> This watch has a lot of settings. Only thing is, the icons, etc. on the screen are really small, the screen is dim, and it is difficult for me to read. I have to put on reading glasses and sit outside in the sun to be able to read it. Granted, my eyes could be better, but I think this could have been made easier to read.</li>
            <li> The watch does what it is supposed to do. My 10-year-old has figured out how to have it help him focus is school. The band, though, is extremely stiff and uncomfortable and has been replaced.</li>
            <li> Bought this back in 2005 when I was in flight school. I used this watch to remind me with a vibration to switch fuel tanks every 30 minutes. Did the job well.</li>
            <li> After wearing it for one week 3 of the front screws came out, so now I&#x27;m not sure how long the top part of the watch is going to hold in place with just one screw!</li>
            <li> Watch is good. The band is terrible.</li>
            <li> This is the second VibraLITE3 that I have owned. The first one lasted for many years and was extremely reliable. The second one was flaky from the start: the function button often skipped over functions, and sweat on my wrist would send the watch into spasms of function switching followed by failure to operate at all, though it eventually recovered. Now after six months, none of the function buttons work at all. Looks like performance for Vibralite3 is the luck of the draw, or else quality control has gone way downhill in the most recent years.</li>
            <li> My mom got this as an alarm clock.  She&#x27;s a nurse and has to wake up very early in the morning, but she&#x27;s extremely hard of hearing and uses the vibration feature to wake her up.  She says it works very well for her.</li>
            <li> The vibration works well for wake up, but the dial is hard to read.  I think it should be bigger.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for my partner who gets up every morning at 5 AM. He  frequently hits the snooze several times before finally getting up. I am a light sleeper and even though I do not have to get up until 7, most mornings I am also up at 5 AM (and not happily). This watch has been a miracle for us/me. I don&#x27;t even hear or feel it vibrating. My sleep has been like a dream!  Unfortunately, the watch has taken my partner some getting used to as he has slept through the  vibrating alarm once or twice, although he is now getting up more promptly so he wont be late for work. We have tried  different sounding alarms through the years, from nature sounds to  soft chimes, but this vibrating  watch is the absolute best. I would highly recommend it!</li>
