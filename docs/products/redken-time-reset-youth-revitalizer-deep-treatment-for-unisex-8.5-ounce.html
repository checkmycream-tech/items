            <li>So glad to find this product online as it has been discontinued in the stores</li>
            <li>and I LOVE the what it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>My hair is truly rejuvenated - so glad I tried this product.  </li>
            <li>My hair has more body and holds moisture even during mid-winter.  </li>
            <li>I actually love this product and have been using it for years.  </li>
            <li>This Deep Treatment provides a healthy shine to my hair and also smells great.  </li>
            <li>It smooths and makes my hair easy to style.  </li>
            <li>This received a high rating from Good Housekeeping.  </li>
            <li>I no longer have frizzy, fine hair.</li>
            <li>It gave my hair back bounce, shine and it looks great.</li>
            <li>You find a product that does the job and before you know it , its no longer available.</li>
            <li>I got this excited that I found it, since it is no longer available in stores</li>
            <li>This is a very good conditioner that will not leave your hair feeling weighed down.</li>
            <li>but the sore scalp and itching are not worth the better conditioned hair!!</li>
            <li>I enjoy this product (the real one).</li>
            <li>Last weekend, I left it on for 30 minutes and was happy with the results.  </li>
            <li>Haha!</li>
            <li>it leaves my hair soft, able to withstand the heat of the curling iron - leaving me with soft manageable hair.</li>
            <li>and I still love having long hair.</li>
            <li>I first tried a free sample of this Time Reset combo with the shampoo, conditioner and Deep Treatment.</li>
            <li>IT MADE MY HAIR FEEL SO SOFT JUST AFTER THE FIRST USE !</li>
            <li>I really like this product and seems it has been taken out of production.</li>
            <li>I can now wear straight hair without the frizz.</li>
            <li>Problem being that as we grow older our hair looses so much shine and bounce.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for aging hair.</li>
            <li>This product leaves your hair soft and very manageable.</li>
            <li>I would recommend to anyone who has colored, permed their hair or simply - if you are older and your hair needs a boost - works wonders!</li>
            <li>I have been searching for a deep conditioner that really works as described.  </li>
            <li>A little pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li>I give his product high marks, especially for those over 50.</li>
            <li>I live in a high and dry Rocky Mountain climate.</li>
            <li>I generally apply to damp hair, leave in for about 15 minutes and rinse well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this product in the past, and it seems that it is no longer available at local syling salons (or from Redken).  </li>
            <li>My hair is shoulder length and normally oily at the roots but dry at the ends.</li>
            <li>This conditioner has eliminated the dry and brittle look of my split ends and made my hair soft and manageable.</li>

            <li> It works great to tame my curly hair, and is one of the few products that I&#x27;ve tried that tame my hair without being too heavy.</li>

            <li> After using my samples, when it came time to brush, i noticed Instantly that my hair was less tangled and WAAAAY easier to come.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, it has been discontinued and I have not yet found an adequate substitute.</li>
            <li> Have to be careful and not get on skin and rinse thoroughly.</li>
            <li> and I will probably purchase some of the other Time Reset Products soon.</li>
            <li> My hair is colored monthly, highlighted every other month.  </li>
            <li> All of my friends agree that these products just make your hair limp and do little to end our crown fuzz.</li>
            <li> I have ordered before from Amazon, from the few remaining vendors that still has it on stock.</li>
            <li> Since I have reached the age of old and dried out hair conditioners have been a disappointment.</li>
            <li> NOt satisfied with the vendor.</li>
            <li> , I am throwing it away, not sure what happened with this stuff</li>
            <li> My hair has changed, getting a little gray, and is very thick.</li>
            <li> makes it worse.</li>

            <li> This conditioner has improved the look of my hair immensely. I no longer have frizzy, fine hair. I use a tiny amount each day in the shower and it lasts a long time. My hair is shoulder length and normally oily at the roots but dry at the ends. I do use a blow dryer daily. This conditioner has eliminated the dry and brittle look of my split ends and made my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> I have had unruly hair all my life. I now get constant complements. This product is great! A little pricey but worth it!</li>
            <li> Since I have reached the age of old and dried out hair conditioners have been a disappointment. All of my friends agree that these products just make your hair limp and do little to end our crown fuzz. This product tends to give me more body and luster. After a couple of days the crown hair returns to fuzz however but the body remains.</li>
            <li> So glad to find this product online as it has been discontinued in the stores and I LOVE the what it makes my hair feel. THANK YOU VERY MUCH!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this 3 or 4 times since it arrived.  It seems to be helping my overprocessed, aging hair and I will probably purchase some of the other Time Reset Products soon.</li>
            <li> My hair is truly rejuvenated - so glad I tried this product.  I would recommend to anyone who has colored, permed their hair or simply - if you are older and your hair needs a boost - works wonders!</li>
            <li> This is a very good conditioner that will not leave your hair feeling weighed down. Note the picture of the product shows a tube but it actually comes in a jar.</li>
            <li> I live in a high and dry Rocky Mountain climate. My hair is colored monthly, highlighted every other month.  I blow it dry after washing and also use a flat iron, a couple times a week.  I have been searching for a deep conditioner that really works as described.  This received a high rating from Good Housekeeping.  I generally apply to damp hair, leave in for about 15 minutes and rinse well.  Last weekend, I left it on for 30 minutes and was happy with the results.  My hair has more body and holds moisture even during mid-winter.

            <li> This product saved me from chopping my long hair!! I first tried a free sample of this Time Reset combo with the shampoo, conditioner and Deep Treatment. My hair has a mind of its own when i wash it!! The individual strands wrap around and up and down and it&#x27;s tangles to the MAX. After using my samples, when it came time to brush, i noticed Instantly that my hair was less tangled and WAAAAY easier to come. REDKEN... THANK YOU!!!</li>
            <li> I am now 39 and I still love having long hair. Problem being that as we grow older our hair looses so much shine and bounce. I tried this product 2ce now. Once I used all over my hair- scalp to ends and one time just on the ends. I loved it. It gave my hair back bounce, shine and it looks great. A nice smelling easy to use product. I put it on, wrap my head in plastic wrap, cover with a shower cap and leave on for 30 minutes. A nice treat!</li>
            <li> I really like this product and seems it has been taken out of production. I have ordered before from Amazon, from the few remaining vendors that still has it on stock. This last product, doesn&#x27;t have the same fragance from previous products, so characteristic of this product. I am wondering I was sold something else on this container....NOt satisfied with the vendor. I enjoy this product (the real one).</li>
            <li> I have used this product for a very long time. I ran out and could not find it. Went to Amazon and found out it is discontinued so I stocked up. I have frizzy hair to begin with and the grey coming in makes it worse. This product is amazing. I can now wear straight hair without the frizz.</li>
            <li> I actually love this product and have been using it for years.  It was recommended to me by my hairdresser and unfortunately she is not doing hair so I had to search for it online and found it.  Great product.</li>
            <li> I am a beautician, and I LOVE Redken! I can use any shampoo now, because sometimes, with menopause-I wake up feeling like a salt lick! TMI!?? Haha! My hair has changed, getting a little gray, and is very thick. I use this twice a week, and BAM! Great hair! I got it on time, and it&#x27;s all good! Thank you, Amazon!</li>
            <li> I WILL KEEP BUYING THIS ! IT MADE MY HAIR FEEL SO SOFT JUST AFTER THE FIRST USE ! I HAVE FRIZZY HAIR AN NOW I DONT !</li>
            <li> This product leaves your hair soft and very manageable. Unfortunately, it has been discontinued and I have not yet found an adequate substitute.</li>
            <li> This product is wonderful. why the company has stopped making this, in my opinion is a mistake. You find a product that does the job and before you know it , its no longer available.</li>
            <li> I use it once a week after applying the conditioner...it leaves my hair soft, able to withstand the heat of the curling iron - leaving me with soft manageable hair.</li>
            <li> This Deep Treatment provides a healthy shine to my hair and also smells great.  It smooths and makes my hair easy to style.  Great product.</li>
            <li> Love this product! My hair stylist turned me on to it but said she thought it was being discontinued. WHY?!! It makes my hair feel so good and it smells heavenly. Highly recommended for aging hair.</li>
            <li> Great product for adding body to hair and gives smooth effect. I did have irritation on my ears and neck after using several times.  Have to be careful and not get on skin and rinse thoroughly.</li>
            <li> I got this excited that I found it, since it is no longer available in stores and I have an allergic type reaction every time I have tried to use it, I am throwing it away, not sure what happened with this stuff but the sore scalp and itching are not worth the better conditioned hair!!</li>
            <li> Excellent in restoring moisture and vitality to hair.</li>
