            <li> They&#x27;re small enough to fit everywhere.  </li>
            <li> Especially since the hand cream lasts so long once applied.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin on my hands in the winter time &amp; this is the only lotion I have found that doesnt make my hands burn and itch when I put it on.</li>
            <li> This satiny lotion moisturizes your hands and stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> The consistency seemed a little pasty compared to when I purchased this lotion with Mary Kay awhile back.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had mine for a while and still haven&#x27;t used half of then.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why I got the Peach as it did not mention Peach when I ordered.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay reps say they cant order the small tubes</li>
            <li> The tubes are as small as two fingers</li>
            <li> Makes a manicure dull and doesn&#x27;t sink in my skin.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately I hate peach</li>

            <li> I keep these on hand to take with me in my purse. It is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that is moisturizing without leaving a greasy residue.    Fast shipping, product as advertised.</li>
            <li> I love the size of this because you can throw it in your purse or pocket. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hands greasy, just smooth. I didn&#x27;t realize it was unscented when I bought it as I prefer the scented one, but it still works great.</li>
            <li> Like the travel size lotions. They worked well in goodie bags I put together for people I worked with at Christmastime.</li>
            <li> Handy size for your purse. It&#x27;s Mary Kay what&#x27;s not to love.  I buy them and bulk and safe a ton.</li>
            <li> Not sure why I got the Peach as it did not mention Peach when I ordered. Unfortunately I hate peach so I ended up giving it all away. The consistency seemed a little pasty compared to when I purchased this lotion with Mary Kay awhile back. Makes a manicure dull and doesn&#x27;t sink in my skin.</li>
            <li> I bought this set for my co-workers. All of them love it! They love how it makes their hands feel and some even want to buy their own.</li>
            <li> I ordered these to include in favor bags for a baby shower. The lotion is lightweight, non-greasy, long lasting and best of all unscented. The size is perfect to carry along in a purse or travel bag. The vendor was also very helpful to me when the post office caused delivery issues. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> great handcream, easy to carry in my purse.</li>
            <li> I attended  a Mary Kay presentation and was taken in by the Mary kay Satins Hand Cream.  It is so soft and smooth.  I love it.  I love the fact that it is not greasy.</li>
            <li> Mary Kay reps say they cant order the small tubes but i found them here &amp; i am so glad &amp; I ordered 2 12pks. I think they should sell this size all the time most women dont want to carry the large tubes in their purses. I have very dry skin on my hands in the winter time &amp; this is the only lotion I have found that doesnt make my hands burn and itch when I put it on.</li>
            <li> I really like this hand cream. I have a large tube of it. But I needed something for my purse, the car, my husband&#x27;s car, travel. These fit the bill perfectly. Especially since the hand cream lasts so long once applied.</li>
            <li> Happy with this purchase.  The tubes are as small as two fingers but you get plenty.  I&#x27;ve had mine for a while and still haven&#x27;t used half of then.  They&#x27;re small enough to fit everywhere.  Only thing is the lotion seems a tad bit watery.  You&#x27;ll feel like you need more through the day.  Overall satisfied with purchase.</li>
            <li> Perfect!! love satin hands! great for stocking stuffers and little gifts all year round! thanks again! satin hands is awesome</li>
            <li> This lotion last forever!</li>
            <li> Great for the purse, and an excellent hand cream.  Does not leave greasy residue on paper.  Would buy this product again.</li>
            <li> good lotion it makes your hands feel good</li>
            <li> This satiny lotion moisturizes your hands and stays on for a very long time.</li>
            <li> I have tried several hand creams and this product delivers great moisture without leaving a greasy residue.  I prefer the non scented formulation</li>
