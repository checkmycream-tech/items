            <li>Purchased a nail stencil kit and works great with it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Finally, Konad polishes work well, but there are great cheaper alternatives that are easier to come by.</li>

            <li>great for women</li>
            <li>the stamper works great.</li>
            <li>I was happy with the &amp;#34;PINK&amp;#34; stamper which was pulled out after 2 times of using it.</li>
            <li>This product works great along with the MASH Nail Art Stamping plates.</li>
            <li>This works great with the stamping set.</li>
            <li>Great bonding activity.</li>
            <li>I am extremely happy with this purchase</li>
            <li>great quality.</li>
            <li>This worked great for me after I buffed/filed the ends a bit.</li>
            <li>The stamper is great but the scraper scratches the heck out of your plates(as would any metal scraper).</li>
            <li>I love the product!!</li>
            <li>so I love it!!</li>
            <li>This came on time and is very nice.</li>
            <li>Any who, AMAZING stamper!</li>
            <li>I would say this product is mostly successful.</li>
            <li>Love this stamper, it&#x27;s every bit as good as Konad!!</li>
            <li>Stamper isn&#x27;t always 100% successful with any of my plates.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of stamping, its not as easy as it looks for beginners, but this Stamper is perfect!</li>
            <li>The scraper is good for one thing and that is SCRATCHING the plates, it doesn&#x27;t remove the polish well.</li>
            <li>This product didn&#x27;t come out as good as I though it would</li>
            <li>because i can&#x27;t see the images/designs of the stamper too good.  </li>
            <li>My daughter loved it.</li>
            <li>It is a good product though and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li>I also purchased the mash nail plates, it seemed like a good price.</li>
            <li>The rubber is perfect for the transfers and doesn&#x27;t push inside the holder (as the cheaply made As Seen On TV set</li>
            <li>The stamper itself is good.</li>
            <li>A good addition to my nail kit.</li>
            <li>I have followed every instruction you can find out there to make this work and can never get a good stamp.  </li>
            <li>It was like the sun came out and all was good</li>
            <li>The shipping was great and it has came in handy.....</li>
            <li>Based on the good reviews, I figured it&#x27;d be fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sometimes the image would look good and sometimes not.</li>
            <li>You need to check the image before applying to ensure it&#x27;s good, and then time to line it up.</li>
            <li>The design doesn&#x27;t go from the stamper to your nail that good either.</li>
            <li>good for backup</li>
            <li>The stamper in good, I selected 4 stars because when I got it looked like used but works as it should.</li>
            <li>Gave this scraper its fair chance and it scraped the heck out of my image plate causeing lots of scratches and did not all the paint off the plate.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m looking forward for more beautiful products from you.   </li>
            <li>My order arrived quickly and the nail art plate stamp and scraper worked perfectly.</li>
            <li>Really happy with the products, very accurate description.  </li>
            <li>So I bought four thinking: \\&quot;great deal introductory price maybe it would be better than konad.\\&quot; ...</li>
            <li>This product helps me make a more detail design on my nails and it does make a great stamp on the design I choose to wear on my nails.</li>
            <li>so there were a number of fingers that got more of the stamp than the nail did LOL)</li>
            <li>Nice product, works good</li>
            <li>This product picks up the nail polish right off the metal and stamps on to your very own nail making life easier than driving way to the salon to get your nails done!!!</li>
            <li>I even switched them between the two brands just to be sure &amp; the fit is perfect.  </li>
            <li>I love the Mash system!</li>
            <li>Love this stamper!</li>
            <li>I am completely satisfied with my purchase of the double-sided nail stamper and scraper by MASH!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time doing stamping nail art, but I&#x27;m happy with all mash tools!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>I love it!</li>
            <li>It is exactly as pictured and yes it stamps beautifully!.</li>
            <li>Love how it works! ...............</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t expect it to be an amazing product for the price you pay.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re getting into nail stamping, MASH has amazing products.</li>
            <li>and I liked thAt.</li>
            <li>If you have experience stamping, the set is nice.</li>
            <li>I liked it.</li>
            <li>it looks nice.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about</li>
            <li>Nice product with nice selection of plates.</li>
            <li>I bought 2 sets and the rubber has some kind of flaw,  like and air bubble when it was manufactured.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s nice that it comes with the scraper</li>
            <li>I liked that you could just buy these items together if that was your cup of tea.  </li>
            <li>Picks up image and transfer nicely.</li>
            <li>:) good luck.</li>
            <li>The stamper has some nice flexibility to it.</li>
            <li>If you are good at this sort of thing than I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li>This stamper does not pick up the image off the plate no matter what kind of polish I use.</li>
            <li>It was superior to the MASH stamper, and I&#x27;m glad I got it.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stamper is nicely made.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what kind of nail polish I use, it just doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li>very good service, shipped right away , product was just as stated.</li>
            <li>The package got here very quickly, but the stamper is not picking up the image that good...</li>
            <li>I was most impressed withe the fast delivery date</li>
            <li>I was very surprised that the scrapper also works flawlessly.</li>
            <li>They work great and very easy to clean :) once you start using these tools you will not want to stop.</li>
            <li>This makes having on of a kind nails better.</li>
            <li>Still, I&#x27;m going to suggest that people who are comfortable with a softer stamper or who get good results with them should probably avoid this one.  </li>
            <li>I love this product, I do my own nails and love to do designs on them.</li>
            <li>The stamper works great and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li>The product came very fast and works great.</li>
            <li>It took me about 3 times to really get it perfect but totally worth the value!</li>
            <li>This product does exactly what it says it does, and comes at a great price.</li>
            <li>But was quickly upset when I couldn&#x27;t get any good results.</li>
            <li>I got these very quickly and packed up nicely.</li>
            <li>Very easy to clean!</li>
            <li>Konaid products are much better..</li>
            <li>I used it with the hello kitty plate from bornpretty and the scraper most times takes ALL the polish off of the plate.</li>
            <li>Thank you..... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li>I watched many tutorials on how to use it</li>
            <li>it will work better.</li>
            <li>The stamper was just okay.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE the MASH</li>
            <li>I love this item, I plan on buying more stamping plates to widen my variety.  </li>
            <li>okay</li>
            <li>better cause the colors I use work better with it.  </li>
            <li>I think scraper works better with salon express one too.</li>
            <li>Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure about this stamp.</li>
            <li>Much better and gentler on the disks.</li>
            <li>Great Products and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>Got more than one thing but everything I got</li>
            <li>This is a great product which is much cheaper than Konad.  </li>
            <li>I love the coloring of the item.  </li>
            <li>I was a bit hesitant about going with MASH over Konad after reading some of the reviews, but I  m glad I did.</li>
            <li>so I will be able to tell when I use that one.</li>
            <li>So, I know she will love these.</li>
            <li>love the stamper and the scraper.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>If you just want to get your manicure done, buy a better quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a neat &amp; interesting idea.</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll get a stamper and a scraper, and I&#x27;ll admit that I bought this product because I like the color more than others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I can now do many drawings on my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li>That works much better.</li>
            <li>Scraper is okay</li>
            <li>I love both the stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li>my daughter and I have been doing our nails together and the ease of using this product makes it enjoyable</li>
            <li>The color of the stamper is deeper purple than shown here, which helps some nail polishes show, letting you position the stamper better.</li>
            <li>A credit card works better than the scraper.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE THE STAMPER, THE SCRAPER</li>
            <li>Good buy, but not crazy about the metal scraper, it leaves scratches on the plates.</li>
            <li>Plastic works better.</li>
            <li>I have been doing more with hand painted work then with the stamper</li>
            <li>so I need to set some time aside to practice more.  </li>
            <li>Stamper is ok.</li>
            <li>Most often with Konad</li>
            <li>I did find the MASH plates of excellent quality and left a 5 star review on those.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s how much better</li>
            <li>I find this method easier, although, I&#x27;ve seen many people online work well with the rolling method.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Metallics of most any brand seem to work well.</li>
            <li>The scraper works ok.</li>
            <li>they work better and do not  scratch.</li>
            <li>eh eh.it is okay quality.</li>
            <li>My daughter is going to love it when she gets it for Christmas.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li>and I hope it works out better.</li>
            <li>Ended up buying a Konad stamper that worked perfectly with the same plates and polish</li>
            <li>I plan on trying a Konad stamper and seeing if this works better.</li>
            <li>Lots and lots of practice for sure.</li>
            <li>i mostly have &amp;#34;dry in 60 sec&amp;#34; paint and all i have used works.</li>
            <li>the firmer the better print.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not my favorite one</li>
            <li>but it does the ok.</li>
            <li>Their customer service is top notch though.</li>
            <li>The stamper is ok but the scraper scratches your plates.</li>
            <li>Works a lot better, not to mention that the metal on the scrapper would eventually damage the plates.</li>
            <li>but overall this product is great! :)</li>
            <li>, I tried to use many thing</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>I just placed an order for one, so hopefully i will better luck</li>
            <li>I was hoping it would work better...</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off using a razor blade, it worked better for me</li>
            <li>Love the way it creates designs.</li>
            <li>I like being able to create cute designs with my stamper.</li>
            <li>Sometimes has issues with picking up images though, but it seemed to work alright for most of mine.  </li>
            <li>and my grand daughter loves it</li>
            <li>and I thought this scraper looked like it would do a much better job then a credit card.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t use the scraper, like others said it scratches the plates and an old credit card I had worked perfect, I also didn&#x27;t have to clean it off as often.</li>
            <li>You will have to practice once or twice to get comfortable with it, but it is honestly very very easy to use.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick and I am totally satisfied!</li>
            <li>: there&#x27;s thumb indentations for better gripping, rubber heads come off for easy cleaning, affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Product came on exact date and in good packing.</li>
            <li>At first this is going to be a slower process, which can lead to drying out the image and not getting a good transfer.</li>
            <li>but overall the product is amazing!!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so excited to have the nail art plate stamp and scraper!</li>
            <li>I was so excited when I received this order!</li>
            <li>A Better material could have been used, a smoother and gushy stamper, so the images would be picked up easily and transferred easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works great and nice for larger hands.</li>
            <li>Now that I know what I&#x27;m doing and have a better feel for it, I really enjoy being able to dress up my nails a bit.</li>
            <li>The stamper is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li>so it is great for to use pretty much any kind of nail polish you want.</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping and nice packaging will buy more MASH products.</li>
            <li>am very happy with it, the quality is great and I especially like that I got a big sized scraper along with it!!</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work as expected but the construction is very good!</li>
            <li>Fast shipping will buy from seller again.works really good  </li>
            <li>Seems good, the konad one appears much softer though...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Stamp have good quality and my wife was a half of happy.</li>
            <li>The price is great &amp; amazon offers free shipping</li>
            <li>The scraper is easy to use, but I&#x27;ve noticed it does scratch the plates.</li>
            <li>She thought it was so easy to use</li>
            <li>Scraper gets clogged too easily though, needs to be cleaned after each nail.</li>
            <li>They make it look so easy.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use, I was worried it would take a while to figure out</li>
            <li>thought the Stamper and Plates would be easy to use, but they are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li>Spend more money and buy a better brand, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li>glad so many people are having success with this stamper, but I just can&#x27;t make it work, so I went with two stars instead of one.  </li>
            <li>Nice pretty nail art.</li>
            <li>seem like work fine</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>it just scratches the plates a plastic card works just fine.</li>
            <li>AND IT WORKS FINE</li>
            <li>and it was fine.  </li>
            <li>clean is super handy, pass a cotton swab moistened with acetone and everything is clean.</li>
            <li>These make doing nail designs quick and easy not to mention fun!!</li>
            <li>I love the stamper its super easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li>If I need more stampers in the future, I&#x27;ll buy more of these, you can&#x27;t beat the price and it gets the job done! :)</li>
            <li>stamper was a HUGE letdown</li>
            <li>The nail polish I used wasn&#x27;t cheap or transparent either.</li>
            <li>The rubber on the stamp is easy to clean when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li>The shipping was nice and fast.</li>
            <li>It really fits nicely in the hand.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li>This stamper is great for the price because is double ended.</li>
            <li>The pads are removable so that you can clean them easily.</li>
            <li>I decided to order the Konad double stamper and scraper and it worked great</li>
            <li>There was something I saw on lightly using a nail file on the stamper</li>
            <li>and I really wanted my own set.</li>
            <li>Both items are easy to handle, hold and clean.</li>
            <li>Compared to both the free stamp pad that came with my Pueen plates and the super-squishy ones that come with the Cisi&amp;Sisi sets, it&#x27;s practically rock.  </li>
            <li>Makes that metal on metal sound too</li>
            <li>but I suggest buying cheap if you have never tried it before.</li>
            <li>for a firm stamper it is really nice pick up is great</li>
            <li>The stamper is cool, easy to hold, easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li>Having two sides is very handy to fit different sizes images.</li>
            <li>If you have the time to keep doing it over until you get it right, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li>This worked great, the stamper was easy to clean and worked well; the scraper left small scratches on the discs, but they still work wonderfully.</li>
            <li>I am trying to save money and learn to do this myself - this was a very economical beginning.</li>
            <li>scraper is good it has metal not like the plastic ones thats great, but the stamper never seems to pick up the image its really shiny unlike my usual one that works better.</li>
            <li>Super easy to use.</li>
            <li>They are super easy to wash up just by rubbing them with nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li>The delivery was fast and the products were exactly what I wanted and the price was good.</li>
            <li>Its a very economical price &amp; the stamper is dual just like a original Konad stamper.</li>
            <li>Price is ok, and I like very much that scraper is not plastic.</li>
            <li>Overall this product is good, although I don&#x27;t like the scraper the double ended stamper works great.</li>
            <li>Once you get the hang of it your golden!</li>
            <li>, my nails came out beautifully (After a bit of practice), I spent 5 hours trying designs</li>
            <li>My 3 stars is pretty generous :)</li>
            <li>it is so much fun!</li>
            <li>I was so excited I immediately grabbed a bunch of polishes that I was told worked with stamping, my plates, and set to work.</li>
            <li>It seems to work better then the first time and transferred \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
            <li>This is the kind of thing you can live without it once you had use</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t clean off the surface, it just scratches the plate and leaves tons of polish on the plate surface.</li>
            <li>the polish doesn&#x27;t all come off the stamper like I have seen in some video on stamping I have watched and have to clean the stamper with nail polish remover to get it off.  </li>
            <li>You always have to clean after each finger nail you stamp.</li>
            <li>Also, after I was done decorating my nails,  I had to have my husband clean off the excess polish on the scraper</li>
            <li>You have to clean before use with alcohol, otherwise won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>As far as the stamper goes, I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li>and if you get the right consistency of nail polish it looks really cool!</li>
            <li>sure to use pure acetone, and clean the image in between each use.</li>
            <li>I did many side by side comparison using different plates and polishes, on paper mostly, and I could easily notice a difference in Konad.</li>
            <li>It went right in the trash!</li>
            <li>I have never done my nails before and it was super easy to make fun nails with my friends.</li>
            <li>, I tried again with a bright red nail art polish and a Gals</li>
            <li>Packaging was nice,each plate was individual and in good condition.</li>
            <li>MASH Double Sided Nail Art it is good for use</li>
            <li>The scraper is really nice, however I prefer to use old giftcards as they don&#x27;t scratch the image plates.</li>
            <li>I bought it because it was cute, but it really works.</li>
            <li>Leaves a cool effect.</li>
            <li>This affects the full nail images because they are supposed to look uniform all over the nail.  </li>
            <li>recommend it cause it works for what it is meant to be for a good low price.</li>
            <li>works great, was nervous at first cause of the bad reviews but it works great, i prefer  a plastic card over the scraper!</li>
            <li>This little tool works nicely and adds a nice touch to any nail design.  </li>
            <li>At first I blamed it on the stencils, but it turns out the stencils are fine.</li>
            <li>As an added bonus, as if the product isn&#x27;t great enough already, the shipping is also super fast.</li>
            <li>I love the colors on this and love how it is double sided!</li>
            <li>The designs roll onto the nail as they should, and I&#x27;ve been able to use many of my regular polishes to stamp with.</li>
            <li>gets it done quickly.</li>
            <li>This was the first stamper I bought for my intro into nail art stamping I mostly bought it instead of the Konad because I could get it quicker (wanted it for a weekend visit with my little niece) and liked the color better than Konad.</li>
            <li>Thank you very much!</li>
            <li>It will do nothing but scratch your pretty mirrored plates, no matter how lightly you scrape.  </li>
            <li>I do nails for myself and my friends &amp; family and so far they love it!The scraper is a pain to clean off if you use thicker polish (which I recommend)</li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this at such a cheap price, and a cute color.</li>
            <li>The stamp picked up the images wonderfully, I also went for the MASH bundle of plates, which I find are very high quality, not sharp, deeply etched.</li>
            <li>I had even ordered two of these since they were such a good deal and tried both out to see if maybe the first one was a dud.  </li>
            <li>I will definitely order more MASH products!</li>
            <li>but once you&#x27;ve practiced a few times it&#x27;s easy to get a good stamp on your nail.</li>
            <li>The Pink and Black is perfect for me :)</li>
            <li>this stamper is nice, picks up well although there seems to be a flat section on the very top which can leave a blank spot if I press too hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and they immediately sent me a complimentary stamp and scraper set.</li>
            <li>If you like to have fun with your nails, this is for you.</li>
            <li>better off using an old credit card.</li>
            <li>Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li>They are having lots of fun with them.</li>
            <li>Grandaughters and me tried to use and just isn&#x27;t worth the time.</li>
            <li>It is a fun product to use.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the purchase just for the stamper.</li>
            <li>So, Konad wins in this area.</li>
            <li>its better to use an old credit card or gift card.</li>
            <li>I am having fun with all my designs.</li>
            <li>You really have to go slowly and be patient if you want it to be perfect, not every try works out.</li>
            <li>I got more luck using an old gift card.</li>
            <li>I do have fun.</li>
            <li>the stamper works well and picks much the images most of the time and if it doesn&#x27;t then it was most likely a fault of mine.</li>
            <li>My daughter loves having &amp;#34;mother daughter dates&amp;#34; and using this to make fun nail art.</li>
            <li>This is a fun way to do nails.</li>
            <li>I have always read that an old credit or gift card works better as a scraper</li>
            <li>I enjoy that it is pretty quick to use, but the thing really should have come with a set of instructions.</li>
            <li>Love it, works better than my other stamper.</li>
            <li>When the first one was defective I quickly got a replacement sent to me.</li>
            <li>my two older teens tried using it and they love it, they just couldn&#x27;t get it to apply the paint very well.  </li>
            <li>was excited to do my nails but that excitement ended very soon.  </li>
            <li>it wont work right</li>
            <li>I started stamping right away.</li>
            <li>Kept it the two days until my konad stamper came, then I tossed it right out.</li>
            <li>i didnt use the right nail polish.</li>
            <li>Not only does it makes my hands look pretty, but my feet look as amazing with this product.</li>
            <li>The scraper works very well, as in all nail polish comes off clean.</li>
            <li>It is less than two dollars more to get the Konad and it works much better.</li>
            <li>The shipping was really fast too so that is cool.</li>
            <li>but the stamper does not pick up the image very effectively and the scraper makes a very big mess of this it does not scrape very clean.</li>
            <li>Super fast delivery and just as described.</li>
            <li>The stamper gets the design completely and passes it easily to the nail.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The stamper seems a bit hard, taking it out and kneeling it will soften it, making it slightly easier for the polish to transfer (depending on what brand you&#x27;re using) very happy with the purchase :)</li>
            <li>It has a big side and then a small side at the top very nice</li>
            <li>A little trial and error will give good results.</li>
            <li>Great size to hold in the hand without making it hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li>It can be because it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever done nail stamping.</li>
            <li>First off, I could not get this thing to work for the life of me.</li>
            <li>The MASH double sided nail art plate stamp an scraper is a great option for those who wants to buy a product similar to konad one.</li>
            <li>it was my first time buying any of nail art items</li>
            <li>I got one from salon express because the rubber part of stamper is white and it works okay too.</li>
            <li>I first purchased a cheap old stamp from walmart, which wasn&#x27;t picking up anything.  </li>
            <li>this Stamper and Scraper was my first purchase.</li>
            <li>If anyone is interested i&#x27;ll post pictures.</li>
            <li>I love the bigger handle size of the stamper</li>
            <li>No need to pay more for a brand name as this works just the same.</li>
            <li>To me, the scraper part was pretty much just junk!</li>
            <li>Product was exactly as described, mom will love her Christmas present.</li>
            <li>Item was exactly what was shown.</li>
            <li>I have used MASH stamps before, and those are exactly as i thought they would be.</li>
            <li>First of all, mine didn&#x27;t come with a scraper.  </li>
            <li>This came well packaged and ready to use!</li>
            <li>First off: throw away the scraper.  </li>
            <li>works well and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I wish i knew how to use the actual stamps and stamp pens better</li>
            <li>Would definitely order again in fact I&#x27;m going to order one more jic this one gets lost.</li>
            <li>I ordered the stamper and scrapper when I first started stamping.</li>
            <li>I had to get my first one replaced because it was defective.</li>
            <li>First of all, the scraper scratches the plate.</li>
            <li>This was my first set of scraper/stamper for my nail stamping plate set.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This was my first stamper purchase.</li>
            <li>Received this set so quickly and its decent.  </li>
            <li>It does take some practice to get the pictures straight on your nail, but it does the trick!</li>
            <li>The set arrived and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>I threw it away after the first use and use a plastic rewards card instead.</li>
            <li>I first discovered the world of nail stamp art at a girls night</li>
            <li>I had that one first and bought these as extras because they were a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li>Even if you don&#x27;t buy Konad plates, their stamper is nearly the same price, and it works much better because the rubber is even and smooth.</li>
            <li>The stamper works pretty well</li>
            <li>i did notice that you need to make sure there is enough paint to fill all the grooves.</li>
            <li>This was the first stamper I bought.</li>
            <li>This was my first stamper/ scraper set.</li>
            <li>It took me a bit to get the hang of using this (My first time</li>
            <li>My daughter and I used this today for the first time.  </li>
            <li>so very speedy!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using a nail art stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li>First time nail art enthusiast</li>
            <li>First things first:  I threw out the scraper in favor of a keychain-sized discount card.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to spend some more time on YouTube to see if anyone else has the same issue, or any suggestions.  </li>
            <li>Got this as my first stamper.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t seem to get a clear, precise looking stamp.</li>
            <li>This is my first stamper</li>
            <li>This really is a great little stamp, lovely color, it&#x27;s double sided with a long barrel and really easy to use.</li>
            <li>I need to get my husband to file it or dull it somehow, other than that the image was good, and I didn&#x27;t use the scrapper, because it scratches the nail plate, but it came together, for the price it was good.</li>
            <li>Both the stamper and the cheeky plates had mixed reviews but there was more positive</li>
            <li>Personally, I will invest in the Konad double stamper because in the end, the investment will pay off time wise.</li>
            <li>Usually, the first time was good, but not after that.</li>
            <li>I have ordered multiple mash products lately and all were wonderful except for the stamper.</li>
            <li>it was a very reasonable price in comparison to others like it and did its job very well.</li>
            <li>It was just as described, and fast fast shipping!  </li>
            <li>I was really excited to get this kit to complete the whole nail art stamping set.</li>
            <li>but when I first tried Was very dificult</li>
            <li>I just stick to an old credit card for scraping now, and hey, no ugly scratches.</li>
            <li>I originally used polish remover with additives for strengthening and that turned out to be one of my major problems in the beginning.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I ordered this because of it&#x27;s size, and the big stamp makes it so easy to put prints or patterns on your toes or on your thumb</li>
            <li>But this too was easily fixed with some super glue.</li>
            <li>it is easy to use and the pink soft ends make it easy to see the pattern.  </li>
            <li>It shipped very fast intact wrapped in plastic brand new!</li>
            <li>, so I can&#x27;t compare but this one certainly serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li>Everytime I try to stamp with the large pad, every image I stamped would not pick up the part of the image that touched the \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; area.</li>
            <li>Since I am new at stamping and nail art all together,  I will give this some more time to see if I can get it to work properly.  </li>
            <li>After testing the two side by side with several bundle monster plates and different polishes the Konad hands down works best.  </li>
            <li>This comes in handy if people have little nails.  </li>
            <li>For beginners though, it is hard to use and takes lots of practice to get good at it.</li>
            <li>The delivery was reAlly fast</li>
            <li>I really like the mash brand.</li>
            <li>but the pink of the stamper is not my favorite.</li>
            <li>but it was very inexpensive to do.</li>
            <li>Seem to be sturdy and arrived promptly thanks to my amazon prime account.</li>
            <li>It is for a gift for my teenage nieces which I hope they enjoy.</li>
            <li>Very upset at this product.</li>
            <li>It was shipped really fast.</li>
            <li>and then i much rather use the squishy ones</li>
            <li>The productis even better that i had expected.</li>
            <li>I really like this products.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think you really need an image plate for stamping your nails, just a paper towel.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>anyone has any tips or tricks,please feel free to email me (lilredshortie520@gmail.com) or respond back to this.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Really fast shipping too.</li>
            <li>The pads are really shiny and don&#x27;t pick up the images well at all.</li>
            <li>I really like this stamper</li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>and it just was not working for me, the scraper was scraping too much off and would go into the design</li>
            <li>It picks up the images very well.</li>
            <li>NOT SO MUCH, I LIKE</li>
            <li>I ordered the Cheeky plates to use with this and not having much luck yet with it.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for the suggestions and keep bringing them if you have any....</li>
            <li>Maybelline Color Show metallics work very well.</li>
            <li>konad stamper picked up everthing while the mash picked up absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li>its not even a straight edge, its got a curve to it or something</li>
            <li>All in all, for the money spent, about 20$, including shipping, this is way better than those As seen on TV things.</li>
            <li>I cannot get the whole image to stick to my nail.  </li>
            <li>it is nice and firm</li>
            <li>As far as I can tell the MASH plates are great, but this stamper is no good.  </li>
            <li>Stamp is very easy to use, the scraper took a few times to learn the technique.</li>
            <li>Thank you for fast ship and high quality product.</li>
            <li>She wants to go to Paul Mitchell when she graduates high school, in 4 years, to study nail, hair, and make up.</li>
            <li>The second was shipped super fast, but just didnt work well.</li>
            <li>I love the colors much better than the pink &amp; green by konad.</li>
            <li>The product is cute and all, but it is not useful and not what it is described as.</li>
            <li>The large stamping side had a U shape dent in it and through the center there was a huge crack.</li>
            <li>Even pressing down harder and kind of rocking it a bit to cover more of the surface was not enough.  </li>
            <li>and i was having some trouble finding good enough plates.</li>
            <li>I love that it has the double end, although I&#x27;ve just been using the larger end.</li>
            <li>I was having high hopes for this stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li>highly recommend to girls who are in nail art</li>
            <li>I owned a Konad single stamper and it works great, but needed a two sided stamper for small designs.</li>
            <li>isn&#x27;t worth all the time it takes to use...very messy and not nail friendly</li>
            <li>I tried taking a file to the stamper and the results got a little better, but still weren&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li>That was easily fixed by replacing the scraper with a straight blade.</li>
            <li>this product is a great idea, but the application is difficult.</li>
            <li>It likes to leave streaks of nail polish, I find it much easier to use an old credit card.</li>
            <li>Pretty simple and straight forward.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s a good size for my nails, but during cleaning, the little purple part comes loose sometimes --</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a big deal because you can also push them back in easily.  </li>
            <li>the scraper scraped the plate its better to use an old credit card it will be less scratches</li>
            <li>I would just stamp to the side, but this blemish is RIGHT in the middle :</li>
            <li>You&#x27;re better off with using your card as a scraper and paying a little more for a konad stamper :/.</li>
            <li>I actually use a little plastic grocery store keyring card and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li>I have to buy a new scraper before I can try it for myself though.</li>
            <li>NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories</li>
            <li>but i pulled it out and used my new plates</li>
            <li>I am new to the stamping world.  </li>
            <li>This is what I was really wanting and I really like the double sided stamper.  </li>
            <li>I was going to say that it&#x27;s a good product for the money until I realized that I only use 50% of the product and similar products are sold for less.</li>
            <li>This is only my first time using stamping plates, but I dont know if I will try again.</li>
            <li>When I first placed my order, I received only the stamper.</li>
            <li>This is the first and only one I bought for stamping, and it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li>The removal rubber stamper inserts are the exact same size as konads as well.</li>
            <li>Instead of using this, I just took an old plastic gift card and used that in its place!</li>
            <li>so I would more use this for those small designs.</li>
            <li>though first that was me, but when I buy other brand I do not have more problems working with other brand, this do not work at all</li>
            <li>For the first few times I used this stamper it worked great, but after a while I noticed that the center of the stamper was picking up less polish than the outer area of the stamper.  </li>
            <li>Then I used it for the first time and realized that the scraper thing isn&#x27;t flat</li>
            <li>, I was certain it was possible to get it all to work.</li>
            <li>Once I cleaned the shine off both ends of the stamper, I put some white stamping polish on a Pueen plate and tried it out, large side first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this little double sided stamper!  </li>
            <li>cause it doesn&#x27;t pick the stamp of the picture which doesn&#x27;t clearly place the picture on nails</li>
            <li>But as I was reading through the reviews someone mentioned that and said to use an old gift card.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;ve started using an old gift card.</li>
            <li>the double sides is very convenient.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using an old credit card now.</li>
            <li>so I threw it out and began using an old gift card .</li>
            <li>Surprised with the quality.</li>
            <li>It was a complete surprise to my girlfriend  </li>
            <li>and she said she uses an old gift card...</li>
            <li>I found and old albertsons card.</li>
            <li>I have to use an old plastic gift card.</li>
            <li>I filed the surface a bit, but as far as I could tell it didn&#x27;t make a difference to the surface.</li>
            <li>I just threw it out, and began using an old gift</li>
            <li>I tossed it also and am using an old grocery store rewards card as the scraper.</li>
            <li>, I prefer an old credit card.  </li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t comment on the scrapper because I immediately threw it in a draw and grabbed an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li>instead used an old giftcard, at a 45 degree angle...</li>
            <li>OTHERS AM USING AN OLD PREPAID CARD.</li>
            <li>I hadn&#x27;t noticed how much of the image was left on the MASH stamper after the transfer to my nail.</li>
            <li>i now just use an old credit card</li>
            <li>My 12 year old loves this set and the ones given to her with it.  </li>
            <li>I found using and old card from a store (something LIKE a credit card).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using an old gift card as well, as stated by others.</li>
            <li>However, I am surprised they use a metal scraper as it scratches the plate.</li>
            <li>really should of just payed the extra two dollars or so for the Konad.</li>
            <li>No problem with the old stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I use an old credit card as a scraper now.</li>
            <li>I now just use a old credit card to scrape with and it works great.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Worth every penny spent on item.</li>
            <li>I gave up on full-coverage designs pretty quickly and tried a tiny little flower.  </li>
            <li>Be sure that you only use a little so that it will dry quickly as you&#x27;re working your way to the next finger.</li>
            <li>I also love that it is double ended so that you can use one side for small designs and the other for full nail designs.</li>
            <li>Aside from the pink rubber part popping out of the handle if I wipe the excess polish off a little too vigorously, this was a pretty good purchase considering it was less than $5!</li>
            <li>its a little small but its easy to clean and works well</li>
            <li>It doesnt clean the plate as it is supposed to, rather it scratches a little bit.</li>
            <li>Cant beat the price... love the product and of course (the pink and black coloring...</li>
            <li>I also love the color pink and black.</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m not able to get a smooth scrape.</li>
            <li>I tried the second stamper that I hadn&#x27;t filed, and was fresh out of the package, and I definitely think that filing it made a big difference.</li>
            <li>The large side of the stamp flattened out *just* enough to pick it up, but the smaller side was a no-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The big size can be used for full nail designs and the smaller one for single images.</li>
            <li>The small end is fine, and the scraper works well, but the large end (the end I use most) has a decent sized bump in the center of the rubber that makes clear and even stamping difficult.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t know how to use the stamp and scraper go on you tube and type in testing out French Tip Plates from New Bundle Monster</li>
            <li>Rough up the stamper with a few swipes of a nail file and it will pick up polish better.</li>
            <li>and to transfer it quickly and firmly.</li>
            <li>The silicon stamping caps are very slick and in order for them to pick up nail polish properly from the plate I had to softly and barely file the top,</li>
            <li>This left me pretty frustrated as sometimes you get a good crisp stamp and other times</li>
            <li>I looked at other brands and the cost was much higher.</li>
            <li>If you have time to mess around with it, it might be worth it.</li>
            <li>but I just use a knife to clean the edges because I am a little freakish about paint being left on it.</li>
            <li>Once you clean the ends, it *will* pick up polish, but it&#x27;s just too not-squishy to pick up all of anything but a small design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I never used any other before, so I can not compare, but it works as far as I know very well, the scraper is a bit off, but I presume all of them are.</li>
            <li>Based on other reviews, I switched to using an old grocery store club card (thinner plastic than a credit card, usually) and it works so well (even better than the Konad scraper) that it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li>One thing I noticed was the pink pads come out of the black holder really easily.  </li>
            <li>The designs were coming out too light where you could hardly see them and</li>
            <li>Luckily, the product arrived on time and the company was generous enough to give me a 10% off for next purchase (maybe a promo), but due to the faulty product I might not even order anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Have used multiple times thus far and seems durable.</li>
            <li>Mash you really should look into a plastic scraper and a harder rubber on the stamper.</li>
            <li>the blade was too short, so instead of removing the excess nail polish it would just push it all over the place, completely messing up your design.</li>
            <li>Though the scrapper should be thrown away and simply use an old credit card instead.</li>
            <li>only suggestion is to scrap the scraper part and use an old credit card or gift card instead, metal on metal scratchs the plates and can damage with time.</li>
            <li>use an old hotel card key or credit card instead.  </li>
            <li>The larger pink pad fell off the first day I received it and will not stay in.</li>
            <li>The surface of the stamper pad has this slight circular bleb right in the middle.  </li>
            <li>Only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because the large ended pink rubber dropped off while I was using it in.</li>
            <li>thanks i will be ordering some of your other designs</li>
            <li>I found: When you are passing the design from the plate to the stamper, don&#x27;t lift it up fast, do it slowly and in the same round-moving way as you pass then the design to the nail ;)</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s much less difference between Konand &amp; MASH on the small ends than the large ends, but for me, I like the full images</li>
            <li>A little tricky at first</li>
            <li>You need time to work on these in the beginning to line everything up right, and you already don&#x27;t have much time before the the thin layer of polish dries.</li>
            <li>The products are tough enough to be used regularly, even though the price is so cheap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m using regular nail polish and the MASH plates, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s necessary if you&#x27;re using special polish or Konad plates, but I compared the filed and non filed and the filing improved it picking up the color, and the quality of the image.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;Scraper&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s really a &amp;#34;Scratcher&amp;#34;, that ruins the stamp plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The large end is less mushy than the MASH stamp.</li>
            <li>The surface of the large pad was uneven and had a circle in the middle of it that was slightly raised higher than the rest of the stamper.</li>
            <li>Like most people I was frustrated at first.</li>
            <li>It transferred less messier but it did not transfer the whole dot</li>
            <li>For less than 3 dollars I really can&#x27;t complain, it serves its&#x27; purpose.</li>
            <li>so you have a large stamper and a little stamper.  </li>
            <li>The only thing is they are not wide enough to do your big toe.</li>
            <li>Easy to use but does take some practice to get the images not to look sloppy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll absolutely  buy MASH products again, but if my little dogs eat the MASH stamper it will not be replaced.</li>
            <li>Takes a  little practice but he was able to do her nails after just a few tries.</li>

            <li> I am extremely happy with this purchase</li>
            <li> great quality.</li>
            <li> This worked great for me after I buffed/filed the ends a bit.</li>
            <li> The stamper is great but the scraper scratches the heck out of your plates(as would any metal scraper).</li>
            <li> I love the product!!</li>
            <li> so I love it!!</li>
            <li> This came on time and is very nice.</li>
            <li> Any who, AMAZING stamper!</li>
            <li> I would say this product is mostly successful.</li>
            <li> Love this stamper, it&#x27;s every bit as good as Konad!!</li>
            <li> Stamper isn&#x27;t always 100% successful with any of my plates.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of stamping, its not as easy as it looks for beginners, but this Stamper is perfect!</li>
            <li> The scraper is good for one thing and that is SCRATCHING the plates, it doesn&#x27;t remove the polish well.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t come out as good as I though it would</li>
            <li> because i can&#x27;t see the images/designs of the stamper too good.  </li>
            <li> My daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> It is a good product though and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I also purchased the mash nail plates, it seemed like a good price.</li>
            <li> The rubber is perfect for the transfers and doesn&#x27;t push inside the holder (as the cheaply made As Seen On TV set</li>
            <li> The stamper itself is good.</li>
            <li> A good addition to my nail kit.</li>
            <li> I have followed every instruction you can find out there to make this work and can never get a good stamp.  </li>
            <li> It was like the sun came out and all was good</li>
            <li> The shipping was great and it has came in handy.....</li>
            <li> Based on the good reviews, I figured it&#x27;d be fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sometimes the image would look good and sometimes not.</li>
            <li> You need to check the image before applying to ensure it&#x27;s good, and then time to line it up.</li>
            <li> The design doesn&#x27;t go from the stamper to your nail that good either.</li>
            <li> good for backup</li>
            <li> The stamper in good, I selected 4 stars because when I got it looked like used but works as it should.</li>
            <li> Gave this scraper its fair chance and it scraped the heck out of my image plate causeing lots of scratches and did not all the paint off the plate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m looking forward for more beautiful products from you.   </li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly and the nail art plate stamp and scraper worked perfectly.</li>
            <li> Really happy with the products, very accurate description.  </li>
            <li> So I bought four thinking: \\&quot;great deal introductory price maybe it would be better than konad.\\&quot; ...</li>
            <li> This product helps me make a more detail design on my nails and it does make a great stamp on the design I choose to wear on my nails.</li>
            <li> so there were a number of fingers that got more of the stamp than the nail did LOL)</li>
            <li> Nice product, works good</li>
            <li> This product picks up the nail polish right off the metal and stamps on to your very own nail making life easier than driving way to the salon to get your nails done!!!</li>
            <li> I even switched them between the two brands just to be sure &amp; the fit is perfect.  </li>
            <li> I love the Mash system!</li>
            <li> Love this stamper!</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my purchase of the double-sided nail stamper and scraper by MASH!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time doing stamping nail art, but I&#x27;m happy with all mash tools!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> I love it!</li>
            <li> It is exactly as pictured and yes it stamps beautifully!.</li>
            <li> Love how it works! ...............</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect it to be an amazing product for the price you pay.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re getting into nail stamping, MASH has amazing products.</li>
            <li> and I liked thAt.</li>
            <li> If you have experience stamping, the set is nice.</li>
            <li> I liked it.</li>
            <li> it looks nice.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about</li>
            <li> Nice product with nice selection of plates.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets and the rubber has some kind of flaw,  like and air bubble when it was manufactured.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s nice that it comes with the scraper</li>
            <li> I liked that you could just buy these items together if that was your cup of tea.  </li>
            <li> Picks up image and transfer nicely.</li>
            <li> :) good luck.</li>
            <li> The stamper has some nice flexibility to it.</li>
            <li> If you are good at this sort of thing than I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t have a problem.</li>
            <li> This stamper does not pick up the image off the plate no matter what kind of polish I use.</li>
            <li> It was superior to the MASH stamper, and I&#x27;m glad I got it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stamper is nicely made.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what kind of nail polish I use, it just doesn&#x27;t work well.  </li>
            <li> very good service, shipped right away , product was just as stated.</li>
            <li> The package got here very quickly, but the stamper is not picking up the image that good...</li>
            <li> I was most impressed withe the fast delivery date</li>
            <li> I was very surprised that the scrapper also works flawlessly.</li>
            <li> They work great and very easy to clean :) once you start using these tools you will not want to stop.</li>
            <li> This makes having on of a kind nails better.</li>
            <li> Still, I&#x27;m going to suggest that people who are comfortable with a softer stamper or who get good results with them should probably avoid this one.  </li>
            <li> I love this product, I do my own nails and love to do designs on them.</li>
            <li> The stamper works great and easy to clean.  </li>
            <li> The product came very fast and works great.</li>
            <li> It took me about 3 times to really get it perfect but totally worth the value!</li>
            <li> This product does exactly what it says it does, and comes at a great price.</li>
            <li> But was quickly upset when I couldn&#x27;t get any good results.</li>
            <li> I got these very quickly and packed up nicely.</li>
            <li> Very easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Konaid products are much better..</li>
            <li> I used it with the hello kitty plate from bornpretty and the scraper most times takes ALL the polish off of the plate.</li>
            <li> Thank you..... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> I watched many tutorials on how to use it</li>
            <li> it will work better.</li>
            <li> The stamper was just okay.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE the MASH</li>
            <li> I love this item, I plan on buying more stamping plates to widen my variety.  </li>
            <li> okay</li>
            <li> better cause the colors I use work better with it.  </li>
            <li> I think scraper works better with salon express one too.</li>
            <li> Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure about this stamp.</li>
            <li> Much better and gentler on the disks.</li>
            <li> Great Products and fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> Got more than one thing but everything I got</li>
            <li> This is a great product which is much cheaper than Konad.  </li>
            <li> I love the coloring of the item.  </li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant about going with MASH over Konad after reading some of the reviews, but I  m glad I did.</li>
            <li> so I will be able to tell when I use that one.</li>
            <li> So, I know she will love these.</li>
            <li> love the stamper and the scraper.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> If you just want to get your manicure done, buy a better quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a neat &amp; interesting idea.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll get a stamper and a scraper, and I&#x27;ll admit that I bought this product because I like the color more than others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can now do many drawings on my nails.&lt;br</li>
            <li> That works much better.</li>
            <li> Scraper is okay</li>
            <li> I love both the stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li> my daughter and I have been doing our nails together and the ease of using this product makes it enjoyable</li>
            <li> The color of the stamper is deeper purple than shown here, which helps some nail polishes show, letting you position the stamper better.</li>
            <li> A credit card works better than the scraper.  </li>
            <li> I LOVE THE STAMPER, THE SCRAPER</li>
            <li> Good buy, but not crazy about the metal scraper, it leaves scratches on the plates.</li>
            <li> Plastic works better.</li>
            <li> I have been doing more with hand painted work then with the stamper</li>
            <li> so I need to set some time aside to practice more.  </li>
            <li> Stamper is ok.</li>
            <li> Most often with Konad</li>
            <li> I did find the MASH plates of excellent quality and left a 5 star review on those.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s how much better</li>
            <li> I find this method easier, although, I&#x27;ve seen many people online work well with the rolling method.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Metallics of most any brand seem to work well.</li>
            <li> The scraper works ok.</li>
            <li> they work better and do not  scratch.</li>
            <li> eh eh.it is okay quality.</li>
            <li> My daughter is going to love it when she gets it for Christmas.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> and I hope it works out better.</li>
            <li> Ended up buying a Konad stamper that worked perfectly with the same plates and polish</li>
            <li> I plan on trying a Konad stamper and seeing if this works better.</li>
            <li> Lots and lots of practice for sure.</li>
            <li> i mostly have &amp;#34;dry in 60 sec&amp;#34; paint and all i have used works.</li>
            <li> the firmer the better print.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not my favorite one</li>
            <li> but it does the ok.</li>
            <li> Their customer service is top notch though.</li>
            <li> The stamper is ok but the scraper scratches your plates.</li>
            <li> Works a lot better, not to mention that the metal on the scrapper would eventually damage the plates.</li>
            <li> but overall this product is great! :)</li>
            <li> , I tried to use many thing</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> I just placed an order for one, so hopefully i will better luck</li>
            <li> I was hoping it would work better...</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off using a razor blade, it worked better for me</li>
            <li> Love the way it creates designs.</li>
            <li> I like being able to create cute designs with my stamper.</li>
            <li> Sometimes has issues with picking up images though, but it seemed to work alright for most of mine.  </li>
            <li> and my grand daughter loves it</li>
            <li> and I thought this scraper looked like it would do a much better job then a credit card.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use the scraper, like others said it scratches the plates and an old credit card I had worked perfect, I also didn&#x27;t have to clean it off as often.</li>
            <li> You will have to practice once or twice to get comfortable with it, but it is honestly very very easy to use.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick and I am totally satisfied!</li>
            <li> : there&#x27;s thumb indentations for better gripping, rubber heads come off for easy cleaning, affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Product came on exact date and in good packing.</li>
            <li> At first this is going to be a slower process, which can lead to drying out the image and not getting a good transfer.</li>
            <li> but overall the product is amazing!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have the nail art plate stamp and scraper!</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received this order!</li>
            <li> A Better material could have been used, a smoother and gushy stamper, so the images would be picked up easily and transferred easily.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works great and nice for larger hands.</li>
            <li> Now that I know what I&#x27;m doing and have a better feel for it, I really enjoy being able to dress up my nails a bit.</li>
            <li> The stamper is very easy to clean.</li>
            <li> so it is great for to use pretty much any kind of nail polish you want.</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping and nice packaging will buy more MASH products.</li>
            <li> am very happy with it, the quality is great and I especially like that I got a big sized scraper along with it!!</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected but the construction is very good!</li>
            <li> Fast shipping will buy from seller again.works really good  </li>
            <li> Seems good, the konad one appears much softer though...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Stamp have good quality and my wife was a half of happy.</li>
            <li> The price is great &amp; amazon offers free shipping</li>
            <li> The scraper is easy to use, but I&#x27;ve noticed it does scratch the plates.</li>
            <li> She thought it was so easy to use</li>
            <li> Scraper gets clogged too easily though, needs to be cleaned after each nail.</li>
            <li> They make it look so easy.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use, I was worried it would take a while to figure out</li>
            <li> thought the Stamper and Plates would be easy to use, but they are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
            <li> Spend more money and buy a better brand, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It is so easy to use.</li>
            <li> glad so many people are having success with this stamper, but I just can&#x27;t make it work, so I went with two stars instead of one.  </li>
            <li> Nice pretty nail art.</li>
            <li> seem like work fine</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> it just scratches the plates a plastic card works just fine.</li>
            <li> AND IT WORKS FINE</li>
            <li> and it was fine.  </li>
            <li> clean is super handy, pass a cotton swab moistened with acetone and everything is clean.</li>
            <li> These make doing nail designs quick and easy not to mention fun!!</li>
            <li> I love the stamper its super easy to use and clean.</li>
            <li> If I need more stampers in the future, I&#x27;ll buy more of these, you can&#x27;t beat the price and it gets the job done! :)</li>
            <li> stamper was a HUGE letdown</li>
            <li> The nail polish I used wasn&#x27;t cheap or transparent either.</li>
            <li> The rubber on the stamp is easy to clean when I&#x27;m done</li>
            <li> The shipping was nice and fast.</li>
            <li> It really fits nicely in the hand.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap</li>
            <li> This stamper is great for the price because is double ended.</li>
            <li> The pads are removable so that you can clean them easily.</li>
            <li> I decided to order the Konad double stamper and scraper and it worked great</li>
            <li> There was something I saw on lightly using a nail file on the stamper</li>
            <li> and I really wanted my own set.</li>
            <li> Both items are easy to handle, hold and clean.</li>
            <li> Compared to both the free stamp pad that came with my Pueen plates and the super-squishy ones that come with the Cisi&amp;Sisi sets, it&#x27;s practically rock.  </li>
            <li> Makes that metal on metal sound too</li>
            <li> but I suggest buying cheap if you have never tried it before.</li>
            <li> for a firm stamper it is really nice pick up is great</li>
            <li> The stamper is cool, easy to hold, easy to use and clean.  </li>
            <li> Having two sides is very handy to fit different sizes images.</li>
            <li> If you have the time to keep doing it over until you get it right, it&#x27;s ok.</li>
            <li> This worked great, the stamper was easy to clean and worked well; the scraper left small scratches on the discs, but they still work wonderfully.</li>
            <li> I am trying to save money and learn to do this myself - this was a very economical beginning.</li>
            <li> scraper is good it has metal not like the plastic ones thats great, but the stamper never seems to pick up the image its really shiny unlike my usual one that works better.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use.</li>
            <li> They are super easy to wash up just by rubbing them with nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;What</li>
            <li> The delivery was fast and the products were exactly what I wanted and the price was good.</li>
            <li> Its a very economical price &amp; the stamper is dual just like a original Konad stamper.</li>
            <li> Price is ok, and I like very much that scraper is not plastic.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is good, although I don&#x27;t like the scraper the double ended stamper works great.</li>
            <li> Once you get the hang of it your golden!</li>
            <li> , my nails came out beautifully (After a bit of practice), I spent 5 hours trying designs</li>
            <li> My 3 stars is pretty generous :)</li>
            <li> it is so much fun!</li>
            <li> I was so excited I immediately grabbed a bunch of polishes that I was told worked with stamping, my plates, and set to work.</li>
            <li> It seems to work better then the first time and transferred \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really worth it!</li>
            <li> This is the kind of thing you can live without it once you had use</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t clean off the surface, it just scratches the plate and leaves tons of polish on the plate surface.</li>
            <li> the polish doesn&#x27;t all come off the stamper like I have seen in some video on stamping I have watched and have to clean the stamper with nail polish remover to get it off.  </li>
            <li> You always have to clean after each finger nail you stamp.</li>
            <li> Also, after I was done decorating my nails,  I had to have my husband clean off the excess polish on the scraper</li>
            <li> You have to clean before use with alcohol, otherwise won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> As far as the stamper goes, I absolutely LOVE it!</li>
            <li> and if you get the right consistency of nail polish it looks really cool!</li>
            <li> sure to use pure acetone, and clean the image in between each use.</li>
            <li> I did many side by side comparison using different plates and polishes, on paper mostly, and I could easily notice a difference in Konad.</li>
            <li> It went right in the trash!</li>
            <li> I have never done my nails before and it was super easy to make fun nails with my friends.</li>
            <li> , I tried again with a bright red nail art polish and a Gals</li>
            <li> Packaging was nice,each plate was individual and in good condition.</li>
            <li> MASH Double Sided Nail Art it is good for use</li>
            <li> The scraper is really nice, however I prefer to use old giftcards as they don&#x27;t scratch the image plates.</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was cute, but it really works.</li>
            <li> Leaves a cool effect.</li>
            <li> This affects the full nail images because they are supposed to look uniform all over the nail.  </li>
            <li> recommend it cause it works for what it is meant to be for a good low price.</li>
            <li> works great, was nervous at first cause of the bad reviews but it works great, i prefer  a plastic card over the scraper!</li>
            <li> This little tool works nicely and adds a nice touch to any nail design.  </li>
            <li> At first I blamed it on the stencils, but it turns out the stencils are fine.</li>
            <li> As an added bonus, as if the product isn&#x27;t great enough already, the shipping is also super fast.</li>
            <li> I love the colors on this and love how it is double sided!</li>
            <li> The designs roll onto the nail as they should, and I&#x27;ve been able to use many of my regular polishes to stamp with.</li>
            <li> gets it done quickly.</li>
            <li> This was the first stamper I bought for my intro into nail art stamping I mostly bought it instead of the Konad because I could get it quicker (wanted it for a weekend visit with my little niece) and liked the color better than Konad.</li>
            <li> Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> It will do nothing but scratch your pretty mirrored plates, no matter how lightly you scrape.  </li>
            <li> I do nails for myself and my friends &amp; family and so far they love it!The scraper is a pain to clean off if you use thicker polish (which I recommend)</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this at such a cheap price, and a cute color.</li>
            <li> The stamp picked up the images wonderfully, I also went for the MASH bundle of plates, which I find are very high quality, not sharp, deeply etched.</li>
            <li> I had even ordered two of these since they were such a good deal and tried both out to see if maybe the first one was a dud.  </li>
            <li> I will definitely order more MASH products!</li>
            <li> but once you&#x27;ve practiced a few times it&#x27;s easy to get a good stamp on your nail.</li>
            <li> The Pink and Black is perfect for me :)</li>
            <li> this stamper is nice, picks up well although there seems to be a flat section on the very top which can leave a blank spot if I press too hard.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and they immediately sent me a complimentary stamp and scraper set.</li>
            <li> If you like to have fun with your nails, this is for you.</li>
            <li> better off using an old credit card.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth it for the price.</li>
            <li> They are having lots of fun with them.</li>
            <li> Grandaughters and me tried to use and just isn&#x27;t worth the time.</li>
            <li> It is a fun product to use.</li>
            <li> Totally worth the purchase just for the stamper.</li>
            <li> So, Konad wins in this area.</li>
            <li> its better to use an old credit card or gift card.</li>
            <li> I am having fun with all my designs.</li>
            <li> You really have to go slowly and be patient if you want it to be perfect, not every try works out.</li>
            <li> I got more luck using an old gift card.</li>
            <li> I do have fun.</li>
            <li> the stamper works well and picks much the images most of the time and if it doesn&#x27;t then it was most likely a fault of mine.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves having &amp;#34;mother daughter dates&amp;#34; and using this to make fun nail art.</li>
            <li> This is a fun way to do nails.</li>
            <li> I have always read that an old credit or gift card works better as a scraper</li>
            <li> I enjoy that it is pretty quick to use, but the thing really should have come with a set of instructions.</li>
            <li> Love it, works better than my other stamper.</li>
            <li> When the first one was defective I quickly got a replacement sent to me.</li>
            <li> my two older teens tried using it and they love it, they just couldn&#x27;t get it to apply the paint very well.  </li>
            <li> was excited to do my nails but that excitement ended very soon.  </li>
            <li> it wont work right</li>
            <li> I started stamping right away.</li>
            <li> Kept it the two days until my konad stamper came, then I tossed it right out.</li>
            <li> i didnt use the right nail polish.</li>
            <li> Not only does it makes my hands look pretty, but my feet look as amazing with this product.</li>
            <li> The scraper works very well, as in all nail polish comes off clean.</li>
            <li> It is less than two dollars more to get the Konad and it works much better.</li>
            <li> The shipping was really fast too so that is cool.</li>
            <li> but the stamper does not pick up the image very effectively and the scraper makes a very big mess of this it does not scrape very clean.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and just as described.</li>
            <li> The stamper gets the design completely and passes it easily to the nail.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The stamper seems a bit hard, taking it out and kneeling it will soften it, making it slightly easier for the polish to transfer (depending on what brand you&#x27;re using) very happy with the purchase :)</li>
            <li> It has a big side and then a small side at the top very nice</li>
            <li> A little trial and error will give good results.</li>
            <li> Great size to hold in the hand without making it hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> It can be because it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever done nail stamping.</li>
            <li> First off, I could not get this thing to work for the life of me.</li>
            <li> The MASH double sided nail art plate stamp an scraper is a great option for those who wants to buy a product similar to konad one.</li>
            <li> it was my first time buying any of nail art items</li>
            <li> I got one from salon express because the rubber part of stamper is white and it works okay too.</li>
            <li> I first purchased a cheap old stamp from walmart, which wasn&#x27;t picking up anything.  </li>
            <li> this Stamper and Scraper was my first purchase.</li>
            <li> If anyone is interested i&#x27;ll post pictures.</li>
            <li> I love the bigger handle size of the stamper</li>
            <li> No need to pay more for a brand name as this works just the same.</li>
            <li> To me, the scraper part was pretty much just junk!</li>
            <li> Product was exactly as described, mom will love her Christmas present.</li>
            <li> Item was exactly what was shown.</li>
            <li> I have used MASH stamps before, and those are exactly as i thought they would be.</li>
            <li> First of all, mine didn&#x27;t come with a scraper.  </li>
            <li> This came well packaged and ready to use!</li>
            <li> First off: throw away the scraper.  </li>
            <li> works well and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I wish i knew how to use the actual stamps and stamp pens better</li>
            <li> Would definitely order again in fact I&#x27;m going to order one more jic this one gets lost.</li>
            <li> I ordered the stamper and scrapper when I first started stamping.</li>
            <li> I had to get my first one replaced because it was defective.</li>
            <li> First of all, the scraper scratches the plate.</li>
            <li> This was my first set of scraper/stamper for my nail stamping plate set.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This was my first stamper purchase.</li>
            <li> Received this set so quickly and its decent.  </li>
            <li> It does take some practice to get the pictures straight on your nail, but it does the trick!</li>
            <li> The set arrived and was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> I threw it away after the first use and use a plastic rewards card instead.</li>
            <li> I first discovered the world of nail stamp art at a girls night</li>
            <li> I had that one first and bought these as extras because they were a bit cheaper.</li>
            <li> Even if you don&#x27;t buy Konad plates, their stamper is nearly the same price, and it works much better because the rubber is even and smooth.</li>
            <li> The stamper works pretty well</li>
            <li> i did notice that you need to make sure there is enough paint to fill all the grooves.</li>
            <li> This was the first stamper I bought.</li>
            <li> This was my first stamper/ scraper set.</li>
            <li> It took me a bit to get the hang of using this (My first time</li>
            <li> My daughter and I used this today for the first time.  </li>
            <li> so very speedy!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using a nail art stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li> First time nail art enthusiast</li>
            <li> First things first:  I threw out the scraper in favor of a keychain-sized discount card.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to spend some more time on YouTube to see if anyone else has the same issue, or any suggestions.  </li>
            <li> Got this as my first stamper.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get a clear, precise looking stamp.</li>
            <li> This is my first stamper</li>
            <li> This really is a great little stamp, lovely color, it&#x27;s double sided with a long barrel and really easy to use.</li>
            <li> I need to get my husband to file it or dull it somehow, other than that the image was good, and I didn&#x27;t use the scrapper, because it scratches the nail plate, but it came together, for the price it was good.</li>
            <li> Both the stamper and the cheeky plates had mixed reviews but there was more positive</li>
            <li> Personally, I will invest in the Konad double stamper because in the end, the investment will pay off time wise.</li>
            <li> Usually, the first time was good, but not after that.</li>
            <li> I have ordered multiple mash products lately and all were wonderful except for the stamper.</li>
            <li> it was a very reasonable price in comparison to others like it and did its job very well.</li>
            <li> It was just as described, and fast fast shipping!  </li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this kit to complete the whole nail art stamping set.</li>
            <li> but when I first tried Was very dificult</li>
            <li> I just stick to an old credit card for scraping now, and hey, no ugly scratches.</li>
            <li> I originally used polish remover with additives for strengthening and that turned out to be one of my major problems in the beginning.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I ordered this because of it&#x27;s size, and the big stamp makes it so easy to put prints or patterns on your toes or on your thumb</li>
            <li> But this too was easily fixed with some super glue.</li>
            <li> it is easy to use and the pink soft ends make it easy to see the pattern.  </li>
            <li> It shipped very fast intact wrapped in plastic brand new!</li>
            <li> , so I can&#x27;t compare but this one certainly serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> Everytime I try to stamp with the large pad, every image I stamped would not pick up the part of the image that touched the \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; area.</li>
            <li> Since I am new at stamping and nail art all together,  I will give this some more time to see if I can get it to work properly.  </li>
            <li> After testing the two side by side with several bundle monster plates and different polishes the Konad hands down works best.  </li>
            <li> This comes in handy if people have little nails.  </li>
            <li> For beginners though, it is hard to use and takes lots of practice to get good at it.</li>
            <li> The delivery was reAlly fast</li>
            <li> I really like the mash brand.</li>
            <li> but the pink of the stamper is not my favorite.</li>
            <li> but it was very inexpensive to do.</li>
            <li> Seem to be sturdy and arrived promptly thanks to my amazon prime account.</li>
            <li> It is for a gift for my teenage nieces which I hope they enjoy.</li>
            <li> Very upset at this product.</li>
            <li> It was shipped really fast.</li>
            <li> and then i much rather use the squishy ones</li>
            <li> The productis even better that i had expected.</li>
            <li> I really like this products.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think you really need an image plate for stamping your nails, just a paper towel.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> anyone has any tips or tricks,please feel free to email me (lilredshortie520@gmail.com) or respond back to this.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Really fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> The pads are really shiny and don&#x27;t pick up the images well at all.</li>
            <li> I really like this stamper</li>
            <li> thanks</li>
            <li> and it just was not working for me, the scraper was scraping too much off and would go into the design</li>
            <li> It picks up the images very well.</li>
            <li> NOT SO MUCH, I LIKE</li>
            <li> I ordered the Cheeky plates to use with this and not having much luck yet with it.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for the suggestions and keep bringing them if you have any....</li>
            <li> Maybelline Color Show metallics work very well.</li>
            <li> konad stamper picked up everthing while the mash picked up absolutely nothing.</li>
            <li> its not even a straight edge, its got a curve to it or something</li>
            <li> All in all, for the money spent, about 20$, including shipping, this is way better than those As seen on TV things.</li>
            <li> I cannot get the whole image to stick to my nail.  </li>
            <li> it is nice and firm</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell the MASH plates are great, but this stamper is no good.  </li>
            <li> Stamp is very easy to use, the scraper took a few times to learn the technique.</li>
            <li> Thank you for fast ship and high quality product.</li>
            <li> She wants to go to Paul Mitchell when she graduates high school, in 4 years, to study nail, hair, and make up.</li>
            <li> The second was shipped super fast, but just didnt work well.</li>
            <li> I love the colors much better than the pink &amp; green by konad.</li>
            <li> The product is cute and all, but it is not useful and not what it is described as.</li>
            <li> The large stamping side had a U shape dent in it and through the center there was a huge crack.</li>
            <li> Even pressing down harder and kind of rocking it a bit to cover more of the surface was not enough.  </li>
            <li> and i was having some trouble finding good enough plates.</li>
            <li> I love that it has the double end, although I&#x27;ve just been using the larger end.</li>
            <li> I was having high hopes for this stamper and scraper.</li>
            <li> highly recommend to girls who are in nail art</li>
            <li> I owned a Konad single stamper and it works great, but needed a two sided stamper for small designs.</li>
            <li> isn&#x27;t worth all the time it takes to use...very messy and not nail friendly</li>
            <li> I tried taking a file to the stamper and the results got a little better, but still weren&#x27;t what I wanted.</li>
            <li> That was easily fixed by replacing the scraper with a straight blade.</li>
            <li> this product is a great idea, but the application is difficult.</li>
            <li> It likes to leave streaks of nail polish, I find it much easier to use an old credit card.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple and straight forward.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a good size for my nails, but during cleaning, the little purple part comes loose sometimes --</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big deal because you can also push them back in easily.  </li>
            <li> the scraper scraped the plate its better to use an old credit card it will be less scratches</li>
            <li> I would just stamp to the side, but this blemish is RIGHT in the middle :</li>
            <li> You&#x27;re better off with using your card as a scraper and paying a little more for a konad stamper :/.</li>
            <li> I actually use a little plastic grocery store keyring card and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> I have to buy a new scraper before I can try it for myself though.</li>
            <li> NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories</li>
            <li> but i pulled it out and used my new plates</li>
            <li> I am new to the stamping world.  </li>
            <li> This is what I was really wanting and I really like the double sided stamper.  </li>
            <li> I was going to say that it&#x27;s a good product for the money until I realized that I only use 50% of the product and similar products are sold for less.</li>
            <li> This is only my first time using stamping plates, but I dont know if I will try again.</li>
            <li> When I first placed my order, I received only the stamper.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only one I bought for stamping, and it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
            <li> The removal rubber stamper inserts are the exact same size as konads as well.</li>
            <li> Instead of using this, I just took an old plastic gift card and used that in its place!</li>
            <li> so I would more use this for those small designs.</li>
            <li> though first that was me, but when I buy other brand I do not have more problems working with other brand, this do not work at all</li>
            <li> For the first few times I used this stamper it worked great, but after a while I noticed that the center of the stamper was picking up less polish than the outer area of the stamper.  </li>
            <li> Then I used it for the first time and realized that the scraper thing isn&#x27;t flat</li>
            <li> , I was certain it was possible to get it all to work.</li>
            <li> Once I cleaned the shine off both ends of the stamper, I put some white stamping polish on a Pueen plate and tried it out, large side first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this little double sided stamper!  </li>
            <li> cause it doesn&#x27;t pick the stamp of the picture which doesn&#x27;t clearly place the picture on nails</li>
            <li> But as I was reading through the reviews someone mentioned that and said to use an old gift card.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;ve started using an old gift card.</li>
            <li> the double sides is very convenient.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using an old credit card now.</li>
            <li> so I threw it out and began using an old gift card .</li>
            <li> Surprised with the quality.</li>
            <li> It was a complete surprise to my girlfriend  </li>
            <li> and she said she uses an old gift card...</li>
            <li> I found and old albertsons card.</li>
            <li> I have to use an old plastic gift card.</li>
            <li> I filed the surface a bit, but as far as I could tell it didn&#x27;t make a difference to the surface.</li>
            <li> I just threw it out, and began using an old gift</li>
            <li> I tossed it also and am using an old grocery store rewards card as the scraper.</li>
            <li> , I prefer an old credit card.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t comment on the scrapper because I immediately threw it in a draw and grabbed an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li> instead used an old giftcard, at a 45 degree angle...</li>
            <li> OTHERS AM USING AN OLD PREPAID CARD.</li>
            <li> I hadn&#x27;t noticed how much of the image was left on the MASH stamper after the transfer to my nail.</li>
            <li> i now just use an old credit card</li>
            <li> My 12 year old loves this set and the ones given to her with it.  </li>
            <li> I found using and old card from a store (something LIKE a credit card).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an old gift card as well, as stated by others.</li>
            <li> However, I am surprised they use a metal scraper as it scratches the plate.</li>
            <li> really should of just payed the extra two dollars or so for the Konad.</li>
            <li> No problem with the old stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I use an old credit card as a scraper now.</li>
            <li> I now just use a old credit card to scrape with and it works great.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Worth every penny spent on item.</li>
            <li> I gave up on full-coverage designs pretty quickly and tried a tiny little flower.  </li>
            <li> Be sure that you only use a little so that it will dry quickly as you&#x27;re working your way to the next finger.</li>
            <li> I also love that it is double ended so that you can use one side for small designs and the other for full nail designs.</li>
            <li> Aside from the pink rubber part popping out of the handle if I wipe the excess polish off a little too vigorously, this was a pretty good purchase considering it was less than $5!</li>
            <li> its a little small but its easy to clean and works well</li>
            <li> It doesnt clean the plate as it is supposed to, rather it scratches a little bit.</li>
            <li> Cant beat the price... love the product and of course (the pink and black coloring...</li>
            <li> I also love the color pink and black.</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not able to get a smooth scrape.</li>
            <li> I tried the second stamper that I hadn&#x27;t filed, and was fresh out of the package, and I definitely think that filing it made a big difference.</li>
            <li> The large side of the stamp flattened out *just* enough to pick it up, but the smaller side was a no-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The big size can be used for full nail designs and the smaller one for single images.</li>
            <li> The small end is fine, and the scraper works well, but the large end (the end I use most) has a decent sized bump in the center of the rubber that makes clear and even stamping difficult.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t know how to use the stamp and scraper go on you tube and type in testing out French Tip Plates from New Bundle Monster</li>
            <li> Rough up the stamper with a few swipes of a nail file and it will pick up polish better.</li>
            <li> and to transfer it quickly and firmly.</li>
            <li> The silicon stamping caps are very slick and in order for them to pick up nail polish properly from the plate I had to softly and barely file the top,</li>
            <li> This left me pretty frustrated as sometimes you get a good crisp stamp and other times</li>
            <li> I looked at other brands and the cost was much higher.</li>
            <li> If you have time to mess around with it, it might be worth it.</li>
            <li> but I just use a knife to clean the edges because I am a little freakish about paint being left on it.</li>
            <li> Once you clean the ends, it *will* pick up polish, but it&#x27;s just too not-squishy to pick up all of anything but a small design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I never used any other before, so I can not compare, but it works as far as I know very well, the scraper is a bit off, but I presume all of them are.</li>
            <li> Based on other reviews, I switched to using an old grocery store club card (thinner plastic than a credit card, usually) and it works so well (even better than the Konad scraper) that it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
            <li> One thing I noticed was the pink pads come out of the black holder really easily.  </li>
            <li> The designs were coming out too light where you could hardly see them and</li>
            <li> Luckily, the product arrived on time and the company was generous enough to give me a 10% off for next purchase (maybe a promo), but due to the faulty product I might not even order anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Have used multiple times thus far and seems durable.</li>
            <li> Mash you really should look into a plastic scraper and a harder rubber on the stamper.</li>
            <li> the blade was too short, so instead of removing the excess nail polish it would just push it all over the place, completely messing up your design.</li>
            <li> Though the scrapper should be thrown away and simply use an old credit card instead.</li>
            <li> only suggestion is to scrap the scraper part and use an old credit card or gift card instead, metal on metal scratchs the plates and can damage with time.</li>
            <li> use an old hotel card key or credit card instead.  </li>
            <li> The larger pink pad fell off the first day I received it and will not stay in.</li>
            <li> The surface of the stamper pad has this slight circular bleb right in the middle.  </li>
            <li> Only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because the large ended pink rubber dropped off while I was using it in.</li>
            <li> thanks i will be ordering some of your other designs</li>
            <li> I found: When you are passing the design from the plate to the stamper, don&#x27;t lift it up fast, do it slowly and in the same round-moving way as you pass then the design to the nail ;)</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s much less difference between Konand &amp; MASH on the small ends than the large ends, but for me, I like the full images</li>
            <li> A little tricky at first</li>
            <li> You need time to work on these in the beginning to line everything up right, and you already don&#x27;t have much time before the the thin layer of polish dries.</li>
            <li> The products are tough enough to be used regularly, even though the price is so cheap!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using regular nail polish and the MASH plates, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s necessary if you&#x27;re using special polish or Konad plates, but I compared the filed and non filed and the filing improved it picking up the color, and the quality of the image.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;Scraper&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s really a &amp;#34;Scratcher&amp;#34;, that ruins the stamp plates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The large end is less mushy than the MASH stamp.</li>
            <li> The surface of the large pad was uneven and had a circle in the middle of it that was slightly raised higher than the rest of the stamper.</li>
            <li> Like most people I was frustrated at first.</li>
            <li> It transferred less messier but it did not transfer the whole dot</li>
            <li> For less than 3 dollars I really can&#x27;t complain, it serves its&#x27; purpose.</li>
            <li> so you have a large stamper and a little stamper.  </li>
            <li> The only thing is they are not wide enough to do your big toe.</li>
            <li> Easy to use but does take some practice to get the images not to look sloppy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll absolutely  buy MASH products again, but if my little dogs eat the MASH stamper it will not be replaced.</li>
            <li> Takes a  little practice but he was able to do her nails after just a few tries.</li>
            <li> you are using a small stamp or large one it works for you, some of the larger stamps you need to have the larger stamp</li>
            <li> Little difficult to get the design correct on the nails, but that is most likely due to operator malfunction since it&#x27;s the first time with something like this.  </li>
            <li> I just (using the rougher side) filed a few times in one direction, and a few times in the perpendicular direction, then used some nail polish remover to clean it.</li>
            <li> I changed from the scraper that came with the set to using a cut up old credit card like was suggested in some of the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> I realize why other people suggest using plastic cards (old credit or club cards).</li>
            <li> As with other reviewers, we use an old give card, instead of the metal-edged scraper which came with the stamp, to scrape off excess polish, works well.</li>
            <li> I used.&lt;br /&gt;Double sided for both large and small images.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This was my first time using a product for nail art stamping other than Konad, and there was no significant difference in the way that it worked.</li>
            <li> rolling over the image doesn&#x27;t work well, try punching straight down and up instead, not hard and not fast, but firmly.</li>
            <li> I especially like that the scraper is not too sharp that it will scratch my plates if I&#x27;m not careful.</li>
            <li> I will never use another brand again as long as your quality stays the same.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s cheap, but still a TOTAL WASTE of $4.50</li>
            <li> Before I did that, it was hard to pick designs up, so I definitely recommend gently filling the ends with a nail file or buffer if you&#x27;re having problems.</li>
            <li> I only bought this because it was cheaper than the konad stamper,  but ended up spending more money because that&#x27;s what I ended up buying after this disappointment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a big fan of the Konad ones simply because it&#x27;s pink .</li>
            <li> Needed an extra stamper for one of my daughters since the other stamper and plate set I bought only had one stamp.</li>
            <li> I had a hard time figuring out just how to use the stamp and had to turn to Youtube to find out that you roll the stamp gently.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the scraper for a while, till I saw how badly it was scratching my image plates, and leaving streaks....</li>
            <li> Stamp works very well but the scraper sucks</li>
            <li> I cut it into 1 1/2 long strips and now I have 3 scrapers.</li>
            <li> took several tries to learn how to do use it but got the hang of it now.</li>
            <li> A complete waste of money.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t pick up the nail polish, and after multiple tries, it picks up blobs of nail polish rather than the intended image.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Again, it picked up only the center of the design.  </li>
            <li> After several frustrating attempts, I was unable to successfully get an image to even transfer from the plate to the stamper, much less my actual nail.  </li>
            <li> The scraper I got with it is metal, and wasn&#x27;t very flat or straight - it just won&#x27;t evenly scrape the polish no matter how I hold it - there&#x27;s always streaks left behind.  </li>
            <li> but ive watched so many YT tutorials that it seems simple enough, but to no avail the strapper is defected or something cuz it just moves the nail polish from either side... :(</li>
            <li> In a lot of other sets, I don&#x27;t think you can get the scraper without buying the plate, which makes it extra money.  </li>
            <li> Save yourself the hassle and buy the Konad brand, you will not be sorry for the few extra bucks you have to spend, it swipes cleanly and picks up the entire image.</li>
            <li> total waste of money, I&#x27;m switching back to my (single-sided) konad stamper.</li>
            <li> I tried using all 3 scrapers and EVERY SINGLE ONE scratches the stamp plate.</li>
            <li> Yeah it was only 5 bucks, but not worth it.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The only thing is that as was stated before these plates are very SHARP around the edges.</li>
            <li> but when you are working with a small stamp plate design you definitely need to have the smaller stamp for placement!  </li>
            <li> But you only get half of your moneys worth.&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> Seriously, can anyone make a decent scraper?</li>
            <li> Only about half of it shows.</li>
            <li> Pay the extra $1 (or less) and go for the Konad stamper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried several times and either a)nothing comes off or b)maybe a quarter or half comes off from the design.</li>
            <li> The smaller end probably needs to be primed and buffed with a nail file slightly, as it doesn&#x27;t do so well.  </li>
            <li> when i opened the stamper, I noticed the large pad had what looked like a thin slice</li>
            <li> metal bad on plates... if they get a plastic scraper it would be better.</li>
            <li> My personal opinion--don&#x27;t waste the money on this one.  </li>
            <li> I refused to buy the Konad stamper because it was pink (I don&#x27;t like pink)</li>
            <li> The scraper is a waste of time it only scratches the image plates.</li>
            <li> Nail plate was just as I expected.</li>
            <li> So be careful when handling or opening.</li>
            <li> this was a total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> the pink thingy does fall out.</li>
            <li> I felt I wasted my money big time on four</li>
            <li> and it would be a waste to have to pay to ship them back</li>
            <li> Buying the pink Konad one instead</li>
            <li> , I expected it on the 18th</li>
            <li> The rubber isn&#x27;t thick enough -- I kept getting a donut shaped pattern on every nail and the stamp wouldn&#x27;t pick up anywhere else, and finally realized that it was the plastic portion of the scraper pushing through.</li>
            <li> you either have to to a double layer or a half design if you don&#x27;t want it to overlap!</li>
            <li> The metal scraper on the other hand is a total waste.  </li>
            <li> This set was completly useless to me, the scraper left way too much polish on the plate - never a clean swipe.  </li>
            <li> Nothing was on the end but the very center of the design, because the stamp pad on this thing is almost as hard as a freaking pencil eraser--it barely has any give at all.  </li>
            <li> when i go to use it on the other hand</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t know how other brands work</li>
            <li> The stamper on the other hand works well.</li>
            <li> I am not exaggerating when I say they are sharp.</li>
            <li> I was not willing to exchange 5-6 dollars item waist of time and money.</li>
            <li> So the scrapers are pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> On time and everything as expected!</li>
            <li> This seller also delivered the item by the due date with no issues.</li>
            <li> Practice on fake finger nails first.</li>
            <li> During mani sessions, I usually use tape or a lint roller sheet to take off the extra polish, but I swipe it again with nail polish remover every now and then.</li>
            <li> As in the stamp works, but the scraper is pretty much useless.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sad because I really wanted to try stamping!</li>
            <li> Does what we expected, but the construction is a little flimsy, but about what we expected for the price.  </li>
            <li> It was very rough, and scratched the hell out of the one plate</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t mind that the rubber with this black stamper was pink.</li>
            <li> The scraper does scratch the plates a little if you careful but all scrapers from ever company do, and i dont mind it has no effect on the quality of the plates.</li>
            <li> Scraper works half the time, and other times it will not scrape off the excess nail polish neatly for a crisp-clear image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Definitely too hard for someone who&#x27;s always on the go like me.</li>
            <li> Not worth the intro price.  </li>
            <li> the scraper is even worse, it doesn&#x27;t scrap the excess nail polish away completely...</li>
            <li> The stamper also fell apart after a few uses (pink parts fell out).</li>
            <li> It takes a few tries to master it.</li>
            <li> Thick and thin lines in the images will pick up better or worse based on that.</li>
            <li> I frequently had to redo my nails because of how poorly the stamper picked up the polish.  </li>
            <li> So, the scraper is worthless (my shopping card worked better) and the stamper would NOT pick up polish at all.</li>
            <li> I sat down with this one and the Konad one and did some comparing.  </li>
            <li> I had to file them down a bit, it was scratching up my stamps.</li>
            <li> But other than that, no complaints!</li>
            <li> The scraper might be a little sharp on the corners.</li>
            <li> Not worth the money for an items that do a half job.</li>
            <li> Half off the designs won&#x27;t even go on the stamper.</li>
            <li> ...I tried to do this again using black on orange.  </li>
            <li> I do like the two size stamps, the smaller end is easier on small stamps and small fingers.</li>
            <li> I looked at it and there seems to be no glue attaching it to the black part at all.</li>
            <li> I always test the polish by opening in the store and taking out the brush to let a little slide down the inside of the bottle.</li>
            <li> not cool.  </li>
            <li> In the end it just make a mess.  </li>
            <li> so I didn&#x27;t mess up my nails.</li>
            <li> Complete waste of money and a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> The scraper sucked, it kills the plates easily with scratches, 80% of the time smears the polish and works like crap.</li>
            <li> i found it to be a little tricky to use..</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it made a difference, but going off of other reviewers before I used them</li>
            <li> If anyone is having a problem with the surface of their stamper not picking up images or being too shiny, try buffing it a little bit with a nail file to see if that helps at all.</li>
            <li> nothing a little superglue won&#x27;t fix, but it was a little</li>
            <li> Cotton ball with a little nail polish remover</li>
            <li> So it turned out messy.</li>
            <li> I scraped it a few times to try n get the excess polish away from the design</li>
            <li> , it was uneven and scratched a few of my plates...</li>
            <li> The surface was uneven which</li>
            <li> The MASH stamper and scraper is really a waste my money and time.</li>
            <li> The scraper doesn&#x27;t work, this is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> They did suggest to buff the stamper if it was having trouble picking up the paint.</li>
            <li> The scrapper was lopsided and uneven.</li>
            <li> Before it arrived I got the MASH stamper to work well, and thought I&#x27;d wasted my money on the Konad stamp.</li>
            <li> Might look into buying something else for heavy use.</li>
            <li> that well and the amount of nail polish is uneven.  </li>
            <li> The scraper was uneven and did not scrape off the polish, but rather scratched the heck out of my plate.</li>
            <li> scraper was harsh on my plates and didn&#x27;t quite do the job sometimes.</li>
            <li> Larger rubber head works but not great</li>
            <li> I am having trouble with it.  </li>
            <li> there are always sections of my nail missing polish.  </li>
            <li> , I use my old NRA card (very thin plastic) and it works like a dream.</li>
            <li> Scrapper is a little bit small, but works fine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> the scraper scratches the stamps and is not very effective.</li>
            <li> It scratches the little nail disks to heck!</li>
            <li> :/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty disappointed</li>
            <li> I just recently became obsessed with nail art and</li>
            <li> As for shipping , my package was actually delayed because they had sent it to the wrong post office but MASH isn&#x27;t to blame for that . . .</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened</li>
            <li> The scrapers/stampers however are a complete disappointment.</li>
            <li> The scraper was a waste!</li>
            <li> Not sure if that should happen</li>
            <li> Like the stamper since it has the small stamper end too.</li>
            <li> but the designs look small when i use it on my boyfriend when practicing.</li>
            <li> im not sure</li>
            <li> You think it is lined up and when you put it on, it like it totally goes the wrong spot.</li>
            <li> I am not sure If its is just me</li>
            <li> : the small rubber head doesn&#x27;t work at ALL.</li>
            <li> I had read some previous comments, so i knew to expect this but for those unaware it can be dangerous.</li>
            <li> its to hard,</li>
            <li> It is too hard and not that &#x27;gummy&#x27; so the nail polish gets stuck....</li>
            <li> The scrapper sucks.</li>
            <li> then negative</li>
            <li> The actual stamper was another disappointment, the designs never came off fully or well maintained no matter how I did them.</li>
            <li> The scraper sucks.</li>
            <li> You can see how thick and opaque a polish is like that.</li>
            <li> this works but is not amazing</li>
            <li> I was totally disappointed about my newly plates with the scraper that came with this product.</li>
            <li> or they are just bad in general.</li>
            <li> but i know the imperfections boil down to user error (ill keep practicing and become a pro</li>
            <li> and I wanted to see if less expensive alternatives work.</li>
            <li> I was a little angry with the price of shipping</li>
            <li> The stamper is just not good quality.</li>
            <li> I learned to use an old plastic gift card a ling time ago in lieu of the metal scraper as they scratch the crap out of the image plates.</li>
            <li> so Im not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong?</li>
            <li> Though some people have complained about scrapers scratching their plates, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this scraper!</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because I am not sure if I am doing something wrong or if this stamper just doesn&#x27;t transfer the image over.</li>
            <li> Now I have to find out if they make any other image plates!!!!!</li>
            <li> When I say scraper, I mean SCAPEr!</li>
            <li> As others have said, the scraper&#x27;s are usually not great.  </li>
            <li> However this one was much worse than the Konad</li>
            <li> This is extremely frustrating and discouraged....</li>
            <li> Not happy with the product</li>
            <li> I t put me behind.  </li>
            <li> Not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> Used once; to frustrating to use.  </li>
            <li> That didn&#x27;t annoyed me since I have the Konad scraper, but if you need one you may want to used a plastic card instead.</li>
            <li> The quality was clearly poor and the rubber for the stamper fell out as soon as I picked it up.</li>
            <li> Whomever designed this obviously never used it on metal plates before because the scraper scratches the crap out of them.  </li>
            <li> was a little shocked by how well it works.</li>
            <li> and I bought this with high expectations, but it failed miserably.</li>
            <li> SO Im a little disappointed that I dont have the scraper.</li>
            <li> as it should nothing was wrong with the packaging or the shpping.</li>
            <li> Unable to use it.</li>
            <li> but sorry that was it.</li>
            <li> I watched a lot of Youtube tutorials and couldn&#x27;t understand what I was doing wrong</li>
            <li> Completely disappointed :/.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The scraper is useless.</li>
            <li> I was so WRONG.</li>
            <li> Definitely disappointed, I&#x27;m going to order the Konad stampers and scrapers, because at least i know those will work like they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> but when i received it i was unhappy.</li>
            <li> Almost impossible to use on yourself.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so bad</li>
            <li> , THE SCRAPER SCRATCHES THE PLATES SO BAD.</li>
            <li> if i just got a bad scraper</li>
            <li> &#x3D;(</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I was so disappointed.  </li>
            <li> The scraper I noticed scratched the crap out of my stamping plates</li>
            <li> I am in nail school and all of the girls that got this set hate the scraper.</li>
            <li> it just scratched the crap out of my plates.</li>
            <li> I hate these.</li>
            <li> I was very frustrated when it didn&#x27;t work at all.  </li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  </li>
            <li> Scraper is awful.</li>
            <li> Really really really really really awful..</li>
            <li> The scraper is horrible as it is metal and it scratches the stamp plates.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> The worst part is that I bought two of these, so I could do nails with my friends, and they both have the defect.</li>
            <li> But, the stamper is terrible.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I bought the SHANY plates to try and this to use as a stamper and scraper. The scraper is good for one thing and that is SCRATCHING the plates, it doesn&#x27;t remove the polish well. and the stamper DOES NOT pick the images. I tried different plates thinking maybe the plates are defective, but it still didn&#x27;t work. I mean it&#x27;s cheap, but still a TOTAL WASTE of $4.50</li>
            <li> I gave it 4 stars because I thought scrapper doesn&#x27;t remove all the extra polish from the plate. It can be because it&#x27;s the first time I&#x27;ve ever done nail stamping. i will change my review as soon as I learn how to do it correctly.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t expect it to be an amazing product for the price you pay. Konaid products are much better..but this one does the job. i found it to be a little tricky to use.. It doesnt clean the plate as it is supposed to, rather it scratches a little bit.</li>
            <li> First off, I could not get this thing to work for the life of me. I used it with the hello kitty plate from bornpretty and the scraper most times takes ALL the polish off of the plate. If it doesnt, the stamper didnt actually pick anything up. This is only my first time using stamping plates, but I dont know if I will try again. Also, I was under the impression that it came with a plate, which it didnt. &#x3D;( not cool.  Help?</li>
            <li> Product came on exact date and in good packing. I&#x27;m looking forward for more beautiful products from you.   Thank you..... &#x3D;)</li>
            <li> The delivery was reAlly fast and I liked thAt. Packaging was nice,each plate was individual and in good condition. I went to try it today and it just didn&#x27;t transfer the image well. I tried the polka dot and the cheetah spots. The cheetah spots had excess polish around it because the scraper did not take off the polish around the design. So it turned out messy. I scraped it a few times to try n get the excess polish away from the design but some stayed which transferred ontO the stamper. The scraper left scratches on the plate.  I suggest maybe a softer scraper that won&#x27;t scratch the surface but will take off all excess polish. Same with the polka dot design. It transferred less messier but it did not transfer the whole dot it only made an outline of the dot. I watched many tutorials on how to use it so Im not sure what I&#x27;m doing wrong? The nail polish I used wasn&#x27;t cheap or transparent either. :/ I&#x27;m pretty disappointed but I might give it another shot another day. :|</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m so excited to have the nail art plate stamp and scraper! When I first placed my order, I received only the stamper. I e-mailed MASH, and they immediately sent me a complimentary stamp and scraper set. Now I have both, and they work beautifully! Thank you, MASH!</li>
            <li> I love this little double sided stamper!  weather you are using a small stamp or large one it works for you, some of the larger stamps you need to have the larger stamp but when you are working with a small stamp plate design you definitely need to have the smaller stamp for placement!  Works perfectly and even better at a perfect price!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> The MASH double sided nail art plate stamp an scraper is a great option for those who wants to buy a product similar to konad one. Price is ok, and I like very much that scraper is not plastic.</li>
            <li> This product didn&#x27;t come out as good as I though it would but I will do...the scraper scratches the nail plate  sometimes and sometimes the stamper won&#x27;t grab the design but it you file it it will work better.</li>
            <li> I sat down with this one and the Konad one and did some comparing.  As others have said, the scraper&#x27;s are usually not great.  However this one was much worse than the Konad one as I could not get it to wipe off all the polish.  The stamper was just okay.  After testing the two side by side with several bundle monster plates and different polishes the Konad hands down works best.  This left me pretty frustrated as sometimes you get a good crisp stamp and other times it&#x27;s patchy.  I had even ordered two of these since they were such a good deal and tried both out to see if maybe the first one was a dud.  After spending over an hour experimenting with it I went online and ordered another Konad stamper.  My personal opinion--don&#x27;t waste the money on this one.  It is less than two dollars more to get the Konad and it works much better.</li>
            <li> I am trying to save money and learn to do this myself - this was a very economical beginning. I would recomend this to anyone just starting to learn this craft.</li>
            <li> I LOVE the MASH Double sided nail art stamp and scraper!!! I got this today and I LOVE it!!! The only problem is that when you scrape the extra nail polish off the plate it leaves scratch marks. But as I was reading through the reviews someone mentioned that and said to use an old gift card. But other than that, no complaints! If you don&#x27;t know how to use the stamp and scraper go on you tube and type in testing out French Tip Plates from New Bundle Monster you&#x27;ll see how to use it and she gives you great tips and ideas!!!</li>
            <li> so i bought this when i was going through my nail art design phase and i was having some trouble finding good enough plates. i bought this and it looks as it should nothing was wrong with the packaging or the shpping. when i go to use it on the other hand im having difficulty scrapping off access nail polish. now im not an expert but ive watched so many YT tutorials that it seems simple enough, but to no avail the strapper is defected or something cuz it just moves the nail polish from either side... :(</li>
            <li> I was recieved this set and scarper wasn&#x27;t included. Because, I don&#x27;t know, how this set good.&lt;br /&gt;Stamp have good quality and my wife was a half of happy.</li>
            <li> Super easy to use. You will have to practice once or twice to get comfortable with it, but it is honestly very very easy to use. I was very surprised that the scrapper also works flawlessly. Between the price and quality of the product would say this is a must have! As an added bonus, as if the product isn&#x27;t great enough already, the shipping is also super fast. I ordered mine on Sunday and got it on Tuesday!</li>
            <li> This works great with the nail stamp designs.  If you like to have fun with your nails, this is for you.</li>
            <li> This is the first and only one I bought for stamping, and it&#x27;s awesome.&lt;br /&gt;No problem stamping from the fisrt time I used.&lt;br /&gt;Double sided for both large and small images.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how other brands work, so I can&#x27;t compare but this one certainly serves it&#x27;s purpose.</li>
            <li> I love the stamper its super easy to use and clean. The scraper I noticed scratched the crap out of my stamping plates so I&#x27;ve started using an old gift card.</li>
            <li> I refused to buy the Konad stamper because it was pink (I don&#x27;t like pink) but I didn&#x27;t mind that the rubber with this black stamper was pink. Any who, AMAZING stamper! I threw out the scraper because it scratched my plates, I use my old NRA card (very thin plastic) and it works like a dream. I have also heard Konad scrapers also scratch the plates, so there&#x27;s no \\&quot;Konda is better\\&quot; to be said about that. If you&#x27;re getting into nail stamping, MASH has amazing products.</li>
            <li> Needs directions and tips  on using this product, thankful for Instagram videos that help instead</li>
            <li> the rubber comes apart it wont work right</li>
            <li> If you have experience stamping, the set is nice. For beginners though, it is hard to use and takes lots of practice to get good at it. Almost impossible to use on yourself.</li>
            <li> I love this item, I plan on buying more stamping plates to widen my variety.  I really like the mash brand.</li>
            <li> The scraper is a waste of time it only scratches the image plates. The stamper on the other hand works well.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for my daughter and sister so they have not yet been used, but they came promptly and seem to be sturdy. I will update my review once they&#x27;ve been used.</li>
            <li> Nail plate was just as I expected. The only thing is that as was stated before these plates are very SHARP around the edges. So be careful when handling or opening. I had read some previous comments, so i knew to expect this but for those unaware it can be dangerous. I am not exaggerating when I say they are sharp. I need to get my husband to file it or dull it somehow, other than that the image was good, and I didn&#x27;t use the scrapper, because it scratches the nail plate, but it came together, for the price it was good. the stamper is very good I liked it. and have been using it often.</li>
            <li> Stamp works very well but the scraper sucks, it was uneven and scratched a few of my plates... better off using an old credit card.</li>
            <li> Overall this product is good, although I don&#x27;t like the scraper the double ended stamper works great. I would recommend the stamper but not the scraper.</li>
            <li> it was my first time buying any of nail art items so I didn&#x27;t know what to look for. they both work okay but the pink of the stamper is not my favorite. because i can&#x27;t see the images/designs of the stamper too good.  I got one from salon express because the rubber part of stamper is white and it works okay too. I like white one better cause the colors I use work better with it.  I think scraper works better with salon express one too.</li>
            <li> It came in the mail just when I needed it, and works great!&lt;br /&gt;I have another stamper but I ordered this because of it&#x27;s size, and the big stamp makes it so easy to put prints or patterns on your toes or on your thumb nails!!&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with it, the quality is great and I especially like that I got a big sized scraper along with it!!</li>
            <li> This review is only for the stamper because I immediately tossed out the scraper. I learned to use an old plastic gift card a ling time ago in lieu of the metal scraper as they scratch the crap out of the image plates. That goes for all brands, even konad.   Compared to my konad stamper, this mash version is up to par. I love the colors much better than the pink &amp; green by konad. The rubber surface seems to be identical to konad. The removal rubber stamper inserts are the exact same size as konads as well. I even switched them between the two brands just to be sure &amp; the fit is perfect.  The price is great &amp; amazon offers free shipping so I say go for it if you&#x27;re considering this purchase.</li>
            <li> Super fast delivery and just as described. Would buy from this seller again.  I did have to watch video to learn how to use as no instruction came with items.</li>
            <li> My daughter loved it.</li>
            <li> I love the colors on this and love how it is double sided! The double sides mae it easier to use.</li>
            <li> I love the Mash system! I had to purchase it all seperate but it was very inexpensive to do. Once you get the hang of it your golden! It took me about 3 times to really get it perfect but totally worth the value! I do nails for myself and my friends &amp; family and so far they love it!The scraper is a pain to clean off if you use thicker polish (which I recommend) but I just use a knife to clean the edges because I am a little freakish about paint being left on it. Love this stamper!</li>
            <li> this is a very good purchase. Definitely worth it for the price. Have used multiple times thus far and seems durable. the double sides is very convenient.</li>
            <li> Unable to use it. The surface was uneven which&lt;br /&gt;Does not allow a correct transfer. Is going to trash I was not willing to exchange 5-6 dollars item waist of time and money.</li>
            <li> I was having high hopes for this stamper and scraper. The package got here very quickly, but the stamper is not picking up the image that good...the scraper is even worse, it doesn&#x27;t scrap the excess nail polish away completely...So I order the KONAD one. The MASH stamper and scraper is really a waste my money and time.</li>
            <li> I first purchased a cheap old stamp from walmart, which wasn&#x27;t picking up anything.  this stamper is nice, picks up well although there seems to be a flat section on the very top which can leave a blank spot if I press too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked the scraper for a while, till I saw how badly it was scratching my image plates, and leaving streaks.... I&#x27;m using an old credit card now.</li>
            <li> it looks nice. seem like work fine but it dosen&#x27;t work the way like it should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I just recently became obsessed with nail art and this Stamper and Scraper was my first purchase. I&#x27;m still trying to get the hang of stamping, its not as easy as it looks for beginners, but this Stamper is perfect! I love that it has the double end, although I&#x27;ve just been using the larger end. The scraper is easy to use, but I&#x27;ve noticed it does scratch the plates. It is a good product though and it arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I purchased this stamper for the color ! I&#x27;m not a big fan of the Konad ones simply because it&#x27;s pink . This stamps and picks up the design perfectly . I wasn&#x27;t thrilled about the scraper cause it scratched one of my plates so I threw it out and began using an old gift card . As for shipping , my package was actually delayed because they had sent it to the wrong post office but MASH isn&#x27;t to blame for that . . . USPS is .</li>
            <li> I bought this stamper and scraper for the colors..but when i received it i was unhappy. Its dented on the larger rubber side..its also not as big as the konad stampers, which i suggest to buy instead. If anyone is interested i&#x27;ll post pictures.</li>
            <li> I am completely satisfied with my purchase of the double-sided nail stamper and scraper by MASH! It arrived on time, with perfect packaging! It works great, &amp; I have no complaints! Thank you!  :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened but my mash stamps will not pick up any images on the mash stamper. This is extremely frustrating and discouraged.... Not happy with the product</li>
            <li> I was so excited when I received this order! Then I used it for the first time and realized that the scraper thing isn&#x27;t flat so it doesn&#x27;t scrape off all of the nail polish as needed. That was easily fixed by replacing the scraper with a straight blade. The stamper also fell apart after a few uses (pink parts fell out). But this too was easily fixed with some super glue. For less than 3 dollars I really can&#x27;t complain, it serves its&#x27; purpose.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping will buy from seller again.works really good  Surprised with the quality. It was a complete surprise to my girlfriend  She thought it was so easy to use</li>
            <li> Gift items, haven&#x27;t been used yet. Seem to be sturdy and arrived promptly thanks to my amazon prime account. Will update review after Christmas.</li>
            <li> Nice product with nice selection of plates. Something for everybody.  Arrived promptly. It is for a gift for my teenage nieces which I hope they enjoy.</li>
            <li> I love the bigger handle size of the stamper but sorry that was it. The stamped itself is made of a softer material then the Konad one. So I just removed the rubber stamper from that one and traded it with the Mashnail one. Works great and nice for larger hands. Now on to the scraper. Its metal.... metal bad on plates... if they get a plastic scraper it would be better. Hint. Hint. I read another review and she said she uses an old gift card... I found and old albertsons card. I cut it into 1 1/2 long strips and now I have 3 scrapers. It depends on what angle you hold it when you scrap to get different results on different plates. But it works. Mash you really should look into a plastic scraper and a harder rubber on the stamper. Your plates are WONDERFUL. I will never use another brand again as long as your quality stays the same.</li>
            <li> It was just as described, and fast fast shipping!  The products are tough enough to be used regularly, even though the price is so cheap! Thank you!</li>
            <li> MASH Double Sided Nail Art it is good for use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;thank you&lt;br /&gt;thank you</li>
            <li> excelente producto lo recomiendo a mi esposa le ha funcionado de maravilla lo compre desde venezuela y llego en perfecto estado</li>
            <li> I feel this product does not work well. Half off the designs won&#x27;t even go on the stamper. Very upset at this product. Wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;I was a little shocked by how well it works. I wasn&#x27;t sure about this stamp. But i can&#x27;t stop using it. This makes having on of a kind nails better.</li>
            <li> Definitely too hard for someone who&#x27;s always on the go like me. The scraper doesn&#x27;t work, this is a waste of time.</li>
            <li> It was shipped really fast. I bought this product thinking it would speed the time when doing designs and it did not work. I ended up having to fix all the nails. I t put me behind.  I tried different nail polishes and none worked.</li>
            <li> I never used any other before, so I can not compare, but it works as far as I know very well, the scraper is a bit off, but I presume all of them are. And with this price, I like it a lot!</li>
            <li> its to hard, but i still use it every now and then i much rather use the squishy ones</li>
            <li> Great value for the money. I looked at other brands and the cost was much higher. I bought two for my granddaughters. They are having lots of fun with them. Perfect transaction.</li>
            <li> The product came very fast and works great. This was my first time using a product for nail art stamping other than Konad, and there was no significant difference in the way that it worked. Awesome.</li>
            <li> As far as the stamper goes, I absolutely LOVE it! No need to pay more for a brand name as this works just the same. I also love that it is double ended so that you can use one side for small designs and the other for full nail designs. They are super easy to wash up just by rubbing them with nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like is the scraper! When I say scraper, I mean SCAPEr! It scratches the little nail disks to heck! Instead of using this, I just took an old plastic gift card and used that in its place! Much better and gentler on the disks. To me, the scraper part was pretty much just junk! Oh well.....</li>
            <li> The stamp does not work at all, and the nail polish stuck on the stamp. I am so disappointed with it.</li>
            <li> I bought 2 sets and the rubber has some kind of flaw,  like and air bubble when it was manufactured. The metal scrapers are bent so I&#x27;m not able to get a smooth scrape. I have to use an old plastic gift card. So the scrapers are pretty much useless. I guess i got what i paid for.</li>
            <li> Thank you for fast ship and high quality product. Product was exactly as described, mom will love her Christmas present.</li>
            <li> Received order faster than what was quoted. Item was exactly what was shown. Worth every penny spent on item. Will do business again with the company in the future!</li>
            <li> Excelent product, great seller. The productis even better that i had expected. This is the kind of thing you can live without it once you had use</li>
            <li> Great Products and fast shipping.  Really happy with the products, very accurate description.  I really like this products.  Thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Got more than one thing but everything I got I can&#x27;t be happier !! On time and everything as expected! I will definitely be buying again!</li>
            <li> I ordered 3 sets of the scraper/stamper and the 2012 25 stamp set. I have used MASH stamps before, and those are exactly as i thought they would be. The scrapers/stampers however are a complete disappointment. I tried using all 3 scrapers and EVERY SINGLE ONE scratches the stamp plate. It doesn&#x27;t clean off the surface, it just scratches the plate and leaves tons of polish on the plate surface. Definitely disappointed, I&#x27;m going to order the Konad stampers and scrapers, because at least i know those will work like they&#x27;re supposed to.</li>
            <li> First of all, mine didn&#x27;t come with a scraper.  The rubber keeps falling out of the stamp, and it just plan doesn&#x27;t work!  Not happy with this at all.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the stamper and scraper yet, they&#x27;re a gift for my sister. I also purchased the mash nail plates, it seemed like a good price. The shipping was really fast too so that is cool.</li>
            <li> This is a great product which is much cheaper than Konad.  I like the fact that it&#x27;s double sided so you have a large stamper and a little stamper.  This comes in handy if people have little nails.  And it&#x27;s nice that it comes with the scraper so I didn&#x27;t have to buy it separately.  I don&#x27;t think you really need an image plate for stamping your nails, just a paper towel.  In a lot of other sets, I don&#x27;t think you can get the scraper without buying the plate, which makes it extra money.  I liked that you could just buy these items together if that was your cup of tea.  This seller also delivered the item by the due date with no issues.</li>
            <li> the scraper scratches the stamps and is not very effective. I am in nail school and all of the girls that got this set hate the scraper. They did suggest to buff the stamper if it was having trouble picking up the paint. I have to buy a new scraper before I can try it for myself though.</li>
            <li> My order arrived quickly and the nail art plate stamp and scraper worked perfectly. I started stamping right away. The MASH stamp is larger and easier to handle than the Konad brand stamp. I love the coloring of the item.  I will definitely order more MASH products!</li>
            <li> I was a bit hesitant about going with MASH over Konad after reading some of the reviews, but I  m glad I did. I don&#x27;t use the scraper, like others said it scratches the plates and an old credit card I had worked perfect, I also didn&#x27;t have to clean it off as often. The stamp picked up the images wonderfully, I also went for the MASH bundle of plates, which I find are very high quality, not sharp, deeply etched. I&#x27;m not sure if it made a difference, but going off of other reviewers before I used them I filed the surface a bit, but as far as I could tell it didn&#x27;t make a difference to the surface. However, I have another that I haven&#x27;t yet opened so I will be able to tell when I use that one. All in all, I&#x27;m happy I purchased this, my nails came out beautifully (After a bit of practice), I spent 5 hours trying designs and I would definitely purchase again.  Update:  I tried the second stamper that I hadn&#x27;t filed, and was fresh out of the package, and I definitely think that filing it made a big difference. I&#x27;m using regular nail polish and the MASH plates, so I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s necessary if you&#x27;re using special polish or Konad plates, but I compared the filed and non filed and the filing improved it picking up the color, and the quality of the image. I just (using the rougher side) filed a few times in one direction, and a few times in the perpendicular direction, then used some nail polish remover to clean it. Works like a dream.</li>
            <li> I ordered the MASH Double sided nail plate art stamp and scraper, for my daughter for Christmas. I also bought the design plates. I cannot wait to give them to her for Christmas. She wants to go to Paul Mitchell when she graduates high school, in 4 years, to study nail, hair, and make up. So, I know she will love these. She is constantly doing her nail, or ours if we let her.&lt;br /&gt;I received this way before the actual date of arrival. The package was in perfect shape, too.</li>
            <li> This came well packaged and ready to use! Though some people have complained about scrapers scratching their plates, I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this scraper! The rubber on the stamp is easy to clean when I&#x27;m done and I think it&#x27;s a great product for the price! I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> While the stamper works well, the scraper seems to be bent, and scratches the plate.  It&#x27;s so bad it&#x27;s being thrown away.</li>
            <li> Little difficult to get the design correct on the nails, but that is most likely due to operator malfunction since it&#x27;s the first time with something like this.  Lots to choose from though and if you get the right consistency of nail polish it looks really cool! Scraper gets clogged too easily though, needs to be cleaned after each nail.</li>
            <li> First off: throw away the scraper.  It will do nothing but scratch your pretty mirrored plates, no matter how lightly you scrape.  Aside from the pink rubber part popping out of the handle if I wipe the excess polish off a little too vigorously, this was a pretty good purchase considering it was less than $5! I like the double-sided stamps; the larger one is for patterns and bigger images, the smaller one is for the daintier images.</li>
            <li> works well and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> Cant beat the price... love the product and of course (the pink and black coloring...two of my faves)  I wish i knew how to use the actual stamps and stamp pens better but i know the imperfections boil down to user error (ill keep practicing and become a pro some day!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If anyone has any tips or tricks,please feel free to email me (lilredshortie520@gmail.com) or respond back to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;overall, awesome deal and good product!</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this at such a cheap price, and a cute color. But you only get half of your moneys worth.&lt;br /&gt;1. The stamper is O.K. A Better material could have been used, a smoother and gushy stamper, so the images would be picked up easily and transferred easily.&lt;br /&gt;2. The scraper was a waste! the blade was too short, so instead of removing the excess nail polish it would just push it all over the place, completely messing up your design. I just threw it out, and began using an old gift card.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend buying a different stamp and scraper. Not worth the money for an items that do a half job. My 3 stars is pretty generous :)</li>
            <li> This stamper works just as great as my konad one. I was really impressed with this stamper set after seeing the reviews online that said konad was the best. I would recommend this stamper set if you would like a cheaper alternative to konad.</li>
            <li> The shipping was nice and fast. But in the packaging there was only the stamp and not the scraper! SO Im a little disappointed that I dont have the scraper.</li>
            <li> Did not like the art stamp pole cause it doesn&#x27;t pick the stamp of the picture which doesn&#x27;t clearly place the picture on nails</li>
            <li> Scraper is awful. Really really really really really awful.. Seriously, can anyone make a decent scraper? I&#x27;d prefer to not ruin my credit cards.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected but the construction is very good!</li>
            <li> The stamper is ergonomic and wonderful! The rubber is perfect for the transfers and doesn&#x27;t push inside the holder (as the cheaply made As Seen On TV set did) The scraper is really nice, however I prefer to use old giftcards as they don&#x27;t scratch the image plates. Overall, MASH rocks my nails!!</li>
            <li> I bought it because it was cute, but it really works. The best part is that it came with an image plate I don&#x27;t yet have. The shipping was quick and I am totally satisfied! Now I have to find out if they make any other image plates!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bo0o.. Did not like this product.. I had to resend it to the seller because it broke after 4 uses.. It did not want to transfer the art images to the nails correctly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time doing stamping nail art, but I&#x27;m happy with all mash tools! The stamper gets the design completely and passes it easily to the nail.&lt;br /&gt;One tip I found: When you are passing the design from the plate to the stamper, don&#x27;t lift it up fast, do it slowly and in the same round-moving way as you pass then the design to the nail ;)</li>
            <li> They make it look so easy. I bought the plates of designs to use with this and none of it worked. I actually returned it all. I will stick with nail decals!</li>
            <li> This is a nifty tool and a great idea. I would say this product is mostly successful. It takes a few tries to master it. If the blade was a tad sharper it, scraping the plate for the design would be cleaner. Over though, I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
            <li> love the stamper and the scraper. they work great. I have never done my nails before and it was super easy to make fun nails with my friends.</li>
            <li> Needed an extra stamper for one of my daughters since the other stamper and plate set I bought only had one stamp. This really is a great little stamp, lovely color, it&#x27;s double sided with a long barrel and really easy to use. The stamp set I got has a smaller stamp but I noticed that both of the girls reach for this one almost every time. It really fits nicely in the hand. Would definitely order again in fact I&#x27;m going to order one more jic this one gets lost.</li>
            <li> this product is a great idea, but the application is difficult. my two older teens tried using it and they love it, they just couldn&#x27;t get it to apply the paint very well.  we bought the specialty polishes just for this.  maybe it will get easier with practice.</li>
            <li> Picks up image and transfer nicely. I have only played around with it the stamp and have done some experimenting. Mani and Pedi should be a breeze.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.  Used once; to frustrating to use.  Grandaughters and me tried to use and just isn&#x27;t worth the time.</li>
            <li> I love this product. Easy to use but does take some practice to get the images not to look sloppy. Really fast shipping too.</li>
            <li> i have been in the beauty business for 52 years and i have done nails along with hair &amp; massages//this gimmick isn&#x27;t worth all the time it takes to use...very messy and not nail friendly</li>
            <li> Not the best set but to use once in a while it&#x27;s fine. If you have the time to keep doing it over until you get it right, it&#x27;s ok. If you just want to get your manicure done, buy a better quality. :) good luck.</li>
            <li> Very simple to use. Though the scrapper should be thrown away and simply use an old credit card instead. A little trial and error will give good results.</li>
            <li> wish it came with instructions. took several tries to learn how to do use it but got the hang of it now.</li>
            <li> Seems good, the konad one appears much softer though...So, hmm If I ever need another, I&#x27;ll try the konad, but this gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I bought this as a starter kit to try out nail art.  It is so easy to use, I was worried it would take a while to figure out but I have been a stamping fool since i received this in the mail.  Very fast shipping and nice packaging will buy more MASH products.</li>
            <li> Great item. I still haven&#x27;t mastered it yet but I am working on it. It&#x27;s a neat &amp; interesting idea.</li>
            <li> Pretty simple and straight forward. You&#x27;ll get a stamper and a scraper, and I&#x27;ll admit that I bought this product because I like the color more than others. The stamper has some nice flexibility to it.</li>
            <li> I love the product!! I was a little angry with the price of shipping but overall the product is amazing!! The Pink and Black is perfect for me :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I can now do many drawings on my nails.&lt;br /&gt;To clean is super handy, pass a cotton swab moistened with acetone and everything is clean. Very good buy!</li>
            <li> Wish I had ordered the Konad brand! The larger pink pad fell off the first day I received it and will not stay in. The pads are really shiny and don&#x27;t pick up the images well at all. The surface of the large pad was uneven and had a circle in the middle of it that was slightly raised higher than the rest of the stamper. I had to file the stamper in order to use it at all. If anyone is having a problem with the surface of their stamper not picking up images or being too shiny, try buffing it a little bit with a nail file to see if that helps at all. The scraper is horrible as it is metal and it scratches the stamp plates. I tossed it also and am using an old grocery store rewards card as the scraper. That works much better. Very disappointed!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cheap so I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back.  I was very frustrated when it didn&#x27;t work at all.  I have been stamping for several years so i was not using it incorrectly.  The polish literally did not stick to the stamper so it could be transferred to my nails.  It went right in the trash!</li>
            <li> This is what I was really wanting and I really like the double sided stamper.  Scraper is okay, I prefer an old credit card.  Seller was great!</li>
            <li> My daughter used this with the Shany cosmetic plate sets, and i have yet to hear any complaints and she uses it quite often!!</li>
            <li> I love both the stamper and scraper. Tip: Rough up the stamper with a few swipes of a nail file and it will pick up polish better.</li>
            <li> I really like this stamper it is nice and firm so it is great for to use pretty much any kind of nail polish you want.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t wast my time.  This does not work as advertised.  If you can actually get the image to appear on the stamper, (which is a challenge in itself) 9 out of 10 times it will not transfer well enough or at all to the nail.</li>
            <li> it took a while to get this  but it came now to learn how to use it now. thanks i will be ordering some of your other designs thanks</li>
            <li> If you are good at this sort of thing than I&#x27;m sure you won&#x27;t have a problem. I did and so I gave it to my niece. I ordered this stamp with a plate with patterns on it and all the parts worked. I just couldn&#x27;t get the pattern to transfer to my nail. I was using gels so maybe that was the problem.</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t transfer On the stamper</li>
            <li> The scraper might be a little sharp on the corners. I had to file them down a bit, it was scratching up my stamps. The stamper itself is good.</li>
            <li> Perfect companion to the MASH STAMPING SET. They work great and very easy to clean :) once you start using these tools you will not want to stop. it is so much fun! my daughter and I have been doing our nails together and the ease of using this product makes it enjoyable</li>
            <li> A good addition to my nail kit.</li>
            <li> Nice product, works good</li>
            <li> I have followed every instruction you can find out there to make this work and can never get a good stamp.  I finally gave up after a couple of months.</li>
            <li> This stamper did not work at all. AT ALL.  At first I blamed it on the stencils, but it turns out the stencils are fine. It was this stamper that sucked! I haven&#x27;t found a good one to replace it yet, but I&#x27;d recommend looking elsewhere!</li>
            <li> I ordered the stamper and scrapper when I first started stamping. I was so excited I immediately grabbed a bunch of polishes that I was told worked with stamping, my plates, and set to work. But was quickly upset when I couldn&#x27;t get any good results. So I hit the internet and YouTube. I tried taking a file to the stamper and the results got a little better, but still weren&#x27;t what I wanted. I thought it must be the polishes, but that to didn&#x27;t change the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so upset and thought it must be me because nothing I tried worked. I was just about to give up when I decided to ordered a stamper from Konad and voilà every image and stamping regular polish I tried worked. It was like the sun came out and all was good again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stamper was a HUGE letdown and I would not recommend it to anyone. I can&#x27;t comment on the scrapper because I immediately threw it in a draw and grabbed an old gift card instead.</li>
            <li> The scrapper sucks. I had to get my first one replaced because it was defective. The scrapper was lopsided and uneven. The second was shipped super fast, but just didnt work well. I actually use a little plastic grocery store keyring card and it works amazingly.</li>
            <li> This stamper does not pick up the image off the plate no matter what kind of polish I use. The scraper left scratches on the image plates.</li>
            <li> I owned a Konad single stamper and it works great, but needed a two sided stamper for small designs. Besides Konad is a bit pricey and I wanted to see if less expensive alternatives work. First of all, the scraper scratches the plate. That didn&#x27;t annoyed me since I have the Konad scraper, but if you need one you may want to used a plastic card instead. This stamper is great for the price because is double ended. The big size can be used for full nail designs and the smaller one for single images. You do get what you paid for though. The stamper doesn&#x27;t always pick up the designs well. At times, it won&#x27;t stamped well into the nail either. The color of the stamper is deeper purple than shown here, which helps some nail polishes show, letting you position the stamper better. If you have time to mess around with it, it might be worth it. Overall, not bummed since it was only 2 dollars with prime. Personally, I will invest in the Konad double stamper because in the end, the investment will pay off time wise. I will rate it 2 1/2 for price and quality.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.The delivery was fast and the products were exactly what I wanted and the price was good.I will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> I purchased the stamp and scraper set to use with [[ASIN:B00631ZXRA NEW 2012 MASH Set of 25 Nail Art Nailart Polish Stamp Stamping Manicure Image Plates Accessories Set Kit]]&lt;br /&gt;The stamper works great.&lt;br /&gt;But it was my 1st time using the plate and it just was not working for me, the scraper was scraping too much off and would go into the design and then there was nothing left to pick up on the stamp.&lt;br /&gt;I instead used an old giftcard, at a 45 degree angle... it worked perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;The stamper is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;Love that it is double sided one for larger designs and a smaller one for smaller designs/smaller nails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great also!</li>
            <li> This was my first set of scraper/stamper for my nail stamping plate set. Its a very economical price &amp; the stamper is dual just like a original Konad stamper. It picks up the images very well.</li>
            <li> It serves its purpose. The pads are removable so that you can clean them easily. I don&#x27;t use the scraper it just scratches the plates a plastic card works just fine.</li>
            <li> Use with discs etched with nail art designs. This worked great, the stamper was easy to clean and worked well; the scraper left small scratches on the discs, but they still work wonderfully. Leaves a cool effect. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great price.  Product has worked well. A credit card works better than the scraper.  It is a fun product to use.</li>
            <li> If you are having a problem with the stamper not picking up images, pull out the plastic part and massage it for a minute or two.  It loosens it up and then works like a charm!!</li>
            <li> Love this stamper, it&#x27;s every bit as good as Konad!! The scraper I got with it is metal, and wasn&#x27;t very flat or straight - it just won&#x27;t evenly scrape the polish no matter how I hold it - there&#x27;s always streaks left behind.  Based on other reviews, I switched to using an old grocery store club card (thinner plastic than a credit card, usually) and it works so well (even better than the Konad scraper) that it doesn&#x27;t matter. Totally worth the purchase just for the stamper.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THE STAMPER, THE SCRAPER NOT SO MUCH, I LIKE OTHERS AM USING AN OLD PREPAID CARD. AND IT WORKS FINE, THE SCRAPER SCRATCHES THE PLATES SO BAD.</li>
            <li> scraper is good it has metal not like the plastic ones thats great, but the stamper never seems to pick up the image its really shiny unlike my usual one that works better.</li>
            <li> This was my first stamper purchase. I love it! The grip is great! Having two sides is very handy to fit different sizes images. Good buy, but not crazy about the metal scraper, it leaves scratches on the plates. Plastic works better.</li>
            <li> I did not have any luck with this. The scraper just scratched the plates and the Stamper would not pick up the polish. I decided to order the Konad double stamper and scraper and it worked great so it was not my error it was the MASH scraper and stamper.</li>
            <li> I must say, I regret buying this stamper and scraper. I should have just bought the Konad stamper and scraper. Yeah it was only 5 bucks, but not worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when i opened the stamper, I noticed the large pad had what looked like a thin slice that  had been taken scraped off it. Everytime I try to stamp with the large pad, every image I stamped would not pick up the part of the image that touched the \\&quot;shaved\\&quot; area. I would just stamp to the side, but this blemish is RIGHT in the middle :/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scraper, well, all I will say is that it is in the trash somewhere. It was very rough, and scratched the hell out of the one plate i used it on. I just stick to an old credit card for scraping now, and hey, no ugly scratches.</li>
            <li> The shipping was great and it has came in handy..... also like how it&#x27;s double sided. It has a big side and then a small side at the top very nice</li>
            <li> I just received the stamper and scraper yesterday.  I ordered the Cheeky plates to use with this and not having much luck yet with it.  Since I am new at stamping and nail art all together,  I will give this some more time to see if I can get it to work properly.  Both the stamper and the cheeky plates had mixed reviews but there was more positive then negative so I figured I would give them a shot.  I have only tried 2 designs on the same plate so I don&#x27;t know if it is the plate, stamper or polish yet.  The designs were coming out too light where you could hardly see them and the polish doesn&#x27;t all come off the stamper like I have seen in some video on stamping I have watched and have to clean the stamper with nail polish remover to get it off.  There was something I saw on lightly using a nail file on the stamper ends which I tried.  Can anyone please give me some guidance on the art of stamping and what I should try in order to improve the stamp...???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok...I tried to do this again using black on orange.  My granddaughter wanted orange nail polish with the stamp with the lips and the work kiss above it.  I changed from the scraper that came with the set to using a cut up old credit card like was suggested in some of the other reviews.  It seems to work better then the first time and transferred \\&quot;ok\\&quot;.  I will need to keep practicing.  I have been doing more with hand painted work then with the stamper so I need to set some time aside to practice more.  Thanks for the suggestions and keep bringing them if you have any....</li>
            <li> I got these very quickly and packed up nicely. It is to transfer polish from a stamp to your nail. (Just in case someone doesn&#x27;t know) I gave it 3 stars because I am not sure if I am doing something wrong or if this stamper just doesn&#x27;t transfer the image over. Only about half of it shows. Maybe it is me. I will just have to keep trying.</li>
            <li> Stamper isn&#x27;t always 100% successful with any of my plates. I recommend you not use this scraper as well, it&#x27;ll scratch your plates. Stamper is ok.</li>
            <li> A little tricky at first but once you&#x27;ve practiced a few times it&#x27;s easy to get a good stamp on your nail. Purchased a nail stencil kit and works great with it.</li>
            <li> This was the first stamper I bought for my intro into nail art stamping I mostly bought it instead of the Konad because I could get it quicker (wanted it for a weekend visit with my little niece) and liked the color better than Konad. Based on the good reviews, I figured it&#x27;d be fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Like most people I was frustrated at first. I&#x27;d bought various plates and polishes (Konad and non-Konad on both). Sometimes the image would look good and sometimes not. Usually, the first time was good, but not after that. I watched a lot of Youtube tutorials and couldn&#x27;t understand what I was doing wrong, I was certain it was possible to get it all to work. Finally, I decided to buy the official double side Konad stamp. Before it arrived I got the MASH stamper to work well, and thought I&#x27;d wasted my money on the Konad stamp. Not so. I did many side by side comparison using different plates and polishes, on paper mostly, and I could easily notice a difference in Konad. It was superior to the MASH stamper, and I&#x27;m glad I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference comes from the hardness, or softness, of the rubber. Thick and thin lines in the images will pick up better or worse based on that. You can see this by doing tests using both sides of the stamper. There&#x27;s much less difference between Konand &amp; MASH on the small ends than the large ends, but for me, I like the full images and you need the larger end for that. So, Konad wins in this area. The large end is less mushy than the MASH stamp. Before I got the konad stamp I hadn&#x27;t noticed how much of the image was left on the MASH stamper after the transfer to my nail. Most often with Konad nothing is left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I did find the MASH plates of excellent quality and left a 5 star review on those. I&#x27;ll absolutely  buy MASH products again, but if my little dogs eat the MASH stamper it will not be replaced. However, I&#x27;m considering buying a back up Konad stamp. That&#x27;s how much better I found it to be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;1)Make sure to use pure acetone, and clean the image in between each use. I originally used polish remover with additives for strengthening and that turned out to be one of my major problems in the beginning.&lt;br /&gt;2)Turn off any fans you may have causing a draft on your work area. I found leaving my ceiling fan on dramitically reduced the time I had to work. You need time to work on these in the beginning to line everything up right, and you already don&#x27;t have much time before the the thin layer of polish dries. You need to check the image before applying to ensure it&#x27;s good, and then time to line it up. At first this is going to be a slower process, which can lead to drying out the image and not getting a good transfer. So, make it easier on yourself and watch your drafs.&lt;br /&gt;3)If rolling over the image doesn&#x27;t work well, try punching straight down and up instead, not hard and not fast, but firmly. I find this method easier, although, I&#x27;ve seen many people online work well with the rolling method.&lt;br /&gt;4)Practice and experiment. It takes practice. If you&#x27;re at the end of your manicure, just play around before taking off your polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Konad polishes work well, but there are great cheaper alternatives that are easier to come by. Maybelline Color Show metallics work very well. You can find a ton of tips on Youtube about various polishes that work, but that&#x27;s one of my favorites. Metallics of most any brand seem to work well. I always test the polish by opening in the store and taking out the brush to let a little slide down the inside of the bottle. You can see how thick and opaque a polish is like that.</li>
            <li> I read a review recommending a plastic gift card in place of the scraper and after using the scraper once I understand why...it totally scratches the plates. This is why I give it four stars, throw the scraper away.  The stamper is cool, easy to hold, easy to use and clean.  I do like the two size stamps, the smaller end is easier on small stamps and small fingers.</li>
            <li> The scraper scratched all the plates and the Stamper would not pick up the polish. I order the Konad double stamper and scraper and I used with mash plates, they work perfect. I dont recommend this product at all.</li>
            <li> Very happy with this stamper no need to pay alot of money to get good quality products! Works great only suggestion is to scrap the scraper part and use an old credit card or gift card instead, metal on metal scratchs the plates and can damage with time.</li>
            <li> did not work at all. the stamper doesnt pick up any of the images. i did a comparison test between the mash stamper and konad stamper  using the same image and polish. konad stamper picked up everthing while the mash picked up absolutely nothing. i used a nail file on the mash, it didnt help. this was a total waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;oh yea... and the scraper was a joke. its not even a straight edge, its got a curve to it or something so it didnt scrape off anything. it just scratched the crap out of my plates. its better to use an old credit card or gift card.</li>
            <li> Received this set so quickly and its decent.  After using 3 times the bigger rubber stamper came off.  Not sure if that should happen but I continued to use it.  Might have to glue it.  Might look into buying something else for heavy use.</li>
            <li> The scraper works ok. Like the stamper since it has the small stamper end too. I would give it a 5 but the scraper doesn&#x27;t work as well as a credit card. It leaves residue on the plate that the stamper can pick up. Would order again.</li>
            <li> I would recommend the stamper. it is easy to use and the pink soft ends make it easy to see the pattern.  I WOULD NOT use the scraper as it has a tendency to scratch the plates.  use an old hotel card key or credit card instead.  they work better and do not  scratch.</li>
            <li> eh eh.it is okay quality. the pink thingy does fall out.</li>
            <li> Great idea for doing it yourself! It does take some practice to get the pictures straight on your nail, but it does the trick!</li>
            <li> The set arrived and was exactly as described. My daughter is going to love it when she gets it for Christmas. This was a great transaction and I would purchase from this seller again.</li>
            <li> So I bought four thinking: \\&quot;great deal introductory price maybe it would be better than konad.\\&quot; ...It wasn&#x27;t at all. The scraper sucked, it kills the plates easily with scratches, 80% of the time smears the polish and works like crap. The actual stamper was another disappointment, the designs never came off fully or well maintained no matter how I did them. I felt I wasted my money big time on four and it would be a waste to have to pay to ship them back so now they are just stuffed away for nothing... Completely disappointed :/. You&#x27;re better off with using your card as a scraper and paying a little more for a konad stamper :/. I learned my lesson.</li>
            <li> Love it, works better than my other stamper. I also love the color pink and black. Can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
            <li> This came on time and is very nice. I am having fun with all my designs. Stamp is very easy to use, the scraper took a few times to learn the technique.</li>
            <li> I hate these. They were a waste of money, they didn&#x27;t really work well- i should&#x27;ve never thought of buying these</li>
            <li> very good service, shipped right away , product was just as stated. would recommend this site to my friends. 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I got this along with the MASH stamp trays, and they work like a charm.  I just have to get used to using them!  The designs roll onto the nail as they should, and I&#x27;ve been able to use many of my regular polishes to stamp with.</li>
            <li> For the first few times I used this stamper it worked great, but after a while I noticed that the center of the stamper was picking up less polish than the outer area of the stamper.  I frequently had to redo my nails because of how poorly the stamper picked up the polish.  In the end it just make a mess.  I now bought the Konad stamper and I hope it works out better.</li>
            <li> I bought this MASH stamper and scraper and couldn&#x27;t get them to work. Ended up buying a Konad stamper that worked perfectly with the same plates and polish I was trying and failing. So, the scraper is worthless (my shopping card worked better) and the stamper would NOT pick up polish at all. Kept it the two days until my konad stamper came, then I tossed it right out.</li>
            <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t know what would do without it! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Es un excelente producto, lo recomiendo mucho y es exactamente como lo descrito por el vendedor, tambien el empaque fue adecuado y llegó en buenas condiciones, sin daños ni problemas</li>
            <li> works great. the smaller stamp is about the size of a dime and the bigger side is about the size of a nickel. great for women but the designs look small when i use it on my boyfriend when practicing.</li>
            <li> After several frustrating attempts, I was unable to successfully get an image to even transfer from the plate to the stamper, much less my actual nail.  I followed all of the review suggestions stating to use a plastic card instead of the blade scraper (a card came with the Cheeky plates I purchased), I even buffered the stamper.  All to no avail.  I plan on trying a Konad stamper and seeing if this works better.</li>
            <li> Difficult to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the Stamper and Plates would be easy to use, but they are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every one of them that I have tried just turns into a smudged mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> the stamper works great. the scraper however has ruined some of my nail plates. im not sure if i just got a bad scraper or they are just bad in general. i now just use an old credit card</li>
            <li> My 12 year old loves this set and the ones given to her with it.  The colors transfer to her nails just like they are shown to.  Takes a  little practice but he was able to do her nails after just a few tries.</li>
            <li> You really have to go slowly and be patient if you want it to be perfect, not every try works out. It does work well, but can be hit or miss.</li>
            <li> Basically the stamper does it&#x27;s job.  It seems to pick up the polish well enough.  One thing I noticed was the pink pads come out of the black holder really easily.  It&#x27;s not a big deal because you can also push them back in easily.  The metal scraper on the other hand is a total waste.  It leaves deep scratches on your plates.  I threw it away after the first use and use a plastic rewards card instead. I was going to say that it&#x27;s a good product for the money until I realized that I only use 50% of the product and similar products are sold for less.</li>
            <li> This set was completly useless to me, the scraper left way too much polish on the plate - never a clean swipe.  And the stamper - after countless times of \\&quot;roughing it up\\&quot; never picked up an entire image.  I was so disappointed.  Save yourself the hassle and buy the Konad brand, you will not be sorry for the few extra bucks you have to spend, it swipes cleanly and picks up the entire image.</li>
            <li> The stamper is nicely made. I especially like that the scraper is not too sharp that it will scratch my plates if I&#x27;m not careful. Only reason I&#x27;m not giving 5 stars is because the large ended pink rubber dropped off while I was using it in. Wasn&#x27;t tugging on it or anything. I looked at it and there seems to be no glue attaching it to the black part at all. Oh well, I put it back in with some glue and it works like a charm now.</li>
            <li> This little tool works nicely and adds a nice touch to any nail design.  It&#x27;s easy to use. Great size to hold in the hand without making it hard to maneuver.</li>
            <li> The product is cute and all, but it is not useful and not what it is described as. I was totally disappointed about my newly plates with the scraper that came with this product.</li>
            <li> I first discovered the world of nail stamp art at a girls night and I really wanted my own set. I bought 25 plates and this stamp and scrapper set.&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to do my nails but that excitement ended very soon.  The rubber stamper doesn&#x27;t pick up the design that well and the amount of nail polish is uneven.  The design doesn&#x27;t go from the stamper to your nail that good either. It&#x27;s just not doing a good job and it is making me frustrated. Buying the pink Konad one instead</li>
            <li> When I received the package it was already open and the stamp and scraper were falling out. The quality was clearly poor and the rubber for the stamper fell out as soon as I picked it up. The scraper was uneven and did not scrape off the polish, but rather scratched the heck out of my plate. A complete waste of money. Go with the Konad!</li>
            <li> As far as I can tell the MASH plates are great, but this stamper is no good.  The small end is fine, and the scraper works well, but the large end (the end I use most) has a decent sized bump in the center of the rubber that makes clear and even stamping difficult. The worst part is that I bought two of these, so I could do nails with my friends, and they both have the defect. Pay the extra $1 (or less) and go for the Konad stamper. I had that one first and bought these as extras because they were a bit cheaper. Even if you don&#x27;t buy Konad plates, their stamper is nearly the same price, and it works much better because the rubber is even and smooth.</li>
            <li> Not worth the intro price.  The surface of the stamper pad has this slight circular bleb right in the middle.  This affects the full nail images because they are supposed to look uniform all over the nail.  The bleb affects how the image gets picked up from the disc, later affecting the image transfer. I only bought this because it was cheaper than the konad stamper,  but ended up spending more money because that&#x27;s what I ended up buying after this disappointment. See photo for the bleb!</li>
            <li> The stamper works pretty well, it&#x27;s a good size for my nails, but during cleaning, the little purple part comes loose sometimes -- nothing a little superglue won&#x27;t fix, but it was a little inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;The scraper was harsh on my plates and didn&#x27;t quite do the job sometimes. I got more luck using an old gift card.</li>
            <li> Getting used to this product was a lot of trial and error. You always have to clean after each finger nail you stamp. I don&#x27;t use the scraper because it scratches the wheels. I found using and old card from a store (something LIKE a credit card). They tend to bend easier and they don&#x27;t scratch the wheels. Practice on fake finger nails first. You think it is lined up and when you put it on, it like it totally goes the wrong spot. ha ha . Lots and lots of practice for sure. I do have fun.</li>
            <li> i was concerned about the reviews, and how they said it didn&#x27;t work or no paint transferred. but i pulled it out and used my new plates w/a gift card to scrape- wallah! image on my nail! i mostly have &amp;#34;dry in 60 sec&amp;#34; paint and all i have used works. i did notice that you need to make sure there is enough paint to fill all the grooves. and to transfer it quickly and firmly. the firmer the better print. i would definitely recommend this to everyone!</li>
            <li> This was the first stamper I bought. It&#x27;s not my favorite one but it does the ok. The scraper is useless. Their customer service is top notch though. When the first one was defective I quickly got a replacement sent to me.</li>
            <li> I love this product, I do my own nails and love to do designs on them. This product helps me make a more detail design on my nails and it does make a great stamp on the design I choose to wear on my nails. Not only does it makes my hands look pretty, but my feet look as amazing with this product.</li>
            <li> Received the stamper today &amp; I am very happy with it. It is exactly as pictured and yes it stamps beautifully!. I just finished doing my daughters nails using the stamper. It shipped very fast intact wrapped in plastic brand new! i am very happy with this stamper.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;Scraper&amp;#34; as it&#x27;s really a &amp;#34;Scratcher&amp;#34;, that ruins the stamp plates.&lt;br /&gt;Since everybody is advising to throw it away and just use a plastic money card ... so why would I buy it from the beginning !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it a year ago, now I regret.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even I was happy with the &amp;#34;PINK&amp;#34; stamper which was pulled out after 2 times of using it. I have to push it in from now &amp; then.</li>
            <li> This was my first stamper/ scraper set. The stamper ends are not that cushiony so I would more use this for those small designs. The stamper is ok but the scraper scratches your plates. I realize why other people suggest using plastic cards (old credit or club cards). I don&#x27;t think I would repurchase this, I prefer the one from Winstonia with the the cushiony white end and the plastic scrapers.</li>
            <li> The stamp works well.  I like that there are two different size stamps and it picks up the polish well.  However, the scraper is METAL.  Whomever designed this obviously never used it on metal plates before because the scraper scratches the crap out of them.  Throw out the scraper and keep the stamp.</li>
            <li> this works but is not amazing i use it once in awhile but taskes lots of ti,e bc sometimes it doesnt work.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using an old gift card as well, as stated by others. Works a lot better, not to mention that the metal on the scrapper would eventually damage the plates. (use either scrapper/gift card at a 45 degree angle for best excess polish removal on plates) The stamper seems a bit hard, taking it out and kneeling it will soften it, making it slightly easier for the polish to transfer (depending on what brand you&#x27;re using) very happy with the purchase :)</li>
            <li> These make doing nail designs quick and easy not to mention fun!! The only thing is they are not wide enough to do your big toe. you either have to to a double layer or a half design if you don&#x27;t want it to overlap! but overall this product is great! :)</li>
            <li> This not work well, I tried to use many thing and I though first that was me, but when I buy other brand I do not have more problems working with other brand, this do not work at all</li>
            <li> It took me a bit to get the hang of using this (My first time so there were a number of fingers that got more of the stamp than the nail did LOL) Now that I know what I&#x27;m doing and have a better feel for it, I really enjoy being able to dress up my nails a bit. I have no complaints about this product.</li>
            <li> The corners of the scraper leaves scratches on the nail plates. I prefer to use a plastic credit card. No complaints with the stamper.</li>
            <li> i didnt like it because the stamper didnt grip up the nail polish paint, either that or i didnt use the right nail polish. the scraper scraped the plate its better to use an old credit card it will be less scratches</li>
            <li> The stamper is just not good quality. The rubber isn&#x27;t thick enough -- I kept getting a donut shaped pattern on every nail and the stamp wouldn&#x27;t pick up anywhere else, and finally realized that it was the plastic portion of the scraper pushing through. total waste of money, I&#x27;m switching back to my (single-sided) konad stamper.</li>
            <li> couldn&#x27;t figure it out!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok. It works but doesn&#x27;t pick up the entire image.</li>
            <li> for a firm stamper it is really nice pick up is great</li>
            <li> I ordered this set along with Mash Plate 41 to try before ordering a bunch of plates. They do work well. However, I am surprised they use a metal scraper as it scratches the plate. Also, after I was done decorating my nails,  I had to have my husband clean off the excess polish on the scraper so I didn&#x27;t mess up my nails. Overall it works well and I like the two sizes of the stamp pads.</li>
            <li> I was really excited to get this kit to complete the whole nail art stamping set. The scraper works very well, as in all nail polish comes off clean. But, the stamper is terrible. I&#x27;ve tried several times and either a)nothing comes off or b)maybe a quarter or half comes off from the design. I don&#x27;t suggest getting this kit. Spend more money and buy a better brand, it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> Excellent nail art tool. highly recommend to girls who are in nail art</li>
            <li> My daughter and I used this today for the first time.  The stamper works great and easy to clean.  Great price too!</li>
            <li> I have ordered multiple mash products lately and all were wonderful except for the stamper. When I received the stamper the plastic wrapping was already opened and the stamper was damaged. The large stamping side had a U shape dent in it and through the center there was a huge crack. There was no way to stamp with this product. When calling the mash 1-800 number no one answered, I left a message and recieved no return call. So, I sent the stamper back and ordred konad. It could of been a one time thing, but I&#x27;d rather not take my chances.</li>
            <li> The stamp does not transfer the polish at all.  The scraper ruined some of our plates.  Complete waste of money and a total disappointment.</li>
            <li> Nice pretty nail art.</li>
            <li> its a little small but its easy to clean and works well</li>
            <li> great price ! good for backup</li>
            <li> I bought these as an alternative to konad I am not sure If its is just me but the stamper does not pick up the image very effectively and the scraper makes a very big mess of this it does not scrape very clean.</li>
            <li> I dont know if its just me, because i am a beginner at stamping...But this stamper doesnt catch the stamp at all.&lt;br /&gt;I really should of just payed the extra two dollars or so for the Konad. I just placed an order for one, so hopefully i will better luck there.&lt;br /&gt;if you are beginning, invest in a konad, not this.</li>
            <li> The stamper in good, I selected 4 stars because when I got it looked like used but works as it should. Scrapper is a little bit small, but works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it cause it works for what it is meant to be for a good low price.</li>
            <li> It is too hard and not that &#x27;gummy&#x27; so the nail polish gets stuck.... ugh... I was hoping it would work better...</li>
            <li> Will only work if you buy the MASH nail polish along with it. It was a pain and didn&#x27;t work like we thought.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used yet but when I first tried Was very dificult You have to clean before use with alcohol, otherwise won&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> The end of the stamper keeps coming out. The scraper sucks. I tried and tried and after it ended up scratching my nail stamping plate. You&#x27;re better off using a razor blade, it worked better for me then this scraper.</li>
            <li> It takes some time to get the hang of the actual technique but it&#x27;s really worth it! Love the way it creates designs.</li>
            <li> I like being able to create cute designs with my stamper. I enjoy that it is pretty quick to use, but the thing really should have come with a set of instructions. I had a hard time figuring out just how to use the stamp and had to turn to Youtube to find out that you roll the stamp gently.</li>
            <li> The scraper does scratch the plates a little if you careful but all scrapers from ever company do, and i dont mind it has no effect on the quality of the plates. the stamper works well and picks much the images most of the time and if it doesn&#x27;t then it was most likely a fault of mine. I was most impressed withe the fast delivery date, I expected it on the 18th and it arrived on the 15th i only ordered it on the 13th! so very speedy! and works well and its the cheapest that I found on amazon! id say buy it if you need a stamper!</li>
            <li> This product works great along with the MASH Nail Art Stamping plates. This is my first time using a nail art stamper and scraper. It is so easy to use. The stamper is very easy to clean. Cotton ball with a little nail polish remover gets it done quickly. Be sure that you only use a little so that it will dry quickly as you&#x27;re working your way to the next finger.</li>
            <li> Does what we expected, but the construction is a little flimsy, but about what we expected for the price.  As with other reviewers, we use an old give card, instead of the metal-edged scraper which came with the stamp, to scrape off excess polish, works well.</li>
            <li> First time nail art enthusiast and I bought this with high expectations, but it failed miserably. Luckily, the product arrived on time and the company was generous enough to give me a 10% off for next purchase (maybe a promo), but due to the faulty product I might not even order anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS: there&#x27;s thumb indentations for better gripping, rubber heads come off for easy cleaning, affordable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: the small rubber head doesn&#x27;t work at ALL. It won&#x27;t pick up the nail polish, and after multiple tries, it picks up blobs of nail polish rather than the intended image. Larger rubber head works but not great, it has a hole punctured in the rubber, which disrupts my my image. Scraper works half the time, and other times it will not scrape off the excess nail polish neatly for a crisp-clear image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it works but it&#x27;s a hit and miss. I would probably buy another stamper.</li>
            <li> The scraper does scratch your plates because the corners of the blade don&#x27;t have the best finish. The silicon stamping caps are very slick and in order for them to pick up nail polish properly from the plate I had to softly and barely file the top, once I did this I saw an improvement when picking up polish. Both items are easy to handle, hold and clean.</li>
            <li> First things first:  I threw out the scraper in favor of a keychain-sized discount card.  The included scraper is metal, and they tend to scratch the heck out of the plates.  Once I cleaned the shine off both ends of the stamper, I put some white stamping polish on a Pueen plate and tried it out, large side first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failure #1.  Nothing was on the end but the very center of the design, because the stamp pad on this thing is almost as hard as a freaking pencil eraser--it barely has any give at all.  Compared to both the free stamp pad that came with my Pueen plates and the super-squishy ones that come with the Cisi&amp;Sisi sets, it&#x27;s practically rock.  Undaunted, I tried again with a bright red nail art polish and a Gals plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, it picked up only the center of the design.  Even pressing down harder and kind of rocking it a bit to cover more of the surface was not enough.  I gave up on full-coverage designs pretty quickly and tried a tiny little flower.  The large side of the stamp flattened out *just* enough to pick it up, but the smaller side was a no-go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For comparison, I used the same polish and plate with another stamper and it was fine.  I also went back and tried a full-coverage design again.  No problem with the old stamper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad so many people are having success with this stamper, but I just can&#x27;t make it work, so I went with two stars instead of one.  Because heck, maybe it&#x27;s me.  Still, I&#x27;m going to suggest that people who are comfortable with a softer stamper or who get good results with them should probably avoid this one.  Once you clean the ends, it *will* pick up polish, but it&#x27;s just too not-squishy to pick up all of anything but a small design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YMMV, and all that.  I&#x27;m going to spend some more time on YouTube to see if anyone else has the same issue, or any suggestions.  If I figure it out, I&#x27;ll amend this review.</li>
            <li> Got this as my first stamper.  Only thing I did to prime it was wash it with hand soap and water and swipe it with nail polish remover [not acetone].  Stamps well enough.  Sometimes has issues with picking up images though, but it seemed to work alright for most of mine.  The smaller end probably needs to be primed and buffed with a nail file slightly, as it doesn&#x27;t do so well.  During mani sessions, I usually use tape or a lint roller sheet to take off the extra polish, but I swipe it again with nail polish remover every now and then.</li>
            <li> This works great with the stamping set. Just takes some time, practice and patience to learn how to use it all. The stamp has to be cleaned off each and every time in between stamps.</li>
            <li> I bought this to go along with some steel plate designs I bought. All in all, for the money spent, about 20$, including shipping, this is way better than those As seen on TV things. This product does exactly what it says it does, and comes at a great price.</li>
            <li> My daughter loves having &amp;#34;mother daughter dates&amp;#34; and using this to make fun nail art. Great bonding activity.</li>
            <li> This is a fun way to do nails. Use it with your choice of stamps purchased separately. I bought Bundle Monsters 25 pc holiday set and my grand daughter loves it</li>
            <li> I am extremely happy with this purchase it was a very reasonable price in comparison to others like it and did its job very well. great quality. and it got here two days ahead of schedule!</li>
            <li> This worked great for me after I buffed/filed the ends a bit. Before I did that, it was hard to pick designs up, so I definitely recommend gently filling the ends with a nail file or buffer if you&#x27;re having problems. If I need more stampers in the future, I&#x27;ll buy more of these, you can&#x27;t beat the price and it gets the job done! :)</li>
            <li> The stamper is great but the scraper scratches the heck out of your plates(as would any metal scraper). I use an old credit card as a scraper now.</li>
            <li> i would recommend this product bec this is what i use with the metal nail designs i also ordered and they work excellent together! This product picks up the nail polish right off the metal and stamps on to your very own nail making life easier than driving way to the salon to get your nails done!!! I ordered on and so did my friend!!! WE LOVE it and both recommend!!!</li>
            <li> As in the stamp works, but the scraper is pretty much useless. It likes to leave streaks of nail polish, I find it much easier to use an old credit card.</li>
            <li> Before buying this I saw on utube credit cards being used as scrapers and I thought this scraper looked like it would do a much better job then a credit card. I was so WRONG. Gave this scraper its fair chance and it scraped the heck out of my image plate causeing lots of scratches and did not all the paint off the plate. I now just use a old credit card to scrape with and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;Stamper works perfect. Very easy to clean!</li>
            <li> Came in on time. Good Item! Love how it works! ............... ..... . . . . . . . .</li>
            <li> The stamper didn&#x27;t pick up any of the product at all. I&#x27;m sad because I really wanted to try stamping!</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to matter what kind of nail polish I use, it just doesn&#x27;t work well.  I can&#x27;t seem to get a clear, precise looking stamp.</li>
            <li> Works great, but I need to get used to stamping!</li>
            <li> This is my first stamper so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to but it does everything it&#x27;s supposed to do so I love it!! I have always read that an old credit or gift card works better as a scraper so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve always used.</li>
            <li> works great, was nervous at first cause of the bad reviews but it works great, i prefer  a plastic card over the scraper!</li>
            <li> I am new to the stamping world.  I am having trouble with it.  the scraper is inconsistent.  I don&#x27;t know if it is me or the product.  Makes that metal on metal sound too and I don&#x27;t like it.  saw a suggestion to use cardboard.  As for the stamper.. I cannot get the whole image to stick to my nail.  there are always sections of my nail missing polish.  Might be user error but I suggest buying cheap if you have never tried it before.</li>
