            <li>Good seller.</li>
            <li>I liked a lot ...</li>
            <li>nice feel.  </li>
            <li>and I think gives a nice shave</li>
            <li>The reason I chose this rating is because the razor gave a good shave and was easy to the skin.</li>
            <li>and  I sure like it.</li>
            <li>and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love the Design and Comfort of the Razor.</li>
            <li>with someone who has sensitive skin, this is one of the best razors I have to provide a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li>That being said, I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
            <li>do like how stylish it is</li>
            <li>More is better.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I would still be able to post my shave results during those times that I&#x27;m shaving in my car</li>
            <li>(If I find the Silvertouch to be any better than the Fusion, I will update my review)</li>
            <li>The battery lasts a month and it is the most comfortable razor I have used.</li>
            <li>It truly is the most comfortable shave on earth.</li>
            <li>When guests come to visit, they always comment on how classy everything looks with my Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Men&#x27;s Power Razor proudly displayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and great for the ladies for various applications :)</li>
            <li>It easily get around those tricky corners.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Works fine, shaves easily.</li>
            <li>The shave was so smooth and easy.</li>
            <li>Does not seem improved over the previous Pro-glide, which is almost perfect.</li>
            <li>In fact, I tried using this without turning it on, and it did fine - the four-blade system beats the three-blade.</li>
            <li>This is a very good product...when I switch on the vibrator on the razor handle it results in the smoothest drag while you shave...</li>
            <li>This battery operated razor does the job, but it is not as smooth as I thought it would be.</li>
            <li>Bizarre idea - an electric manual razor.</li>
            <li>I can get six days (a week if I want to be cheap, and can stand some razor burn) out of a cartridge.</li>
            <li>Good results so far.</li>
            <li>My experience is that it gives an INCREDIBLY close shave the first time you use the razor and after that it is the same as the Gillette Mach 4.</li>
            <li>and it still gives a good shave over and over again, the same with the Fusion -</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s not a bad razor, but there is a lot of room for improvement.  </li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s not a bad razor, but there is a lot of room for improvement.  </li>
            <li>This Gillette does a better job than my old Mach 3</li>
            <li>The Silver color is nice and the grip feels the same for me.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if it also had enough memory to store that data for up to one week.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I can not attest to it&#x27;s use on facial stubble, but if it works on a sensitive scalp, it&#x27;s got to be great on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pricey, but worth it.</li>
            <li>I decided to upgrade from my old Gillette Fusion,and the new one is comfortable shave,i feel very smooth after shaved.</li>
            <li>-less shaving, smooth action with no pulling, and great results.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really impact the function, and I&#x27;m sure using less plastic is better for the environment, but it is worth noting.</li>
            <li>It gives me a closer shave than the electric shaver I have used in the past, and it is the best hand-held disposable type razors that I have used</li>
            <li>i was able to get it for around $5-6 with various promotions (clipped coupons).</li>
            <li>But i like this Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor way better then my regular Gillette Fusion Proglide.</li>
            <li>Love these razors this is my second one.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what I thought at first, and admittedly, I don&#x27;t like it</li>
            <li>This is a first rate razor.</li>
            <li>But, by gosh golly, it works better than a regular manual.</li>
            <li>Thumbs up for Gillette this is my favorite for long time now.</li>
            <li>The blades seem rather pricey but my skin is worth the cost of the new comfort.</li>
            <li>I really like this flexball technology.</li>
            <li>it makes such a smooth shave its unreal.</li>
            <li>Maybe the blades don&#x27;t work very well on her legs and lady-parts, though, because nothing is ever shaved when she comes</li>
            <li>- it really ties my bathroom together.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a gillette :)  not very different from the previous one, but since i love trying new things and it wasn&#x27;t such a huge investment it ordered one.</li>
            <li>We bought this for our 16 year old son for his first razor.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and this gives me a closer shave on the first pass and, as a result, my razor burn is non existent.</li>
            <li>I decided to upgrade from my original Gillette Fusion simply because it was so very old.</li>
            <li>I contacted Gillette to find out if this is any better or different to the standard Fusion Razor.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re a perfectly acceptable alternative to paying $100 or some other insane price for a fancy razor which achieves identical results and has to be cleaned and babied with it&#x27;s own precious fluid or whatever it is.</li>
            <li>and I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Gillette brand and encourage people to give it a try.</li>
            <li>highly recommend the Gillette brand and encourage everyone to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>If you can afford the price of replacement  blades, which is no small investment, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>so I am a new fan.</li>
            <li>Need a new shaving rig, and like disposable cartridge razors?</li>
            <li>Alright, I was due for a new handle, so I went for the clean &amp;#34;silvertouch&amp;#34; look.</li>
            <li>but my issue is that they advertise it is for sensitive skin!</li>
            <li>And the first couple of blades seemed to last forever -</li>
            <li>The newer round smaller button is a huge improvement and being that my original one finally died, this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li>Working so far.</li>
            <li>Since I threw out my old one, this razor now just sits on a shelf after each shave.</li>
            <li>But due to their poor customer service, back to basics is back to perfect.</li>
            <li>I am differently sold on this new technology.</li>
            <li>I have uneven facial hair, and this razor was comfortable compared to proglide manual that I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li>It is simple for him to use and even shaves his soft skin and peach fuze!</li>
            <li>I am really surprised that this hasn&#x27;t come out earlier.</li>
            <li>Is it just so Gillette can charge more for something that&#x27;s totally unnecessary?  </li>
            <li>After a week, I&#x27;d like to upload my whisker-shaving data to my computer, so I could auto-fill an Excel spreadsheet and graph the results.&lt;br /&gt;-Internet-ready capacity with social media connections.  </li>
            <li>they&#x27;re small, unobtrusive, aesthetically pleasing and economical.</li>

            <li> they&#x27;re small, unobtrusive, aesthetically pleasing and economical.</li>
            <li> basically it comes down to false advertising to sell more products....</li>
            <li> Long last, I could use the refill for 2 months</li>
            <li> The power part didn&#x27;t last long at all on either razor.</li>
            <li> long as we&#x27;re adding technological advances to razors, here are some suggestions to Gillette for the next version:&lt;br /&gt;-Nine blades.  </li>
            <li> though sometimes it seems like some blades last a long time, and others start out crappy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette shavers for a long time.</li>
            <li> Apparently they stopped after the last few versions.</li>
            <li> The handle isn&#x27;t any major change from the previous generation, except for the battery indicator LED.</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m less likely to cut my face, and it seems less likely to catch the warts and moles and whatever scattered around my mug.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is that I look 5 years younger than I do with scruff.</li>
            <li> not really using the power part of it...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d like to control my razor remotely from my phone</li>
            <li> only complaint about the razor (and it&#x27;s not even about the razor) is that Gillette no longer ships the prepackage storage case.</li>
            <li> any blade that performs like this, there has to be a down side, and here it is blade life.</li>
            <li> The first model of this razor I had had a longer button to turn it on that was annoying as I would constantly turn it off with my fat fingers.  </li>

            <li> The best shavers. Try it! You wwill never use another one. Long last, I could use the refill for 2 months</li>
            <li> This Gillette does a better job than my old Mach 3 so I am a new fan. The blades seem rather pricey but my skin is worth the cost of the new comfort.</li>
            <li> I liked a lot ...It Is excellent...is a pleasure to use it every morning ---and after that a good coffe</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s Gillette, so it&#x27;s a good razor. This was my 2nd time buying the Fusion Power. The power part didn&#x27;t last long at all on either razor. But it still gives a great shave.</li>
            <li> nice feel.  good product for the price.  a little bit cheaper than walmart because of the coupon.  not really using the power part of it...not sure why it exists.</li>
            <li> The Fusion Proglide power is a good razor and I think gives a nice shave and I think the Silvertouch version has a pleasant and somewhat understated look.  What prevents me from giving the razor 5 stars is for two reasons; one is the price of the blades and the other which isn&#x27;t anything major but the Razor Holder that holds both the Razor and blades is very poorly made and hasn&#x27;t held up well.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor. The fusion proglide is something that I have been using for some time and I highly recommend it. It gives me a closer shave than the electric shaver I have used in the past, and it is the best hand-held disposable type razors that I have used, that has not given me razor burns, itchiness and unshaven parts (those tricky corners).&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Gillette brand and encourage people to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Very,very Nice!Great Item&#x3D;Great Seller+Fast Shipping+Great Communication.Thank U</li>
            <li> The reason I chose this rating is because the razor gave a good shave and was easy to the skin. Would recommend to anybody.</li>
            <li> i have 2 or 3 of these laying around. 1 in the shower, 1 on the counter. they&#x27;re small, unobtrusive, aesthetically pleasing and economical. they&#x27;re a perfectly acceptable alternative to paying $100 or some other insane price for a fancy razor which achieves identical results and has to be cleaned and babied with it&#x27;s own precious fluid or whatever it is. i was able to get it for around $5-6 with various promotions (clipped coupons). battery included. and great for the ladies for various applications :)</li>
            <li> We bought this for our 16 year old son for his first razor.  It is simple for him to use and even shaves his soft skin and peach fuze!</li>
            <li> I really like this flexball technology. It contours as It glided along my face. I am really surprised that this hasn&#x27;t come out earlier. The shave was so smooth and easy. Gillette gave me an opportunity to give this razor a try and  I sure like it. I am differently sold on this new technology.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how it fares to proglide power, but I definitely like it compared manual. I have uneven facial hair, and this razor was comfortable compared to proglide manual that I&#x27;d been using.</li>
            <li> The first model of this razor I had had a longer button to turn it on that was annoying as I would constantly turn it off with my fat fingers.  The newer round smaller button is a huge improvement and being that my original one finally died, this one takes the cake.</li>
            <li> Does not seem improved over the previous Pro-glide, which is almost perfect. The Silver color is nice and the grip feels the same for me. Thumbs up for Gillette this is my favorite for long time now.</li>
            <li> I like it, it works well and I am completely satisfied.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Gillette shavers for a long time. I&#x27;ve used the Fusion and the Fusion Proglide. But i like this Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor way better then my regular Gillette Fusion Proglide. I like the Vibrating when you push the power button it makes such a smooth shave its unreal. I love the Design and Comfort of the Razor. If you are looking for a good Razor then order this one you wont regret it!!</li>
            <li> Good results so far. I&#x27;m not sure if or how the power feature improves performance, and sometimes I forget to turn it on, but I feel like I&#x27;m keeping up with the Jones&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> I decided to upgrade from my old Gillette Fusion,and the new one is comfortable shave,i feel very smooth after shaved.</li>
            <li> I had been using The Art of Shaving razor at 15 plus the price. But due to their poor customer service, back to basics is back to perfect.</li>
            <li> THANK YOU AMAZON FOR YOUR HELP Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Men&#x27;s Power Razor With 1 Razor Blade...&lt;br /&gt;I TRUST 100% AMAZON SERVICE THANK YOU AGAIN</li>
            <li> Great best shave ever. Works fine, shaves easily.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a gillette :)  not very different from the previous one, but since i love trying new things and it wasn&#x27;t such a huge investment it ordered one.</li>
            <li> I bought it to match my chrome shaving brush and it does!</li>
            <li> Love these razors this is my second one. The battery lasts a month and it is the most comfortable razor I have used.</li>
            <li> Working so far. Like the color and grip.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product...when I switch on the vibrator on the razor handle it results in the smoothest drag while you shave...one of the best Gillette product till date and it&#x27;s only $10!!!. Must buy razor.</li>
            <li> Great razor. Only complaint is that I look 5 years younger than I do with scruff. Hmmm... I guess that&#x27;s the point.</li>
            <li> This battery operated razor does the job, but it is not as smooth as I thought it would be. I probably would not recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> This is the best razor I have ever used there is no tugging or pulling it is. Incredible comfort thank you Gillette  for lit me try this razor</li>
            <li> with someone who has sensitive skin, this is one of the best razors I have to provide a close and comfortable shave.</li>
            <li> there is no any 1 Razor blade refill (Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Men&#x27;s Power Razor With 1 Razor Blade Refill And 1 Battery )</li>
            <li> I decided to upgrade from my original Gillette Fusion simply because it was so very old. That being said, I&#x27;m glad I did. Per my expectations, Gillette hit the ball out of the park again with this one. It truly is the most comfortable shave on earth. It also looks great in the bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about the razor (and it&#x27;s not even about the razor) is that Gillette no longer ships the prepackage storage case. Apparently they stopped after the last few versions. Since I threw out my old one, this razor now just sits on a shelf after each shave. It doesn&#x27;t really impact the function, and I&#x27;m sure using less plastic is better for the environment, but it is worth noting. If you upgrade, save your storage tray!</li>
            <li> Got this from Costco. While taking this out of packaging the razor got subjected to slightly extra force which bent the razor at the neck (connection between handle and the blade holding part). This is terrible. This stuff is made from flimsy plastic. For the price they charge - they should make it stronger</li>
            <li> This product really is as precise, as beautiful as it is presented here ! I am infinitely obliged to you Gillette to have sold it to me ! It has been part of my joys of each week ! I so thank you for its swift delivery as well ! *****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yvan Majanja</li>
            <li> Wonderful on time good purchase</li>
            <li> I was a bit confused about why something low-tech needs a battery and a vibrating handle.  Is it just so Gillette can charge more for something that&#x27;s totally unnecessary?  That&#x27;s what I thought at first, and admittedly, I don&#x27;t like it - my hand goes numb after just a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my wife loves the vibrating handle!  In fact, she often locks herself into the bathroom to shave for hours.  Maybe the blades don&#x27;t work very well on her legs and lady-parts, though, because nothing is ever shaved when she comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loves this razor so much that when I took it on a business trip, she called me, upset and crying, saying that she \\&quot;needed Mr. Gillette.\\&quot;  When I got home, she&#x27;d bought four more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like how stylish it is - it really ties my bathroom together.  When guests come to visit, they always comment on how classy everything looks with my Gillette Fusion Proglide Silvertouch Men&#x27;s Power Razor proudly displayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as we&#x27;re adding technological advances to razors, here are some suggestions to Gillette for the next version:&lt;br /&gt;-Nine blades.  There are not enough blades on this version.  More is better.&lt;br /&gt;-A whisker gauge and computer chip to measure whisker-length and analyze shaving efficiency.  It would be nice if it also had enough memory to store that data for up to one week.&lt;br /&gt;-A USB port.  After a week, I&#x27;d like to upload my whisker-shaving data to my computer, so I could auto-fill an Excel spreadsheet and graph the results.&lt;br /&gt;-Internet-ready capacity with social media connections.  A one-touch button to Tweet and post my shave results to Facebook would save lots of time and keep my friends updated on my shaving.&lt;br /&gt;-Wi-fi.  I would still be able to post my shave results during those times that I&#x27;m shaving in my car and I don&#x27;t have an Internet connection.&lt;br /&gt;-An app for my smartphone.  I&#x27;d like to control my razor remotely from my phone - sometimes I need to shave the cat when I&#x27;m out of town for business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s not a bad razor, but there is a lot of room for improvement.  My wife says that she would give it 5 stars, though.n for business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s not a bad razor, but there is a lot of room for improvement.  My wife says that she would give it 5 stars, though.</li>
            <li> I contacted Gillette to find out if this is any better or different to the standard Fusion Razor. My experience is that it gives an INCREDIBLY close shave the first time you use the razor and after that it is the same as the Gillette Mach 4. I must say that I have no problems with the Mach 4 and it still gives a good shave over and over again, the same with the Fusion - but my issue is that they advertise it is for sensitive skin! This is the response I got from Gillette :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;The differences between the Fusion ProGlide and Fusion ProGlide Silvertouch is just the handle design there are no differences in the blades they still use the same Fusion ProGlide cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks again for writing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Justin&lt;br /&gt;The Fusion Team\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So basically it comes down to false advertising to sell more products.... AND I FELL FOR IT! (If I find the Silvertouch to be any better than the Fusion, I will update my review)</li>
            <li> I was a longtime Mach 3 user and am so happy that I switched to this razor. I have sensitive skin and this gives me a closer shave on the first pass and, as a result, my razor burn is non existent.</li>
            <li> This is a first rate razor. When used with a good pre shave lubricant, it will eliminate razor burn and give you the best shave of your life. If you can afford the price of replacement  blades, which is no small investment, I highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> This is a great razor.  It the best of both world disposable and electric shaver.  The fusion proglide gives me a closer shave than the electric shaver I have used in the past.  It easily get around those tricky corners.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the Gillette brand and encourage everyone to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a BzzAgent.  I received this from the Gillette to test.</li>
            <li> Bizarre idea - an electric manual razor. But, by gosh golly, it works better than a regular manual. In fact, I tried using this without turning it on, and it did fine - the four-blade system beats the three-blade. But switching on the little buzzy motor makes a noticeable difference. I feel like I&#x27;m less likely to cut my face, and it seems less likely to catch the warts and moles and whatever scattered around my mug. And the first couple of blades seemed to last forever - though sometimes it seems like some blades last a long time, and others start out crappy. Whatever. I like it. Get one! - RG</li>
            <li> This is the next generation Gilette Fusion razor. Alright, I was due for a new handle, so I went for the clean &amp;#34;silvertouch&amp;#34; look. The handle isn&#x27;t any major change from the previous generation, except for the battery indicator LED. The difference is the blade cartridge. I shave my head, and if you do as well, then try this out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nick-less shaving, smooth action with no pulling, and great results. I can not attest to it&#x27;s use on facial stubble, but if it works on a sensitive scalp, it&#x27;s got to be great on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With any blade that performs like this, there has to be a down side, and here it is blade life. I can get six days (a week if I want to be cheap, and can stand some razor burn) out of a cartridge. It wouldn&#x27;t be too bad, but these babies are pricey. Pricey, but worth it. Need a new shaving rig, and like disposable cartridge razors? TRY IT!</li>
            <li> Good seller. I received the product on time and without problems. I recommend for all.</li>
