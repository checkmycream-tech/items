            <li>This product is great.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>To soon to tell how effective this is</li>
            <li>but it has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t sting when applied.  </li>
            <li>Since then, they&#x27;ve gotten more enthusiastic.</li>
            <li>It smells good and the fragrance fades quickly.</li>
            <li>i have seen the difference since i started using this product i love it</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m able to catch the hairs at a shorter length</li>
            <li>Nothing works better than plucking and shaving.</li>
            <li>but there is still as many as when I started using it.</li>
            <li>havnt been able to tell a change yet.</li>
            <li>Fantastic product, one of those rare purchases that I&#x27;m glad I made!</li>
            <li>Makes a huge difference in the speed of hair regrowth.</li>
            <li>The lotion goes on smooth and absorbs well.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more useful as a soothing lotion...</li>
            <li>I had been spending $52.00/jar for another product which I liked, but which was frequently out of stock everywhere</li>
            <li>Has a nice light scent too which is important when you&#x27;re putting it on your upper lip</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been more and more concerned about the number of hairs popping up on my chin and neck(!)</li>
            <li>even hair around my hairline which is very course!!</li>
            <li>I bought this because one of the reviews wrote about problems that I had exactly!</li>
            <li>; I strongly prefer stuff with natural scent.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t spend much energy on decoration and stuff -- I don&#x27;t pluck anything else.</li>
            <li>Much longer between hairs.</li>
            <li>If used as directed, this stuff REALLY works.  </li>
            <li>I use this after my epilator and it really does work very well.</li>
            <li>I never had as much hair on my chin/neck as I do now.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s works as well as the other and is much more affordable.</li>
            <li>When I do eventually get around to having to pluck again, the hair will be so thin and easy to remove that I&#x27;m confident scaring won&#x27;t be a concern.&lt;br</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t know if others will have as much success using Keep It Bare, but at currently around nine bucks, it&#x27;s probably really worth your time to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I found a depilatory that worked pretty well, but not only did the hair grow back quickly, I&#x27;d have to wait for it to grow long enough for it to be effective.</li>
            <li>When I tried to apply only every other day per the instructions, my hair came back much more quickly.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t remove hair but helps it grow back slower and finer with consistent use.</li>
            <li>tend to be sensitive to stuff you put on skin.</li>
            <li>but it really does deter the growth of facial hair...</li>
            <li>Hair grows back much slower and the hairs are much finer when they grow back.</li>
            <li>The only other reason I gave this product two stars is because it does seem to calm the redness after I finish plucking the hairs.</li>
            <li>Plucking gave much longer lasting results, but left  hyperpigmentation scars and caused the hair to come back thicker and tougher.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s barely a step up from peach fuzz.</li>
            <li>and it definitely is growing back more slowly.</li>
            <li>I tried the Gigi product not really expecting much, but the effect hasn&#x27;t been anything short of miraculous.</li>
            <li>I have PCOS and as a result I have some pretty coarse black hairs under my chin.</li>
            <li>It has really cut down on the frequency I have to tweeze.  </li>
            <li>But little hairs springing out of my chin is not something I was ready for.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s currently the barest hint of regrowth just under the left side of my chin, but what&#x27;s there is so short, thin and fine</li>

            <li> I started plucking a few hairs from my chin when I was about 45, I guess. Since then, they&#x27;ve gotten more enthusiastic. I don&#x27;t spend much energy on decoration and stuff -- I don&#x27;t pluck anything else. I don&#x27;t even shave my legs or wear makeup. But little hairs springing out of my chin is not something I was ready for. It was like the one thing I with which I couldn&#x27;t deal, if you know what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Effectiveness&lt;br /&gt;Works for me. Much longer between hairs. And instead of finding six 2mm hairs that weren&#x27;t there yesterday, I less often find one or two, and they&#x27;re not long enough to get hold of for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Skin&lt;br /&gt;I tend to be sensitive to stuff you put on skin. I go for &amp;#34;sensitive skin&amp;#34; versions and stuff. I mean, I&#x27;m about a 5-6 on the 1-10 scale for sensitive skin. And this stuff didn&#x27;t irritate. I used it daily, and didn&#x27;t notice any bumps or redness at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smell&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m picky; I strongly prefer stuff with natural scent. In fact, I often can&#x27;t use commercial cleaning products because the smell makes it hard to breathe and stuff. This stuff has not a wonderful, natural scent, but a not-unpleasant and not-apparently-toxic scent. Didn&#x27;t make me gag or cough. Your mileage may vary, of course, but that&#x27;s my experience.</li>
            <li> i have seen the difference since i started using this product i love it</li>
            <li> It smells good and the fragrance fades quickly. The lotion goes on smooth and absorbs well. I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in that some of my hair is growing back finer and it definitely is growing back more slowly. I still have to tweeze daily but I&#x27;m able to catch the hairs at a shorter length and they come out a lot less painfully and with less breakage. When I tried to apply only every other day per the instructions, my hair came back much more quickly. I&#x27;ll be using this twice every other day, alternating with once every other day to see what happens. Otherwise, everyday  twice a day until I get my hormones back under control.</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. No change/slowing noticed in hair growth.</li>
            <li> If used as directed, this stuff REALLY works.  It has really cut down on the frequency I have to tweeze.  I noticed results after about one week of application.  Did not have any irritation.  I applied once in the morning and evening--used it under my makeup.  I was skeptical when I first discovered this product but this one does work as touted.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  This product does not perform as advertised.</li>
            <li> Believe it or not it works.  You have to apply it every day for two weeks and then every other day but it really does deter the growth of facial hair...even hair around my hairline which is very course!!</li>
            <li> For me, the difference has been immediate. I&#x27;ve been more and more concerned about the number of hairs popping up on my chin and neck(!) since I&#x27;ve become a woman of a &amp;#34;certain age&amp;#34;. I found a depilatory that worked pretty well, but not only did the hair grow back quickly, I&#x27;d have to wait for it to grow long enough for it to be effective. Plucking gave much longer lasting results, but left  hyperpigmentation scars and caused the hair to come back thicker and tougher. I tried the Gigi product not really expecting much, but the effect hasn&#x27;t been anything short of miraculous. I&#x27;ve gone from either plucking once a week or using a depilatory twice a week to ***not doing either for over two weeks now***. There&#x27;s currently the barest hint of regrowth just under the left side of my chin, but what&#x27;s there is so short, thin and fine, it&#x27;s barely a step up from peach fuzz. When I do eventually get around to having to pluck again, the hair will be so thin and easy to remove that I&#x27;m confident scaring won&#x27;t be a concern.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if others will have as much success using Keep It Bare, but at currently around nine bucks, it&#x27;s probably really worth your time to find out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Grade: A</li>
            <li> I bought this because one of the reviews wrote about problems that I had exactly! But it did not work for me. I have very thick chin and upper lip facial hair. Nothing works better than plucking and shaving. Plucking hurts and causes blemishes and ingrown hair, so does shaving. Shaving has to be done everyday, and it is hard to prevent razor burn.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while now and it hasn&#x27;t done anything for my hair. I have PCOS and as a result I have some pretty coarse black hairs under my chin. Since using this product I have noticed they are a tiny bit less coarse but there is still as many as when I started using it. The only other reason I gave this product two stars is because it does seem to calm the redness after I finish plucking the hairs. It&#x27;s more useful as a soothing lotion...</li>
            <li> I have used this for years.  It doesn&#x27;t remove hair but helps it grow back slower and finer with consistent use.</li>
            <li> No results yet..been 3 weeks</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I had been spending $52.00/jar for another product which I liked, but which was frequently out of stock everywhere and so I tried this....it&#x27;s works as well as the other and is much more affordable.</li>
            <li> To soon to tell how effective this is but it has a nice smell and doesn&#x27;t sting when applied.  I think it is working.</li>
            <li> havnt been able to tell a change yet.</li>
            <li> I use this after my epilator and it really does work very well. Hair grows back much slower and the hairs are much finer when they grow back. Has a nice light scent too which is important when you&#x27;re putting it on your upper lip lol</li>
