            <li> It can get a little sweaty down there on those hot work days so it definitely helps keep you dry.</li>
            <li> Anti Monkey Butt.  </li>
            <li> My son loves his monkey butt!</li>
            <li> He has dry scalp and it works well to keep that under control.</li>
            <li> While it does help, doesn&#x27;t give me the relief I expected.  </li>
            <li> Monkey Butt!!!!  </li>
            <li> One wash smells like a mans scent and the other like bananas.</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a joke for my husband and he just started using the product the other day</li>
            <li> I know a few bicycle riders and they use it all of the time.</li>
            <li> After a few days, I get a little raw again.  </li>
            <li> I think this probably happened en route or was packed poorly.  </li>

            <li> I buy this product mostly because I love the name of it. I alway give this out to my brothers as a gift. They enjoy using it.</li>
            <li> My son loves his monkey butt! One wash smells like a mans scent and the other like bananas. The powder smells awesome too! I will buy again!</li>
            <li> You get Shampoo, body wash and powder.  This is the best product for anyone that sweats, gets rashes or itchy patches.  It&#x27;s medicated and feels great on your skin.  I sent this to my brother and he loves it.  It&#x27;s also great for heavier people like myself that sweat under arms or belly.  Well worth the price.  You can find also find this product at Walmart.</li>
            <li> A gift and they loved it!</li>
            <li> I have bought only the powder before and everyone seemed to like it so I thought I&#x27;d try the  whole package.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this as a gift, however, the product arrived damaged. I think this probably happened en route or was packed poorly.  I decided to keep it for my husband and so far he loves it! The smell is pleasant without being too much. I will order this again.</li>
            <li> I really like this stuff. The body wash and shampoo both smell really good and my skin never feels dry after use like other soaps. The powder also serves its intended purpose very well. It can get a little sweaty down there on those hot work days so it definitely helps keep you dry.</li>
            <li> Despite the goofy title, this stuff works better than any body wash and powder combo to prevent crotch irritation and odor. It is cheaper to order here with PRIME, than at the local stores. We are repeat buyers.</li>
            <li> Deal !! Sham/cond powder body wash !&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased!!</li>
            <li> Love this product!  Love the smell, love the lather, love the clean feeling I get when I use this stuff!</li>
            <li> Yeah, its ok.  While it does help, doesn&#x27;t give me the relief I expected.  After a few days, I get a little raw again.  The hairwash is just hair wash.  No big deal.  However, my nephew thinks this is the coolest thing.  Monkey Butt!!!!  If you have a 10 or so old boy, buy this for them.  He&#x27;ll think its great and you will achieve grreater good in his eyes.</li>
            <li> Every set of 3, had the body wash bottle leaking. Because of this i could not use them as christmas gifts. because packages were soapy.</li>
            <li> I got this as a gag but turns out that it works as advertised.  I know a few bicycle riders and they use it all of the time.</li>
            <li> I just wish they could be purchased separately! The shampoo and shower gel always get used up first! There should be one with the ladies powder too!</li>
            <li> super fast shipping and product as described!!! buy with confidence!!!</li>
            <li> I bought this on my sister-in-law&#x27;s recommendation.  I have had Psoriasis and recently Inverse Psoriasis.  The powder is GREAT for helping the stingy and painful inverse Psoriasis.  Within 24 hours I had some noticeable healing and boy, this stuff works!  I had been using some $44 Nystatin powder (via prescription), but my skin wasn&#x27;t healing well.  It would heal then crack, over and over again.  This powder really does work helping the skin to heal faster without the pain of the added friction during the day.  I&#x27;m also now using the body wash and the shampoo which does a good job, but the shining product here is the powder.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
            <li> I purchased it for my eldest son he is picky about what he uses on his body. He likes the smell of the body was it is very manly I purchased it for myself originally but it was to much of a guy smell. He has dry scalp and it works well to keep that under control. it last about 3 months for him or longer.</li>
            <li> The powder is great, so is the body wash...  but the shampoo has a lot to b desired. . The smell isn&#x27;t that fresh of sent..</li>
            <li> I bought this product for a joke for my husband and he just started using the product the other day and he likes it.</li>
            <li> Anti Monkey Butt Powder is GREAT!  I personally think it&#x27;s the best powder on the market today!  And My Boys love the name!</li>
            <li> I got this for my husband as a joke gift.  Turns out, he loves the stuff. He looks forward to it every Christmas! Hey, some guys enjoy Acqua di Gio pour Homme and other guys like ... *ahem* ... Anti Monkey Butt.  Ain&#x27;t I lucky? ; )</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 17 year old grandson who lives with us.  He says that he really likes this.  I will say that since he has started using this. He smells much nicer.  I plan to get me some.  I want the banana shampoo.</li>
