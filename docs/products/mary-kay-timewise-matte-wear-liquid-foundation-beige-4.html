            <li> At first, I was skeptical because it&#x27;s alot lighter in color than the medium coverage foundation 400 that I usually get.  </li>
            <li> Not cakey at all like my previous mk foundation.  </li>
            <li> Not using the Mary Kay primer helps a little bit, but I still get this powder-like residue..</li>
            <li> But I gave it a try and after a few days, it grew on me.  </li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> It also is truly matte and makes me look unhealthy.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so nasty!</li>

            <li> Great price fast shipping</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Will buy again. Love the liquid foundation.</li>
            <li> Best long wearing foundation. Stays matte throughout the day. Better than Mac and half the price. I would consider this a full coverage. Best for summer months glides on smooth and covers really well.</li>
            <li> I love this makeup for about 1/2 the day! Coverage is excellent and unmatched. The problem with this makeup is it gathers in wrinkles and makes your pores look huge by the end of the day. So for me it&#x27;s not worth it in the end when used alone. The reason I give it three stars is that it&#x27;s the best coverage out there and it may work better if used with a primer. I have never used primer and therefor didn&#x27;t when I used this makeup.</li>
            <li> Its the only foundation that I can find that matches my skintone and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. Love this foundation!</li>
            <li> I am very happy with this foundation. It goes on smooth and has a nice matte finish.</li>
            <li> I like this makeup very much.  I&#x27;ll buy it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 40 and wanted a good makeup for skin that is starting to show it&#x27;s age.  The problem is, I still get an oily t-zone and most makeups made for aging skin are super shiny.  This is perfect for my skin.  blends nicely with no lines and doesn&#x27;t feel heavy.</li>

            <li> Great product and got my product within 3 days of my order!!!!</li>
            <li> Compared to the drugstore brands like CoverGirl and Maybelline, this Mary Kay foundation doesn&#x27;t hold up. After six hours, the liquid foundation looks like I threw powder on my face. It&#x27;s peeling off my skin. It&#x27;s so nasty! Not using the Mary Kay primer helps a little bit, but I still get this powder-like residue.. I know it&#x27;s not my skin because I went out and bought some CoverGirl stuff and it doesn&#x27;t create this residue after 14 hours. Oh, and I did buy the foundation for dry skin so that&#x27;s not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would stay away from this. It also is truly matte and makes me look unhealthy. I really don&#x27;t know how to describe it. I just don&#x27;t look right.</li>
            <li> The product is wonderful, but the person who shipped it took over a month to get it to me. I have to go the the store and buy a bottle of foundation.</li>
            <li> The price is fantastic and the product arrived promptly!  Packaging was ample and product arrived in perfect shape.  Will continue to purchase Mary Kay online.</li>
            <li> This clogged my pores like crazy and melted right off my face immediately after application. I have very oily skin.  It did not help at all.</li>
            <li> I dont have time to see my marykay consultant so purchasing it online was cheaper and more convenient. I feel like it has been used however. When i opened it, some was coming out. Not sure why. Whatever, it was cheaper than going to see my consultant and it came within the expected time.</li>
            <li> Love my mary kay have been using it for at least 10 yrs.Its so light you don&amp;#34;t know you have it on, makes you face look radiant. Love all my Mary Kay and the price is right.</li>
            <li> Product just as described... Took about 3 weeks to receive it though.</li>
