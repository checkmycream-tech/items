            <li>CASTOR OIL, ALONG WITH THE WILD GROWTH, CASTOR AND PIMENTO IS THE BEST HAIR HEALTH AND GROWTH OILS ON THE MARKET</li>
            <li>I think this works best with natural hair , when I had a perm</li>

            <li>and I like it better.</li>
            <li>hope someone give a better review..</li>
            <li>I wonder if another brand would work better for me?  </li>
            <li>and the day before I plan on washing my hair, I use a bit more, just to let it absorb  more into my scalp.</li>
            <li>Love this oil.</li>
            <li>its seems authentic</li>
            <li>You can use a Qtip and dip it into the oil then apply onto your scalps to prevent hair loss :)</li>
            <li>I have used before and my edges have never looked better</li>
            <li>I automatically smelled it to see if it smelt of burnt ashes, and surprisingly I was pleasantly surprised that it smelled good.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair and on the many stretch marks I have.</li>
            <li>But my hair looks a lot thicker and healthy</li>
            <li>It was okay</li>
            <li>i have had better.</li>
            <li>Tropic isle Jamaican castor oil is the best on the market can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li>My hair had a nice smooth texture with a killer shine.</li>
            <li>Love what it does for my skin and hair. . . . . .</li>
            <li>but it seems like it will work. :)</li>
            <li>Love my Jamaican castor oil.</li>
            <li>A must have oil for anyone on a healthy hair journey.</li>
            <li>I can say I really love this product.</li>
            <li>so glad that I added this product to my regimen.</li>
            <li>What I experienced was a normal reaction to the product, and not an allergic reaction!</li>
            <li>but so far so good!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, it has grown my hair and given it great strength and natural sheen, shine and protection!!</li>
            <li>i believe if i continue i will see summ better results noo its not a miracle oil bt its pretty good for the hair</li>
            <li>Soak them in a warm bath, and massage a generous portion of heated (warm the bottle in hot water)</li>
            <li>so it is always full of life and bounces beautifully catching the attention of many...</li>
            <li>Castor oil in general is very good for hair, even the damaged variety.</li>
            <li>I find that JBCO is thickening my new growth and the texture is becoming softer with a beautiful curl pattern.  </li>
            <li>Great on my natural hair!!</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure it out at first because of all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li>I have pretty good skin, so I didn&#x27;t plan on using it for that.  </li>
            <li>Pretty good I guess.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never purchased either but figured they had pretty good reviews.</li>
            <li>i got this and it pretty good</li>
            <li>I think this was a good product for my first experience with castor oil.</li>
            <li>Its true that JBCO doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell but its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li>product looks new and works great..</li>
            <li>Ive experienced thinning hairline and non-existant edges most of my adult years.</li>
            <li>I have noticed if I want my hair to look healthy and strong</li>
            <li>:) It is a bit strong when it comes to the smell</li>
            <li>I use it to promote healthy and strong hair.</li>
            <li>love the strong earthy scent.</li>
            <li>my hair is more easy for me to style.</li>
            <li>If you want good hair growing results I also suggest switching to organic shampoos and conditioners, take LOTS of vitamins especially biotin, prenatal pills etc, and find good hair creams to use.</li>
            <li>Very sticky but good for healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Love, love, LOVE this little bottle of JOY!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this several times since I find it to be a good castor oil, nice consistency makes great hand cream, but you really have to work it in because it is oil.</li>
            <li>oil seems fine to me and I plan to buy much more of it.</li>
            <li>I love saying WAS, so fine and thinning</li>
            <li>I love saying WAS, so fine and thinning</li>
            <li>I love how quickly it absorbs into my scalp!</li>
            <li>Majority of it is used on my ankle and I can honestly say that the first day I used it the pain went away!  </li>
            <li>I put most of it on the roots of my hair and then smooth the rest up to the roots/scalp.</li>

            <li>It  seems to be a great product so far</li>
            <li>but I have noticed that the hair has not thinned again, nor has it filled in any more than it had when I was using it.  </li>
            <li>This oil is extremely great but for my natural hair sisters .</li>

            <li>I don&#x27;t have time for all that when I have plenty of other treatments that work wonderfully and apply with the quickness.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using to for 3 months now and my hair has done a full 360 turn around!</li>
            <li>Surprisingly easy to wash off.</li>
            <li>The smell is easy to cover up</li>
            <li>order arrived very quickly and I have had no problems.</li>
            <li>The smell is easily masked when accompanied with another oil.</li>
            <li>Smells nutty but easy to get used to</li>
            <li>Not one to give up easily</li>
            <li>thing I can think to complain about is the smell, but that&#x27;s an easily remedied situation.</li>
            <li>Visit my Website for more good products for Natural hair care.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I received this item very quickly from the seller.</li>
            <li>/&gt;The oil is easily applied and stays on all night.</li>
            <li>Mine is VERY mild and reminds me of incense, not ashes.</li>
            <li>This product came very quickly and i couldnt wait to use it.</li>
            <li>I bought it specifically because i read reviews saying it went on your hair and spread easily.  </li>
            <li>The products I ordered were the oil and an applicator bottle because its so easy to apply that way.</li>
            <li>It came very quick.</li>
            <li>It washes off easily with soap.</li>
            <li>Strong odor</li>
            <li>If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s not that strong where you can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li>As soon as I poured this oil into my hand, I got a strong wiff of cigarettes.</li>
            <li>but it is not so strong that people would smell you coming.</li>
            <li>, THE SMELL WASNT THAT STRONG</li>
            <li>Has a strong smell.</li>
            <li>It smooths onto your hair very easily and is absorbed well.</li>
            <li>Ive only had it for a week, so I haven&#x27;t experienced any hair growth, but so far its been great.</li>
            <li>It is a beautiful hair type but very fragile.  </li>
            <li>But a wonderful moisturizer, although I would recommend just using it on the scalp because it can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair is fine</li>
            <li>The product seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li>but if you are interested in using this product by itself it may not be the best idea unless you like walking around smelling like a deep fryer,which even using the smallest amount</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s fine as I just needed to get my hands on castor oil ad</li>
            <li>Black Jamacian Castor Oil is the best ever!</li>
            <li>Either way is fine.</li>
            <li>fine hair, thats wavy.</li>
            <li>This Black Castor Oil provides excellent results.</li>
            <li>I truly enjoyed the results and i recieved it quick.</li>
            <li>It arrived quickly!</li>
            <li>Very good oil for a very dry scalp.</li>
            <li>I have light brown hair and it works just fine.</li>
            <li>Sometimes I even use a little on my body after a bath or shower great product!!</li>
            <li>This product came right away and it has been working great this far!</li>
            <li>This is by far the best oil I&#x27;ve used on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>and I must say I see a huge improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li>but why take the chance, makes for a great oil rub, there is no real scent, maybe add some to make it more pleasing....</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge improvements in hair growth while using this product.</li>
            <li>Ladies please do not buy this product, I know is cheap but this doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li>but my hair has become thicker my edges have filled in</li>
            <li>I use this once a week to lightly moisturize my scalp..</li>
            <li>Overall its a great product.</li>
            <li>Great for hair growth- especially when transitioning.</li>
            <li>If you have proven techniques that gives results for hair growth please contact me via email so we can spread the news for free to all men who needs it.</li>
            <li>this stuff works great especially if you have some hair breakage.</li>
            <li>and it is amazing how much my hair has grown since then by using this product.</li>
            <li>Thankfully the cator smell is light.</li>
            <li>It keeps my spiral curls frizz free and bouncy.</li>
            <li>MY HAIRS HAVE FILLED IN..</li>
            <li>please please sell products that work...not looking for a miracle just real and honest results.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Economical, ecological solution for scalp needs.</li>
            <li>just a dab used with my conditioner makes my hair feel so free and tangle free.</li>
            <li>I bought this product primarily to help promote hair growth along my hair line.  </li>
            <li>but it does make a fantastic cleansing oil</li>
            <li>Its is great for your hair, but I get the same effect with NOW Castor oil for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li>I finally gave in to temptation, this is the best thing that has ever happened to my hair, after just one week, my hair is soft as cotton,no more breakage.</li>
            <li>Aside from hair, a light dab moisturizes my face and skin.</li>
            <li>In the winter months, I apply some lightly to my lips for moisture and to fight chap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve heard fantastic things about JBCO, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t had the results that most have suggested (after a couple of months worth of use); however, I plan to finish the bottle with the hope that my hair will thicken up a bit.</li>
            <li>The item is as detailed.</li>
            <li>I also use it with coconut oil as a pre poo and enjoy it.</li>
            <li>Great for deep treatment with a bit of Nature&#x27;s Way Coconut Oil-extra Virgin (also on Amazon) and sit under the dryer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>They are so much fuller and the bald patches are filling in nicely.</li>
            <li>After one month, completely filled in...</li>
            <li>It worked great for me, I saw results the next day.</li>
            <li>Great purchase will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li>This one was &amp;#34;light light brown&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li>Washed it off with shampoo and now my hair feels ridiculously smooth.</li>
            <li>Great product fro hair growth especially if you hair is thinning.</li>
            <li>On February 8, 2013, the bald spot was completely filled in with HAIR, almost 1/2 inch.  </li>
            <li>it does however make you hair shiny and smooth, but you need to keep it away from the scalp.</li>
            <li>But this product is fabulous.</li>
            <li>It really helps with dryness and got my hair growing nicely.  </li>
            <li>so happy i got my product and am looking forward to using it to grow my hairline back....</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>So you also may want to make sure you don&#x27;t have any underlying medical conditions that aid in shedding and breakage.biotin, prenatal pills etc, and find good hair creams to use.</li>
            <li>Love it and still have a good amount left!</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>This is also good to help prevent breakage of hair allowing proper, healthy growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li>use Gels &amp; like to use good natural things...</li>
            <li>So far, so good.  </li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>
            <li>regret not reading the most recent reviews instead of the good ones.</li>
            <li>Good stuff so far for what I need it for</li>
            <li>So far so good on this product</li>
            <li>So far so good.</li>

            <li>I apply it to my top and bottom lashes very close to the lash line every night before bed, and also on my top lashes before applying make-up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I apply it to my top and bottom lashes very close to the lash line every night before bed, and also on my top lashes before applying make-up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>As for growth (lenth wise) I can&#x27;t say there has been much so far.</li>
            <li>So far im stilling trying to see if this was a good buy.</li>
            <li>Just started using the product and so far so good.</li>
            <li>Came fairly quick and I still have more than 3/4 bottle full.</li>
            <li>Right now I am on crappy chemo which thins my hair and makes it more prone to shedding and breakage.</li>
            <li>Right now I am on crappy chemo which thins my hair and makes it more prone to shedding and breakage.</li>
            <li>I ordered 2 more bottles right away</li>
            <li>Very good quality oil, works well with my other hair care products.</li>
            <li>i bought this because i saw many positive comments from the site, but it turns out neutral!</li>
            <li>This product is great for mixing with other oils however be sure of how you store it so that it doesn&#x27;t get rancid.</li>
            <li>but it only been about 1 1/2 mnths LOVE It!!</li>
            <li>I use a spoolie brush, but Q-tips or an old clean mascara wand will do just as good.</li>
            <li>I use a spoolie brush, but Q-tips or an old clean mascara wand will do just as good.</li>
            <li>Strong believer in oils, and great to chase away dry skin!</li>
            <li>I have fine, but loosely curled hair and this does great.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d give this a higher rating if it smelled better or had no scent at all.</li>
            <li>This oil has a thickness and heaviness and a unique smell.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth it, I tell you!</li>
            <li>Worth the buy!</li>
            <li>I gave 5 stars because I&#x27;m just really excited to use this product on my hair.</li>
            <li>My edges are growing and i&#x27;m just so excited.</li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Tropic Isle makers, I&#x27;m excited to see my hair length &amp; luster will be like in the coming future.(with continued use of your product, of course.</li>
            <li>but worth the money!</li>
            <li>originally said in this review that I was using this for an hair growth oil.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this in attempt to help with hair loss on my head.</li>
            <li>I started my Healthy Hair Journey in 2010 and when I first heard of this product I had to order it.</li>
            <li>was more consistent</li>
            <li>I ordered this product for my hair, and it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li>Bought two more for my family members after raving about the first purchase I did of JBCO a month before.</li>
            <li>Within one week exactly, I was able to see hair filling in.</li>
            <li>but I think this product was pretty ok.</li>
            <li>I love it thanks!</li>
            <li>I may need to use it longer to see significant results.</li>
            <li>First off, this oil feels more like molasses.</li>
            <li>but did not notice anything significant.  </li>
            <li>That product is worth the money!</li>
            <li>I was so excited reading all the reviews online about.</li>
            <li>I was excited</li>
            <li>I mostly use it in my hot oil treatments or to moisturize my scalp.</li>
            <li>I am in love once again, just don&#x27;t tell my husband ;)</li>
            <li>In just a week of using this product I noticed results :) I was a bit spectacle but decided to try it, the smell is not so hot but after leaving it in overnight the smell did not linger no matter</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t make my hair grow at all, but it is a great moisturizer if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li>Great for dry skin or to soften your hair.  </li>
            <li>I thought I would have to do this for the rest of my life, but I thought since I had such great success using the oil on my hair, maybe, just maybe it could help my brows.</li>
            <li>I recommend to use it on clean hair..</li>
            <li>I have adopted an all natural lifestyle for my hair, and I am sure glad that I added this to my regimen.</li>
            <li>I have noticed that the benefits of this oil aren&#x27;t as great when I used it while my hair was dry.</li>
            <li>Amidst the smell, I mixed it with coconut oil to get a pleasant scent</li>
            <li>a strong distinct smoky odor</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t see how there are so many positive reviews for this stuff</li>
            <li>Very nice price for the size and the product really does wonders for my naturally kinky hair.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth trying for the price and quick delivery!</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t see anything special effect on my hair</li>
            <li>It is a great oil and it does wonders in hair concoctions, deep conditioners and hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li>I combine this product with megatek for the complete hair growth serum and it works amazingly</li>
            <li>After one month of use, the bottle is still quite full.</li>
            <li>My beard is completely full now since using this product.</li>
            <li>My scalp gently pulsates after I do the massages, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li>For men with thinning or wanting a full beard try it out.</li>
            <li>I had heard such good reviews on this castor oil.  </li>
            <li>Ive heard its good, im not regular using it</li>
            <li>My suggestion, is that one could add a good essential oil to the bottle to tweak the smell.  </li>
            <li>Water won&#x27;t do any good because essential oils are oil soluble.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s full advantages</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve only heard good things about it.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re now almost completely full and all it took was two months of semi-diligent application (I&#x27;m not gonna lie,</li>
            <li>I really ddntknow what to expect because despite the reviews most products can be a hitor miss for my hair.</li>
            <li>but  so far it is nice.  </li>
            <li>Already have it just buying to keep my stock full.</li>
            <li>works really well, would recommend, need to purchase more. . . . . .  . . . . . .</li>
            <li>In addition, this 4 oz bottle is still 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>In addition, this 4 oz bottle is still 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li>Ok so this is 100percent real</li>
            <li>Especially if you have a good regimen.</li>
            <li>overall the benefits are good for you, so instead of using it for my hair</li>
            <li>I love this oil I&#x27;e heard so much about it every where when I researched products for hair growth.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t try it on my skin, but I am sure it is very moisturing</li>
            <li>I love this product my hair shines really well</li>
            <li>This product is used as recommended, but more time is needed before I&#x27;ll really evaluate it.</li>
            <li>Its greasy so use before bed only and find a good applicator I gave up and use my fingers to massage it in.</li>
            <li>Overall a good product.</li>
            <li>So overall, I think this is a good product</li>
            <li>So I guess it&#x27;s true that this product works for some, but not for others.</li>
            <li>but I do think the oil is authentic with real ingredients, it smells like charcoal</li>
            <li>Wake with sweet baby hands and feet, and reinforced nail cuticles.</li>
            <li>big bottle is a good deal too.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks but want to give it a full 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>&quot; you have a head full of hair.\\</li>
            <li>Overall good product.</li>
            <li>It is too thick for my relaxed hair, but works perfectly on her hair.</li>
            <li>Now I know why so many Jamaicans have thick, beautiful hair, no matter</li>
            <li>The smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li>Smell is not bad so no problems there.</li>
            <li>I was cautious because some ppl talked about the &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; smell, but when I used it found that the smell was not bad at all.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s supposedly slightly thinner in consistency, but people seem to like it and it smells good, so the reviews say (I haven&#x27;t and don&#x27;t plan on trying it, I&#x27;m satisfied with this original).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>wonderful product looking forward to using more of this line I have recommended this product to other people can&#x27;t wait to order my next order</li>
            <li>The first time I used this oil it made my hair sooo shiny and strong.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong, but that&#x27;s what you should expect being that it&#x27;s castor oil.</li>
            <li>The smell is a bit strong at first, though it does not stick to your hair after you wash it out.</li>
            <li>Exactly what I was looking for and I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li>am happy that I read other reviews and took a chance.</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m happy with it as i mix it with other oils.</li>
            <li>a quick shuffling of the comb in my eyebrow region removes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They aren&#x27;t necessarily fuller because that would require more hair follicles, but maybe in more time.</li>
            <li>Loyal to jbco</li>
            <li>the smell is like cigarette ashes but its mild</li>
            <li>It thickened my hair and has tremendously reversed my damaged hair.</li>
            <li>Came quickly.</li>
            <li>I read online that this makes your hair thick, I read many great reviews on it, so i am trying it.</li>
            <li>Plus the scent is really mild</li>
            <li>Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li>I love to make a scrub from brown sugar,aloe vera, salicylic acid and a bit of castor oil and put it on, and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>And they were quick to sent in my product.</li>
            <li>Item was shipped quickly; was please with the product.</li>
            <li>And the delivery was quick</li>
            <li>OMG I see what the hype was about it leaves your hair feeling super</li>
            <li>I like this much better than regular castor oil which seems a bit more dense.  </li>
            <li>Seems mildly richer than the Heritage product</li>
            <li>This is a good oil for eliminating frizzy hair, but as far as growth I really have not seen a difference.  </li>
            <li>and quick too..</li>
            <li>Came in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>It has a mild odor.  </li>
            <li>It makes my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li>It also smoothes out the wrinkles I have on my shoulders from too many sunburns, so I imagine it will work well for the older folks.</li>
            <li>I am so lucky to come across this product.</li>
            <li>I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li>I really enjoy the product and the very reasonable price for this product wished  </li>
            <li>If you sincerely cannot stand the smell, I would highly suggest layering your JBCO treatment with Oyin Handmade Juices and Berries Herbal Leave-In Hair Tonic.</li>
            <li>I have relaxed hair and I love this product so far!!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still too early to give a report on the results, but it&#x27;s a very nice product so far.</li>
            <li>There is a light coffee scent when first using but it disappears and is not so noticeable.</li>
            <li>I dont know about my hair growing more than normal</li>
            <li>It has a smoky smell that i found kind of strange at first but it ok now</li>
            <li>My Black Castor oil arrived in good shape and very quickly.</li>
            <li>Anyways, my hair is soft, strong and is growing!</li>
            <li>It really is great when combined with other products, and I add it to my leave in conditioner which makes my hair more soft.  </li>
            <li>come with good quality and long usable date!</li>
            <li>it really does a good job keeping those edges smooth and flat.</li>
            <li>Before my new growth felt like a brillo pad :).  </li>
            <li>Black castor oil great</li>
            <li>I will keep buying it, because it is a good moisturizer for dry lips and skin, but does not do anything for my hair and makes my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li>It was amazing how quickly my hair grew and the Jamaican black castor oil def had a lot to do with it because I had used most of the bottle for the concoction.</li>
            <li>this product gave me a good amount of moisture to my extremely dry psoriasis scalp.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a good product to help with dry hair.</li>
            <li>As for my edges, my mom has been using emu oil on hers for around the same amount of time that I have been using the castor oil, and her edges look so much better!  </li>
            <li>Thanks Tropic Isle!!  </li>
            <li>The seller is friendly, efficient, and fast!  </li>
            <li>Smell funny!</li>
            <li>Thanks Tropic Isle!!</li>

            <li>I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase more!</li>
            <li>I love this product for my natural hair!</li>

            <li>My hair looks and feels luscious for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li>Love this oil so far!</li>
            <li>Great brand, you just can&#x27;t go wrong with the many uses of organic castor oil!</li>
            <li>It really is a great product a little sticky though.</li>
            <li>It is a little cheaper on another website but it is a great product.</li>
            <li>it is softer and has stop sheding so very much now instead of a comb full of hair</li>
            <li>Very good product thick</li>
            <li>It is very thick and doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but the benefits are worth it.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t tried the original jamaican black castor oil without the lavender, I heard it was good</li>
            <li>LOL, it fades after a few hours.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read amazing reviews about this, but i didn&#x27;t like it personally.</li>
            <li>hope you guy enjoy as much as I do..</li>
            <li>Nothing amazing yet, but I have only been using it for three weeks or so.</li>
            <li>But use tiny drops and this is amazing.</li>
            <li>FAST SERVICE ALONG WITH SECURE PACKAGING</li>
            <li>From what I have read,the success of JBCO is subjective.</li>
            <li>Love this product wow</li>
            <li>Chicks\\&quot; leave in conditioner, It is costly, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li>Not crazy about the smell of the oil itself</li>
            <li>but I like mixing it with sweet almond oil for hot oil treatments once a week.</li>
            <li>Worth your time and money.  </li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>I love how soft this stuff makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth purchasing again.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;re going to add essential oil to this JBCO, I recommend calendula, blood orange, lavender...something with a nice scent.  </li>
            <li>Leaves my beard soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product, it&#x27;s working wonderfully so far</li>
            <li>It has a distinct smell but it fades and I don&#x27;t notice it after I apply the oil.</li>
            <li>To use this I mix his with warm coconut oil and essential peppermint oil to stimulate my scalp.</li>
            <li>and I love natural products.</li>
            <li>JBCO is worth a shot</li>
            <li>I read on many natural hair blogs about this product.</li>
            <li>worth ordering.</li>
            <li>It really does help hair grow, keep eye area fresh and wrinkle free, removes scars, etc.</li>
            <li>Worth the money which is not a lot</li>
            <li>I must use it a bit longer  to determine it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li>and so far i love the results..</li>
            <li>But so far it seems to be ok</li>
            <li>Let me tell you what it does for my sensitive skin:&lt;br /&gt;Mosquitoes love me.</li>
            <li>It was worth the wait</li>
            <li>It was well worth the buy, I saw a difference within days.</li>
            <li>This is a very rich and lush oil.  </li>
            <li>The Living Black Castor Oil is amazing!</li>
            <li>The Living Black Castor Oil is amazing!</li>
            <li>If you suffer from dermatitis, this Jamaican black castor oil is amazing!</li>
            <li>Tropic Isle&#x27;s Jamaican Black Castor Oil is amazing!</li>
            <li>&amp; this is thick and rich and feels great.</li>
            <li>I received it pretty quick.</li>
            <li>though, it can get into your eyes) and seen them grow and on my dry skin and seen it glow (this is best for dry skin</li>
            <li>I was excited but also a bit sceptical because I didn&#x27;t know if all the hype is real or not, but I noticed improvement in my hair within three weeks give or take a day or so.</li>
            <li>I am only on my first bottle but so far working great ..</li>
            <li>The smell takes some getting used to but other than that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li>but I remain unconvinced that this is a superior product to any other.</li>
            <li>The amount in the bottle couldn&#x27;t really see if it did anything significant.</li>
            <li>Its just right for all my needs.</li>
            <li>Received it on time and it was the right product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using JBCO along with emu oil twice a day (when I wake up and right before bed).  </li>
            <li>shipment was right on time</li>
            <li>Right now I haven&#x27;t seen in changes in skin or hair.</li>
            <li>Finances are troublesome for my family right now</li>
            <li>Finances are troublesome for my family right now</li>
            <li>The redness doesn&#x27;t fade right away, but it helps with the pain and infection.&lt;br /&gt;Sunburned and no aloe vera?</li>
            <li>I gave my girlfriend some when I visited her and it eased the pain she was having around her right shoulders.</li>
            <li>I received this product on March 5, 2013 and started using it right away.</li>
            <li>around my edges are thinning from braids and right sew-ins</li>
            <li>I love how dark and healthy it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I applied this to my hair exactly as told, rub into roots then apply to the rest,, I left it in for 2 hours and had nice results.</li>
            <li>Mainly, I use it (lightly) to moisturize my scalp post-shampoo.</li>
            <li>After mixing them up in correct quantaties, I began to apply the oils and sure enough within 2 weeks of use my eyelashes were so full</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but was only pleasantly surprised with how much I liked this product!</li>
            <li>Have not seen full result of hair growth as was advertised from a certain magazine.  </li>
            <li>Took a little while to get used to the smell, It is just a strong woodsy smell, but i liked it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t bother me as much because I suppose it&#x27;s good for my really dry, dandruff prone scalp.</li>
            <li>The oil is light, not thick.</li>
            <li>, this is my first time purchasing this product, it has a distinct smell to it but tolerable.</li>
            <li>Aside from it being sticky and thick, I love how it&#x27;s made my hair look so much more healthier!</li>
            <li>The product arrived quickly and smells so pure.</li>
            <li>I like black castor oil because it is much lighter and seemingly more effective in many ways than regular castor oils.</li>
            <li>I want to use this more because it&#x27;s nice and viscous which lasts a long time and your scalp does not dry up.</li>
            <li>When I&#x27;m using this on my scalp and hair, whether it&#x27;s before bed or styling for the day, once I use it, I spray my hair with Palmer&#x27;s Olive Oil with Vitamin E hair spray because it has a nice clean smell that gives my hair that high gloss sheen all day long.  </li>
            <li>Jamaican Black Castor Oil is a good product.</li>
            <li>J.B.C.O always makes my hair soft and pliable when I use it and it makes my hair grow very quickly.</li>
            <li>Give me a few more weeks with this product and I will have more to contribute toward the thickness and growing power.</li>
            <li>great for african american hair</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I love using it as part of my natural hair regimen, it really helps retain moisture and grow it.</li>
            <li>After i wash my hair and blow dry, I rub a nice amount in hand then rub it on my hair.</li>
            <li>I read some articles that said black castor oil was good for ache and pains as well as hair, skin, lashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li>They have grown now to over half an inch and are looking good.</li>
            <li>I thought I had been ripped off, but I am glad I decided to try it any way because this stuff really does do as people have claimed as far as helping hair to regrow.</li>
            <li>I purchased the black castor oil for my hair, but have found out that it is good for skin and scalp conditions.</li>
            <li>Service was quick and fast .</li>
            <li>Also received the product super fast and was packaged</li>
            <li>the good news is my hair is breaking less</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and keeps hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping</li>
            <li>this is a great product that African american ladies will truly see results and benefit from.</li>
            <li>The bottle lasted over 4 months so far and is still going strong.</li>
            <li>everyone, I know my hair will grow long, healthy and full.</li>
            <li>After all the good reviews and word of mouth about black castor oil, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li>this oil is a 10/10 has helped me in anyway and has gave me a lot of NEW GROWTH !!!</li>
            <li>My hairdresser suggested pure castor oil to help it grown back healthily (if that&#x27;s a word), and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any notable changes but</li>
            <li>Several months later:  This oil is too good to be true.</li>
            <li>The smell is very smoky (this is not unpleasant to me at all).</li>
            <li>At first it didn&#x27;t seem to work, but now I can really see tremendous hair growth at my hairline.</li>
            <li>I thought because of the dark color it would have a strong overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li>We recommend this oil very much.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>I very much wanted to believe the hype about this product, but al I got was a greasy itchy scalp.</li>
            <li>It is VERY VERY greasy.</li>
            <li>I bought this product about a 3 weeks ago with the intention to use it to increase hair growth around my hairline, combat dry hair, and seal; so far, I&#x27;ve seen a great change in the moisture retention of my hair and the whole feel of it.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good stuff, really thick, so I don&#x27;t think it would make a good daily hair oil, but it&#x27;s definitely good in a small amount in a mixture of oils, and in skin products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m happy to say that I can feel new hair growth in those less dense areas.  </li>
            <li>It really grows my hair, sometimes i mix it with coconut oil because its quite thick, but other wise it works great on  my hair</li>
            <li>The best to keep my hair moistorized and a little does go a long way when using it.</li>
            <li>My hair is more manageable (fine 4B/C texture) with less breakage.</li>
            <li>I have thick curly hair and this oil is great for growth and sealing your ends to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li>is, it&#x27;s pretty damn</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and made my hair have a dewy look , didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy!</li>
            <li>used to be a blonde for over 20 years or more</li>
            <li>The item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li>UNLESS YOU WANT A HIGHLY IRRITATED SCALP!!</li>
            <li>It actually came 1 day before the date it was suppose to come, the sooner the better.</li>
            <li>I use it to do a hot oil treatment once a week</li>
            <li>So you also may want to make sure you don&#x27;t have any underlying medical conditions that aid in shedding and breakage.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t seen the rapid growth as some but the overall health of my hair is better...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll definitely order more.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s so worth it because it helps your hair grow so much.</li>
            <li>I use it as a hot oil sort of treatment before I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>I made the mistake of putting way too much on at first.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff I will continue to by its my second bottle</li>
            <li>will say, that I also bought the same brand JBCO Hair food, which has a much more pungeant smell/odor than this oil.  </li>
            <li>i love this stuff especially in myhair but also on my skin</li>
            <li>definitely going to order more when I run out</li>
            <li>I actually found more hair falling out while I was using it.</li>
            <li>and I was able to use the rest of it just recently to make a hot oil treatment and to use it on my edges.</li>
            <li>Love that it was double bubbled wrapped and taped for protection.</li>
            <li>Hope I see more from this product in the following weeks!</li>
            <li>Actually felt like I was losing more hair after using this.</li>
            <li>I add this with another oil for a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li>Most ppl use this product to grow back thinning hair or bald patches.</li>
            <li>The product does tingle for about 5 minutes when first applied, but then it subside.  </li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li>The first time it was sticky like honey or sap.</li>
            <li>I heated it today with coconut oil and its pretty drippy.</li>
            <li>But Iwill let post results later if I see results.:)</li>
            <li>My ends have become more nourished and in the 3 weeks of use only 2 times a week ( bc of smell and oiliness)</li>
            <li>I have noticed a healthy shine and bounce back in my hair.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I love this product for multiple reasons.  </li>
            <li>My feet are so soft and callus/shed free.  </li>
            <li>This was my first time trying castor oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had it for a while, and I think that I only used it one time more than once a week.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what there is to review about this oil, its like asking for a review of olive oil!</li>
            <li>this was my first time using</li>
            <li>and when I took the braid out, my hair was pretty knotted.</li>
            <li>Suuuper fast shipping.!</li>
            <li>I definitely recommend this product and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Also, wash your face gently in the morning as well!</li>
            <li>This did absolutely nothing for me, but give me an eye infection!</li>
            <li>Bottom line is with consistent use, it works like a charm.</li>
            <li>i love it and woudl definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m about two thirds through my first bottle</li>
            <li>I almost gave this product an unfavorable review when I first received it.</li>
            <li>when i first used it my scalp did itch n tingle</li>
            <li>I experience so much growth!</li>
            <li>It is exactly what it says it is....</li>
            <li>This has been so helpful for many different things.</li>
            <li>The first day of application I always wear a turban.</li>
            <li>I was reluctant at first but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m starting to love it.</li>
            <li>It came fast!</li>
            <li>This was my first time ordering this product and it met my expectation.</li>
            <li>Use consistently, you will see a difference in your hair strength and growth.  </li>
            <li>really can&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li>and although I have not been consistent I see progress.</li>
            <li>This works better than the capsacin creams which can get into the eyes after applying the cream in the middle of the night.    </li>
            <li>I am enjoying it overall!</li>
            <li>I also made sure that she started sleeping on a satin pillowcase and wearing a satin cap, washing with her remaining hair in braids and using Shea moisture shampoo only on her scalp.  </li>
            <li>I definitely would recommend this product to anyone!!:))</li>
            <li>I have not used the porduct yet but it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>Love it, used it on my hair regularly to give it moisture</li>
            <li>Love this will reorder in the future.</li>
            <li>First, it&#x27;s not a miracle drug</li>
            <li>This gem of an oil is our #1 best kept beauty secret ladies!</li>
            <li>This has really made me and my daughter&#x27;s hair grow!</li>
            <li>within the first couple weeks of use i started noticing growth my colour was growing out</li>
            <li>This product did exactly what everyone says it does.</li>
            <li>Recently my edges broke off (lol) and now that I use this stuff I can really see them coming back.</li>
            <li>and I applied it for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li>If used consistently, this will grow your hair longer.</li>
            <li>It might be better for someone with really short hair.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>Castor Oil is used for many different beauty remedies.</li>
            <li>but you have to be willing put in the time to see optimal results.</li>
            <li>Its the first day</li>
            <li>I am also going to get a higher MCG Biotin pill</li>
            <li>As with anything, a well balanced diet comes first.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried grape seed oil, olive oil, coconut oil and for the first time castor oil.</li>
            <li>But must admit, I haven&#x27;t used it consistently to see a difference in growth in my edges.  </li>
            <li>This was the whole reason I purchased!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better if you do this before bed, otherwise your vision will suck and your eye area will be greasy and gross.</li>
            <li>This is my second bottle of this magical oil.</li>
            <li>This really worked!</li>
            <li>It really works!</li>
            <li>Just applied this stuff to my roots for the first time today.</li>
            <li>and it makes my oil mixtures so much easier to apply to my hair!</li>
            <li>I did a hot oil treatment with it</li>
            <li>I do NOT recommend this to anyone (I&#x27;m glad I only applied it to my eyelashes</li>
            <li>This product absorbed very well into the scalp and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li>The biggest suggestion I have for anyone who is looking to try this product for the first time is GIVE IT TIME.</li>
            <li>Better than any facial lotion.</li>
            <li>People can never guess my age ;)</li>
            <li>Definitely repurchasing :)</li>
            <li>first off i bought this for hair but decided to also use it on eyelashes and brows.</li>
            <li>When i first started using this oil</li>
            <li>use it everyday for good result</li>
            <li>After more research I found it was ALL natural and wasn&#x27;t only great for hair but lots of other things!</li>
            <li>Black castor oil is great for natural hair.</li>
            <li>It has a honey texture; great for coarse and dry hair.</li>
            <li>To me, it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable unless my nose was right on the cap or bottle.</li>
            <li>I will continue to use in hair treatments to see how much of a difference it makes, can&#x27;t say right now.</li>
            <li>I think this is going to be a great product, only because my friend are giving it such high praise.</li>
            <li>However, I will caution that a cap full is more than enough for one entire head full of hair.</li>
            <li>Great buy especially if your transitioning back to natural like me !!</li>
            <li>Make my hair soft don&#x27;t put to much and you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li>this is a staple product I only use castor oil since Im a kinky curly natural girl!!!!!!!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t attest to its effectiveness for pattern baldness or hormonal based hair lose, but for lose due to styling this is absolutely an amazing solution.</li>
            <li>I warm it between my fingers then apply to my scalp (every other night about three times a week)</li>
            <li>i havent seen any significant hair growth yet, but it does hydrates my hair and scalp and keeps it feeling really soft</li>
            <li>i like the extra dark kind better for my hair.</li>
            <li>and I decided to try this brand of black castor oil due to the wonderful reviews.</li>
            <li>this really works and I&#x27;m very surprised and excited.</li>
            <li>Seriously, this is great for hair.  </li>
            <li>Great so far for me because it moisturizes without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li>i don&#x27;t use so much on my hair because ive found red pimento hair growth oil was a lot better..</li>
            <li>this product was recommended by many people, I use it regularly but don&#x27;t see too much of a difference as people told me I would have.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s ok, of course nothing works fast enough these days, but hopefully will start to see results.</li>
            <li>Overall I feel that the product was good that is versitile with its different uses.  </li>
            <li>The jbco is a good product , i found a bigger bottle for cheaper locally</li>
            <li>Love this oil very good and thick use a little you won&#x27;t need alot.</li>
            <li>Used four bottles without any positive result.  </li>
            <li>Hopefully, I&#x27;ll have positive results.</li>
            <li>I bought it to see if it would grow my sides, based on youtube users positive reviews of the product.</li>
            <li>it works great for moisturizing my natural African American hair.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily and actually prevents my skin from becoming oily.</li>
            <li>Other than that this product is great and will definitely be purchasing again for my hair regimen.</li>
            <li>I really think this stuff does exactly what I hoped it would.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve experienced damage to my hair due to using relaxers and not maintaining my hair properly (I know shame on me!).</li>
            <li>love this stuff really works great for dark age spots on African American skin</li>
            <li>even used it as a hot oil treatment and my hair has grown so much</li>
            <li>I may need to take a heeping tablespoon full for old times sake????  </li>
            <li>And I literally just took a shower and washed my hair and let me tell you, it is SO soft, full and thicker than it was 3 days ago before I started using</li>
            <li>and it has made my new growh soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li>Lays my hair down nicely</li>
            <li>It leaves hair a little greasy if too much is applied but other than that, perfect!</li>
            <li>Jamaican Black Castor Oil is AMAZING for your hair.</li>
            <li>Be sure to wet your hair first.  </li>
            <li>This oil has my hair super soft .</li>
            <li>I mixed mine in both a shea butter concoction and hair oil concoction (both in a style similar to Youtube&#x27;s Naptural85), and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re so long, dark, fuller just beautiful.</li>
            <li>Strong smell when you initially use it, but it does fade away.</li>
            <li>Its a thick oil with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li>It certainly does what it says.  </li>
            <li>going to stick with coconut oil 100% pure.</li>
            <li>i began using JBCO to make my hair denser in certain areas.  </li>
            <li>So this stuff certainly helps my hair, but i wouldnt leave it in my hair.</li>
            <li>Can&#x27;t live without this product!!</li>
            <li>I got the product very quickly after ordering it and it came in a very protective packaging which i definitely appreciate.  </li>
            <li>It is thick and it able to be spread easily.</li>
            <li>Also great for those dry, rough and itchy spots on your knees and elbows!&lt;br /&gt;Overdried hands and brittle nails from too much dishwashing?</li>
            <li>and it works just fine for my hair, especially in the winter month.</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit off putting initially,  but after about 10 minutes it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>It was free shipping and it arrived in 2 days and was more than half off than if I had gone to the store near me.</li>
            <li>It arrived in a timely fashion and was decently wrapped!</li>
            <li>The oil is very thick and has a scent which I can live with, it&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li>/&gt;The girls who threads my eyebrows suggested warming up the oil in those little plastic travel shampoo containers and heating it by placing it in water that was warm from the pot.</li>
            <li>but  I have since learned that you need to warm it up to make it a little thinner.  </li>
            <li>I Warm it up a little.  </li>
            <li>Smoky smell, thick texture, and wonderful for rehydration of dry scalp issues!</li>
            <li>the smell is a little different like a woody burnt bacon smell but it is doing great</li>
            <li>I have experienced extreme dryness and shedding for months and single strand knots.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks I noticed amazing growth on my temples.  </li>
            <li>I am very happy I purchased it, and I hope my review helps someone else discover this natural secret! &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li>I am Jamaican and I know the real thing.</li>
            <li>I started breaking out which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li>didn&#x27;t really care to treat this until about a month ago when I got hit by a car, broke my arm, and tore a muscle in my leg.</li>
            <li>This is just how it has worked for me and maybe this can help those who haven&#x27;t had as much luck as others using the castor oil to treat the hair loss around the temple/edges.</li>
            <li>I apply it on my edges at night before bed gently massaging it in</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li>The bottle is glass and this stuff makes my hair thicker and much</li>
            <li>This really made my hair grow as promised... will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Nothing was damaged, it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>I havent been using it very long,but i can already see a change in how my hair looks,and feels.</li>
            <li>I like that the product is very think</li>
            <li>It really works and helps your hair to grow.</li>
            <li>I have the 4 oz and its goin fast.</li>
            <li>I really like the castor oil.  </li>
            <li>I massage into my hair and scalp before washing my hair and it just makes my wash process so much nicer.  </li>
            <li>i mix mines with coconut oil thanks</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t expect overnight results because what product really gives you overnight results?</li>
            <li>After that I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li>so I wasn&#x27;t really paying attention to my progress and with its reputation</li>
            <li>The severe itching comes from when you put too much on your scalp.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not going to make it grow any faster by putting too much on it.</li>
            <li>Again putting too much on your hair could be causing it to shed.</li>
            <li>,that was until i ran across a very wonderul product &amp; the name of that product</li>
            <li>and I wore them so much</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much growth lengthwise</li>
            <li>ALL OF THAT WAS STRAIGHT OUT</li>
            <li>i haven&#x27;t notice much of a difference yet</li>
            <li>it really works wonders</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair and it really has grew and gotten thicker.</li>
            <li>Then I google it and found so much benefits from this oil.</li>
            <li>got here fast</li>
            <li>my hair is growing fast</li>
            <li>It has helped my locs grow fast as well as help oil my scalp</li>
            <li>It did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li>This stuff really and truly work.</li>
            <li>works very well if you have breakage or thinning.</li>
            <li>fast shipping</li>
            <li>It really keeps my hair hydrated, and my edges are growing.</li>
            <li>but I like the product so much that I began using it in my hair.</li>
            <li>and I have not seen much change.</li>
            <li>Very timely, and no damage done.</li>
            <li>I love to use this when my hair is wet &amp; I&#x27;m doing a two-strand twist style.  </li>
            <li>Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read so much about it helping thining hair.</li>
            <li>thanks for the prouduct</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to give this 3 bottles before I can really tell if it&#x27;s working or not</li>
            <li>My eyelashes don&#x27;t fall out as much as before.</li>
            <li>but the smell really makes it unbearable.</li>
            <li>So can&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li>Castor oil really helps to moisturize your hair.</li>
            <li>it has done my scalp so much justice</li>
            <li>please try it ladies and gentlemen if you aren&#x27;t ready to shave your heads bald.</li>
            <li>It is very sticky of course, but it also did nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li>but I really have noticed a difference along my part after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li>Absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li>It really helps with hair growth as well as reducing shedding.  </li>
            <li>but I think I need some time for it to really work</li>
            <li>The reviewer was absolutely correct.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t really smell it in my hair.  </li>
            <li>can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve really seen any improvement</li>
            <li>that may have helped/hendered speed of growth, length or luster:&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m a believer in dirty hair grows best, so I grease my scalp like 1x a week &amp; wash maybe 1x every month or 2.</li>
            <li>try not to wear my hair tied up so much.</li>
            <li>so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I really like the way it improves my hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s really too oily</li>
            <li>any product out there really helps hair to regrow.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty normal kinda like olive oil</li>
            <li>and it really worked wonders.</li>
            <li>It absorbs into the skin and is not sticky or greasy, telling me my body really needs this product.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much.</li>
            <li>My hair is much thicker than 8weeks ago.</li>
            <li>and in two weeks I had a reasonable amount of hair there, and in four weeks the hair was the length</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it twice, so I can&#x27;t really give a \\&quot;review\\&quot; of the product&#x27;s performace or efficacy, but I can comment on the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; or odor that people complain about.&lt;br /&gt;THERE</li>
            <li>i take these very day along with garlic pills.  </li>
            <li>oil really works.</li>
            <li>i notice i was applyin too much</li>
            <li>you really dont need much in your hair.</li>
            <li>you should really give it a try...</li>
            <li>i used this product in my hair and my eyebrows that i plucked to much.</li>
            <li>Ireally like this product and plan to purchase again really soon</li>
            <li>Thanks Tropic Isle...</li>
            <li>AND IT HEALS MUCH FASTER</li>
            <li>It also depends on how much and how often you apply this product.  </li>
            <li>It really works.</li>
            <li>After I wash my hair and apply it to my scalp, it feels really sticky.</li>
            <li>I will continue using this product and I will put my feedback in about 30 days to see if this oil is really working or not.</li>
            <li>it helps seal the locks really well.</li>
            <li>I manage my pain with diet (no wheat, corn, sugar, etc.) and gentle exercise.</li>
            <li>Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>It works really well with my hair</li>
            <li>this stuff really works</li>
            <li>and it looks like she will make this goal very soon.  </li>
            <li>We are both very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and it looks like she will make this goal very soon.  </li>
            <li>We are both very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li>My beautician talked me into trying another product which seems to really help</li>
            <li>HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t really see any difference, maybe because I stopped using it.</li>
            <li>Ended up throwing the whole bottle away.</li>
            <li>is really saying something.</li>
            <li>I am not putting it on straight</li>
            <li>My hair has grown so much since I start using JBCO.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>It gives my hair much needed strength💜</li>
            <li>Dont really see a difference after 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li>I really like the organic oil.</li>
            <li>Our hair looks much healthier and feels stronger since using it.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>It really moisturizes my hair.  </li>
            <li>AND IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li>you could tug on your hair too much and accidentaly pulling your hair out.</li>
            <li>I find that I don&#x27;t even use oil sheen spray as much as I use to.</li>
            <li>It grew and was so much thicker.</li>
            <li>This stuff really makes your hair grow.  </li>
            <li>Delivery was fast and packed well.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know if it works.</li>
            <li>It makes hair grow twice as fast.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it as often and then not at all because since I wash my hair once a week, the area in which the product was applied took on a very oily feel, so</li>
            <li>thank you so much for your service.</li>
            <li>I like this product its very sticky</li>
            <li>I purchased my item not off of amazon but the real website for this oil.</li>
            <li>She said it has made so much difference with helping the dryness of her hair.</li>
            <li>I really like doing my three times a week</li>
            <li>hair grows fast, but I think that this product has given my thickness a boost.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my hair</li>
            <li>It also lasts a while, you don&#x27;t need much to reap the benefits.</li>
            <li>Put too much on and you&#x27;ll break out from the greasiness clogging your pores.</li>
            <li>I put mine on those cotton pads and gently dab all over face, then rub over eyebrows and lips.</li>
            <li>My fianc&amp;eacute;e couldn&#x27;t believe my sunburn was gone that fast.</li>
            <li>/&gt;JBCO doesn&#x27;t really have much of a smell at oll to me.</li>
            <li>REALLY HELP MY EDGES GROW</li>
            <li>I have only had the product for almost two weeks, so I am not sure what the full outcome will be, but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li>and it really reverses the damage done on your hair.</li>
            <li>I was package in a plastic bottle and very oily.</li>
            <li>Can tell its straight from the islands.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very upset.</li>
            <li>Even my hair dresser was amazed at how much it grew( I hadn&#x27;t seen her in about 6 weeks)</li>
            <li>Very itchy on scalp...but very moisturizing on hair.</li>
            <li>it really isn&#x27;t when you put on your hair, but I do understand that if you are use to your hair products smelling fruity and sweetthat this smell is off putting.</li>
            <li>I was really hoping this would be my miracle oil.</li>
            <li>You can find it on Amazon and it smells absolutely DELICIOUS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>CAN&#x27;T SAY MUCH</li>
            <li>Beware that it is an oil, so if you put too much you will be greasy.</li>
            <li>Very sticky to try and massage into hair</li>
            <li>i tried this for two months straight</li>
            <li>I was expecting trouble, but after leaving it on for 2 hours, my scalp had absorbed most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>Since its a pretty thick and potent oil, I mix it with a carrier oil like avocado or sweet almond oil to minimize the shock it could have alone to my scalp.</li>
            <li>so the product is wonderful at keeping my thick, coarse hair soft and reducing</li>
            <li>Hopeful to see more results in the near future.</li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised  that this product actually works to promote hair growth as many reviews have said.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not too sure it was helpful but with natural hair, it keeps my hair oiled and it actually shines!</li>
            <li>Love it so far will buy a bigger size.</li>
            <li>Its a very think oil that is good for my thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li>Its good and thick.</li>
            <li>To me, it is more effective than other oil, such as coconut, Oliver oil, regular pure caser oil....</li>
            <li>Overall its a good product as its made my hair grow alot and my hair is pretty black.</li>
            <li>She pretty much told me this is what I would have to live with from years of getting my hair braided.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m talking about new hair, growing fast, and the condition of the length of my hair improved so much!</li>
            <li>However, it&#x27;s not the best product for those who are worried about it weighing their hair down, it is very heavy, and sticky.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s too early to tell right now.</li>
            <li>So far I&#x27;ve used this on my skin and hair, can&#x27;t say right now if there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li>I love to put a small amount in my hair before flat ironing it and it leaves it super smooth.</li>
            <li>, I mixed it with some other oils and it is so good.</li>
            <li>The smell is not notice for long and isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li>Honestly I&#x27;m not to sure what&#x27;s the best way to use this to regroup my edges from tight braids.</li>
            <li>but this was the missing key to give me a head full of thick, strong, shiny and beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li>Overall not disappointed.</li>
            <li>i was so excited to get this line of products I use it on a regular</li>
            <li>Not only has my already healthy hair grown, it has never been softer, no other oil provides the sealing protection, softness and itchy scalp relief as this.</li>
            <li>I will be buying more of this product and will see what other ways I can use it.</li>
            <li>I make sure I either spray with Olive oil or add some other porduct to cover up the smell.</li>
            <li>braids.but after i tried there other oil and it gave me more growth than anything i have tried biotin pills ,baby dont be bald,dr miricle, all oils.</li>
            <li>I add to conditioners and many other hair products.</li>
            <li>I chose it because of the reviews , and for what I have heard about it, I don&#x27;t use it every day, more like every other day, however I am not seeing results.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read it has many other uses</li>
            <li>I recommend mixing it with other oils just to be safe.</li>
            <li>Still figuring if I love it or not, I really don&#x27;t know how to use it!</li>
            <li>I have not been consistent in applying every night, but I do notice a little more hair coming in.</li>
            <li>for 4b/c hair thats a miracle.. I&#x27;m not sure about growth but with the oils I&#x27;m sure it will help!</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t see any significant hair growth, but my hair , as well as, my scalp were properly hydrated.</li>
            <li>its raw and keeps my hair nice</li>
            <li>It helps with moisture because my hair gets dry easily.</li>
            <li>My hair grows pretty fast naturally, so I cannot comment on whether JBCO helped in that aspect or not.</li>
            <li>It also works very well as a hot oil treatment, natural hair need lots of mosture.</li>
            <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s my fault that It&#x27;s not growing back as great as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li>not sure if it&#x27;s the phase I am in right now or the product I need more time to tell.</li>
            <li>, I was really surprised, I thought for sure it would be dry.</li>
            <li>Good when hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li>Naturally black and went for a very light caramel, brown/blonde. .</li>
            <li>This product smells much better than the JBCO produced by other companies, is thick and rich and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I parted my hair into sections beginning with the lower region and as strange as it may sound</li>
            <li>Recommendations: put the bottle under hot water to help loosen it up before using; use it once a week or overnight as a pre-poo; use a clarifying shampoo to ensure oil rinses out completely.</li>
            <li>Recently, I have been doing my own hair (I was natural for 3 years and switched back to relaxers) which included amping up my regimen.</li>
            <li>not worth the money...there are othjer products that you can use that are so much better</li>
            <li>So far, I really like it!</li>
            <li>BACK FULL</li>
            <li>I just mixed it with my almond oil and diluted it with some water and generously applied it to my roots and ends and the next day my hair was nice and soft.</li>
            <li>This is hands down my favorite oil.</li>
            <li>but you get used to it quick and its not bad just odd</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little thick and doesn&#x27;t smell the best</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really works,my hair looks little more thicker.</li>
            <li>Now, hairs are sprouting in that area (new hair!)</li>
            <li>I have put it on my eyebrows for 3 days and they have SO MUCH new growth!</li>
            <li>First and foremost, I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 years and my 4b hair has been fairly healthy throughout the entire time and is currently shoulder length.</li>
            <li>I use it, along with other oils and it really makes my feel hair soft and more healthier.</li>
            <li>For starters, it makes my new hair growth much thicker.</li>
            <li>My hair feels softer, less tangled, and my curls are more defined.  </li>
            <li>it makes my hair look even more black (temporarily), which i like.  </li>
            <li>Less is more.</li>
            <li>, Love my Jamaican Black Castor</li>
            <li>Love the black castor oil.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve read previous reviews and many people seem to complain about this product being too greasy or it has a stench to it.</li>
            <li>I love using jamaican black castor oil for a number of health &amp; beauty purposes.</li>
            <li>I know it works for others, I watched MANY YouTube reviews on this product, but they were 90% black girls, maybe that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work for me?</li>
            <li>I had a half dollar sized patch at the top front of my hair that had visibly thinned.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed less dryness around my hair line and my scalp seems to be more moisturized, since using this oil.</li>
            <li>It works okay to me, I prefer coconut oil as it less greasy and lightweight.</li>
            <li>I love it only thing i thought the bottle was a larger one.  </li>
            <li>And its proven to regulate DHT which is one of the factors if not the main factor of hairloss in men&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura d’or shampoo.</li>
            <li>the main Product&lt;br /&gt;Black</li>
            <li>It smells gross and is super sticky.</li>
            <li>I was having breakage problems around my hairline, mainly from sleeping without a cap or satin pillowcase.</li>
            <li>So I gave a little to my aunt to try (the little lasted her for MONTHS) , and she loved it!</li>
            <li>Luckily, I gave some to my granny, so she still had some left.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t particularly like the smell.</li>
            <li>Will definitely purchase more bottle shortly.</li>
            <li>I plan on keeping this as my main hair care and growth regime.</li>
            <li>Although it is a heavy oil, it absorbs well, and gives my natural hair a nice sheen.</li>
            <li>Looking for quick growth especially in areas that has no hair.</li>
            <li>I was particularly using it for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li>I bought this particular castor oil and Sundown Vitamin E oil 70,000 IU, as the pin also required vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>but I fully believe that my hair would not have grown back as quickly as it has with this product.</li>
            <li>Now I will have to most likely wear a wig until these areas thicken back up.</li>
            <li>The consistency is really thick and almost sticky but good for natural hair.</li>
            <li>the product is really doing wonders on my edges of my hair because has thicken my edges really really  good because they have always been so thin.</li>
            <li>However, if you are very sensitive to smell, you should test the real thing before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend Jamaican Black Castro Oil if your wanting to see result on Hair Growth. :)</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li>highly suggest seeing what you can get out of this before dropping dough on Latisse.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I am in Looovveee with Jamaican Castor oil, i highly recommend it.    </li>
            <li>and my oh my I&#x27;ve seen eyebrow hairs I haven&#x27;t seen since high school!!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I highly recommended this item..</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>and it wasnt unbelievable results, just being honest everyone ranting and raving about them receiving all these inches a month when in reality if ur hair grows fast or normal naturally ur going to get these results anyway because its your norm.</li>
            <li>in all, highly recommend adding this oil to your hair care routine.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>High quality castor oil..highly recommended</li>
            <li>and I use a clean mascara wand to put it on my lashes to keep them long and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>could&#x27;ve  received a 5 star but when receiving the product the top or cap is a little bent thank God</li>
            <li>Stating to work a little will keep using and probable order more.</li>
            <li>When I put it on my lashes and brows every night I do notice a little more fullness.</li>
            <li>But who cares about all that, the point is that it made my hair so SOFT!!</li>
            <li>This was said to be the most trusted brand and that it was a little exspensive</li>
            <li>So far I see a lot of improvement on the stretch marks!!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s good for keeping hair hydrated longer, so it feels less dry than before I started using it.</li>
            <li>Odorless, but very thick and good for moisture.</li>
            <li>I was expecting it to have a strong scent since other reviews stated it</li>
            <li>this stuff is awasome, repairs damaged hair, softents hair and increases hair growth, a friend told me about this stuff as i have recently had a fire-breathing-accident and part of my beard was destroyed and its awasome, best to use in small amounts, dont care much for smell (smells a little musty)</li>
            <li>it comes out amazing with a thick coat on it.</li>
            <li>also i applied it to a part in my hair that was really thinnin and so far its fillin up</li>
            <li>My hair, lashes feel very conditioned and soft.  </li>
            <li>Again it is very moisturizing on my natural hair.  </li>
            <li>I really like this oil and leave my hair soft and manageable and it does make your hair</li>
            <li>so I massage my scalp with this oil and mix it with another light oil, but nevertheless, I will use it till the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li>The real deal..using it as I transition from perm to Natural.</li>
            <li>there is real improvement in my hair, &amp; when used on a consistent basis with a regular hair care routine it works.</li>
            <li>I am African American with natural 4b/c hair and this product is magic.</li>
            <li>I will give it a few more weeks to see if I notice any results.</li>
            <li>However it did not grow my hair long yet, but now I have a head full of hair.</li>
            <li>Normally I use vitamin E oil on things like this, but I was out, and figured that this couldn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li>oil is really good on your edges to slick them back.</li>
            <li>this product is good and you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, so I am sure if will grow my hair.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;After looking at a few options I decided to try this out, as it seemed inexpensive and not harmful like so many others.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li>Ilike to use after a hot bath as it soaks into your damp skin and you can really reap the rewards, especially before bed when your body recharges and heals.</li>
            <li>Since castor oil is absorbed into the skin (laxative/purgative effect), I am limiting my use of the oil for heels and cuticles to weekly manicures and pedicures, not a daily practice.</li>
            <li>I didnt use this product long enough to notice results it packed away on a shelf of my many hair products.</li>
            <li>will give it a few more months to see how I like it.</li>
            <li>Love it, I saw an increase in thickness over a few weeks of application.</li>
            <li>This product was not &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; like the ones I normally buy.</li>
            <li>Maybe I needed to be more patient to see results, so far I have only used it for two weeks but not religiously.</li>
            <li>However, I must say it&#x27;s a kind of thick and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s kinda thick which is nice because I don&#x27;t want it to absorb into the wigs I wear.  </li>
            <li>I mix it with another oil (e.g. jojoba or Vitamin E) because it is kind of thick and doesn&#x27;t spread as well as I want it to on</li>
            <li>A little of this product goes a long way, so it&#x27;s best to not be heavy handed, especially on straight or loosely curled hair.</li>
            <li>Essential oils are powerful with wonderful benefits but could make you sick if not diluted well.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used pharmaceutical grade castor oil to seal my coily 4c natural hair and had heard of the even better properties of Black Jamaican Castor Oil.</li>
            <li>My hair is super soft and moisturized, I mix this with organic coconut oil for extra shine.</li>
            <li>Next i&#x27;m looking forward to the Tropic Isle Living Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil !</li>
            <li>I mean to say that honestly I read all the reviews</li>
            <li>My edges were acting funny and becoming shorter on the sides due to being under stress and dying my hair.</li>
            <li>The pictures in the left column are from July 19, 2015 and the pictures on the right were taken on July 24, 2015.</li>
            <li>I have noticed it ironically dries my skin out where I apply it, and if I use it every day, I will break out right next to where I applied the oil.</li>
            <li>NOT STARTING OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT.</li>
            <li>The second day after I got it, right when I was about to try it it fell off my counter and broke.</li>
            <li>IS ONE OF THEM PRODUCTS, JUST RECIEVED MY 1ST BOTTLES AND STARTED RIGHT AWAY USING IT, MY HAIR IS CURRENTLY IN BOX BRAIDS FOR 90 DAYS.</li>
            <li>Even though the seller shipped promptly, the castor oil was regular castor oil, and not dark with the consistency of true JBCO.</li>
            <li>I recently went natural to try to get my hair healthy and just simply embrace my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I use this along with almond oil, and pure castor oil on my hair daily, and I really like how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li>In addition if you would like other techniques that’s not included in this list, feel free to email me and ask.&lt;br /&gt;Noblesupreme@outlook.com</li>
            <li>Beware it does smell a little nutty, but if you mix it with another natural oil, you&#x27;re ok...</li>
            <li>It kind of reminded me of when a man shaves and you see the little stubble growing back.</li>
            <li>, you might want to open a few windows because the smell is pretty strong but it works really well</li>
            <li>of caution, this product is very thick and oily so, be sure it is absorbed before laying your head on any linens or furniture.</li>
            <li>and I already have new growth coming in.</li>
            <li>I moisturize my new growth</li>
            <li>/&gt;c) softened my new growth BEAUTIFULLY&lt;br</li>
            <li>+ I have lots of new growth.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>i ordered two weeks ago i alreary can see my new hair</li>
            <li>I has new growth already</li>
            <li>I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a new oil and so on.</li>
            <li>always finding new uses for it.</li>
            <li>My mother was like what is that in your hair, I said NEW HAIR growing.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t live without now..</li>
            <li>in 2 weeks my bald edges got thicker and new hair is coming in .</li>
            <li>but I now have new growth .</li>
            <li>AND I HAVE BOUT 4 INCHES OF NEW GROWTHS AND BOUT 3 INCHES OF REMAINING RELAXED END</li>
            <li>it has thickened my new growth and has increased my hair growth.</li>
            <li>It looks like I am getting some new hair growth.</li>
            <li>It takes a while for your hair to adapt to a new regimen and for you to reap the benefits of a new product, so do give it time.</li>
            <li>Overall, very good for my thick dry hair.</li>
            <li>I think the oil is very moisturizing when mixed with other things, and helps give hair nice shine and sheen when used with conditioner for a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>HUGE point I want to make is Initially I purchased the JBCO from my local hair store</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and moist and I&#x27;ve heard castor oil help to promote hair growth which was the main reason for me purchasing it.</li>
            <li>And if you have super dry hair like mine, this will help a bunch.  </li>
            <li>My edges did grow back some, but not as fast as everyone claims, and it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable.</li>
            <li>the very short patches had grown a lot, the bald patches had filled in and the back had grown BELOW HER SHOULDERS.  </li>
            <li>strong after just a month and half of use</li>
            <li>I applied it on my scalp and new growth; it made my new growth feel so soft!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very thick and sticky and has a strong, though not necessarily bad, odor that others might find off-putting.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Makes my hair very soft and manageable&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li>so I was very surprised when this item worked so well.</li>
            <li>I gave it 3 stars because it did make my hair feel very soft</li>
            <li>I ordered this oil (delivery was very fast), the same day I received</li>
            <li>It makes your hair very soft .</li>
            <li>oil made my hair very soft and it did grow my egdes that were&lt;br /&gt;starting to break off because i always wore my hair in pony tails. .</li>
            <li>and I also used it on my feet and they are very soft because of it.</li>
            <li>she was very surprised that I had never used it before.</li>
            <li>So, at least for the first couple of uses, go easy on the quantity</li>
            <li>All I can say is &amp;#34;Wow.&amp;#34; Not only did my eyebrow hair grow back (more plentiful and healthier than before) in a short amount of time, BUT the seborrhea there is almost gone.</li>
            <li>But applying it to your scalp and ends on a consistent basis is definitely recommended, as well as using for a pre poo treatment, or sealing moisture into damp</li>
            <li>other favorite hair product is \\&quot;Mixed</li>
            <li>they grew longer, not sure about darker/thicker, but maybe I should keep on using it for more time.</li>
            <li>well actually I but this on first strait out of the shower then I apply my hair gel.</li>
            <li>, I purchased a second bottle after getting no results with the first one.  </li>
            <li>Wow, it&#x27;s horrid!</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Completely recommend!</li>
            <li>What it does do is make my hair soooo soft and shiny!</li>
            <li>I am willing to purchase it again and hopefully will get similar results.</li>
            <li>Way back in 7th grade, I got my hair relaxed for the first time and it broke off within half-a-year.</li>
            <li>This castor oil made my hair so soft!</li>
            <li>I tried this as well as the regular castor oil, I love them both but would probably prefer this one over the other one.</li>
            <li>I recommend to all natural girls!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m not really sure it&#x27;s better than the drug store over the counter type of castor oil</li>
            <li>soft!....</li>
            <li>it will really cause breakage if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li>Same exact thing.</li>
            <li>here&#x27;s what the oil does best: It will thicken your hair like crazy!</li>
            <li>more so I&#x27;m not sure if this stuff works</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>Until I started noticing my hair was shedding more than usual.</li>
            <li>I use it before I braid her hair and it softens it so much that she barely even notices when I am braiding it.  </li>
            <li>I am newly transitioning natural (going on 4 months in) with about 1-2 inches of new growth.</li>
            <li>Always remember that essential oils can be diluted with oil only, so if you spill some or use it too concentrated on the skin or scalp, take coconut, olive, any vegetable or carrier oil will do to clean it off.  </li>
            <li>I use it to smooth down my edges</li>
            <li>Its a super thick oil but absorbs quickly into scalp.</li>
            <li>Yes, it takes a little more time and effort than other hair oils, but I think its worth it.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair to begin with, and it started thinning in my late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>If you have thinning edges or thin hair in general, this may be your best bet other than taking a supplement such as biotin to really increase the thickness of your hair.</li>
            <li>However my hair is very thin as appears to look stronger, shinier, and almost imediatly in areas where my hair was short it has filled in nicely.</li>
            <li>I have also noticed my hair grows in straight if I use it diligently, because the heavy weight of the oil forces the hairs to move in the right direction!</li>
            <li>This oil is one of the products I use in my hair,and I think it really does make my hair feel much softer than it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li>I mix it with other oils to create a special blend for my hair.  </li>
            <li>and I have noticed an improvement in my severe case of dandruff, and it also makes my natural hair very soft.</li>
            <li>I did a bit of research on the web and found several positive reviews about Tropic Isle Castor Oil.</li>
            <li>My hair still sucks, but I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s much that I can do keep it looking great for longer than 24 hrs at a time.</li>
            <li>My hair has always been relatively healthy and long (the middle of my back).</li>
            <li>but surprisingly it didn&#x27;t last me that long, because I used it in a few of my hair concoctions.</li>
            <li>This Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil, really works!!!</li>
            <li>I have been an ongoing user of the black castor oil and trust me when I say, this stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li>This is the only thing that keeps my dry hair smooth and shining.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used it as both a hot oil treatment and regular moisturizer; for the latter, I cut it with other oils (coconut, jojoba, vitamin E) and it works fine.</li>
            <li>Within a year and a half, I regrew my natural hair and my scalp and hair were back to a healthy state.</li>
            <li>I use this product mixed with the Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil and as a back up the Hair Food.</li>
            <li>This will certainly be something that I intend to use constantly.</li>
            <li>I can find the large one here for the same price</li>
            <li>I used it on my damp hair after I got out of the shower and combed my hair ( by the way I am an African American woman) and instantly my hair felt super duper soft!!!</li>
            <li>The oil is somewhat thick thus couldn&#x27;t imagine this being of much interest to people with fine hair.</li>
            <li>I have very kinky course hair and it can get very dry and shed a whole lot.</li>
            <li>plus I feel the quality is a little better than what I can locally buy.</li>
            <li>I believe it was due to the tremendous stress I was under at the time, but no matter the reason for it, it was there.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also mix this with other oils to create a super cream.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this about six months but only used it sparingly when I noticed my hair was dry.</li>
            <li>I massage it onto my scalp and roots every other day, and my roots are now super shiny, sleek and extremely soft.</li>
            <li>It was easy to point out because my hair was now a chestnut blonde but the \\&quot;new hair\\&quot; looked black.</li>
            <li>Smells really bad, but got her fast and is a great price</li>
            <li>The smell isn&#x27;t that bad but definitely not the best thing either.</li>
            <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon so far is the only place I can find the real</li>
            <li>I recently purchased this oil,an so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li>pressed CLEAR CASTOR OIL..</li>
            <li>It is clear, and the smoke odor was almost non-existent.</li>
            <li>This is a heavy (thick) oil but when used properly it is great at moisturizing and adding softness.  </li>
            <li>She continues to use this product as her scalp massage and moisturizer and her hair is not only growing like a weed but feels very fluffly, soft and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li>I am only using this product on one side of my head and not all over, as I am generally cautious when trying a product for the first time.</li>
            <li>Actually I was really surprised it really works</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everyone wants thick,healthy hair, and I can definitely recommend this as a natural way to thicken your hair..</li>
            <li>I could leave in coconut oil in my hair overnight, but I have never done so with JBCO, primarily because I am worried that it might be too heavy for skin.</li>
            <li>Left my hair feeling very moisturized.</li>
            <li>I use this with Wild Hair Growth and Shea Butter, at night.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t really used it enough yet to see results</li>
            <li>Start seeing results as early as 2 weeks.</li>
            <li>I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and use this oil to help thicken some of the thinning areas in my hair.  </li>
            <li>Works we&#x27;ll on my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I have been seeing this recommended on YouTube for hair growth for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li>I noticed it my skin is soft all over.</li>
            <li>I used the whole bottle last year and am done with it.</li>
            <li>Again you are probably using too much and that is another side effect of putting too much JBCO on your hair and scalp in such a short time period.</li>
            <li>And let me tell you that my eyelashes have nearly doubled in length in a month.</li>
            <li>This stuff did make my hair soft...</li>
            <li>Been natural for 5 years but used heat alot to damage my hair.</li>
            <li>I preferably like the green vibrance line ( available on</li>

            <li>Used nightly for 2 weeks so far.</li>
            <li>I like this oil, not a harsh smell</li>
            <li>no jbco did not fall out anyway so far</li>
            <li>I will give a 30 day update as to how it is working thus far.  </li>
            <li>I have two daughters that have natural hair</li>

            <li>but I won&#x27;t because I am trying to be natural.</li>

            <li>I&#x27;ve been natural for 7 months and have been looking for an oil that I could use in my LOCO method on my 4 C hair.</li>
            <li>Maybe it as my natural hair growth cycle, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li>This has really helped me grow my edges back.</li>

            <li>I use it also in my natural hair before i co wash</li>
            <li>and it was soft</li>

            <li>I used this product for my natural hair castor oil challenge and it has done wonders for me and my hair.</li>
            <li>The only problems I really had with it was the molasses like texture and smell.</li>
            <li>Aside from that I would recommend this product to anyone trying to grow their hair natural or not.</li>
            <li>and my hair is soooo soft and shiny.  </li>

            <li>Naturally since my hair was, hehe</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m texlaxed and my daughter is a straightened natural.</li>
            <li>Edges are back thanks to it.</li>
            <li>If you are going natural, rub this in your scalp everytime you wash your hair.  </li>
            <li>This product makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>So far, I have used this product for about three months.  </li>
            <li>After reading some things said about this product in a Natural Hair forum on FB, I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li>and I did not have the patience to complete the bottle.  </li>
            <li>However, from the time I did use it (about 3 weeks), I do see some improvement on hair that was thinning near the edges.  </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Wonders on my natural hair</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 1 year and 6 months natural and this is one of my staple hair products.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li>it make my skin soft...</li>
            <li>Since I am south asian it didn&#x27;t really do the trick, my hair is still falling off.</li>
            <li>All hair breakage stopped and my hair is soft and shines.  </li>
            <li>AND SO FAR I HAVENT BEEN DISAPPOINT ON NO PRODUCTS</li>
            <li>SO FAR WHEN I DECIDED TO GO FOR RELAXER TO NATURAL</li>
            <li>I use this for my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I will purchase this Castor oil again; it keeps my hair soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li>That&#x27;s what all natural, unrefined products smell like:</li>
            <li>people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I really like it - this oil is all my mother used on my hair when I was younger.</li>
            <li>It works wonders on natural hair.</li>
            <li>This product really works I have told several of my friends and they have started using it as well</li>
            <li>Would not waste time</li>
            <li>so far i like it.</li>
            <li>My reason for going natural was because my hair had fell out a lot after having my son.</li>
            <li>This is VERY recommenedable especially with breaking edges.</li>
            <li>I wear my hair natural.</li>
            <li>I also mix some into my conditioner on wash day &amp; it do make my hair soft from that.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive scalp do not use.</li>
            <li>and i would not say my scalp is sensitive.</li>
            <li>recommend this to those who are transitioning to natural hair.</li>
            <li>Too early to comment on it.</li>
            <li>I got this oil because my hair was thinning ( transitioning from relaxed to natural) and a bald spot</li>
            <li>I would reccomend for women who are transitioning to wearing their natural hair.</li>
            <li>It keeps my hair soft and edges looking natural.</li>
            <li>I havent had it long enough to know if it truely works on my hair.</li>
            <li>It is thick and not thin like other oils which I love!  </li>
            <li>She lives in Florida and when I returned to visit her, barely 7 months later, her hair had grown so much!  </li>
            <li>I only used is a few times but already in love with it.</li>
            <li>Also, if the smell bothers you, put in few drops of your favorite essential oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Love the thick texture</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d use it more if it weren&#x27;t so thick.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the perfect balance: not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li>I love the thick consistency of castor oil.</li>
            <li>The smell is ok and the oil is thick.</li>
            <li>I love how thick it is.</li>
            <li>It is slowly but surely getting there when it comes to the edges</li>
            <li>but this oil is way better its thick and gives you moisture like nothing else</li>
            <li>I would recommend to any people looking for healthy hair or a thick oil.</li>
            <li>With regular application, I use this directly on the scalp, it keeps your hair nice and thick.</li>
            <li>Slow progress is better than none.</li>
            <li>I live in the northwest, so african american skin gets pretty chappy out here.</li>
            <li>Weird smell, not bad, just strong, but nothing you cant get used to.</li>
            <li>yet I found it on amazon (no surprise) for very cheap either way a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>especially if used daily along with co-washing or regular washes because in the first three weeks my edges were a little better</li>
            <li>I am excited as I have researched this for a little while</li>
            <li>A WHOLE LOT OF FABRICATION AND THE FEEDBACK FROM OTHER PEOPLE ON HERE REALLY INTICED ME</li>
            <li>Using it as a hot oil treatment has prevented my hair from being overly dry as the weather has become colder.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not until I decided to transition that I became a bit more curious about this oil along with other oils and products.</li>
            <li>I went from having no edges all of my life to them being full in less than a month.</li>
            <li>but, it is tolerable considering that I saw a nice amount of growth while using this oil along with a few other oils.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t do that in Winter because the air is dry from the heaters and furnaces being on and it will pull the moisture out of your scalp and the inside of your hair to moisturize the outside of your strand, which will quickly cause damage and breakage.  </li>
            <li>It makes my new growth very soft and extra manageable.</li>
            <li>Although it is heavy, one can use minimal amounts in the hair,because it spreads very easily.</li>
            <li>and I am left with baby soft, shiny, healthy hair that grows faster than usual.</li>
            <li>Ok let me start with the fact that I am Hispanic and I have done a lot of damage to my hair due to extensive flat ironing and dying.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is such an easy thing to add to your daily regimen, and is so much cheaper than buying all of the other products I formerly used.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is such an easy thing to add to your daily regimen, and is so much cheaper than buying all of the other products I formerly used.</li>
            <li>The first week I did not notice the smell, the second week it was like someone was constantly waving one of those Crayola Licorice Scented Markers under my nose.</li>
            <li>Received this product and it&#x27;s not BLACK CASTOR OIL...</li>
            <li>Oddly enough, this particular brand has been reported as having a &amp;#34;smoky smell&amp;#34; but I do not find it offensive.</li>
            <li>this is a thicker oil, the viscosity would not be to many people&#x27;s liking but for thicker ,kinkier  hair ,your tresses will thank you I use on my scalp and that of my daughters&#x27;,  to lock in moisture after a shampoo since black peoples hair dry out easily and is quite delicate.</li>
            <li>I am no longer searching high and low for a miracle product.</li>
            <li>I took off one star for the smell and the fact that it  is very heavy on my fine hair.</li>
            <li>It does have a light smell, and its not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>only cons are the oil does not smell so good though you can mix it with other oils to improve the smell, the other con is the oil itches when you first start applying in your hair &amp; scalp but that usually lessens after your scalp gets use to it, but to me the pro&#x27;s outweigh the cons of this product</li>
            <li>It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li>Good for me, Not good for other people.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just trying different alternatives to normal &amp;#34;hair grease&amp;#34; and i have heard a lot about this product.</li>
            <li>Now, I actually look normal without any make-up.</li>
            <li>I used it with my heating cap prior to my normal shampoo &amp; condition.  </li>
            <li>I use this to calm my hair down after I shampoo and condition.  </li>
            <li>Very very thick I bought this originally and a treatment for my hair but to be honest it is so thick</li>
            <li>It may be a little thick for some, but a good solution would be to mix it with another oil like coconut or jojoba.</li>
            <li>I put just a couple of drops on it, and my arm was like new the next morning.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen new growth on my edges after using for only 2 weeks!</li>
            <li>I would have to come back to see if there&#x27;s any new hairgrowth as a result of this product.</li>
            <li>but I actually do see new hair comn in</li>
            <li>Dry up fast after application.</li>
            <li>Used to mix a hair tonic for short natural soft  hair.  </li>
            <li>so I can&#x27;t use it too much on my face, only when necessary).</li>
            <li>After about a few months of use I have seen tremendous results.  </li>
            <li>The hair also grows back stronger, which is also nice since over plucking seems to thin eyebrows</li>
            <li>this stuff is good as a heavy moisturizer during colder months b/c it is thick.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair all over is really thick and really strong.</li>
            <li>but I use it anyway to keep my hair strong and thick.</li>
            <li>I can tell you that it has made my coarse hair very soft.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m not going to mention all the ingredients, but to give you an idea, my homemade hair creams and body salves are made of natural oils, such as virgin coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, unrefined avocado oil, jojoba, a few nut oils, true ivory unrefined shea butter(softened by stirring with a fork, NOT MELTED!!), calendula essential oil, tea tree essential oil, myrrh, ylang ylang</li>
            <li>This stuff will thicken your hair up within the first couple of weeks if used every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li>First when i purchased this product i thought it was going to be just like other product</li>
            <li>This product has definitely thickened my natural hair and has kept my scalp moisturized!</li>
            <li>(And gentlemen, of course) Let me tell you the 3 major ways this oil has changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I noted a major difference; my scalp was no longer flaky and was growing at faster rate.  </li>
            <li>This is what I did; first I washed my hair twice with shampoo only after allowing it to air dry</li>
            <li>I have short natural curly hair and currently have dyed my hair so my hair is in much need of moisturizers and deep treatments.</li>
            <li>My hair gets so dry in the winter and JBCO has left it my hair soft, really helps to define my curls</li>
            <li>There is a considerable difference in the thickness of my roots and its just a clear when flat ironed.</li>
            <li>The cool thing is you can use a little of it on your eyebrows and eyelashes at night to thicken them too!</li>
            <li>I just received this last week and what I can say right away is that this stuff gives moisture without completely weighing the hair down.  </li>
            <li>It takes a little while to see results, but its worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Last spring I wore them so much( my hair is straight, light brown and very thin)</li>
            <li>The smell of Jamaican Black a Castor Oil is strong and nutty, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li>so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
            <li>It helps keep my feet soft and pretty and putting a little in my bath makes my skin feel healthier and</li>
            <li>Highly recommended for all African American type four hair types.</li>
            <li>i mean i have hair growing in fine</li>
            <li>Not only did the product help to clear my skin, but it also thickens my hair.</li>
            <li>So, this is the 2nd review to clear things up.  </li>
            <li>I use this in addition to coconut oil ask a mask (I am currently transitioning to natural hair and using only natural products).</li>
            <li>I did my big chop and went natural October 2010</li>
            <li>My hair was above my shoulders, now it&#x27;s nearly below my shoulders and growing.</li>
            <li>leaves hair extra soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>My hair is starting to look like it&#x27;s old self</li>
            <li>and I can barely if at all smellit once it&#x27;s in our hair.  </li>
            <li>The only one I&#x27;ve seen so far is Lavender.  </li>
            <li>since i&#x27;ve been using it i see so a big difference in my natural hair.</li>
            <li>I recently went natural from having relaxed hair for about 7-8 years.</li>
            <li>When I recieved the product and used it, I barely noticed the smell.  </li>
            <li>I just got this like 5 days ago and only used it twice so far.</li>
            <li>I can tell a big difference in my hair as far as thickness, I never had edges</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been transitioning from relaxed hair to natural hair for about a year, and it&#x27;s been a fairly simple process.  </li>
            <li>I also mixed it with Wild Growth Oil and coconut oil.</li>
            <li>and I definitely felt a change in the moisture retention of my hair, my hair was soft, bouncy</li>
            <li>, this grew my edges back almost completely in 45 days, I could see some growth after 2 days.</li>
            <li>It can have multiple uses for your hair; makes it soft &amp; promotes growth.</li>
            <li>The product arrived much sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li>I all ready ordered a sec.</li>
            <li>Her goal is to grow her hair enough so that she can wear her natural hair in a bun and not have to wear a wig anymore</li>
            <li>I used this product only once so far</li>
            <li>I have been trying to grow my edges back for years because they completely fell out from wearing my</li>
            <li>Silky soft all week until next shampoo.  </li>
            <li>I really didn&#x27;t care for it on my scalp and after two tries gave</li>
            <li>AND I CAN BARE IT, JUST TO ME JBCO</li>
            <li>Rubbed this on my burnt shoulders and neck, the next morning the redness and pain was completely gone.</li>
            <li>I use this oil on my natural hair and in my Deep conditioning treatments and also on my edges</li>
            <li>I am a natural and wear twist outs daily.</li>
            <li>You get used to the burnt seed smell and the thick consistency the oil has, as I actually enjoy it now.</li>
            <li>and I honestly believe it was fake because it didn&#x27;t do NADA..</li>
            <li>, I did some research on U-tube and everyone swore by it, I have thin, chemically processed hair for 20 or more years, and</li>
            <li>it weighs my hair down because it&#x27;s heavy, but I love that.  </li>
            <li>how much you use :) It made my hair soft, after wash, thick and when applied to scalp less hair fallout!!</li>
            <li>It is working really good for my black relaxed hair but it is very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li>My hair is currently natural (very kinky) but as far as I can remember, growing up, I always had less hair around my temples and at the back.</li>
            <li>Thankfully with my genetics and love for garlic, I shed significantly less than the average human being</li>
            <li>I had HIGH HOPES that this oil would do wonders for me according to these reviews and other natural hair forums I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li>I mean it&#x27;s just fantastic</li>
            <li>It makes my hair so soft and the twists last much longer than other products.</li>
            <li>grew my hair back so nice and thick!!</li>
            <li>First of all, the oil is not black; its the same clear color as regular castor oil, just a little thinner.  </li>
            <li>This product leaves my hair very soft, I have not used it for a long period of time yet</li>
            <li>This is AMAZING for eyebrow regrowth since opposite direction growth is so frustrating when it already takes so long to regrow.</li>
            <li>My scalp no longer dries up like how it did with other products, this castro oil keeps it very oily just the way I like it.</li>
            <li>I can not give it credit for any unusual hair growth spurt, as I had read in other reviews.</li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know what to say other than we shall see how beneficial this product will be for my hair.</li>
            <li>It was hard to clean up even on hardwood.</li>
            <li>A little goes a long way - the bottle still looks full, too.</li>
            <li>Thick and original.</li>
            <li>so maybe this is better for you ladies (and guys) with long, thick, dry, wild hair.</li>
            <li>It really helps them so much because I had nothing hardly for lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I swear I loved this product, but it was so thick and hard to spread on my scalp.</li>
            <li>Brings fullness and life back to your hair just be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li>I will definitely be ordering another bottle in the near future.</li>
            <li>Not only did it cease to grow, but I kept getting split ends everywhere, even after I had stopped straightening my hair and began only using natural products.</li>
            <li>My hair is natural and im african american JBCO kept my hair feelin soft and fluffy when applied correctly when theres too much hair</li>
            <li>My hair is very dry and normally soaks up any moisture.  </li>
            <li>Though she is an older lady, she is very feminine and does not like her looks with this &#x27;boy&#x27; type hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to make a long story short, I sent her a bottle of this Jamaican black castor oil</li>
            <li>If you overapply it will certainly weigh it down and your hair will start to look stringy.</li>
            <li>It is thick the way folk describe, and it smells very different, but the thickness actually works for me, so I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li>It has totally boosted my hair care regimen to a whole other level!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>As for hair growth I cant really say it has helped me grow my hair because I&#x27;m currently using other products for that too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m long transitioning from relaxed to natural</li>
            <li>especially the natural hair community use castor oil in particular Jamaican Black Castor oil, so I figured I may as well try it right&lt;</li>
            <li>My hair is long, wavy, and naturally frizzy.</li>
            <li>It stung like a bee at first, but after a few minutes, it was okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I been using this product for one month and it made my hair so thick and full.</li>
            <li>Every night I used BCO to my brows and within weeks my brows were so thick and full that amaze me.  </li>
            <li>Like most black castor oil it is very heavy.</li>
            <li>I live in dry southern Cali.  </li>
            <li>Otherwise, it would weigh the hair down too much.  </li>
            <li>Still have it dont use much, weighs down hair.</li>
            <li>I use it to lay down my edges at night &amp; it has really helped my hair</li>
            <li>(note: I have very fine thin hair!)</li>
            <li>BUT  THEN I  DECIDED TO GET ONE( the same &amp;#34;tropic isles black castor oil &amp;#34;) FROM MY LOCAL HAIR STORE</li>
            <li>I needed this product to help regrow my hair and help maintain health due to the use of my high blood pressure medicine.</li>
            <li>an odd odor, smells very musky.</li>
            <li>I really like the black castor oil.</li>
            <li>Jamaican Black Castor oil works really well for locks  </li>
            <li>Have to say that I&#x27;m really liking the black castor oil.  </li>
            <li>Also, I do suffer with dry, sensitive scalp issues as well.</li>
            <li>I use and like this oil as a hair treatment, but frankly can&#x27;t find much difference between this type and the stuff from India that I buy from my online health food provider costing a lot less.  </li>
            <li>my hair also has less breakage and its sooooooooo much softer.</li>
            <li>so I normally mix it with shea butter or with other oils for a moisturizing spray.</li>
            <li>In a few minutes I was able to go back to sleep, no more pain.</li>
            <li>It is also good on my dry cuticles and feet in this cold chafing weather.</li>
            <li>Positive results in a few short weeks.  </li>
            <li>The bottle looks small, but it does go a long way, and I still have more than half, although I do use it sparingly.</li>
            <li>and I find it hard to apply and even harder to wash out, and it limps on me (medium length wavy fine hair)</li>
            <li>I am really amazed at how fast this oil worked to regrow my edges-I now have thick edges!</li>
            <li>I ordered this product because I have very dry and brittle natural hair.  </li>
            <li>it was what i ordered but the smell was a little much.</li>
            <li>Within the 3 months my edges have completely grown back and the dry scalp no longer exists!</li>
            <li>After few months I swear by this and other natural oils, and I&#x27;m the type of person who normally scoffs at natural</li>
            <li>Upon first use I put way too much on my hair (not good)!</li>
            <li>I read that Jamaican oil was better than others, and maybe it really is, but the smell is so bad</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell good or bad to me and since it&#x27;s mixed into a hair dressing when I apply it, I don&#x27;t smell it afterward in my or my daughter&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t really describe the smell accurately...</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Today, i will be ordering two more btls... one for me and one for my sister.</li>
            <li> and I like it better.</li>
            <li> hope someone give a better review..</li>
            <li> I wonder if another brand would work better for me?  </li>
            <li> and the day before I plan on washing my hair, I use a bit more, just to let it absorb  more into my scalp.</li>
            <li> Love this oil.</li>
            <li> its seems authentic</li>
            <li> You can use a Qtip and dip it into the oil then apply onto your scalps to prevent hair loss :)</li>
            <li> I have used before and my edges have never looked better</li>
            <li> I automatically smelled it to see if it smelt of burnt ashes, and surprisingly I was pleasantly surprised that it smelled good.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m sure</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair and on the many stretch marks I have.</li>
            <li> But my hair looks a lot thicker and healthy</li>
            <li> It was okay</li>
            <li> i have had better.</li>
            <li> Tropic isle Jamaican castor oil is the best on the market can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff.</li>
            <li> My hair had a nice smooth texture with a killer shine.</li>
            <li> Love what it does for my skin and hair. . . . . .</li>
            <li> but it seems like it will work. :)</li>
            <li> Love my Jamaican castor oil.</li>
            <li> A must have oil for anyone on a healthy hair journey.</li>
            <li> I can say I really love this product.</li>
            <li> so glad that I added this product to my regimen.</li>
            <li> What I experienced was a normal reaction to the product, and not an allergic reaction!</li>
            <li> but so far so good!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it has grown my hair and given it great strength and natural sheen, shine and protection!!</li>
            <li> i believe if i continue i will see summ better results noo its not a miracle oil bt its pretty good for the hair</li>
            <li> Soak them in a warm bath, and massage a generous portion of heated (warm the bottle in hot water)</li>
            <li> so it is always full of life and bounces beautifully catching the attention of many...</li>
            <li> Castor oil in general is very good for hair, even the damaged variety.</li>
            <li> I find that JBCO is thickening my new growth and the texture is becoming softer with a beautiful curl pattern.  </li>
            <li> Great on my natural hair!!</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure it out at first because of all the good reviews.  </li>
            <li> I have pretty good skin, so I didn&#x27;t plan on using it for that.  </li>
            <li> Pretty good I guess.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never purchased either but figured they had pretty good reviews.</li>
            <li> i got this and it pretty good</li>
            <li> I think this was a good product for my first experience with castor oil.</li>
            <li> Its true that JBCO doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell but its definitely worth it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> product looks new and works great..</li>
            <li> Ive experienced thinning hairline and non-existant edges most of my adult years.</li>
            <li> I have noticed if I want my hair to look healthy and strong</li>
            <li> :) It is a bit strong when it comes to the smell</li>
            <li> I use it to promote healthy and strong hair.</li>
            <li> love the strong earthy scent.</li>
            <li> my hair is more easy for me to style.</li>
            <li> If you want good hair growing results I also suggest switching to organic shampoos and conditioners, take LOTS of vitamins especially biotin, prenatal pills etc, and find good hair creams to use.</li>
            <li> Very sticky but good for healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this little bottle of JOY!  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this several times since I find it to be a good castor oil, nice consistency makes great hand cream, but you really have to work it in because it is oil.</li>
            <li> oil seems fine to me and I plan to buy much more of it.</li>
            <li> I love saying WAS, so fine and thinning</li>
            <li> I love saying WAS, so fine and thinning</li>
            <li> I love how quickly it absorbs into my scalp!</li>
            <li> Majority of it is used on my ankle and I can honestly say that the first day I used it the pain went away!  </li>
            <li> I put most of it on the roots of my hair and then smooth the rest up to the roots/scalp.</li>

            <li> It  seems to be a great product so far</li>

            <li> This oil is extremely great but for my natural hair sisters .</li>

            <li> This product came very quickly and i couldnt wait to use it.</li>
            <li> I bought it specifically because i read reviews saying it went on your hair and spread easily.  </li>
            <li> The products I ordered were the oil and an applicator bottle because its so easy to apply that way.</li>
            <li> It came very quick.</li>
            <li> It washes off easily with soap.</li>
            <li> Strong odor</li>
            <li> If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that strong where you can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> As soon as I poured this oil into my hand, I got a strong wiff of cigarettes.</li>
            <li> but it is not so strong that people would smell you coming.</li>
            <li> , THE SMELL WASNT THAT STRONG</li>
            <li> Has a strong smell.</li>
            <li> It smooths onto your hair very easily and is absorbed well.</li>
            <li> Ive only had it for a week, so I haven&#x27;t experienced any hair growth, but so far its been great.</li>
            <li> It is a beautiful hair type but very fragile.  </li>
            <li> But a wonderful moisturizer, although I would recommend just using it on the scalp because it can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is fine</li>
            <li> The product seems to be working just fine.</li>
            <li> but if you are interested in using this product by itself it may not be the best idea unless you like walking around smelling like a deep fryer,which even using the smallest amount</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s fine as I just needed to get my hands on castor oil ad</li>
            <li> Black Jamacian Castor Oil is the best ever!</li>
            <li> Either way is fine.</li>
            <li> fine hair, thats wavy.</li>
            <li> This Black Castor Oil provides excellent results.</li>
            <li> I truly enjoyed the results and i recieved it quick.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> Very good oil for a very dry scalp.</li>
            <li> I have light brown hair and it works just fine.</li>
            <li> Sometimes I even use a little on my body after a bath or shower great product!!</li>
            <li> This product came right away and it has been working great this far!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best oil I&#x27;ve used on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> and I must say I see a huge improvement in my hair.</li>
            <li> but why take the chance, makes for a great oil rub, there is no real scent, maybe add some to make it more pleasing....</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge improvements in hair growth while using this product.</li>
            <li> Ladies please do not buy this product, I know is cheap but this doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> but my hair has become thicker my edges have filled in</li>
            <li> I use this once a week to lightly moisturize my scalp..</li>
            <li> Overall its a great product.</li>
            <li> Great for hair growth- especially when transitioning.</li>
            <li> If you have proven techniques that gives results for hair growth please contact me via email so we can spread the news for free to all men who needs it.</li>
            <li> this stuff works great especially if you have some hair breakage.</li>
            <li> and it is amazing how much my hair has grown since then by using this product.</li>
            <li> Thankfully the cator smell is light.</li>
            <li> It keeps my spiral curls frizz free and bouncy.</li>
            <li> MY HAIRS HAVE FILLED IN..</li>
            <li> please please sell products that work...not looking for a miracle just real and honest results.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Economical, ecological solution for scalp needs.</li>
            <li> just a dab used with my conditioner makes my hair feel so free and tangle free.</li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily to help promote hair growth along my hair line.  </li>
            <li> but it does make a fantastic cleansing oil</li>
            <li> Its is great for your hair, but I get the same effect with NOW Castor oil for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> I finally gave in to temptation, this is the best thing that has ever happened to my hair, after just one week, my hair is soft as cotton,no more breakage.</li>
            <li> Aside from hair, a light dab moisturizes my face and skin.</li>
            <li> In the winter months, I apply some lightly to my lips for moisture and to fight chap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard fantastic things about JBCO, so I decided to try it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the results that most have suggested (after a couple of months worth of use); however, I plan to finish the bottle with the hope that my hair will thicken up a bit.</li>
            <li> The item is as detailed.</li>
            <li> I also use it with coconut oil as a pre poo and enjoy it.</li>
            <li> Great for deep treatment with a bit of Nature&#x27;s Way Coconut Oil-extra Virgin (also on Amazon) and sit under the dryer for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> They are so much fuller and the bald patches are filling in nicely.</li>
            <li> After one month, completely filled in...</li>
            <li> It worked great for me, I saw results the next day.</li>
            <li> Great purchase will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> This one was &amp;#34;light light brown&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> Washed it off with shampoo and now my hair feels ridiculously smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product fro hair growth especially if you hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> On February 8, 2013, the bald spot was completely filled in with HAIR, almost 1/2 inch.  </li>
            <li> it does however make you hair shiny and smooth, but you need to keep it away from the scalp.</li>
            <li> But this product is fabulous.</li>
            <li> It really helps with dryness and got my hair growing nicely.  </li>
            <li> so happy i got my product and am looking forward to using it to grow my hairline back....</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So you also may want to make sure you don&#x27;t have any underlying medical conditions that aid in shedding and breakage.biotin, prenatal pills etc, and find good hair creams to use.</li>
            <li> Love it and still have a good amount left!</li>
            <li> but so far so good.</li>
            <li> This is also good to help prevent breakage of hair allowing proper, healthy growth.&lt;br</li>
            <li> use Gels &amp; like to use good natural things...</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> regret not reading the most recent reviews instead of the good ones.</li>
            <li> Good stuff so far for what I need it for</li>
            <li> So far so good on this product</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> So far so good.</li>
            <li> I apply it to my top and bottom lashes very close to the lash line every night before bed, and also on my top lashes before applying make-up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I apply it to my top and bottom lashes very close to the lash line every night before bed, and also on my top lashes before applying make-up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> As for growth (lenth wise) I can&#x27;t say there has been much so far.</li>
            <li> So far im stilling trying to see if this was a good buy.</li>
            <li> Just started using the product and so far so good.</li>
            <li> Came fairly quick and I still have more than 3/4 bottle full.</li>
            <li> Right now I am on crappy chemo which thins my hair and makes it more prone to shedding and breakage.</li>
            <li> Right now I am on crappy chemo which thins my hair and makes it more prone to shedding and breakage.</li>
            <li> I ordered 2 more bottles right away</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil, works well with my other hair care products.</li>
            <li> i bought this because i saw many positive comments from the site, but it turns out neutral!</li>
            <li> This product is great for mixing with other oils however be sure of how you store it so that it doesn&#x27;t get rancid.</li>
            <li> but it only been about 1 1/2 mnths LOVE It!!</li>
            <li> I use a spoolie brush, but Q-tips or an old clean mascara wand will do just as good.</li>
            <li> I use a spoolie brush, but Q-tips or an old clean mascara wand will do just as good.</li>
            <li> Strong believer in oils, and great to chase away dry skin!</li>
            <li> I have fine, but loosely curled hair and this does great.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this a higher rating if it smelled better or had no scent at all.</li>
            <li> This oil has a thickness and heaviness and a unique smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth it, I tell you!</li>
            <li> Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> I gave 5 stars because I&#x27;m just really excited to use this product on my hair.</li>
            <li> My edges are growing and i&#x27;m just so excited.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Tropic Isle makers, I&#x27;m excited to see my hair length &amp; luster will be like in the coming future.(with continued use of your product, of course.</li>
            <li> but worth the money!</li>
            <li> originally said in this review that I was using this for an hair growth oil.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this in attempt to help with hair loss on my head.</li>
            <li> I started my Healthy Hair Journey in 2010 and when I first heard of this product I had to order it.</li>
            <li> was more consistent</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my hair, and it has not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought two more for my family members after raving about the first purchase I did of JBCO a month before.</li>
            <li> Within one week exactly, I was able to see hair filling in.</li>
            <li> but I think this product was pretty ok.</li>
            <li> I love it thanks!</li>
            <li> I may need to use it longer to see significant results.</li>
            <li> First off, this oil feels more like molasses.</li>
            <li> but did not notice anything significant.  </li>
            <li> That product is worth the money!</li>
            <li> I was so excited reading all the reviews online about.</li>
            <li> I was excited</li>
            <li> I mostly use it in my hot oil treatments or to moisturize my scalp.</li>
            <li> I am in love once again, just don&#x27;t tell my husband ;)</li>
            <li> In just a week of using this product I noticed results :) I was a bit spectacle but decided to try it, the smell is not so hot but after leaving it in overnight the smell did not linger no matter</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hair grow at all, but it is a great moisturizer if you have dry hair.</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin or to soften your hair.  </li>
            <li> I thought I would have to do this for the rest of my life, but I thought since I had such great success using the oil on my hair, maybe, just maybe it could help my brows.</li>
            <li> I recommend to use it on clean hair..</li>
            <li> I have adopted an all natural lifestyle for my hair, and I am sure glad that I added this to my regimen.</li>
            <li> I have noticed that the benefits of this oil aren&#x27;t as great when I used it while my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> Amidst the smell, I mixed it with coconut oil to get a pleasant scent</li>
            <li> a strong distinct smoky odor</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t see how there are so many positive reviews for this stuff</li>
            <li> Very nice price for the size and the product really does wonders for my naturally kinky hair.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth trying for the price and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t see anything special effect on my hair</li>
            <li> It is a great oil and it does wonders in hair concoctions, deep conditioners and hot oil treatments.</li>
            <li> I combine this product with megatek for the complete hair growth serum and it works amazingly</li>
            <li> After one month of use, the bottle is still quite full.</li>
            <li> My beard is completely full now since using this product.</li>
            <li> My scalp gently pulsates after I do the massages, and I LOVE it.</li>
            <li> For men with thinning or wanting a full beard try it out.</li>
            <li> I had heard such good reviews on this castor oil.  </li>
            <li> Ive heard its good, im not regular using it</li>
            <li> My suggestion, is that one could add a good essential oil to the bottle to tweak the smell.  </li>
            <li> Water won&#x27;t do any good because essential oils are oil soluble.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s full advantages</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve only heard good things about it.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re now almost completely full and all it took was two months of semi-diligent application (I&#x27;m not gonna lie,</li>
            <li> I really ddntknow what to expect because despite the reviews most products can be a hitor miss for my hair.</li>
            <li> but  so far it is nice.  </li>
            <li> Already have it just buying to keep my stock full.</li>
            <li> works really well, would recommend, need to purchase more. . . . . .  . . . . . .</li>
            <li> In addition, this 4 oz bottle is still 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> In addition, this 4 oz bottle is still 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> Ok so this is 100percent real</li>
            <li> Especially if you have a good regimen.</li>
            <li> overall the benefits are good for you, so instead of using it for my hair</li>
            <li> I love this oil I&#x27;e heard so much about it every where when I researched products for hair growth.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t try it on my skin, but I am sure it is very moisturing</li>
            <li> I love this product my hair shines really well</li>
            <li> This product is used as recommended, but more time is needed before I&#x27;ll really evaluate it.</li>
            <li> Its greasy so use before bed only and find a good applicator I gave up and use my fingers to massage it in.</li>
            <li> Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> So overall, I think this is a good product</li>
            <li> So I guess it&#x27;s true that this product works for some, but not for others.</li>
            <li> but I do think the oil is authentic with real ingredients, it smells like charcoal</li>
            <li> Wake with sweet baby hands and feet, and reinforced nail cuticles.</li>
            <li> big bottle is a good deal too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks but want to give it a full 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &quot; you have a head full of hair.\\</li>
            <li> Overall good product.</li>
            <li> It is too thick for my relaxed hair, but works perfectly on her hair.</li>
            <li> Now I know why so many Jamaicans have thick, beautiful hair, no matter</li>
            <li> The smell is not bad at all.</li>
            <li> Smell is not bad so no problems there.</li>
            <li> I was cautious because some ppl talked about the &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; smell, but when I used it found that the smell was not bad at all.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s supposedly slightly thinner in consistency, but people seem to like it and it smells good, so the reviews say (I haven&#x27;t and don&#x27;t plan on trying it, I&#x27;m satisfied with this original).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> wonderful product looking forward to using more of this line I have recommended this product to other people can&#x27;t wait to order my next order</li>
            <li> The first time I used this oil it made my hair sooo shiny and strong.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong, but that&#x27;s what you should expect being that it&#x27;s castor oil.</li>
            <li> The smell is a bit strong at first, though it does not stick to your hair after you wash it out.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> am happy that I read other reviews and took a chance.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m happy with it as i mix it with other oils.</li>
            <li> a quick shuffling of the comb in my eyebrow region removes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They aren&#x27;t necessarily fuller because that would require more hair follicles, but maybe in more time.</li>
            <li> Loyal to jbco</li>
            <li> the smell is like cigarette ashes but its mild</li>
            <li> It thickened my hair and has tremendously reversed my damaged hair.</li>
            <li> Came quickly.</li>
            <li> I read online that this makes your hair thick, I read many great reviews on it, so i am trying it.</li>
            <li> Plus the scent is really mild</li>
            <li> Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I love to make a scrub from brown sugar,aloe vera, salicylic acid and a bit of castor oil and put it on, and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> And they were quick to sent in my product.</li>
            <li> Item was shipped quickly; was please with the product.</li>
            <li> And the delivery was quick</li>
            <li> OMG I see what the hype was about it leaves your hair feeling super</li>
            <li> I like this much better than regular castor oil which seems a bit more dense.  </li>
            <li> Seems mildly richer than the Heritage product</li>
            <li> This is a good oil for eliminating frizzy hair, but as far as growth I really have not seen a difference.  </li>
            <li> and quick too..</li>
            <li> Came in the mail quickly.</li>
            <li> Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> It has a mild odor.  </li>
            <li> It makes my hair super shiny.</li>
            <li> It also smoothes out the wrinkles I have on my shoulders from too many sunburns, so I imagine it will work well for the older folks.</li>
            <li> I am so lucky to come across this product.</li>
            <li> I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the product and the very reasonable price for this product wished  </li>
            <li> If you sincerely cannot stand the smell, I would highly suggest layering your JBCO treatment with Oyin Handmade Juices and Berries Herbal Leave-In Hair Tonic.</li>
            <li> I have relaxed hair and I love this product so far!!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still too early to give a report on the results, but it&#x27;s a very nice product so far.</li>
            <li> There is a light coffee scent when first using but it disappears and is not so noticeable.</li>
            <li> I dont know about my hair growing more than normal</li>
            <li> It has a smoky smell that i found kind of strange at first but it ok now</li>
            <li> My Black Castor oil arrived in good shape and very quickly.</li>
            <li> Anyways, my hair is soft, strong and is growing!</li>
            <li> It really is great when combined with other products, and I add it to my leave in conditioner which makes my hair more soft.  </li>
            <li> come with good quality and long usable date!</li>
            <li> it really does a good job keeping those edges smooth and flat.</li>
            <li> Before my new growth felt like a brillo pad :).  </li>
            <li> Black castor oil great</li>
            <li> I will keep buying it, because it is a good moisturizer for dry lips and skin, but does not do anything for my hair and makes my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li> It was amazing how quickly my hair grew and the Jamaican black castor oil def had a lot to do with it because I had used most of the bottle for the concoction.</li>
            <li> this product gave me a good amount of moisture to my extremely dry psoriasis scalp.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product to help with dry hair.</li>
            <li> As for my edges, my mom has been using emu oil on hers for around the same amount of time that I have been using the castor oil, and her edges look so much better!  </li>
            <li> Thanks Tropic Isle!!  </li>
            <li> The seller is friendly, efficient, and fast!  </li>

            <li> My current favorite!</li>
            <li> Overall, you&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase more!</li>
            <li> I love this product for my natural hair!</li>
            <li> The first thing I have notice since using this product, the breakage has stopped!</li>
            <li> I could not resist, my hair has really grown!!</li>
            <li> My hair looks and feels luscious for the first time in my life!</li>
            <li> Love this oil so far!</li>
            <li> Great brand, you just can&#x27;t go wrong with the many uses of organic castor oil!</li>
            <li> It really is a great product a little sticky though.</li>
            <li> It is a little cheaper on another website but it is a great product.</li>
            <li> it is softer and has stop sheding so very much now instead of a comb full of hair</li>
            <li> Very good product thick</li>
            <li> It is very thick and doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but the benefits are worth it.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t tried the original jamaican black castor oil without the lavender, I heard it was good</li>
            <li> LOL, it fades after a few hours.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read amazing reviews about this, but i didn&#x27;t like it personally.</li>
            <li> hope you guy enjoy as much as I do..</li>
            <li> Nothing amazing yet, but I have only been using it for three weeks or so.</li>
            <li> But use tiny drops and this is amazing.</li>
            <li> FAST SERVICE ALONG WITH SECURE PACKAGING</li>
            <li> From what I have read,the success of JBCO is subjective.</li>
            <li> Love this product wow</li>
            <li> Chicks\\&quot; leave in conditioner, It is costly, but well worth the price.</li>
            <li> Not crazy about the smell of the oil itself</li>
            <li> but I like mixing it with sweet almond oil for hot oil treatments once a week.</li>
            <li> Worth your time and money.  </li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> I love how soft this stuff makes my hair feel.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth purchasing again.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;re going to add essential oil to this JBCO, I recommend calendula, blood orange, lavender...something with a nice scent.  </li>
            <li> Leaves my beard soft and looking healthy.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, it&#x27;s working wonderfully so far</li>
            <li> It has a distinct smell but it fades and I don&#x27;t notice it after I apply the oil.</li>
            <li> To use this I mix his with warm coconut oil and essential peppermint oil to stimulate my scalp.</li>
            <li> and I love natural products.</li>
            <li> JBCO is worth a shot</li>
            <li> I read on many natural hair blogs about this product.</li>
            <li> worth ordering.</li>
            <li> It really does help hair grow, keep eye area fresh and wrinkle free, removes scars, etc.</li>
            <li> Worth the money which is not a lot</li>
            <li> I must use it a bit longer  to determine it&#x27;s worth</li>
            <li> and so far i love the results..</li>
            <li> But so far it seems to be ok</li>
            <li> Let me tell you what it does for my sensitive skin:&lt;br /&gt;Mosquitoes love me.</li>
            <li> It was worth the wait</li>
            <li> It was well worth the buy, I saw a difference within days.</li>
            <li> This is a very rich and lush oil.  </li>
            <li> The Living Black Castor Oil is amazing!</li>
            <li> The Living Black Castor Oil is amazing!</li>
            <li> If you suffer from dermatitis, this Jamaican black castor oil is amazing!</li>
            <li> Tropic Isle&#x27;s Jamaican Black Castor Oil is amazing!</li>
            <li> &amp; this is thick and rich and feels great.</li>
            <li> I received it pretty quick.</li>
            <li> though, it can get into your eyes) and seen them grow and on my dry skin and seen it glow (this is best for dry skin</li>
            <li> I was excited but also a bit sceptical because I didn&#x27;t know if all the hype is real or not, but I noticed improvement in my hair within three weeks give or take a day or so.</li>
            <li> I am only on my first bottle but so far working great ..</li>
            <li> The smell takes some getting used to but other than that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> but I remain unconvinced that this is a superior product to any other.</li>
            <li> The amount in the bottle couldn&#x27;t really see if it did anything significant.</li>
            <li> Its just right for all my needs.</li>
            <li> Received it on time and it was the right product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using JBCO along with emu oil twice a day (when I wake up and right before bed).  </li>
            <li> shipment was right on time</li>
            <li> Right now I haven&#x27;t seen in changes in skin or hair.</li>
            <li> Finances are troublesome for my family right now</li>
            <li> Finances are troublesome for my family right now</li>
            <li> The redness doesn&#x27;t fade right away, but it helps with the pain and infection.&lt;br /&gt;Sunburned and no aloe vera?</li>
            <li> I gave my girlfriend some when I visited her and it eased the pain she was having around her right shoulders.</li>
            <li> I received this product on March 5, 2013 and started using it right away.</li>
            <li> around my edges are thinning from braids and right sew-ins</li>
            <li> I love how dark and healthy it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I applied this to my hair exactly as told, rub into roots then apply to the rest,, I left it in for 2 hours and had nice results.</li>
            <li> Mainly, I use it (lightly) to moisturize my scalp post-shampoo.</li>
            <li> After mixing them up in correct quantaties, I began to apply the oils and sure enough within 2 weeks of use my eyelashes were so full</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but was only pleasantly surprised with how much I liked this product!</li>
            <li> Have not seen full result of hair growth as was advertised from a certain magazine.  </li>
            <li> Took a little while to get used to the smell, It is just a strong woodsy smell, but i liked it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t bother me as much because I suppose it&#x27;s good for my really dry, dandruff prone scalp.</li>
            <li> The oil is light, not thick.</li>
            <li> , this is my first time purchasing this product, it has a distinct smell to it but tolerable.</li>
            <li> Aside from it being sticky and thick, I love how it&#x27;s made my hair look so much more healthier!</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and smells so pure.</li>
            <li> I like black castor oil because it is much lighter and seemingly more effective in many ways than regular castor oils.</li>
            <li> I want to use this more because it&#x27;s nice and viscous which lasts a long time and your scalp does not dry up.</li>
            <li> When I&#x27;m using this on my scalp and hair, whether it&#x27;s before bed or styling for the day, once I use it, I spray my hair with Palmer&#x27;s Olive Oil with Vitamin E hair spray because it has a nice clean smell that gives my hair that high gloss sheen all day long.  </li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil is a good product.</li>
            <li> J.B.C.O always makes my hair soft and pliable when I use it and it makes my hair grow very quickly.</li>
            <li> Give me a few more weeks with this product and I will have more to contribute toward the thickness and growing power.</li>
            <li> great for african american hair</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I love using it as part of my natural hair regimen, it really helps retain moisture and grow it.</li>
            <li> After i wash my hair and blow dry, I rub a nice amount in hand then rub it on my hair.</li>
            <li> I read some articles that said black castor oil was good for ache and pains as well as hair, skin, lashes and eyebrows.</li>
            <li> They have grown now to over half an inch and are looking good.</li>
            <li> I thought I had been ripped off, but I am glad I decided to try it any way because this stuff really does do as people have claimed as far as helping hair to regrow.</li>
            <li> I purchased the black castor oil for my hair, but have found out that it is good for skin and scalp conditions.</li>
            <li> Service was quick and fast .</li>
            <li> Also received the product super fast and was packaged</li>
            <li> the good news is my hair is breaking less</li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and keeps hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> this is a great product that African american ladies will truly see results and benefit from.</li>
            <li> The bottle lasted over 4 months so far and is still going strong.</li>
            <li> everyone, I know my hair will grow long, healthy and full.</li>
            <li> After all the good reviews and word of mouth about black castor oil, I decided to try it.  </li>
            <li> this oil is a 10/10 has helped me in anyway and has gave me a lot of NEW GROWTH !!!</li>
            <li> My hairdresser suggested pure castor oil to help it grown back healthily (if that&#x27;s a word), and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any notable changes but</li>
            <li> Several months later:  This oil is too good to be true.</li>
            <li> The smell is very smoky (this is not unpleasant to me at all).</li>
            <li> At first it didn&#x27;t seem to work, but now I can really see tremendous hair growth at my hairline.</li>
            <li> I thought because of the dark color it would have a strong overwhelming smell.</li>
            <li> We recommend this oil very much.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> I very much wanted to believe the hype about this product, but al I got was a greasy itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> It is VERY VERY greasy.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a 3 weeks ago with the intention to use it to increase hair growth around my hairline, combat dry hair, and seal; so far, I&#x27;ve seen a great change in the moisture retention of my hair and the whole feel of it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good stuff, really thick, so I don&#x27;t think it would make a good daily hair oil, but it&#x27;s definitely good in a small amount in a mixture of oils, and in skin products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m happy to say that I can feel new hair growth in those less dense areas.  </li>
            <li> It really grows my hair, sometimes i mix it with coconut oil because its quite thick, but other wise it works great on  my hair</li>
            <li> The best to keep my hair moistorized and a little does go a long way when using it.</li>
            <li> My hair is more manageable (fine 4B/C texture) with less breakage.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this oil is great for growth and sealing your ends to prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> is, it&#x27;s pretty damn</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and made my hair have a dewy look , didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy!</li>
            <li> used to be a blonde for over 20 years or more</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described.</li>
            <li> UNLESS YOU WANT A HIGHLY IRRITATED SCALP!!</li>
            <li> It actually came 1 day before the date it was suppose to come, the sooner the better.</li>
            <li> I use it to do a hot oil treatment once a week</li>
            <li> So you also may want to make sure you don&#x27;t have any underlying medical conditions that aid in shedding and breakage.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the rapid growth as some but the overall health of my hair is better...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll definitely order more.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s so worth it because it helps your hair grow so much.</li>
            <li> I use it as a hot oil sort of treatment before I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> I made the mistake of putting way too much on at first.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I will continue to by its my second bottle</li>
            <li> will say, that I also bought the same brand JBCO Hair food, which has a much more pungeant smell/odor than this oil.  </li>
            <li> i love this stuff especially in myhair but also on my skin</li>
            <li> definitely going to order more when I run out</li>
            <li> I actually found more hair falling out while I was using it.</li>
            <li> and I was able to use the rest of it just recently to make a hot oil treatment and to use it on my edges.</li>
            <li> Love that it was double bubbled wrapped and taped for protection.</li>
            <li> Hope I see more from this product in the following weeks!</li>
            <li> Actually felt like I was losing more hair after using this.</li>
            <li> I add this with another oil for a hot oil treatment.</li>
            <li> Most ppl use this product to grow back thinning hair or bald patches.</li>
            <li> The product does tingle for about 5 minutes when first applied, but then it subside.  </li>
            <li> Overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> The first time it was sticky like honey or sap.</li>
            <li> I heated it today with coconut oil and its pretty drippy.</li>
            <li> But Iwill let post results later if I see results.:)</li>
            <li> My ends have become more nourished and in the 3 weeks of use only 2 times a week ( bc of smell and oiliness)</li>
            <li> I have noticed a healthy shine and bounce back in my hair.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I love this product for multiple reasons.  </li>
            <li> My feet are so soft and callus/shed free.  </li>
            <li> This was my first time trying castor oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had it for a while, and I think that I only used it one time more than once a week.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what there is to review about this oil, its like asking for a review of olive oil!</li>
            <li> this was my first time using</li>
            <li> and when I took the braid out, my hair was pretty knotted.</li>
            <li> Suuuper fast shipping.!</li>
            <li> I definitely recommend this product and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Also, wash your face gently in the morning as well!</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for me, but give me an eye infection!</li>
            <li> Bottom line is with consistent use, it works like a charm.</li>
            <li> i love it and woudl definitely recommend it to others.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about two thirds through my first bottle</li>
            <li> I almost gave this product an unfavorable review when I first received it.</li>
            <li> when i first used it my scalp did itch n tingle</li>
            <li> I experience so much growth!</li>
            <li> It is exactly what it says it is....</li>
            <li> This has been so helpful for many different things.</li>
            <li> The first day of application I always wear a turban.</li>
            <li> I was reluctant at first but decided to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m starting to love it.</li>
            <li> It came fast!</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering this product and it met my expectation.</li>
            <li> Use consistently, you will see a difference in your hair strength and growth.  </li>
            <li> really can&#x27;t believe it!</li>
            <li> and although I have not been consistent I see progress.</li>
            <li> This works better than the capsacin creams which can get into the eyes after applying the cream in the middle of the night.    </li>
            <li> I am enjoying it overall!</li>
            <li> I also made sure that she started sleeping on a satin pillowcase and wearing a satin cap, washing with her remaining hair in braids and using Shea moisture shampoo only on her scalp.  </li>
            <li> I definitely would recommend this product to anyone!!:))</li>
            <li> I have not used the porduct yet but it is exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> Love it, used it on my hair regularly to give it moisture</li>
            <li> Love this will reorder in the future.</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s not a miracle drug</li>
            <li> This gem of an oil is our #1 best kept beauty secret ladies!</li>
            <li> This has really made me and my daughter&#x27;s hair grow!</li>
            <li> within the first couple weeks of use i started noticing growth my colour was growing out</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what everyone says it does.</li>
            <li> Recently my edges broke off (lol) and now that I use this stuff I can really see them coming back.</li>
            <li> and I applied it for the first time yesterday.  </li>
            <li> If used consistently, this will grow your hair longer.</li>
            <li> It might be better for someone with really short hair.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> Castor Oil is used for many different beauty remedies.</li>
            <li> but you have to be willing put in the time to see optimal results.</li>
            <li> Its the first day</li>
            <li> I am also going to get a higher MCG Biotin pill</li>
            <li> As with anything, a well balanced diet comes first.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried grape seed oil, olive oil, coconut oil and for the first time castor oil.</li>
            <li> But must admit, I haven&#x27;t used it consistently to see a difference in growth in my edges.  </li>
            <li> This was the whole reason I purchased!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better if you do this before bed, otherwise your vision will suck and your eye area will be greasy and gross.</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this magical oil.</li>
            <li> This really worked!</li>
            <li> It really works!</li>
            <li> Just applied this stuff to my roots for the first time today.</li>
            <li> and it makes my oil mixtures so much easier to apply to my hair!</li>
            <li> I did a hot oil treatment with it</li>
            <li> I do NOT recommend this to anyone (I&#x27;m glad I only applied it to my eyelashes</li>
            <li> This product absorbed very well into the scalp and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy.</li>
            <li> The biggest suggestion I have for anyone who is looking to try this product for the first time is GIVE IT TIME.</li>
            <li> Better than any facial lotion.</li>
            <li> People can never guess my age ;)</li>
            <li> Definitely repurchasing :)</li>
            <li> first off i bought this for hair but decided to also use it on eyelashes and brows.</li>
            <li> When i first started using this oil</li>
            <li> use it everyday for good result</li>
            <li> After more research I found it was ALL natural and wasn&#x27;t only great for hair but lots of other things!</li>
            <li> Black castor oil is great for natural hair.</li>
            <li> It has a honey texture; great for coarse and dry hair.</li>
            <li> To me, it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable unless my nose was right on the cap or bottle.</li>
            <li> I will continue to use in hair treatments to see how much of a difference it makes, can&#x27;t say right now.</li>
            <li> I think this is going to be a great product, only because my friend are giving it such high praise.</li>
            <li> However, I will caution that a cap full is more than enough for one entire head full of hair.</li>
            <li> Great buy especially if your transitioning back to natural like me !!</li>
            <li> Make my hair soft don&#x27;t put to much and you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li> this is a staple product I only use castor oil since Im a kinky curly natural girl!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t attest to its effectiveness for pattern baldness or hormonal based hair lose, but for lose due to styling this is absolutely an amazing solution.</li>
            <li> I warm it between my fingers then apply to my scalp (every other night about three times a week)</li>
            <li> i havent seen any significant hair growth yet, but it does hydrates my hair and scalp and keeps it feeling really soft</li>
            <li> i like the extra dark kind better for my hair.</li>
            <li> and I decided to try this brand of black castor oil due to the wonderful reviews.</li>
            <li> this really works and I&#x27;m very surprised and excited.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is great for hair.  </li>
            <li> Great so far for me because it moisturizes without being too heavy.  </li>
            <li> i don&#x27;t use so much on my hair because ive found red pimento hair growth oil was a lot better..</li>
            <li> this product was recommended by many people, I use it regularly but don&#x27;t see too much of a difference as people told me I would have.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, of course nothing works fast enough these days, but hopefully will start to see results.</li>
            <li> Overall I feel that the product was good that is versitile with its different uses.  </li>
            <li> The jbco is a good product , i found a bigger bottle for cheaper locally</li>
            <li> Love this oil very good and thick use a little you won&#x27;t need alot.</li>
            <li> Used four bottles without any positive result.  </li>
            <li> Hopefully, I&#x27;ll have positive results.</li>
            <li> I bought it to see if it would grow my sides, based on youtube users positive reviews of the product.</li>
            <li> it works great for moisturizing my natural African American hair.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily and actually prevents my skin from becoming oily.</li>
            <li> Other than that this product is great and will definitely be purchasing again for my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> I really think this stuff does exactly what I hoped it would.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve experienced damage to my hair due to using relaxers and not maintaining my hair properly (I know shame on me!).</li>
            <li> love this stuff really works great for dark age spots on African American skin</li>
            <li> even used it as a hot oil treatment and my hair has grown so much</li>
            <li> I may need to take a heeping tablespoon full for old times sake????  </li>
            <li> And I literally just took a shower and washed my hair and let me tell you, it is SO soft, full and thicker than it was 3 days ago before I started using</li>
            <li> and it has made my new growh soft and easy to manage.</li>
            <li> Lays my hair down nicely</li>
            <li> It leaves hair a little greasy if too much is applied but other than that, perfect!</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil is AMAZING for your hair.</li>
            <li> Be sure to wet your hair first.  </li>
            <li> This oil has my hair super soft .</li>
            <li> I mixed mine in both a shea butter concoction and hair oil concoction (both in a style similar to Youtube&#x27;s Naptural85), and I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so long, dark, fuller just beautiful.</li>
            <li> Strong smell when you initially use it, but it does fade away.</li>
            <li> Its a thick oil with a pleasant smell.</li>
            <li> It certainly does what it says.  </li>
            <li> going to stick with coconut oil 100% pure.</li>
            <li> i began using JBCO to make my hair denser in certain areas.  </li>
            <li> So this stuff certainly helps my hair, but i wouldnt leave it in my hair.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t live without this product!!</li>
            <li> I got the product very quickly after ordering it and it came in a very protective packaging which i definitely appreciate.  </li>
            <li> It is thick and it able to be spread easily.</li>
            <li> Also great for those dry, rough and itchy spots on your knees and elbows!&lt;br /&gt;Overdried hands and brittle nails from too much dishwashing?</li>
            <li> and it works just fine for my hair, especially in the winter month.</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit off putting initially,  but after about 10 minutes it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> It was free shipping and it arrived in 2 days and was more than half off than if I had gone to the store near me.</li>
            <li> It arrived in a timely fashion and was decently wrapped!</li>
            <li> The oil is very thick and has a scent which I can live with, it&#x27;s all good!</li>
            <li> /&gt;The girls who threads my eyebrows suggested warming up the oil in those little plastic travel shampoo containers and heating it by placing it in water that was warm from the pot.</li>
            <li> but  I have since learned that you need to warm it up to make it a little thinner.  </li>
            <li> I Warm it up a little.  </li>
            <li> Smoky smell, thick texture, and wonderful for rehydration of dry scalp issues!</li>
            <li> the smell is a little different like a woody burnt bacon smell but it is doing great</li>
            <li> I have experienced extreme dryness and shedding for months and single strand knots.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I noticed amazing growth on my temples.  </li>
            <li> I am very happy I purchased it, and I hope my review helps someone else discover this natural secret! &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> I am Jamaican and I know the real thing.</li>
            <li> I started breaking out which is unusual for me.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t really care to treat this until about a month ago when I got hit by a car, broke my arm, and tore a muscle in my leg.</li>
            <li> This is just how it has worked for me and maybe this can help those who haven&#x27;t had as much luck as others using the castor oil to treat the hair loss around the temple/edges.</li>
            <li> I apply it on my edges at night before bed gently massaging it in</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li> The bottle is glass and this stuff makes my hair thicker and much</li>
            <li> This really made my hair grow as promised... will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> Nothing was damaged, it was packaged very well.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I havent been using it very long,but i can already see a change in how my hair looks,and feels.</li>
            <li> I like that the product is very think</li>
            <li> It really works and helps your hair to grow.</li>
            <li> I have the 4 oz and its goin fast.</li>
            <li> I really like the castor oil.  </li>
            <li> I massage into my hair and scalp before washing my hair and it just makes my wash process so much nicer.  </li>
            <li> i mix mines with coconut oil thanks</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t expect overnight results because what product really gives you overnight results?</li>
            <li> After that I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference.</li>
            <li> so I wasn&#x27;t really paying attention to my progress and with its reputation</li>
            <li> The severe itching comes from when you put too much on your scalp.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not going to make it grow any faster by putting too much on it.</li>
            <li> Again putting too much on your hair could be causing it to shed.</li>
            <li> ,that was until i ran across a very wonderul product &amp; the name of that product</li>
            <li> and I wore them so much</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much growth lengthwise</li>
            <li> ALL OF THAT WAS STRAIGHT OUT</li>
            <li> i haven&#x27;t notice much of a difference yet</li>
            <li> it really works wonders</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair and it really has grew and gotten thicker.</li>
            <li> Then I google it and found so much benefits from this oil.</li>
            <li> got here fast</li>
            <li> my hair is growing fast</li>
            <li> It has helped my locs grow fast as well as help oil my scalp</li>
            <li> It did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> This stuff really and truly work.</li>
            <li> works very well if you have breakage or thinning.</li>
            <li> fast shipping</li>
            <li> It really keeps my hair hydrated, and my edges are growing.</li>
            <li> but I like the product so much that I began using it in my hair.</li>
            <li> and I have not seen much change.</li>
            <li> Very timely, and no damage done.</li>
            <li> I love to use this when my hair is wet &amp; I&#x27;m doing a two-strand twist style.  </li>
            <li> Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read so much about it helping thining hair.</li>
            <li> thanks for the prouduct</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give this 3 bottles before I can really tell if it&#x27;s working or not</li>
            <li> My eyelashes don&#x27;t fall out as much as before.</li>
            <li> but the smell really makes it unbearable.</li>
            <li> So can&#x27;t much.</li>
            <li> Castor oil really helps to moisturize your hair.</li>
            <li> it has done my scalp so much justice</li>
            <li> please try it ladies and gentlemen if you aren&#x27;t ready to shave your heads bald.</li>
            <li> It is very sticky of course, but it also did nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li> but I really have noticed a difference along my part after 3 weeks.  </li>
            <li> Absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> It really helps with hair growth as well as reducing shedding.  </li>
            <li> but I think I need some time for it to really work</li>
            <li> The reviewer was absolutely correct.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t really smell it in my hair.  </li>
            <li> can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve really seen any improvement</li>
            <li> that may have helped/hendered speed of growth, length or luster:&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m a believer in dirty hair grows best, so I grease my scalp like 1x a week &amp; wash maybe 1x every month or 2.</li>
            <li> try not to wear my hair tied up so much.</li>
            <li> so you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I really like the way it improves my hair.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s really too oily</li>
            <li> any product out there really helps hair to regrow.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty normal kinda like olive oil</li>
            <li> and it really worked wonders.</li>
            <li> It absorbs into the skin and is not sticky or greasy, telling me my body really needs this product.</li>
            <li> Thank you so much.</li>
            <li> My hair is much thicker than 8weeks ago.</li>
            <li> and in two weeks I had a reasonable amount of hair there, and in four weeks the hair was the length</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it twice, so I can&#x27;t really give a \\&quot;review\\&quot; of the product&#x27;s performace or efficacy, but I can comment on the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; or odor that people complain about.&lt;br /&gt;THERE</li>
            <li> i take these very day along with garlic pills.  </li>
            <li> oil really works.</li>
            <li> i notice i was applyin too much</li>
            <li> you really dont need much in your hair.</li>
            <li> you should really give it a try...</li>
            <li> i used this product in my hair and my eyebrows that i plucked to much.</li>
            <li> Ireally like this product and plan to purchase again really soon</li>
            <li> Thanks Tropic Isle...</li>
            <li> AND IT HEALS MUCH FASTER</li>
            <li> It also depends on how much and how often you apply this product.  </li>
            <li> It really works.</li>
            <li> After I wash my hair and apply it to my scalp, it feels really sticky.</li>
            <li> I will continue using this product and I will put my feedback in about 30 days to see if this oil is really working or not.</li>
            <li> it helps seal the locks really well.</li>
            <li> I manage my pain with diet (no wheat, corn, sugar, etc.) and gentle exercise.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> It works really well with my hair</li>
            <li> this stuff really works</li>
            <li> and it looks like she will make this goal very soon.  </li>

            <li> and it looks like she will make this goal very soon.  </li>
            <li> We are both very happy.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My beautician talked me into trying another product which seems to really help</li>
            <li> HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference, maybe because I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> Ended up throwing the whole bottle away.</li>
            <li> is really saying something.</li>
            <li> I am not putting it on straight</li>
            <li> My hair has grown so much since I start using JBCO.</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> It gives my hair much needed strength💜</li>
            <li> Dont really see a difference after 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li> I really like the organic oil.</li>
            <li> Our hair looks much healthier and feels stronger since using it.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> It really moisturizes my hair.  </li>
            <li> AND IT REALLY WORKS.</li>
            <li> you could tug on your hair too much and accidentaly pulling your hair out.</li>
            <li> I find that I don&#x27;t even use oil sheen spray as much as I use to.</li>
            <li> It grew and was so much thicker.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes your hair grow.  </li>
            <li> Delivery was fast and packed well.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know if it works.</li>
            <li> It makes hair grow twice as fast.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it as often and then not at all because since I wash my hair once a week, the area in which the product was applied took on a very oily feel, so</li>
            <li> thank you so much for your service.</li>
            <li> I like this product its very sticky</li>
            <li> I purchased my item not off of amazon but the real website for this oil.</li>
            <li> She said it has made so much difference with helping the dryness of her hair.</li>
            <li> I really like doing my three times a week</li>
            <li> hair grows fast, but I think that this product has given my thickness a boost.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my hair</li>
            <li> It also lasts a while, you don&#x27;t need much to reap the benefits.</li>
            <li> Put too much on and you&#x27;ll break out from the greasiness clogging your pores.</li>
            <li> I put mine on those cotton pads and gently dab all over face, then rub over eyebrows and lips.</li>
            <li> My fianc&amp;eacute;e couldn&#x27;t believe my sunburn was gone that fast.</li>
            <li> /&gt;JBCO doesn&#x27;t really have much of a smell at oll to me.</li>
            <li> REALLY HELP MY EDGES GROW</li>
            <li> I have only had the product for almost two weeks, so I am not sure what the full outcome will be, but so far I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
            <li> and it really reverses the damage done on your hair.</li>
            <li> I was package in a plastic bottle and very oily.</li>
            <li> Can tell its straight from the islands.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend to anyone!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very upset.</li>
            <li> Even my hair dresser was amazed at how much it grew( I hadn&#x27;t seen her in about 6 weeks)</li>
            <li> Very itchy on scalp...but very moisturizing on hair.</li>
            <li> it really isn&#x27;t when you put on your hair, but I do understand that if you are use to your hair products smelling fruity and sweetthat this smell is off putting.</li>
            <li> I was really hoping this would be my miracle oil.</li>
            <li> You can find it on Amazon and it smells absolutely DELICIOUS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T SAY MUCH</li>
            <li> Beware that it is an oil, so if you put too much you will be greasy.</li>
            <li> Very sticky to try and massage into hair</li>
            <li> i tried this for two months straight</li>
            <li> I was expecting trouble, but after leaving it on for 2 hours, my scalp had absorbed most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> Since its a pretty thick and potent oil, I mix it with a carrier oil like avocado or sweet almond oil to minimize the shock it could have alone to my scalp.</li>
            <li> so the product is wonderful at keeping my thick, coarse hair soft and reducing</li>
            <li> Hopeful to see more results in the near future.</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised  that this product actually works to promote hair growth as many reviews have said.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not too sure it was helpful but with natural hair, it keeps my hair oiled and it actually shines!</li>
            <li> Love it so far will buy a bigger size.</li>
            <li> Its a very think oil that is good for my thick curly hair.  </li>
            <li> Its good and thick.</li>
            <li> To me, it is more effective than other oil, such as coconut, Oliver oil, regular pure caser oil....</li>
            <li> Overall its a good product as its made my hair grow alot and my hair is pretty black.</li>
            <li> She pretty much told me this is what I would have to live with from years of getting my hair braided.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m talking about new hair, growing fast, and the condition of the length of my hair improved so much!</li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s not the best product for those who are worried about it weighing their hair down, it is very heavy, and sticky.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s too early to tell right now.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this on my skin and hair, can&#x27;t say right now if there&#x27;s a difference.</li>
            <li> I love to put a small amount in my hair before flat ironing it and it leaves it super smooth.</li>
            <li> , I mixed it with some other oils and it is so good.</li>
            <li> The smell is not notice for long and isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li> Honestly I&#x27;m not to sure what&#x27;s the best way to use this to regroup my edges from tight braids.</li>
            <li> but this was the missing key to give me a head full of thick, strong, shiny and beautiful hair.  </li>
            <li> Overall not disappointed.</li>
            <li> i was so excited to get this line of products I use it on a regular</li>
            <li> Not only has my already healthy hair grown, it has never been softer, no other oil provides the sealing protection, softness and itchy scalp relief as this.</li>
            <li> I will be buying more of this product and will see what other ways I can use it.</li>
            <li> I make sure I either spray with Olive oil or add some other porduct to cover up the smell.</li>
            <li> braids.but after i tried there other oil and it gave me more growth than anything i have tried biotin pills ,baby dont be bald,dr miricle, all oils.</li>
            <li> I add to conditioners and many other hair products.</li>
            <li> I chose it because of the reviews , and for what I have heard about it, I don&#x27;t use it every day, more like every other day, however I am not seeing results.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read it has many other uses</li>
            <li> I recommend mixing it with other oils just to be safe.</li>
            <li> Still figuring if I love it or not, I really don&#x27;t know how to use it!</li>
            <li> I have not been consistent in applying every night, but I do notice a little more hair coming in.</li>
            <li> for 4b/c hair thats a miracle.. I&#x27;m not sure about growth but with the oils I&#x27;m sure it will help!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any significant hair growth, but my hair , as well as, my scalp were properly hydrated.</li>
            <li> its raw and keeps my hair nice</li>
            <li> It helps with moisture because my hair gets dry easily.</li>
            <li> My hair grows pretty fast naturally, so I cannot comment on whether JBCO helped in that aspect or not.</li>
            <li> It also works very well as a hot oil treatment, natural hair need lots of mosture.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s my fault that It&#x27;s not growing back as great as I&#x27;d like</li>
            <li> not sure if it&#x27;s the phase I am in right now or the product I need more time to tell.</li>
            <li> , I was really surprised, I thought for sure it would be dry.</li>
            <li> Good when hair is wet or dry.</li>
            <li> Naturally black and went for a very light caramel, brown/blonde. .</li>
            <li> This product smells much better than the JBCO produced by other companies, is thick and rich and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I parted my hair into sections beginning with the lower region and as strange as it may sound</li>
            <li> Recommendations: put the bottle under hot water to help loosen it up before using; use it once a week or overnight as a pre-poo; use a clarifying shampoo to ensure oil rinses out completely.</li>
            <li> Recently, I have been doing my own hair (I was natural for 3 years and switched back to relaxers) which included amping up my regimen.</li>
            <li> not worth the money...there are othjer products that you can use that are so much better</li>
            <li> So far, I really like it!</li>
            <li> BACK FULL</li>
            <li> I just mixed it with my almond oil and diluted it with some water and generously applied it to my roots and ends and the next day my hair was nice and soft.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite oil.</li>
            <li> but you get used to it quick and its not bad just odd</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little thick and doesn&#x27;t smell the best</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really works,my hair looks little more thicker.</li>
            <li> Now, hairs are sprouting in that area (new hair!)</li>
            <li> I have put it on my eyebrows for 3 days and they have SO MUCH new growth!</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 years and my 4b hair has been fairly healthy throughout the entire time and is currently shoulder length.</li>
            <li> I use it, along with other oils and it really makes my feel hair soft and more healthier.</li>
            <li> For starters, it makes my new hair growth much thicker.</li>
            <li> My hair feels softer, less tangled, and my curls are more defined.  </li>
            <li> it makes my hair look even more black (temporarily), which i like.  </li>
            <li> Less is more.</li>
            <li> , Love my Jamaican Black Castor</li>
            <li> Love the black castor oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve read previous reviews and many people seem to complain about this product being too greasy or it has a stench to it.</li>
            <li> I love using jamaican black castor oil for a number of health &amp; beauty purposes.</li>
            <li> I know it works for others, I watched MANY YouTube reviews on this product, but they were 90% black girls, maybe that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work for me?</li>
            <li> I had a half dollar sized patch at the top front of my hair that had visibly thinned.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed less dryness around my hair line and my scalp seems to be more moisturized, since using this oil.</li>
            <li> It works okay to me, I prefer coconut oil as it less greasy and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I love it only thing i thought the bottle was a larger one.  </li>
            <li> And its proven to regulate DHT which is one of the factors if not the main factor of hairloss in men&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pura d’or shampoo.</li>
            <li> the main Product&lt;br /&gt;Black</li>
            <li> It smells gross and is super sticky.</li>
            <li> I was having breakage problems around my hairline, mainly from sleeping without a cap or satin pillowcase.</li>
            <li> So I gave a little to my aunt to try (the little lasted her for MONTHS) , and she loved it!</li>
            <li> Luckily, I gave some to my granny, so she still had some left.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t particularly like the smell.</li>
            <li> Will definitely purchase more bottle shortly.</li>
            <li> I plan on keeping this as my main hair care and growth regime.</li>
            <li> Although it is a heavy oil, it absorbs well, and gives my natural hair a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> Looking for quick growth especially in areas that has no hair.</li>
            <li> I was particularly using it for my eyebrows.</li>
            <li> I bought this particular castor oil and Sundown Vitamin E oil 70,000 IU, as the pin also required vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> but I fully believe that my hair would not have grown back as quickly as it has with this product.</li>
            <li> Now I will have to most likely wear a wig until these areas thicken back up.</li>
            <li> The consistency is really thick and almost sticky but good for natural hair.</li>
            <li> the product is really doing wonders on my edges of my hair because has thicken my edges really really  good because they have always been so thin.</li>
            <li> However, if you are very sensitive to smell, you should test the real thing before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY recommend Jamaican Black Castro Oil if your wanting to see result on Hair Growth. :)</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> highly suggest seeing what you can get out of this before dropping dough on Latisse.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I am in Looovveee with Jamaican Castor oil, i highly recommend it.    </li>
            <li> and my oh my I&#x27;ve seen eyebrow hairs I haven&#x27;t seen since high school!!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I highly recommended this item..</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> and it wasnt unbelievable results, just being honest everyone ranting and raving about them receiving all these inches a month when in reality if ur hair grows fast or normal naturally ur going to get these results anyway because its your norm.</li>
            <li> in all, highly recommend adding this oil to your hair care routine.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> High quality castor oil..highly recommended</li>
            <li> and I use a clean mascara wand to put it on my lashes to keep them long and conditioned.  </li>
            <li> could&#x27;ve  received a 5 star but when receiving the product the top or cap is a little bent thank God</li>
            <li> Stating to work a little will keep using and probable order more.</li>
            <li> When I put it on my lashes and brows every night I do notice a little more fullness.</li>
            <li> But who cares about all that, the point is that it made my hair so SOFT!!</li>
            <li> This was said to be the most trusted brand and that it was a little exspensive</li>
            <li> So far I see a lot of improvement on the stretch marks!!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s good for keeping hair hydrated longer, so it feels less dry than before I started using it.</li>
            <li> Odorless, but very thick and good for moisture.</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to have a strong scent since other reviews stated it</li>
            <li> this stuff is awasome, repairs damaged hair, softents hair and increases hair growth, a friend told me about this stuff as i have recently had a fire-breathing-accident and part of my beard was destroyed and its awasome, best to use in small amounts, dont care much for smell (smells a little musty)</li>
            <li> it comes out amazing with a thick coat on it.</li>
            <li> also i applied it to a part in my hair that was really thinnin and so far its fillin up</li>
            <li> My hair, lashes feel very conditioned and soft.  </li>
            <li> Again it is very moisturizing on my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> I really like this oil and leave my hair soft and manageable and it does make your hair</li>
            <li> so I massage my scalp with this oil and mix it with another light oil, but nevertheless, I will use it till the bottle is empty.</li>
            <li> The real deal..using it as I transition from perm to Natural.</li>
            <li> there is real improvement in my hair, &amp; when used on a consistent basis with a regular hair care routine it works.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural 4b/c hair and this product is magic.</li>
            <li> I will give it a few more weeks to see if I notice any results.</li>
            <li> However it did not grow my hair long yet, but now I have a head full of hair.</li>
            <li> Normally I use vitamin E oil on things like this, but I was out, and figured that this couldn&#x27;t hurt.  </li>
            <li> oil is really good on your edges to slick them back.</li>
            <li> this product is good and you only need to use a small amount.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, so I am sure if will grow my hair.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;After looking at a few options I decided to try this out, as it seemed inexpensive and not harmful like so many others.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> Ilike to use after a hot bath as it soaks into your damp skin and you can really reap the rewards, especially before bed when your body recharges and heals.</li>
            <li> Since castor oil is absorbed into the skin (laxative/purgative effect), I am limiting my use of the oil for heels and cuticles to weekly manicures and pedicures, not a daily practice.</li>
            <li> I didnt use this product long enough to notice results it packed away on a shelf of my many hair products.</li>
            <li> will give it a few more months to see how I like it.</li>
            <li> Love it, I saw an increase in thickness over a few weeks of application.</li>
            <li> This product was not &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; like the ones I normally buy.</li>
            <li> Maybe I needed to be more patient to see results, so far I have only used it for two weeks but not religiously.</li>
            <li> However, I must say it&#x27;s a kind of thick and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s kinda thick which is nice because I don&#x27;t want it to absorb into the wigs I wear.  </li>
            <li> I mix it with another oil (e.g. jojoba or Vitamin E) because it is kind of thick and doesn&#x27;t spread as well as I want it to on</li>
            <li> A little of this product goes a long way, so it&#x27;s best to not be heavy handed, especially on straight or loosely curled hair.</li>
            <li> Essential oils are powerful with wonderful benefits but could make you sick if not diluted well.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used pharmaceutical grade castor oil to seal my coily 4c natural hair and had heard of the even better properties of Black Jamaican Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> My hair is super soft and moisturized, I mix this with organic coconut oil for extra shine.</li>
            <li> Next i&#x27;m looking forward to the Tropic Isle Living Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil !</li>
            <li> I mean to say that honestly I read all the reviews</li>
            <li> My edges were acting funny and becoming shorter on the sides due to being under stress and dying my hair.</li>
            <li> The pictures in the left column are from July 19, 2015 and the pictures on the right were taken on July 24, 2015.</li>
            <li> I have noticed it ironically dries my skin out where I apply it, and if I use it every day, I will break out right next to where I applied the oil.</li>
            <li> NOT STARTING OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT.</li>
            <li> The second day after I got it, right when I was about to try it it fell off my counter and broke.</li>
            <li> IS ONE OF THEM PRODUCTS, JUST RECIEVED MY 1ST BOTTLES AND STARTED RIGHT AWAY USING IT, MY HAIR IS CURRENTLY IN BOX BRAIDS FOR 90 DAYS.</li>
            <li> Even though the seller shipped promptly, the castor oil was regular castor oil, and not dark with the consistency of true JBCO.</li>
            <li> I recently went natural to try to get my hair healthy and just simply embrace my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I use this along with almond oil, and pure castor oil on my hair daily, and I really like how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> In addition if you would like other techniques that’s not included in this list, feel free to email me and ask.&lt;br /&gt;Noblesupreme@outlook.com</li>
            <li> Beware it does smell a little nutty, but if you mix it with another natural oil, you&#x27;re ok...</li>
            <li> It kind of reminded me of when a man shaves and you see the little stubble growing back.</li>
            <li> , you might want to open a few windows because the smell is pretty strong but it works really well</li>
            <li> of caution, this product is very thick and oily so, be sure it is absorbed before laying your head on any linens or furniture.</li>
            <li> and I already have new growth coming in.</li>
            <li> I moisturize my new growth</li>
            <li> /&gt;c) softened my new growth BEAUTIFULLY&lt;br</li>
            <li> + I have lots of new growth.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> i ordered two weeks ago i alreary can see my new hair</li>
            <li> I has new growth already</li>
            <li> I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a new oil and so on.</li>
            <li> always finding new uses for it.</li>
            <li> My mother was like what is that in your hair, I said NEW HAIR growing.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t live without now..</li>
            <li> in 2 weeks my bald edges got thicker and new hair is coming in .</li>
            <li> but I now have new growth .</li>
            <li> AND I HAVE BOUT 4 INCHES OF NEW GROWTHS AND BOUT 3 INCHES OF REMAINING RELAXED END</li>
            <li> it has thickened my new growth and has increased my hair growth.</li>
            <li> It looks like I am getting some new hair growth.</li>
            <li> It takes a while for your hair to adapt to a new regimen and for you to reap the benefits of a new product, so do give it time.</li>
            <li> Overall, very good for my thick dry hair.</li>
            <li> I think the oil is very moisturizing when mixed with other things, and helps give hair nice shine and sheen when used with conditioner for a deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> HUGE point I want to make is Initially I purchased the JBCO from my local hair store</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and moist and I&#x27;ve heard castor oil help to promote hair growth which was the main reason for me purchasing it.</li>
            <li> And if you have super dry hair like mine, this will help a bunch.  </li>
            <li> My edges did grow back some, but not as fast as everyone claims, and it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable.</li>
            <li> the very short patches had grown a lot, the bald patches had filled in and the back had grown BELOW HER SHOULDERS.  </li>
            <li> strong after just a month and half of use</li>
            <li> I applied it on my scalp and new growth; it made my new growth feel so soft!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thick and sticky and has a strong, though not necessarily bad, odor that others might find off-putting.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Makes my hair very soft and manageable&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have a very sensitive scalp.</li>
            <li> so I was very surprised when this item worked so well.</li>
            <li> I gave it 3 stars because it did make my hair feel very soft</li>
            <li> I ordered this oil (delivery was very fast), the same day I received</li>
            <li> It makes your hair very soft .</li>
            <li> oil made my hair very soft and it did grow my egdes that were&lt;br /&gt;starting to break off because i always wore my hair in pony tails. .</li>
            <li> and I also used it on my feet and they are very soft because of it.</li>
            <li> she was very surprised that I had never used it before.</li>
            <li> So, at least for the first couple of uses, go easy on the quantity</li>
            <li> All I can say is &amp;#34;Wow.&amp;#34; Not only did my eyebrow hair grow back (more plentiful and healthier than before) in a short amount of time, BUT the seborrhea there is almost gone.</li>
            <li> But applying it to your scalp and ends on a consistent basis is definitely recommended, as well as using for a pre poo treatment, or sealing moisture into damp</li>
            <li> other favorite hair product is \\&quot;Mixed</li>
            <li> they grew longer, not sure about darker/thicker, but maybe I should keep on using it for more time.</li>
            <li> well actually I but this on first strait out of the shower then I apply my hair gel.</li>
            <li> , I purchased a second bottle after getting no results with the first one.  </li>
            <li> Wow, it&#x27;s horrid!</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Completely recommend!</li>
            <li> What it does do is make my hair soooo soft and shiny!</li>
            <li> I am willing to purchase it again and hopefully will get similar results.</li>
            <li> Way back in 7th grade, I got my hair relaxed for the first time and it broke off within half-a-year.</li>
            <li> This castor oil made my hair so soft!</li>
            <li> I tried this as well as the regular castor oil, I love them both but would probably prefer this one over the other one.</li>
            <li> I recommend to all natural girls!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not really sure it&#x27;s better than the drug store over the counter type of castor oil</li>
            <li> soft!....</li>
            <li> it will really cause breakage if you are not careful.  </li>
            <li> Same exact thing.</li>
            <li> here&#x27;s what the oil does best: It will thicken your hair like crazy!</li>
            <li> more so I&#x27;m not sure if this stuff works</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> Until I started noticing my hair was shedding more than usual.</li>
            <li> I use it before I braid her hair and it softens it so much that she barely even notices when I am braiding it.  </li>
            <li> I am newly transitioning natural (going on 4 months in) with about 1-2 inches of new growth.</li>
            <li> Always remember that essential oils can be diluted with oil only, so if you spill some or use it too concentrated on the skin or scalp, take coconut, olive, any vegetable or carrier oil will do to clean it off.  </li>
            <li> I use it to smooth down my edges</li>
            <li> Its a super thick oil but absorbs quickly into scalp.</li>
            <li> Yes, it takes a little more time and effort than other hair oils, but I think its worth it.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair to begin with, and it started thinning in my late 20&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> If you have thinning edges or thin hair in general, this may be your best bet other than taking a supplement such as biotin to really increase the thickness of your hair.</li>
            <li> However my hair is very thin as appears to look stronger, shinier, and almost imediatly in areas where my hair was short it has filled in nicely.</li>
            <li> I have also noticed my hair grows in straight if I use it diligently, because the heavy weight of the oil forces the hairs to move in the right direction!</li>
            <li> This oil is one of the products I use in my hair,and I think it really does make my hair feel much softer than it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other oils to create a special blend for my hair.  </li>
            <li> and I have noticed an improvement in my severe case of dandruff, and it also makes my natural hair very soft.</li>
            <li> I did a bit of research on the web and found several positive reviews about Tropic Isle Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> My hair still sucks, but I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s much that I can do keep it looking great for longer than 24 hrs at a time.</li>
            <li> My hair has always been relatively healthy and long (the middle of my back).</li>
            <li> but surprisingly it didn&#x27;t last me that long, because I used it in a few of my hair concoctions.</li>
            <li> This Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil, really works!!!</li>
            <li> I have been an ongoing user of the black castor oil and trust me when I say, this stuff really works!!!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that keeps my dry hair smooth and shining.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it as both a hot oil treatment and regular moisturizer; for the latter, I cut it with other oils (coconut, jojoba, vitamin E) and it works fine.</li>
            <li> Within a year and a half, I regrew my natural hair and my scalp and hair were back to a healthy state.</li>
            <li> I use this product mixed with the Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil and as a back up the Hair Food.</li>
            <li> This will certainly be something that I intend to use constantly.</li>
            <li> I can find the large one here for the same price</li>
            <li> I used it on my damp hair after I got out of the shower and combed my hair ( by the way I am an African American woman) and instantly my hair felt super duper soft!!!</li>
            <li> The oil is somewhat thick thus couldn&#x27;t imagine this being of much interest to people with fine hair.</li>
            <li> I have very kinky course hair and it can get very dry and shed a whole lot.</li>
            <li> plus I feel the quality is a little better than what I can locally buy.</li>
            <li> I believe it was due to the tremendous stress I was under at the time, but no matter the reason for it, it was there.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also mix this with other oils to create a super cream.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this about six months but only used it sparingly when I noticed my hair was dry.</li>
            <li> I massage it onto my scalp and roots every other day, and my roots are now super shiny, sleek and extremely soft.</li>
            <li> It was easy to point out because my hair was now a chestnut blonde but the \\&quot;new hair\\&quot; looked black.</li>
            <li> Smells really bad, but got her fast and is a great price</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t that bad but definitely not the best thing either.</li>
            <li> it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon so far is the only place I can find the real</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this oil,an so far I really like it.  </li>
            <li> pressed CLEAR CASTOR OIL..</li>
            <li> It is clear, and the smoke odor was almost non-existent.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy (thick) oil but when used properly it is great at moisturizing and adding softness.  </li>
            <li> She continues to use this product as her scalp massage and moisturizer and her hair is not only growing like a weed but feels very fluffly, soft and not greasy at all.  </li>
            <li> I am only using this product on one side of my head and not all over, as I am generally cautious when trying a product for the first time.</li>
            <li> Actually I was really surprised it really works</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everyone wants thick,healthy hair, and I can definitely recommend this as a natural way to thicken your hair..</li>
            <li> I could leave in coconut oil in my hair overnight, but I have never done so with JBCO, primarily because I am worried that it might be too heavy for skin.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I use this with Wild Hair Growth and Shea Butter, at night.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t really used it enough yet to see results</li>
            <li> Start seeing results as early as 2 weeks.</li>
            <li> I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and use this oil to help thicken some of the thinning areas in my hair.  </li>
            <li> Works we&#x27;ll on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing this recommended on YouTube for hair growth for a pretty long time.</li>
            <li> I noticed it my skin is soft all over.</li>
            <li> I used the whole bottle last year and am done with it.</li>
            <li> Again you are probably using too much and that is another side effect of putting too much JBCO on your hair and scalp in such a short time period.</li>
            <li> And let me tell you that my eyelashes have nearly doubled in length in a month.</li>
            <li> This stuff did make my hair soft...</li>
            <li> Been natural for 5 years but used heat alot to damage my hair.</li>
            <li> I preferably like the green vibrance line ( available on</li>
            <li> , This pills are all natural and it battles the hair loss from within also.</li>
            <li> ( all natural ingredients )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Biotin</li>

            <li> Used nightly for 2 weeks so far.</li>
            <li> I like this oil, not a harsh smell</li>
            <li> no jbco did not fall out anyway so far</li>
            <li> I will give a 30 day update as to how it is working thus far.  </li>
            <li> I have two daughters that have natural hair</li>

            <li> Thus far I like the product and the results.</li>
            <li> my hair is arm pit lenth and natural.</li>
            <li> but I won&#x27;t because I am trying to be natural.</li>
            <li> This made it easier, with no pull at the point of demarcation between the natural and relaxed hair (and I have a LOT of hair.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s relaxed my natural wave pattern.  </li>
            <li> I have spend so much money to make my hair grow and after trying this product for only two weeks</li>
            <li> I am natural &amp; I have 4c Type hair.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
            <li> and it left it feeling very moisturized.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used for the last 4 months and hasn&#x27;t really helped the regrowth.  </li>
            <li> and it also makes my hands really soft</li>

            <li> I&#x27;ve been natural for 7 months and have been looking for an oil that I could use in my LOCO method on my 4 C hair.</li>
            <li> Maybe it as my natural hair growth cycle, I don&#x27;t know.  </li>
            <li> This has really helped me grow my edges back.</li>
            <li> ummm i used it a lil over a month so far</li>
            <li> I use it also in my natural hair before i co wash</li>
            <li> and it was soft</li>
            <li> but, I like the product so far.  </li>
            <li> I do not use heat elements on my African-American hair and wear it natural</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;m a natural with 4b hair)</li>
            <li> so far i like it</li>
            <li> Maybe it&#x27;s too early to make a conclusion.  </li>
            <li> EARLY</li>
            <li> so mostiurezd  and did thicken my hair and take chemicles out of my hair since im going natural</li>

            <li> After hearing about this oil all over you tube and from natural hair lovers...</li>
            <li> It does make the hair soft and my spot in the front is filling in.</li>
            <li> I am using this product on my natural hair .</li>
            <li> I bought this for use in my natural hair care regimen and DIY hair recipes.  </li>
            <li> oh and it has a smell, its not terrible but its not nice at all.</li>
            <li> I Was hearing a lot about this product in Natural Hair Forums and Blogs</li>
            <li> so I decided to order it also for my Natural Hair and</li>
            <li> I tried it because of the rave reviews this product was getting on natural hair care blogs that I follow.</li>
            <li> when put on the edges of my hair and on the scalp really ads lasting moisture.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this product for my natural hair castor oil challenge and it has done wonders for me and my hair.</li>
            <li> The only problems I really had with it was the molasses like texture and smell.</li>
            <li> Aside from that I would recommend this product to anyone trying to grow their hair natural or not.</li>
            <li> and my hair is soooo soft and shiny.  </li>
            <li> i used it on my eyebrows and within two weeks they nearly doubled in size.</li>
            <li> I have added it to my water bottle solution for my natural hair.  </li>
            <li> Naturally since my hair was, hehe</li>
            <li> Naturally since my hair was, hehe</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m texlaxed and my daughter is a straightened natural.</li>
            <li> Edges are back thanks to it.</li>
            <li> If you are going natural, rub this in your scalp everytime you wash your hair.  </li>
            <li> This product makes my hair soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> So far, I have used this product for about three months.  </li>
            <li> After reading some things said about this product in a Natural Hair forum on FB, I decided to give this a try.  </li>
            <li> and I did not have the patience to complete the bottle.  </li>
            <li> However, from the time I did use it (about 3 weeks), I do see some improvement on hair that was thinning near the edges.  </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Wonders on my natural hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 1 year and 6 months natural and this is one of my staple hair products.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair really soft and shiny.</li>
            <li> it make my skin soft...</li>
            <li> Since I am south asian it didn&#x27;t really do the trick, my hair is still falling off.</li>
            <li> All hair breakage stopped and my hair is soft and shines.  </li>
            <li> AND SO FAR I HAVENT BEEN DISAPPOINT ON NO PRODUCTS</li>
            <li> SO FAR WHEN I DECIDED TO GO FOR RELAXER TO NATURAL</li>
            <li> I use this for my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this Castor oil again; it keeps my hair soft and moisturized.  </li>
            <li> That&#x27;s what all natural, unrefined products smell like:</li>
            <li> people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I really like it - this oil is all my mother used on my hair when I was younger.</li>
            <li> It works wonders on natural hair.</li>
            <li> This product really works I have told several of my friends and they have started using it as well</li>
            <li> Would not waste time</li>
            <li> so far i like it.</li>
            <li> My reason for going natural was because my hair had fell out a lot after having my son.</li>
            <li> This is VERY recommenedable especially with breaking edges.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural.</li>
            <li> I also mix some into my conditioner on wash day &amp; it do make my hair soft from that.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive scalp do not use.</li>
            <li> and i would not say my scalp is sensitive.</li>
            <li> recommend this to those who are transitioning to natural hair.</li>
            <li> Too early to comment on it.</li>
            <li> I got this oil because my hair was thinning ( transitioning from relaxed to natural) and a bald spot</li>
            <li> I would reccomend for women who are transitioning to wearing their natural hair.</li>
            <li> It keeps my hair soft and edges looking natural.</li>
            <li> I havent had it long enough to know if it truely works on my hair.</li>
            <li> It is thick and not thin like other oils which I love!  </li>
            <li> She lives in Florida and when I returned to visit her, barely 7 months later, her hair had grown so much!  </li>
            <li> I only used is a few times but already in love with it.</li>
            <li> Also, if the smell bothers you, put in few drops of your favorite essential oil.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Love the thick texture</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d use it more if it weren&#x27;t so thick.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the perfect balance: not too thick and not too thin.</li>
            <li> I love the thick consistency of castor oil.</li>
            <li> The smell is ok and the oil is thick.</li>
            <li> I love how thick it is.</li>
            <li> It is slowly but surely getting there when it comes to the edges</li>
            <li> but this oil is way better its thick and gives you moisture like nothing else</li>
            <li> I would recommend to any people looking for healthy hair or a thick oil.</li>
            <li> With regular application, I use this directly on the scalp, it keeps your hair nice and thick.</li>
            <li> Slow progress is better than none.</li>
            <li> I live in the northwest, so african american skin gets pretty chappy out here.</li>
            <li> Weird smell, not bad, just strong, but nothing you cant get used to.</li>
            <li> yet I found it on amazon (no surprise) for very cheap either way a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> especially if used daily along with co-washing or regular washes because in the first three weeks my edges were a little better</li>
            <li> I am excited as I have researched this for a little while</li>
            <li> A WHOLE LOT OF FABRICATION AND THE FEEDBACK FROM OTHER PEOPLE ON HERE REALLY INTICED ME</li>
            <li> Using it as a hot oil treatment has prevented my hair from being overly dry as the weather has become colder.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not until I decided to transition that I became a bit more curious about this oil along with other oils and products.</li>
            <li> I went from having no edges all of my life to them being full in less than a month.</li>
            <li> but, it is tolerable considering that I saw a nice amount of growth while using this oil along with a few other oils.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t do that in Winter because the air is dry from the heaters and furnaces being on and it will pull the moisture out of your scalp and the inside of your hair to moisturize the outside of your strand, which will quickly cause damage and breakage.  </li>
            <li> It makes my new growth very soft and extra manageable.</li>
            <li> Although it is heavy, one can use minimal amounts in the hair,because it spreads very easily.</li>
            <li> and I am left with baby soft, shiny, healthy hair that grows faster than usual.</li>
            <li> Ok let me start with the fact that I am Hispanic and I have done a lot of damage to my hair due to extensive flat ironing and dying.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is such an easy thing to add to your daily regimen, and is so much cheaper than buying all of the other products I formerly used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is such an easy thing to add to your daily regimen, and is so much cheaper than buying all of the other products I formerly used.</li>
            <li> The first week I did not notice the smell, the second week it was like someone was constantly waving one of those Crayola Licorice Scented Markers under my nose.</li>
            <li> Received this product and it&#x27;s not BLACK CASTOR OIL...</li>
            <li> Oddly enough, this particular brand has been reported as having a &amp;#34;smoky smell&amp;#34; but I do not find it offensive.</li>
            <li> this is a thicker oil, the viscosity would not be to many people&#x27;s liking but for thicker ,kinkier  hair ,your tresses will thank you I use on my scalp and that of my daughters&#x27;,  to lock in moisture after a shampoo since black peoples hair dry out easily and is quite delicate.</li>
            <li> I am no longer searching high and low for a miracle product.</li>
            <li> I took off one star for the smell and the fact that it  is very heavy on my fine hair.</li>
            <li> It does have a light smell, and its not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> only cons are the oil does not smell so good though you can mix it with other oils to improve the smell, the other con is the oil itches when you first start applying in your hair &amp; scalp but that usually lessens after your scalp gets use to it, but to me the pro&#x27;s outweigh the cons of this product</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected.</li>
            <li> Good for me, Not good for other people.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just trying different alternatives to normal &amp;#34;hair grease&amp;#34; and i have heard a lot about this product.</li>
            <li> Now, I actually look normal without any make-up.</li>
            <li> I used it with my heating cap prior to my normal shampoo &amp; condition.  </li>
            <li> I use this to calm my hair down after I shampoo and condition.  </li>
            <li> Very very thick I bought this originally and a treatment for my hair but to be honest it is so thick</li>
            <li> It may be a little thick for some, but a good solution would be to mix it with another oil like coconut or jojoba.</li>
            <li> I put just a couple of drops on it, and my arm was like new the next morning.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen new growth on my edges after using for only 2 weeks!</li>
            <li> I would have to come back to see if there&#x27;s any new hairgrowth as a result of this product.</li>
            <li> but I actually do see new hair comn in</li>
            <li> Dry up fast after application.</li>
            <li> Used to mix a hair tonic for short natural soft  hair.  </li>
            <li> so I can&#x27;t use it too much on my face, only when necessary).</li>
            <li> After about a few months of use I have seen tremendous results.  </li>
            <li> The hair also grows back stronger, which is also nice since over plucking seems to thin eyebrows</li>
            <li> this stuff is good as a heavy moisturizer during colder months b/c it is thick.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair all over is really thick and really strong.</li>
            <li> but I use it anyway to keep my hair strong and thick.</li>
            <li> I can tell you that it has made my coarse hair very soft.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to mention all the ingredients, but to give you an idea, my homemade hair creams and body salves are made of natural oils, such as virgin coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, unrefined avocado oil, jojoba, a few nut oils, true ivory unrefined shea butter(softened by stirring with a fork, NOT MELTED!!), calendula essential oil, tea tree essential oil, myrrh, ylang ylang</li>
            <li> This stuff will thicken your hair up within the first couple of weeks if used every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> First when i purchased this product i thought it was going to be just like other product</li>
            <li> This product has definitely thickened my natural hair and has kept my scalp moisturized!</li>
            <li> (And gentlemen, of course) Let me tell you the 3 major ways this oil has changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I noted a major difference; my scalp was no longer flaky and was growing at faster rate.  </li>
            <li> This is what I did; first I washed my hair twice with shampoo only after allowing it to air dry</li>
            <li> I have short natural curly hair and currently have dyed my hair so my hair is in much need of moisturizers and deep treatments.</li>
            <li> My hair gets so dry in the winter and JBCO has left it my hair soft, really helps to define my curls</li>
            <li> There is a considerable difference in the thickness of my roots and its just a clear when flat ironed.</li>
            <li> The cool thing is you can use a little of it on your eyebrows and eyelashes at night to thicken them too!</li>
            <li> I just received this last week and what I can say right away is that this stuff gives moisture without completely weighing the hair down.  </li>
            <li> It takes a little while to see results, but its worth the wait.</li>
            <li> Last spring I wore them so much( my hair is straight, light brown and very thin)</li>
            <li> The smell of Jamaican Black a Castor Oil is strong and nutty, but that is to be expected.</li>
            <li> so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  </li>
            <li> It helps keep my feet soft and pretty and putting a little in my bath makes my skin feel healthier and</li>
            <li> Highly recommended for all African American type four hair types.</li>
            <li> i mean i have hair growing in fine</li>
            <li> Not only did the product help to clear my skin, but it also thickens my hair.</li>
            <li> So, this is the 2nd review to clear things up.  </li>
            <li> I use this in addition to coconut oil ask a mask (I am currently transitioning to natural hair and using only natural products).</li>
            <li> I did my big chop and went natural October 2010</li>
            <li> My hair was above my shoulders, now it&#x27;s nearly below my shoulders and growing.</li>
            <li> leaves hair extra soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> My hair is starting to look like it&#x27;s old self</li>
            <li> and I can barely if at all smellit once it&#x27;s in our hair.  </li>
            <li> The only one I&#x27;ve seen so far is Lavender.  </li>
            <li> since i&#x27;ve been using it i see so a big difference in my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I recently went natural from having relaxed hair for about 7-8 years.</li>
            <li> When I recieved the product and used it, I barely noticed the smell.  </li>
            <li> I just got this like 5 days ago and only used it twice so far.</li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference in my hair as far as thickness, I never had edges</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been transitioning from relaxed hair to natural hair for about a year, and it&#x27;s been a fairly simple process.  </li>
            <li> I also mixed it with Wild Growth Oil and coconut oil.</li>
            <li> and I definitely felt a change in the moisture retention of my hair, my hair was soft, bouncy</li>
            <li> , this grew my edges back almost completely in 45 days, I could see some growth after 2 days.</li>
            <li> It can have multiple uses for your hair; makes it soft &amp; promotes growth.</li>
            <li> The product arrived much sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> I all ready ordered a sec.</li>
            <li> Her goal is to grow her hair enough so that she can wear her natural hair in a bun and not have to wear a wig anymore</li>
            <li> I used this product only once so far</li>
            <li> I have been trying to grow my edges back for years because they completely fell out from wearing my</li>
            <li> Silky soft all week until next shampoo.  </li>
            <li> I really didn&#x27;t care for it on my scalp and after two tries gave</li>
            <li> AND I CAN BARE IT, JUST TO ME JBCO</li>
            <li> Rubbed this on my burnt shoulders and neck, the next morning the redness and pain was completely gone.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my natural hair and in my Deep conditioning treatments and also on my edges</li>
            <li> I am a natural and wear twist outs daily.</li>
            <li> You get used to the burnt seed smell and the thick consistency the oil has, as I actually enjoy it now.</li>
            <li> and I honestly believe it was fake because it didn&#x27;t do NADA..</li>
            <li> , I did some research on U-tube and everyone swore by it, I have thin, chemically processed hair for 20 or more years, and</li>
            <li> it weighs my hair down because it&#x27;s heavy, but I love that.  </li>
            <li> how much you use :) It made my hair soft, after wash, thick and when applied to scalp less hair fallout!!</li>
            <li> It is working really good for my black relaxed hair but it is very thick and greasy.</li>
            <li> My hair is currently natural (very kinky) but as far as I can remember, growing up, I always had less hair around my temples and at the back.</li>
            <li> Thankfully with my genetics and love for garlic, I shed significantly less than the average human being</li>
            <li> I had HIGH HOPES that this oil would do wonders for me according to these reviews and other natural hair forums I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> I mean it&#x27;s just fantastic</li>
            <li> It makes my hair so soft and the twists last much longer than other products.</li>
            <li> grew my hair back so nice and thick!!</li>
            <li> First of all, the oil is not black; its the same clear color as regular castor oil, just a little thinner.  </li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair very soft, I have not used it for a long period of time yet</li>
            <li> This is AMAZING for eyebrow regrowth since opposite direction growth is so frustrating when it already takes so long to regrow.</li>
            <li> My scalp no longer dries up like how it did with other products, this castro oil keeps it very oily just the way I like it.</li>
            <li> I can not give it credit for any unusual hair growth spurt, as I had read in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know what to say other than we shall see how beneficial this product will be for my hair.</li>
            <li> It was hard to clean up even on hardwood.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way - the bottle still looks full, too.</li>
            <li> Thick and original.</li>
            <li> so maybe this is better for you ladies (and guys) with long, thick, dry, wild hair.</li>
            <li> It really helps them so much because I had nothing hardly for lashes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I swear I loved this product, but it was so thick and hard to spread on my scalp.</li>
            <li> Brings fullness and life back to your hair just be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> I will definitely be ordering another bottle in the near future.</li>
            <li> Not only did it cease to grow, but I kept getting split ends everywhere, even after I had stopped straightening my hair and began only using natural products.</li>
            <li> My hair is natural and im african american JBCO kept my hair feelin soft and fluffy when applied correctly when theres too much hair</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry and normally soaks up any moisture.  </li>
            <li> Though she is an older lady, she is very feminine and does not like her looks with this &#x27;boy&#x27; type hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to make a long story short, I sent her a bottle of this Jamaican black castor oil</li>
            <li> If you overapply it will certainly weigh it down and your hair will start to look stringy.</li>
            <li> It is thick the way folk describe, and it smells very different, but the thickness actually works for me, so I&#x27;m fine with that.</li>
            <li> It has totally boosted my hair care regimen to a whole other level!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> As for hair growth I cant really say it has helped me grow my hair because I&#x27;m currently using other products for that too.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m long transitioning from relaxed to natural</li>
            <li> especially the natural hair community use castor oil in particular Jamaican Black Castor oil, so I figured I may as well try it right&lt;</li>
            <li> My hair is long, wavy, and naturally frizzy.</li>
            <li> It stung like a bee at first, but after a few minutes, it was okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I been using this product for one month and it made my hair so thick and full.</li>
            <li> Every night I used BCO to my brows and within weeks my brows were so thick and full that amaze me.  </li>
            <li> Like most black castor oil it is very heavy.</li>
            <li> I live in dry southern Cali.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, it would weigh the hair down too much.  </li>
            <li> Still have it dont use much, weighs down hair.</li>
            <li> I use it to lay down my edges at night &amp; it has really helped my hair</li>
            <li> (note: I have very fine thin hair!)</li>
            <li> BUT  THEN I  DECIDED TO GET ONE( the same &amp;#34;tropic isles black castor oil &amp;#34;) FROM MY LOCAL HAIR STORE</li>
            <li> I needed this product to help regrow my hair and help maintain health due to the use of my high blood pressure medicine.</li>
            <li> an odd odor, smells very musky.</li>
            <li> I really like the black castor oil.</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor oil works really well for locks  </li>
            <li> Have to say that I&#x27;m really liking the black castor oil.  </li>
            <li> Also, I do suffer with dry, sensitive scalp issues as well.</li>
            <li> I use and like this oil as a hair treatment, but frankly can&#x27;t find much difference between this type and the stuff from India that I buy from my online health food provider costing a lot less.  </li>
            <li> my hair also has less breakage and its sooooooooo much softer.</li>
            <li> so I normally mix it with shea butter or with other oils for a moisturizing spray.</li>
            <li> In a few minutes I was able to go back to sleep, no more pain.</li>
            <li> It is also good on my dry cuticles and feet in this cold chafing weather.</li>
            <li> Positive results in a few short weeks.  </li>
            <li> The bottle looks small, but it does go a long way, and I still have more than half, although I do use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> and I find it hard to apply and even harder to wash out, and it limps on me (medium length wavy fine hair)</li>
            <li> I am really amazed at how fast this oil worked to regrow my edges-I now have thick edges!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I have very dry and brittle natural hair.  </li>
            <li> it was what i ordered but the smell was a little much.</li>
            <li> Within the 3 months my edges have completely grown back and the dry scalp no longer exists!</li>
            <li> After few months I swear by this and other natural oils, and I&#x27;m the type of person who normally scoffs at natural</li>
            <li> Upon first use I put way too much on my hair (not good)!</li>
            <li> I read that Jamaican oil was better than others, and maybe it really is, but the smell is so bad</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell good or bad to me and since it&#x27;s mixed into a hair dressing when I apply it, I don&#x27;t smell it afterward in my or my daughter&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t really describe the smell accurately...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just not a good one either.&lt;br /&gt;Very</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is thick so requires some effort  but worth it.</li>
            <li> I have a high sensitivity to smell and the Jamaican black castor oil is tolerable.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve even started applying small drops of it on my 15 month old daughter&#x27;s hair 3x a week after nightly baths and her hair has been growing in thick, curly and strong.</li>
            <li> My dry itchy scalp has calmed down and my natural hair is left soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I tried it in a few scalp oil recipes, hoping that adding it in small amounts to carrier oils would diminish the strong scent.</li>
            <li> I personally feel a little bit of a tingle, and mainly blood rushing to my scalp.</li>
            <li> however it&#x27;s not sticky just really thick and penetrates right into the scalp.</li>
            <li> read online about the benefits of pure, raw castor oil when it comes to hair and eyebrow growth, so I decided to give this product a shot.</li>
            <li> Besides that, I don&#x27;t notice anything different about this oil as opposed to the other natural oils for the hair.</li>
            <li> Also, stays on the hair a long time and does not dry out hair.</li>
            <li> I did ALOT of research mainly for natural THICK hair growth and REgrowth (edges/nape) products</li>
            <li> I always get huge bumps that inflame and itch pretty bad, lasting for days.</li>
            <li> This castor oil is CLEAR, like all other castor oils.</li>
            <li> It keeps the hair extremely moisturized, which is a necessity for natural hair.  </li>
            <li> On the other hand, my daughter&#x27;s hair is natural and I use it on her hair which has become thicker and healthier with no adverse effects.</li>
            <li> Along with other products I believe this has aided in my natural hair&#x27;s health and growth.  </li>
            <li> Therefore, a little bit really does go a long way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> but no I can&#x27;t live without my Jamaican black castor</li>
            <li> Last week I had decided to go back to using this oil and saw immediate results of soft, moisturized hair and less hair shedding.</li>
            <li> The relaxed hair was past my shoulders when I started this process, and I don&#x27;t intend to do a big chop, but use a keratin strengthening process that has been working really well.  </li>
            <li> My hair is now growing back faster than it has ever done in the past and feels much healthier and thicker.</li>
            <li> Being that I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to see a noticeable difference I only rated it 4 stars.</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a big change in hair growth.</li>
            <li> but that smell is only initially and doesn&#x27;t linger long.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing that gives me long term relief  update: coming back to edit my profile.</li>
            <li> The oil is pretty good for the hair, but terrible for the scalp.</li>
            <li> Fortunately I&#x27;m not taking a tablespoon full everyday like my Grandmother had to as a kid.</li>
            <li> Especially for Natural Black hair</li>
            <li> Castor oil is clear, the dark bottle is deceiving.</li>
            <li> but you have to take in consideration of using things in moderation and not going overboard because you want fast hair growth.</li>
            <li> I relax my hair and I usually relax it every 2 or 2 1/2 months because that&#x27;s how fast it grows.</li>
            <li> but you have to take in consideration of using things in moderation and not going overboard because you want fast hair growth.</li>
            <li> I relax my hair and I usually relax it every 2 or 2 1/2 months because that&#x27;s how fast it grows.</li>
            <li> I xan only imagine how long my hair will be after using it for 6 months...</li>
            <li> But it was falling out in long pieces with the white part at the end.</li>
            <li> It took me two hours to flat iron my hair today.</li>
            <li> Long lasting product.</li>
            <li> but it doesn&#x27;t last too long after applied to hair.</li>
            <li> because it is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I was expecting something good from this oil but got disappointed.</li>
            <li> The oil is pretty thick and smells like ashes, but nothing you can&#x27;t deal with.  </li>
            <li> The oil is pretty thick and smells like sesame oil.</li>
            <li> So my new regimen is that I put the emu oil on my edges and brush just a little bit of the castor oil through the rest of my hair, concentrating on the ends, and then I wrap it.</li>
            <li> My new growth is thicker and my hair did grow a little bit faster.</li>
            <li> YOU really must mix other oils with it to bring the stickiness down to 0.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for about one year &amp; it has been very hard for me to find products that aid in african american hair especially being natural.</li>
            <li> If you are new to JBCO, here&#x27;s a few things you might want to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;1.</li>
            <li> One bottle last very long time.</li>
            <li> this Product was no where near BLACK</li>
            <li> (I have low porosity hair that tend to be dry)</li>
            <li> (I have low porosity hair that tend to be dry)</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil is a must for natural hair.</li>
            <li> Brittle and dry hair are very big issues when transitioning..</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had heard rave reviews about it on natural Black hair websites, and I&#x27;d also heard what it can do for your skin.</li>
            <li> I only use this as a remedy for dry skin, and exzema.</li>
            <li> In the back, she had some hair, but it was ragged and all different lengths and felt rough.  </li>
            <li> It moisturises my edges very well especially since its thick.</li>
            <li> id this nights weekly and after only 2 weeks I saw thick black new growth even in thinning and balding areas in my scalp!!!!  </li>
            <li> I have not noticed anything positive or negative.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive, especially considering how little you get (and compared to how much lwil maskriti you could get for the same price), but it works just fine.  </li>
            <li> I have natural hair and my edges were thinning from a hairstyle that I had that was too tight</li>
            <li> previous to this product i purchased dr. adorable but their prices are ridiculous for the product (peppermint black castor oil) and shipping.</li>
            <li> I have also mixed with other oils like coconut and/or jojoba when using as co-wash, deep conditioning, or with leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li> I like to mix it with other oils so that it can last longer, like extra vrigin olive oil and vitiamin E oil.</li>
            <li> It was also more expensive than the regular oil for less product.</li>
            <li> so, it&#x27;s a little too early to tell if it will help with growing my hair around my temples</li>
            <li> It makes the hair soft and the scalp a little greasy, but I have not seen any growth.  </li>
            <li> What it does do is make my hair soft and shiny and scalp less dry..</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, but I don&#x27;t use it anymore because the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> I think that this product is possibly too heavy for thin, fine hair.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a small cute bottle and very thick when I touched it.</li>
            <li> be careful to not get it on clothes, it&#x27;s pretty hard to get the stain out.</li>
            <li> I mostly use in the winter to protect my hair from the cold</li>
            <li> Also, using my sulfate free shampoos, I had a difficult time removing the product.</li>
            <li> Also this one isn&#x27;t cold pressed, which is the better way of extracting the oil.</li>
            <li> As far as hair growth I&#x27;m not really sure yet as it&#x27;s only been around two weeks....</li>
            <li> There are a few things I want to clear up about this product.</li>
            <li> Completely NOT satisfy at all.  </li>
            <li> This oil is probably just helping to keep my lashes soft with all the mascara that I use everyday.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a long time user of castor oil</li>
            <li> It has a smokey burnt wood smell, but it doesn&#x27;t stay for that long once applied to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I thought that I could swallow anything as long as it&#x27;s helpful.  </li>
            <li> I leave this on for 24 hours or as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I ended up leaving the braids in for too long so there was buildup</li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used this item that long to see any effects jbco may have on me.</li>
            <li> The &#x27;smoky&#x27; smell doesn&#x27;t hang around long after application.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not particularly sensitive to smells and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smells</li>
            <li> ki did notice i was getting minor headaches though</li>
            <li> Girlfriend said bottle was smaller than expected</li>
            <li> While the smell turns some people off, as with quite a few natural oils, it&#x27;s benefits cannot be denied.</li>
            <li> but hey long as it works I can deal with the smell..</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen much breakage but it will thicken the hair, if you already have thick hair I would use sparingly.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a lil thick and the mell doesn&#x27;t bother me much</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have thin hair at all, I also rarely get greasy hair.</li>
            <li> Did I mention how SLOW my hair growth rate really is?</li>
            <li> She is 82 years years and last summer, had hardly any hair left in the front--not just the roots but the whole front of her head up to her ears had maybe 1/2  inch or less of hair remaining.  </li>
            <li> I would not recommend it for those with relaxed African American hair (unless you want your hair to feel weighed down).</li>
            <li> I notice my usually dry, thin hair is now thicker, fuller and more hydrated since I&#x27;ve been using this product the past couple weeks.</li>
            <li> I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil -</li>
            <li> I only recently learned of the benefits of Black Castor Oil</li>
            <li> This is good for mixing with other hair products, to give it that extra oil base.</li>
            <li> And in between I usually get about 4 or so inches of new growth.</li>
            <li> And in between I usually get about 4 or so inches of new growth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it grew new hair which I needed</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t just use it by itself, I mix It with some of my other oils because I don&#x27;t really like the thickness of it..</li>
            <li> I like that consistancy that help other oils add moisture to the skin especially in winter weather and season.  </li>
            <li> I have mixed other oils like unrefined avocado oil</li>
            <li> I usua get this at my local beauty store this product is a little watery not the same</li>
            <li> After a month&#x27;s (morning and evening) use around my edges, that feel out due to styling, my hair has GROWN BACK !</li>
            <li> grown out my hair especially where I needed it in the nape and other thinning areas</li>
            <li> Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.  </li>
            <li> It smells a little weird, almost like bacon grease, the lavender version may be a better choice.</li>
            <li> I have already purchased this product twice and will keep getting it for as long as Amazon sells it!</li>
            <li> Mix this with other essential oils to add lustor to your mositerizings.</li>
            <li> Even though I already have long hair, I can wait to see if it helps with growth!</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend mixing it with other oils though</li>
            <li> I would purchase again and the next time may dilute it with other oils.</li>
            <li> I mixed it with other oils and used it each night.</li>
            <li> I use it to steam my hair twice a month and use a mixture of this and tropic isle living red pimento growth oil to oil my hair every other day...</li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t seen anything differently happen in comparison to me using my other hair oils.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using very long</li>
            <li> my edges were starting to thin because of the constant wig wearing, but this product truly is a live saver.</li>
            <li> I have dry brittle hair and have been using coconut oil for years.</li>
            <li> for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Works on eyebrows and eyelashes</li>
            <li> It did help to relieve my dry, itchy scalp</li>
            <li> It made my hair crunchy and dry.</li>
            <li> I used to have really dry ends</li>
            <li> The ends of my hair are no longer dry.</li>
            <li> my hair is not longer dry.</li>
            <li> 3Chair thats really dry</li>
            <li> I have african-american relaxed hair that is damaged and dry.</li>
            <li> I use it on my ends as well when they are dry.  </li>
            <li> and i recommend this to anyone who has dry scalp issues</li>
            <li> It also works on any dry skin patches and as a cuticle softener and hand lotion.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my dry hands and it is healing.</li>
            <li> I was so fed up with my hair being dry, and not retaining any length.</li>
            <li> For 8 yrs until last summer, I would keep my hair braided back-to-back with a few days of hair rest (yea yea yea, that&#x27;s pretty bad) and on top of that, my hair was probably never healthy.</li>
            <li> I no longer suffer from dry scalp.</li>
            <li> My scalp use to be so dry.  </li>
            <li> It will also prevent hair breakages, dandruff, eczema and dry, itchy scalp.</li>
            <li> I still use it to oil my scalp when it is dry and itchy.  </li>
            <li> I have really dry hair</li>
            <li> Dry, achy, swollen feet from running around all day?</li>
            <li> I purchased this JBCO in February because I had extremely dry skin around the edges of my hairline, which lead to balding spots.</li>
            <li> All came back after a few weeks of daily message in places that were thinning</li>
            <li> The main reason I bought it was for my hair and my hair is thick and my edges have grown.</li>
            <li> Its super thick!!</li>
            <li> My hair was only about a inch long when I had started using it and after just a month my hair was reaching down almost to the tip of my nose.</li>
            <li> always go to style single</li>
            <li> and I have natural dark coloured jet black hair and it has help the shine in the hair.</li>
            <li> has an odd smell and is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I had seen previous post where people complained of the smell and was hesistant to buy it at first.  </li>
            <li> I bought this product since I usually like going natural.</li>
            <li> For the ppl that complained about it, you have to change your whole hair regimen and being balanced in other aspects of your life to see change.</li>
            <li> I expected an unpleasant odor, but not at all, it smells fine!</li>
            <li> if you you have loose edges</li>
            <li> I like it, especially on my edges to help lay them down.</li>
            <li> but that stopped when i mixed the oil with another oil to break it down so to speak.i</li>
            <li> NEEDS TO BE MIXED WITH SOMETHING OR ONLY USE A LITTLE BIT!</li>
            <li> A little of this (dime size) goes a long way, and if much isn&#x27;t in the hair then the hair won&#x27;t feel heavy or weighed down at all.</li>
            <li> A little definitely goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Use small amount while hair is wet and allow hair to dry naturally.  </li>
            <li> Although this oil can also regrow one&#x27;s hair, I don&#x27;t recommend using this particular product just because the bottle is VERY small, and hence it would be a bit</li>
            <li> My daughter used it, but I&#x27;m not sure yet if the new growth was mainly due to need for retouch of relaxer..</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low to find something to thicken my hair i have been using this product for approximately  two weeks</li>
            <li> However, sometimes our (African American) hair do not grow the average due to damage, genetics, and other factors.</li>
            <li> Thick but manageable new growth coming in</li>
            <li> As other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s pretty thick, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I researched the reason and the only reason I could find was that my hair was not very strong</li>
            <li> It does have an odd smell to it, which doesn&#x27;t bother me as I only wear it at home.</li>
            <li> I have black hair and the next morning</li>
            <li> I simply added some of this Tropical Isle Living Jamaican Black Castor Oil (JBCO) to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d only put up to 6 drops though for such a small bottle.  </li>
            <li> I had a dime sized area with out hair for 3 years related to a half wig that rub the area bald.</li>
            <li> I tried it on dry hair as well as wet hair, but it did nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have only been using this product for about a month and a half.</li>
            <li> I finally made the decision to purchase a bottle of Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li> I always mixed it with other oils and conditioner when using on hair, and other oils when using on scalp.</li>
            <li> , they are only half there.</li>
            <li> i just use regular for the black color.</li>
            <li> It has help with my edges that was stressed from braiding and the middle of my head.&lt;br /&gt;The smell which I know was a big issue for some I think is highly over exaggerated.</li>
            <li> I have very dry skin</li>
            <li> I have very dry scalp</li>
            <li> I have thyroid disease, which makes my hair very dry and brittle, I have tried everything you can imagine, glycerine, coconut oil.</li>
            <li> have hair that is naturally very dry.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item almost 2 months ago and let me tell you, my hair is full of volume, my alopecia patch is nearly all covered with hair, my curls are slowly coming back and my hair feels extremely thick!!!</li>
            <li> Although i didnt use it long i didnt notice any of the results other womer seemed to be getting.</li>
            <li> It really protects it from the cold New York winters.</li>
            <li> no growth in years so far for the brows there is a few sprouts, slight but there.</li>
            <li> I had hair down my back, but my teenage son was killed in an auto accident and all of my hair fell out stress and meds to cope.</li>
            <li> It does exactly what it says my eyebrows were very thin by me plucking them constantly.  </li>
            <li> Then I started using it twice a week and not putting so much in such a little time on my hair and scalp and no itching.</li>
            <li> So you really only want to put a little on your hair unless you like that mucky feel and look.</li>
            <li> you have to give it a little extra help as you age.</li>
            <li> I only used little dabs 1-2 times a week since it makes the hair look oily</li>
            <li> /&gt;You only need a little bit once a week or so.  </li>
            <li> Anyway it came on time and was a little smaller than I envisioned</li>
            <li> I taught her to finger comb only and also to use a little protein on her ends about once a month, after she washed.</li>
            <li> I use this regularly by applying a little on my fingertips &amp; massaging onto my scalp maybe 2 times a week</li>
            <li> Being Jamaican myself, I&#x27;ve been using this specific brand and product since I was little</li>
            <li> this oil is very thick and coats the hair very well.</li>
            <li> This oil has a very thick texture so you will want to be gentle when rubbing it in your hair or else</li>
            <li> Very thick, and not liking the smell very muc .</li>
            <li> Use it in a mixture of other oils to keep my skin moisturized during this dry winter months.</li>
            <li> Very thick, smells weird, does keep my scalp nicely moisturized and prevents dandruff.</li>
            <li> Also my hair was a little thin around the temples and it&#x27;s grown back much thicker.</li>
            <li> I massage a little on my scalp mixed with some peppermint  essential oil (few drops) and burdock root oil (which I also bought on Amazon.com)</li>
            <li> I massage a little on my scalp mixed with some peppermint  essential oil (few drops) and burdock root oil (which I also bought on Amazon.com)</li>
            <li> Only draw back is it&#x27;s a little heavy.</li>
            <li> But to me it wasn&#x27;t a bad smell or overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I do love that it doesn&#x27;t have a bad ordor.</li>
            <li> lol, Some of you may think that is so disgusting</li>
            <li> I apply I t on at least 4 times everyday and it&#x27;s really growing my hair where I have bald spots.</li>
            <li> I only use a bit on each temple so it should last at least 2 months.</li>
            <li> I put a tiny amount in a bowl, add few drops of coconut/olive oil to ensure it can penetrate the scalp, dip my fingers into the mixture and massage it into my scalp.</li>
            <li> and then it is harder to wash off.</li>
            <li> , I have only had this product for a few days)&lt;br</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed growth per se, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks.</li>
            <li> Only been using a few days so</li>
            <li> it is what I expected</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s working as expected.</li>
            <li> To cut the story short you must apply a Green drink (vegetable &amp; fruit) to your regiments.</li>
            <li> I have also tired castor oil on my eyebrows and my sideburns and it made them much thicker.</li>
            <li> , I will get back with you in a few months</li>
            <li> My NOW oils lasted me an entire year but this oil was gone after a few months.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected .</li>
            <li> Thicker than expected .</li>
            <li> Of course, I shed a few tears but tears don&#x27;t make your hair grow back</li>
            <li> work be careful</li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not really convinced about miracle growth products.</li>
            <li> It helped some but not much.</li>
            <li> ( I have thin, very prone to breakage hair. )</li>
            <li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> /&gt;shipping was just as expected would purchase again</li>
            <li> Would be careful when pouring it out of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It really is no joke.</li>
            <li> It really is no joke.</li>
            <li> You just have to be careful not to overdue it with this oil.  </li>
            <li> This item came on time as expected.</li>
            <li> Part my hair in wide sections at bedtime as needed fordryness.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few months ago and finally got around to trying it,after about 2 weeks</li>
            <li> I recommend this product to anyone who is curious.</li>
            <li> I put this on once a day for a few months, and my brows grew back and got thicker (yay)</li>
            <li> I have also used it on my eyelashes (careful with that</li>
            <li> be careful when traveling</li>
            <li> I do not see any changes in my hair even after a few months later.</li>
            <li> But be careful.</li>
            <li> Every morning when I wake up, or after I shower, I have a lot of white flakes in my eyebrow region that I spend about 20-30 minutes everyday in the bathroom roughly cleaning with my comb.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for too long, the product smell is barely noticeable, slightly thick consistency.</li>
            <li> /&gt;While I&#x27;ve always had thick hair to begin with, my edges were another story completely.</li>
            <li> The only problem is that it&#x27;s so thick, so I can only apply two days or so before I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li> If you have short hair, use much less; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> When I used it while my hair was wet, it eliminated the need for other moisturizing products, and I just put a little shea butter on my ends to hold my double strand twists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have dark brown hair that I was recently thinking about dying black, but there was no need after using this product.</li>
            <li> Also with this oil, a little goes a long way, so unless you want a greased up head of hair only use a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> Also, the other reason I got this stuff was to regrow out my fairly thin edges on the left near my temple...</li>
            <li> I find the texture not as sticky and heavy as the other regular castor oil I have.</li>
            <li> My hair is black and long.</li>
            <li> I know a thing or two about growing black hair long.</li>
            <li> I apply it every other day directly to the scalp which results in thick and moisture locked hair.</li>
            <li> Seriously if this product worked wouldn&#x27;t it be recognized by the entire world and be on the front page of a medical magazine?  </li>
            <li> I have always had thick long natural hair but recently from using the flat iron a lot, my hair started to thin out at the ends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very expensive for daily use and really trashes the exisiting hair you have, especially if it&#x27;s longer.</li>
            <li> well i think you are suppose to put it on wet hair because i put it on dry hair and it was just a mess.</li>
            <li> It goes in a little thick, so it&#x27;s a bit hard to spread evenly (somebody here suggested mixing it with a tad of olive oil), or just spread a tiny bit in your palms and gently rub it in your hair...</li>
            <li> It did seem to make my hair slightly less dry and shiner.</li>
            <li> Strange I have reviewed this at least three tomes, maybe my opinions are going back to Jamaica?</li>
            <li> As for hair growth, its not soley responsible for long and flowing hair (sorry ladies, its not).</li>
            <li> I am really pleased with this product, I hate that I waited so long to try it.</li>
            <li> This coats the lashes and the oil naturally and slowly drips down to the lash line.</li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way on my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a really long way.  </li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Like I said a little does go a long way, so</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and face a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It is quite oily, so a little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> A little goes a long way with this product, it is quite thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> a little go a long way with this product</li>
            <li> I will continue to use this product a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I have very thick, coily, dense, often dry, natural AA hair.</li>
            <li> but instead I was left with dull, dry lookinh hair.</li>
            <li> WHY OH WHY did it take me so long to purchase?!!!!  </li>
            <li> I really like the Jamaican black castor oil, it has helped in areas of my hair that was really thin.</li>
            <li> so i order the peppermint essential order separately and this brand of black castor oil and keep a few coins in the bank.</li>
            <li> I do recommend getting the bigger bottle and the drop dispenser for less messy applications...</li>
            <li> I found the odor light and not at all unpleasant.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and fuller at the roots but thats not good for the rest of your hair.</li>
            <li> All I ever get nowadays is just one or two small white flakes that aren&#x27;t embedded in my skin -</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m not sure of the same effects</li>
            <li> I mix it with other oils (jojoba etc.)  </li>
            <li> must have oil forget the other oils.</li>
            <li> The next week I put the oil on my hair as usual, but I decided to put some on my scalp.  </li>
            <li> The smell is nutty, and it mixes well with other products.</li>
            <li> I use this product every other day.</li>
            <li> Im using a mixture of almond oil, coconut oil, JBCO, argan oil, tea tree oil, peppermint oil for GHE every other night or so.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Maybe I will use if for other ailments as recommended.</li>
            <li> My hair is extremely longer, thicker and healthier.  </li>
            <li> In the process I tried other products and ummmm no no ... does not compare.  </li>
            <li> I use it in a mixture of other oils for my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to mix with some other oils to apply to my hair.</li>
            <li> Therefor I mix it with other oils like olive, rosemary and vitamin e.</li>
            <li> , so I didn&#x27;t mix it with any other hair conditioners or oils.  </li>
            <li> When I opened the bottle I smelled the oil, no smell hum, so I got a clear plastic spoon to compare my cold press Castor oil to this oil and guess what I found out, SURPRISE to me, they are one in the same, I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference from where one started and the other left off.</li>
            <li> I wished I had read some of the other one star ratings before I bought this.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this at first, what with it being talked about like</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m gunna try and mix with Another other oil</li>
            <li> and I oil my scalp once every other day.</li>
            <li> and I just haven&#x27;t implemented yet, but I will start using for other things as well.  </li>
            <li> other thing:</li>
            <li> I used this with some other tropic isle products and the combo seems to be working wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I would recommend using this every other day.</li>
            <li> Use it with other oils.</li>
            <li> I had no problems with shedding like I have read in other reviews.</li>
            <li> So next morning I rinse my hair as usual</li>
            <li> the other reviews said.</li>
            <li> I oil my scalp with this &amp; other products together, and I can tell the difference in the thickness of my hair from this summer til now.</li>
            <li> Maybe it could be the amount other apply???</li>
            <li> What happen if i mix it with other oils and shea butter ..</li>
            <li> I purchased this because my edges were thinning due to braids and after pregnancy shedding.  </li>
            <li> I would&#x27;nt recommend it to someone that&#x27;s not willing to wait for it to do</li>
            <li> I only gave this 3 stars because I am not sure about it&#x27;s stimulation for hair growth yet.</li>
            <li> I mix it with other oils, put it in my conditioner as well as use it by itself.</li>
            <li> 4 stars due to smell.</li>
            <li> &quot; I wear a weave and refused to look any other time.</li>
            <li> I purchase from the store but, was buying other things and throw this in the cart also.</li>
            <li> MIXES WITH OTHER PRODUCTS WELL.</li>
            <li> I now mix it with other oils</li>
            <li> and I also have extreme thinning at my crown and my temples that I was going to target with the oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about to get my braids soon due to the warmer weather</li>
            <li> Get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> I used it in my hair with other oils and would use it again.</li>
            <li> And at night after I cleanse, I use a small drop of the oil as a facial moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My hair was starting to get very dry and look dull.  </li>
            <li> I literally had no hairline after tight weaves and heavy braids, now my hairline is back n</li>
            <li> A little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> It made my hair very rough.</li>
            <li> The smell is very minimal and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
            <li> &amp; after I&#x27;m finished I place my satin bonnet on my hair, I also use it on my twist outs with other oils &amp; creams I&#x27;ve noticed less tangles as well as less single strand knots since adding the product to my regimen</li>
            <li> The bad smell is strong and I can&#x27;t use it.  </li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but still a bit strong.</li>
            <li> my hairs are still dry and still losing them everyday</li>
            <li> I mixed it with coconut oil to thin it out a bit , and greased my entire scalp.</li>
            <li> And hey, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you&#x27;ve only wasted a few bucks.</li>
            <li> It makes my natural hair soft and tames my crazy curls.  </li>
            <li> My normally thick hair was damaged pretty badly after a bad coloring and after using this for 2 weeks with the Jamaucan Black Castor Oil Protein Hair Conditioner I noticed a great improvement.</li>
            <li> The only slight problem I had was a small amount of leakage when shipped.</li>
            <li> I washed my hair, added leave in conditioner, then applied a little black castor oil to my hair while still damp, let it air dry</li>
            <li> I like to use it in conjunction with other oils to tone down the uniqueness of it&#x27;s smell.  </li>
            <li> Let me say this product lays your hair down unlike any other.</li>
            <li> In the past I have had facial acne due to hair products, so I am a little</li>
            <li> Due to the castor oil being so thick, I literally use just a tiny dab on my face.</li>
            <li> just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve purchased Jamaican Black Caster Oil from other companies and did not have this problem.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference but nothing extreme</li>
            <li> first time using you may be a little skeptical because of the thickness</li>
            <li> Started using it and have sen major growth in the past few months!</li>
            <li> I never knew my hair was so dark and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I noticed because it came in gray, and my hair was dyed dark brown.  </li>
            <li> I just want to say that this was not a shot in the dark.</li>
            <li> The only negative is the smell</li>
            <li> The 4 oz only negative aspect of this item.</li>
            <li> My edges are back and thick now</li>
            <li> To some it smells like someone behind, to me it smells like old ash trays.</li>
            <li> I only apply this 1 or 2 times a week because it is so thick.</li>
            <li> I used it briefly but found it too thick, gummy and smelly.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my hair thick when I&#x27;m using it.</li>
            <li> The oil is thick and smells similar to coffee beans.</li>
            <li> My dead ends are no longer dead and dry looking.</li>
            <li> but when I started using the Jamaican Black Castor oil, a month later my hair had grown in sooooo thick in my crown.  </li>
            <li> but I don&#x27;t mind it because I don&#x27;t have to worry about it running down my face and neck after application.</li>
            <li> Now when I started using it down then I could smell it and it smelled like ashes.</li>
            <li> After using this I poured the hair store bottle down the drain</li>
            <li> never let&#x27;s me down....</li>
            <li> WHEN I TAKE THESE BRAIDS DOWN</li>
            <li> I apply to my scalp the evening before I go to get my hair wash; I wrap it or tie it down with a scarf, go to asleep.</li>
            <li> I rub the oil on and they go down within 20 minutes, no itching, no redness.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It does have a smell that could be somewhat unwelcomed, but you can mask it with an oil of your choice to tone it down.</li>
            <li> It lays my hair down after I apply it I wear my silk scarf.</li>
            <li> and I mix it with other oils!</li>
            <li> I mean I don&#x27;t have coarse hair to begin with it</li>
            <li> its very thick not watery like the ones you see in kroger or sallys,the smell is a little smokey and its dark clear</li>
            <li> and I know that on average hair grows up to a half of an inch a month</li>
            <li> /&gt;After I wash my hair, I let it air dry and then lather a small amount throughout.</li>
            <li> No more dry brittle ends.</li>
            <li> I even apply a little on a q-tip and very carefully apply on my lashes.</li>
            <li> I used to use a Latisse knockoff, so they were still long, but my eyelashes have stayed long and lush with Jamaican Black Castor Oil, which is a lot less expensive and doesn&#x27;t sting!</li>
            <li> My hair is much stronger and once again very thick, so thick i couldn&#x27;t comb my hair.</li>
            <li> I read that it is made from ashes &amp; there is a slight ashy aroma.</li>
            <li> I would not recommend this for black hair.</li>
            <li> Hope they give me my money back for the 2 bottles I bought from them, next time ill stick to my lavender jamaican black castor oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard about this type of Jamaican Black Castor Oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jamaican Black Castro Oil for a month now and my hair continues to grow inches.</li>
            <li> I apply this black castor oil to my temples, outer edges, and ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> is jamaican black castor oil.</li>
            <li> I advise everyone out there to try this product you will not be dissappointed because it delivers everytime,thanks jamaican black castor oil.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with black soap and use witch hazel as a toner and this black castor oil as a moisturizer and this has solved my combination to oily skin.</li>
            <li> I also notice within 24 hours, it dries out and purges black and whiteheads   </li>
            <li> I previously used this on my hair</li>
            <li> I even tried the inversion method for a couple days, maybe saw a 1/2&#x27; difference but braided my hair half way through the week.</li>
            <li> It also isn&#x27;t actually black.</li>
            <li> Black Castrol works it works.  </li>
            <li> It is has been a year since I started using Black Castrol Oil</li>
            <li> I never knew about black castor oil until I read it on Thirsty Roots.</li>
            <li> And it does not sting the eyes, or cause the slight skin discoloration that Latisse did.</li>
            <li> I just hope by summer my slight bald issues will be mended.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after doing a lot of research on the benefits of Jamaican black castor oil.</li>
            <li> Well I was hoping this was going to work out ordering this imposter Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  </li>
            <li> I have been using the Jamaican Black Castor Oil for about 3 weeks, and I can see a change in the thickness of my hair and also growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patricia,</li>
            <li> This Jamaican Black Castor Oil works wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> but it was much less lighter.</li>
            <li> I saw my eyelashes grow longer and thicker in less than a week.  </li>
            <li> However, I must say I also took advice of previous commenters by taking my biotins in conjunction.</li>
            <li> it is reason I have slightly balding on my edge(s).</li>
            <li> Less shedding and growth of about an inch.</li>
            <li> I gave her half of the bottle and niether one of us have been in pain.  </li>
            <li> Seller and educated him on BLACK CASTOR OIL he than instructed me to call the number printed on the label called this So called PHONY Tropic Isle Living</li>
            <li> and they said Black Castor Oil is indeed dk brown to black color..</li>
            <li> I bought the Tropic Isle Living Jamaican Black Castor Oil (4 ounces) about two weeks ago.</li>
            <li> Along comes the black castor oil.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;m going to give this black castor oil the credit.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ridiculous how stress can physically affect your body, isn&#x27;t</li>
            <li> Has a slight smell</li>
            <li> I decided to dye my hair a week and a half ago, to give my hair a POP.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the black castor oil yet, but bought it at the recommendation of a friend.</li>
            <li> I WANTED THE JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL AND RECEIVED THE SHAMPOO INSTEAD.....</li>
            <li> I have been using the JBCO for less than a week.</li>
            <li> The product have a slight smell</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used half of the product but have already reordered.</li>
            <li> My edges are thicker than ever, they were previously damaged from the over wear of wigs.</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sold that this is Jamaican black castor oil at all.</li>
            <li> but I still use this black caster oil with Oliver oil.</li>
            <li> This Black Castor Oil is the boom.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what black castor oil was until I read the reviews on Amazon while I was browsing for hair products.</li>
            <li> Once i started to used Jamaican Black Castor Oil, I saw improvement.</li>
            <li> I use Jamaican black castor oil on my hair.  </li>
            <li> Hair previously broken/</li>
            <li> At the end of that time I parted my hair and noticed that the thinning was less than it had been, and called my daughter over to verify, and she saw it too.  </li>
            <li> In order to see the results from the Black Castor Oil, you must be diligent and have patience.  </li>
            <li> A lot healthier and less addictive.&lt;br /&gt;Dry</li>
            <li> It has a slight, nutty scent that doesn&#x27;t linger in the hair at all.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s been less than a month</li>
            <li> I have less dandruff and use it on my scalp 3 times a week and on my edges.</li>
            <li> and I repeatedly ended up with Jamaican Black castor oil.</li>
            <li> The thickness will allow you to use less and still get the job done.</li>
            <li> And before my surgery my hair was long and thick down to my shoulders</li>
            <li> And before my surgery my hair was long and thick down to my shoulders</li>
            <li> Apply very very gently as you don&#x27;t want to remove your hair haphazardly in the process.</li>
            <li> THIS MESS</li>
            <li> I used this product for 2 weeks everyday and the area was dark with beginning hair growth.</li>
            <li> and this was my first disappointment.</li>
            <li> It makes your hair thick and long</li>
            <li> Had it for few months and not even 1/4 way down yet.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and please don&#x27;t ingest this, unless you want to pay homage to the porcelain god.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth on my edges that were destroyed in my teens wearing tight pony tails.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help regrow my temple hair, which was ripped out by tight, weave-enhanced cornrows.  </li>
            <li> I tend to have dry, ratty, dull hair...</li>
            <li> It is thick and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> This oil is thick, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> But what I got was plain Castor Oil in a dark brown bottle, can you say rip off.</li>
            <li> I dab a little bit of this oil on my hands, combined with a lightweight leave on hair conditioner.</li>
            <li> And just a little should cover your head.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little on the thicker side, however, I like that.</li>
            <li> Ive noticed a little growth with this as well.</li>
            <li> It took a little while to get used to the thickness of it</li>
            <li> Since this past summer,  I have been battling damaged hair due to protein overload from protein treatments, blow drying and coloring.</li>
            <li> I use this both as part as a treatment while sitting under a dryer, as well as putting a little on my scalp between washes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this ever since I was a little girl</li>
            <li> I mix a little of this with tea tree oil and apply to my eyebrows for thicker growth.</li>
            <li> The smell takes a little getting used to</li>
            <li> but they also grew a little</li>
            <li> This stuff is a little sticky like glue</li>
            <li> Hair growth took a little bit longer, but I could see and feel a difference within seven days.  </li>
            <li> my hair FEELS thicker and looks a little fuller</li>
            <li> it does have a little werid smell but nothing i can handle.</li>
            <li> I added lavendar oil because the smell was a little oily</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a little over a year</li>
            <li> It has a burnt smell that takes a little getting use to.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I also put this on my eyebrows for fullness and have friends that rub a little on their eyelashes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product every other night for the past two weeks</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky.</li>
            <li> I put it in a little applicator bottle and put it on scalp and on my hands to rub in my hair.  </li>
            <li> I am keeping this little bottle by my night stand and hope to never run out of it.</li>
            <li> I am not sure what all properties the other companies may have in their versions</li>
            <li> must use a little  oil</li>
            <li> but I wish it was a little quicker.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t expect much other than another oil treatment that I would try and probably put aside with the rest of my &#x27;so-so hair products&#x27; that I purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> This little bottle of oil has changed my life!night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and my eyelashes are getting thicker and a little longer</li>
            <li> i do see little growth,</li>
            <li> My little girl  has flaky scalp</li>
            <li> it smells a little like coffee to me</li>
            <li> I have seen little growth aroung my edges, but I am not gining up on it.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s nothing a little water can&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> &amp; I do see a little growth</li>
            <li> A little is all that is needed.  </li>
            <li> Caster oil has been used for a very, very long time for various health uses...and folk remedies..and the Caster seed is used to make the infamous poison Ricen..used in the Tokyo subway terrorism attack...</li>
            <li> it smells terrible since black castor oil is AMAZING for ALL hair types.</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference in how rapid my hair is growing as opposed to pre-JBCO, my hair seemed to be growing slowly but not steadily...</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t wait til 3 months down the road or even longer!</li>
            <li> I actually mix it with either EVOO or EVCO because it is VERY thick (like syrup).</li>
            <li> I have tried sevreal products to increase hair growth in the past with little to no success.</li>
            <li> Unless you really want your scalp to itch like crazy, I would recommend that you not purchase this product for your hair</li>
            <li> , I had damaged edges also some thinning do to years of poor hair care such as over processing, repeated heat styling.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re very short, and rather thin on the bottom lash line.</li>
            <li> I do not use this product everyday.  </li>
            <li> I bought it to increase hair growth in an uneven area.</li>
            <li> But for a few dollars figured why not.</li>
            <li> I added JBCO, Olive Oil Growth Oil (you can find at any drugstore it comes in a green bottle), Marracon Oil and a bit of water.</li>
            <li> Use a carrier oil if this is too heavy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been protective styling with a crochet - worn away of my trouble spots, and wigs.</li>
            <li> The oil must be too heavy.</li>
            <li> and I use it everyday on my hair, face and daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Had this for a few weeks</li>
            <li> I recommend for anyone with short hair and also thin hair....</li>
            <li> combined with me not wearig extensions for a few weeks</li>
            <li> waste of money, do nor recommend.</li>
            <li> I will update this review after a few weeks using the product.</li>
            <li> I do not seal my ends with this because it makes my hair so heavy.</li>
            <li> however I notice my thin areas from wearing closure gad start to come back before my GrO aut even came in.</li>
            <li> I use it on my daughter&#x27;s scalp and it takes away all dryness and doesn&#x27;t make her hair too heavy.</li>
            <li> the solution to that is warming it up in the microwave for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for few weeks now</li>
            <li> Will update in a few months, hope it works.</li>
            <li> This Jamaica Castro oil I use as a moisturizing oil for my hair and within a few days of using it, I could feel that the texture of my hair has improved.</li>
            <li> Now my hair is thin and back to bra length.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m waiting a few weeks until I measure the growth results of my hair and edges.</li>
            <li> It dissipates after a few seconds.  </li>
            <li> You can use this product 2 to 3 times a week vs everyday bc</li>
            <li> Plus, after a few minutes, the smell goes away.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24, and my hair had stopped growing a few months ago.</li>
            <li> Ive been using it for a few weeks now.</li>
            <li> What I have found that works is sealing with a heavy oil and baggying at night or during the day.</li>
            <li> The oil seems to absorb into the skin after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> That being said, for the people who are anti- oil or don&#x27;t like the feel of heavy oil,  this may not be the product for you    </li>
            <li> I massage into scalp, leave on for a few hours.</li>
            <li> At bedtime, I use an eyedropper and massage a few drops into my scalp every night.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it&#x27;s really heavy.</li>
            <li> I did not use everyday</li>
            <li> Plus, this was a bit messy for me.</li>
            <li> Ive used it for a child with patches of hair missing and it grew within a month.</li>
            <li> If you stop applying it on the lashes, they&#x27;ll go back to being thin.</li>
            <li> castor oil into them for a few minutes, and then put on cotton gloves and socks.</li>
            <li> put some on my sister and she saw results within a few days</li>
            <li> My hair was broken off in the back a few years ago because of exercise and keeping my hair in a ponytail while I did it.</li>
            <li> Still not a huge fan</li>
            <li> I am AA with SLOW growing 4b hair so slow I can scream, I&#x27;ve mixed this product with pepppermint oil</li>
            <li> Even using small dime sized amounts my hair was weighed down and sticky.</li>
            <li> i started using it on the section of my hair that was naturally thin and fine and it has mad it thicker, i also use it to help regrow my mothers edges it</li>
            <li> Because of this product, I no longer have to spend half an hour in the bathroom combing my eyebrow region bare of ugly, white skin flakes in the morning or after a shower.</li>
            <li> I mix it with my other essential oils to thin it out because it is so thick.  </li>
            <li> I am not sure what makes it black though.</li>
            <li> Jamaican black castor oil is my holy frail and I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> THAT THIS IS NOT AUTHENTIC BLACK CASTOR OIL.</li>
            <li> and I see some improvement very thick oil a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I massaged it every other day in the areas with bald spots for at least 30 or so days</li>
            <li> I mix it with other oils because its sooo thick.</li>
            <li> As all other castor oils, it is thick and viscous.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s extremely thick and it doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as other oils do.</li>
            <li> This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.   </li>
            <li> The product is thick as other reviews have indicated but I like that b/c</li>
            <li> ISNT AS THICK AS OTHER HAIR FOOD OIL.</li>
            <li> I like the consistency: not to liquidy yet not to stiff like grease.</li>
            <li> I used to use plain castor oil</li>
            <li> All I ever got out of it was dry, ratty, dull and OILY-looking hair!</li>
            <li> As for the smell it is not strong and bothersome in anyway.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 3 or 4 months to fill in small thin areas around my edges.  </li>
            <li> However, I must warn you that this stuff itches like crazy if it left on the scalp for too long.</li>
            <li> It helps tame my frizzy hair.</li>
            <li> Anyone have some other suggestions cause this one is epic FAIL!</li>
            <li> Watch out for the smell because it smells pretty bad.</li>
            <li> It slow down the shedding, I&#x27;m still waiting on it to thickening my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was thick and down to my waist.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, medium/coarse textured curly hair, that can be rough, frizzy, dull, you name it.</li>
            <li> cant even give it a chance to see if it works or not smells like hot butt, totally wasted my money :(</li>
            <li> I also use it on my eyelashes and around my eyes for my night moisturizer, as well as for blemishes, dry cracked skin, cuts, burns, it is an all purpose beauty secret.  </li>
            <li> This little bottle of oil has changed my life!</li>
            <li> My hair is very soft, moisturized, and growing like crazy.</li>
            <li> hair was very thin, dead, and had multiple split ends after using this product</li>
            <li> I noticed New hair growing on the crown of my head where I had previous damage from a bad home bleach job.</li>
            <li> Rub a little bit on your scalp Preferably twice a day, if you cant at least once at night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> A little thick</li>
            <li> its a little thick like all castor oils</li>
            <li> there is very little if any.</li>
            <li> I was worried about the amount being to small, but product is concentrated and very little is needed to do the job.</li>
            <li> Putting too much JBCO on my scalp and hair and let me tell you it was itching so bad that week until I washed it out.</li>
            <li> This stuff really smells bad.</li>
            <li> Not because this is a bad product, it isn&#x27;t it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair.</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition called seborrhea dermatitis that I&#x27;ve dealt with for the past four to five years.</li>
            <li> I apply a small amount twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, with a q-tip.</li>
            <li> I used this product in the past and stopped for whatever reason, and now I remember why.</li>
            <li> Once I washed it out there was no more itching.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews</li>
            <li> and It just didn&#x27;t want to return to its natural state even after cutting it...</li>
            <li> I usually use shea butter</li>
            <li> Well I saw a before and after youtube video about Caster Oil and this girl used it for about 8 months for her eye brows that she had plucked excessively.</li>
            <li> some days I got lazy and skipped the morning</li>
            <li> Not sure about all the claims to grow your hair though.</li>
            <li> the only thing is that its so expensive.</li>
            <li> In the past, I tried a growth product on my lashes that made them grow</li>
            <li> brand is \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; than the castor oils I&#x27;ve used in the past.  </li>
            <li> It keeps my hair thick and moisturized and my hair has already grown a few inches!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and i have been using it on and off for the past month at night.</li>
            <li> I put an small amount in my finger and give a 3 minutes massage in the scalp</li>
            <li> I have alopecia, it hasn&#x27;t cured the slick spot in my hair, but it has helped with the thinning along my edges.  </li>
            <li> Once you get past the smell</li>
            <li> It was an unbelievable change.  </li>
            <li> so I&#x27;m not sure if the oil worked or not.</li>
            <li> It does leave a smokey smell but its not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of this at home, once I finsh with it I am not sure I will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I have alopecia and not sure if this helped or provided any benefit to me.  </li>
            <li> I am seeing results after a few weeks of using!</li>
            <li> Not sure if it helps regrow thinning hair yet as I just got it.</li>
            <li> Though the bottle is small, its viscosity makes up for it.</li>
            <li> A small price to pay.</li>
            <li> My hair grew a lot in the past 3 months it was shoulder length</li>
            <li> Rubbed a bit of oil and the thing never swelled like it usually does.</li>
            <li> It looked like some type of oil with a small</li>
            <li> I was devastated, one side was the shortest it&#x27;s ever been, a bit past my ear lobe.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;m seeing the difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of this doing anything out of the ordinary for my hair growth than I was hoping for.</li>
            <li> For me I felt it was too thick and messy...</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on hair since I was told to try it in replace of my regular castor oil, and I must say that i was not impressed.</li>
            <li> My temples and hairline that were balding from excessive braiding and weaves is filling in.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the slick edge look.</li>
            <li> In a little of few days I took notice how incredibly thick and stronger my hair felt!</li>
            <li> My temples are extremely thin, partly hereditary and partly due to tension alopecia, and I have noticed parts that were bald and slick, now have fuzz and are filling out.</li>
            <li> and I let it dry on my hair hours before I go to bed because this oil is very STICKY and smell very BAD, and</li>
            <li> I am a white girl with fine/wispy curly hair that has gotten very thin at the scalp.</li>
            <li> I was very heavy handed which caused my hair to be very limp and sticky.</li>
            <li> I wear a long weave and thought it looked silly with a long thick weave and thin edges.</li>
            <li> Get YOURSELF a bottle of BLACK CASTOR OIL !!&lt;</li>
            <li> I find it too heavy for my hair and a little irritating for my scalp even when I dilute it.</li>
            <li> and I usually don&#x27;t have a hard time managing it.</li>
            <li> If you are having problems with a damaged hair line from pulling on your hair this may work for you, but for me it cause a very little bit of hair growth and was extremely slow.</li>
            <li> Some of my hair came out because of heat damage, I stupidly was hot combing my hair sometimes twice a day and some of my hair said NOPE and bye bye.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, on and off I&#x27;ve suffered from a dry scalp and whatever I used failed to assist or help the problem long term..  </li>
            <li> and I mean small amout of JBCO added</li>
            <li> it doesnt smell too horrible and it comes off easily when you wash hair</li>
            <li> It is hard to massage into scalp.</li>
            <li> but my hair is notoriously hard to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Hard to find these items in my area of Delaware.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting moisture to stay in my hair, whether it&#x27;s winter or summer.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It smells like sesame oil, and is really hard to spread.</li>
            <li> bit my lip, hard.</li>
            <li> thick, makes it a bit hard to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to still give it a try and see if my hair grows, but its hard to even apply it considering how thick it is.</li>
            <li> ( hard to distribute through my thick hair )</li>
            <li> Interestingly, I never realized that using this product could add volume to my thin and limp hair!</li>
            <li> I put the oil all over my head, and about an hour later I was itching like crazy.  </li>
            <li> One complaint is the smell.</li>
            <li> I would say you should put this on at least 2-3 times a week.</li>
            <li> Now granted any product you use there could be negative side effects you experience</li>
            <li> Now granted any product you use there could be negative side effects you experience</li>
            <li> I apply to my scalp as the inversion method before bed at least once a week.</li>
            <li> Our scalps have not been itchy since applying the product and the stickiness isn&#x27;t an issue because I added this to a homemade hair grease/pomade (at least 4 capfuls to about 14oz of hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with a crazy itchy scalp, so I finally shaved my head to get to the root of the problem.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s in fact similar to Heritage Store Cold</li>
            <li> I never liked the thought of castor oil because I&#x27;ve seen on youtube that it causes a lot of shedding.</li>
            <li> I have also changed some of my hair habits, such as using cold water to rinse the conditioner out of my hair and using non-silicone conditioners.</li>
            <li> I apply this oil to my scalp at least 2 xs per week and massage my scalp for about 10 minutes after that.</li>
            <li> My hair broke off really bad after I had it colored a honey blonde for a few months.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to give it at least six months.  </li>
            <li> i only used it once and stopped because it made my hair fall off like crazy.</li>
            <li> I soak my once a week at least.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying desperately to get my hair back to his it</li>
            <li> yuck this thing is soooo stink and thick</li>
            <li> Made my already thick hair even thicker.</li>
            <li> While thick in consistency, I find that my scalp absorbs it overnight.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit to thick and sticky for my liking.</li>
            <li> Now granted, I didn&#x27;t use it every day because it was SO thick</li>
            <li> The JBCO is thick</li>
            <li> My hair is vey curly &amp; thick &amp; i was having problems finding a product that will give my hair the needed moisture</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s so thick, I poured it in a bottle with a nozzle on the end</li>
            <li> It has a nutty smell to it and a thick consistency.</li>
            <li> may be to thick to place on scalp...</li>
            <li> It has a thick consistency</li>
            <li> Thick and moisturizing.</li>
            <li> Really thick oil.</li>
            <li> yes it is thick and the smell may not be to your liking but at the end of the day your hair will thank you</li>
            <li> So I started to research what I can use to make my hair thick again</li>

            <li> Today is the first day that I am using JBCO and let me say that i&#x27;m quite shocked!  </li>
            <li> When I say ripped out, I mean ripped out -- folicles and all, to the point that it was just shiny skin.  </li>
            <li> If you know the Andre Walker system, you know what I mean.  </li>
            <li> I would never use on anything other than my scalp bcs of weird smell.</li>
            <li> Jamaican black castor oil + MTG + Essential oils + base oils</li>
            <li> One of my fellow natural hair bloggers recommended this product to me and I have not been disappointed.</li>
            <li> I use a very small amount in the palm of my hand and massage through my hair and scalp.  </li>
            <li> I have been applying a small amount to my  thin hairline about 3x a week</li>
            <li> but I recommend that you take a very small amount and mix it with water or a water based product to help spread evenly through out your hair.</li>
            <li> I put it on my eyebrows at night, and sometimes I would put a very, very small portion on my eyebrows after doing my makeup just for shine.</li>
            <li> To me its not bad smells like Evoo which isnt that horrible.</li>
            <li> My eyebrow region was almost entirely covered in white flakes - I looked disgusting.</li>
            <li> My hair was ridiculously damaged.</li>
            <li> I hit the wrong key on my phone and reviewed the wrong item.  </li>
            <li> My daughter suffers from dry scalp &amp; it does help with that</li>
            <li> This smells as bad as the one back home and has the thick consistency</li>
            <li> My hair line was very thin from using other product that did not agree and made my hair brittle, weak and evetually break off.</li>
            <li> That marker scent was so awful and this oil smells exactly like it!</li>
            <li> Well I purchased this item and it smells a little weird</li>
            <li> JBCO is thick, very thick.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for myself and repurchased shortly for my mom, this made our scalp itch soon bad</li>
            <li> I mix it with another type of oil to thin it out because it is a bit thick.</li>
            <li> It also makes my thin hair thick.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for about a month and see some slow hair growth on thin edges and thinning crown.</li>
            <li> I already have very thick hair, so Im not sure if it helps with that!</li>
            <li> but no growth i been using to my edged like crazy twice a day every other day and nothing.</li>
            <li> I am waiting to see results, but the smell is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re so thick and, try as I might, they don&#x27;t curl that the difference is not as dramatic as what&#x27;s going on below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> but yet not many about the excessive shedding!!!</li>
            <li> My castor oil just came in today, it was delicately wrapped and everything!</li>
            <li> I use it on my son&#x27;s hair because it was thinning and weak but after using this on his hair for a month it got thicker and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS AS AN ALL PURPOSE OIL, RECENTLY BURNT MY ARM :-(</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty nasty tho</li>

            <li> Plus I am anemic which also can make your hair thin and prone to breakage.</li>
            <li> I do not have a problem with thin hair or breakage</li>
            <li> Thin hair, broken strands, no volume, no curls</li>
            <li> Bottle came broken and all the oil leaked out.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a lady told me it would help with thin eyebrows.</li>
            <li> but I noticed that my eyesight was getting worse.</li>
            <li> I decided to use this product to seal moisture and grow in some thin edges… let me tell you that this product is no joke.</li>
            <li> I usually thin it out with almond oil</li>
            <li> I used it 2-3 times a week overnight for approximately two months.</li>
            <li> My crown area had always been thin (I think it runs in my family)</li>
            <li> , I mix the castor oil with jojoba oil to thin it out and to reduce the smell of the castor oil.</li>
            <li> they were thin before.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I used this on my temples when hair began to thin.  </li>
            <li> But now in my thirties, they began to thin, and were even alot shorter than I remember.</li>

            <li> Bottle showed up broken.</li>
            <li> The product arrived with the cap broken and the oil leaked all over the bottle.</li>
            <li> and I am using this to promote hair growth in a couple of thin areas of the the scalp.</li>
            <li> I had some thin spots and used this oil,</li>
            <li> -plucked eyebrows and/or thin eyelashes?</li>
            <li> My hair had broken off around the edges, I researched how to grow my hair.</li>
            <li> Thin edges?</li>
            <li> My hair is already naturally thin</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m already self concious about my thin spots and now they are worse.</li>
            <li> within a week I began to see growth around thin spots.</li>
            <li> My temples have gotten thin over the years</li>
            <li> I needed something to grow my thin fading edges.</li>
            <li> I have known about this product for years, but was very skeptical because of the thickness, I thought it would weigh my hair down and make it sticky.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and gooey and has a faint, but slightly unpleasant odor, but my hair LOVES Jamaican Black Castor Oil.</li>
            <li> I tried diluting it with an other oil, and I still got a rash (however, not as bad as before).</li>
            <li> this thing smell so bad, i tried a little</li>
            <li> its very thick and weird smelling.</li>
            <li> This product has a horrible smell - it smells like old cigarettes.  </li>
            <li> my hair has gotten so thick and my hair was so thin!!</li>
            <li> get me wrong</li>
            <li> it was terrible, made my scalp itchy and red.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have to say I was a tad bit skeptical about this product.</li>
            <li> A FAKE IT DON&#x27;T DO ANY OF THE THINGS THAT IS LISTED ON THE BOTTLE</li>
            <li> THIS IS &#x27;&#x27;FAKE&#x27;&#x27;</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product wrong.  </li>
            <li> Sorry.</li>
            <li> Sorry, didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> This stuff proved me wrong.  </li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t go wrong..</li>
            <li> Maybe i used it the wrong way by not adding something &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; to it or something.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> So, to say the castor oil alone has grown &amp; thickened my hair would probably be a bit exaggerated.</li>
            <li> have seen on Dr Oz of these Factories selling fake products while using misleading labels ...</li>
            <li> It has a faint peanutty type of smell, but it&#x27;s nothing that I can&#x27;t deal with.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, i have about 3 or 4 people who have already said they want in.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s sad</li>
            <li> is b/c it smells weird</li>
            <li> But, the product was expensive for me to keep using.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This oil didn&#x27;t working! Ladies please do not buy this product, I know is cheap but this doesn&#x27;t work. my hairs are still dry and still losing them everyday</li>
            <li> I use this in addition to coconut oil ask a mask (I am currently transitioning to natural hair and using only natural products). It helps with moisture because my hair gets dry easily.</li>
            <li> I have dry brittle hair and have been using coconut oil for years. I decided to try out JBCO just out of curiosity and I am impressed by the results. If you are new to JBCO, here&#x27;s a few things you might want to keep in mind:&lt;br /&gt;1. The smell- thousands of users will tell you that castor oil smells terrible. I personally find the odor similar to petroleum jelly (thats the best I can come up with). I found the odor light and not at all unpleasant. However, if you are very sensitive to smell, you should test the real thing before buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Consistency- JBCO is thick, very thick. I put a tiny amount in a bowl, add few drops of coconut/olive oil to ensure it can penetrate the scalp, dip my fingers into the mixture and massage it into my scalp. Yes, it takes a little more time and effort than other hair oils, but I think its worth it. The problem with viscous oils is, you feel as though you need a lot more to cover the scalp, then you overdo it and then it is harder to wash off. So, at least for the first couple of uses, go easy on the quantity and you can increase it later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Surprisingly easy to wash off. I was expecting trouble, but after leaving it on for 2 hours, my scalp had absorbed most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. The effects- My hair grows pretty fast naturally, so I cannot comment on whether JBCO helped in that aspect or not. However, hair is definitely shinier, healthier and split ends are under control. Interestingly, I never realized that using this product could add volume to my thin and limp hair! That was a pleasant surprise :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I use shampoo, wash-off conditioner, leave-in conditioner/scalp treatment and of course oiling. But now, I am using only JBCO and shampoo, as my hair does not need anything else. It is manageable. I like the fact that my hair is no longer exposed to tons of gunk from several products. And the wallet is happier too ;-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A word of advice for the newbies-&lt;br /&gt;1. From what I have read,the success of JBCO is subjective. People (including me) tout it as a miracle product, but not everyone benefits from it. So, it might not be the holy grail of haircare for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;2. I could leave in coconut oil in my hair overnight, but I have never done so with JBCO, primarily because I am worried that it might be too heavy for skin. In the past I have had facial acne due to hair products, so I am a little paranoid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I am gonna stick with it.</li>
            <li> I love this castro  oil. I am Jamaican and I know the real thing. I am pleasantly pleased.</li>
            <li> Great seller love product</li>
            <li> Two words.....love it!!!!</li>
            <li> Awesome... Love love love. Have used for years</li>
            <li> I started breaking out which is unusual for me. I used this castor oil &amp; my face cleared up in one day. I have very dry skin &amp; this is thick and rich and feels great. It&#x27;s also supposed to be good for hair, so I started using it on my hairline. I use a paintbrush for both applications. I read that it is made from ashes &amp; there is a slight ashy aroma. I only mention it because I know some people like scentless products. I love this product!</li>
            <li> I have a skin condition called seborrhea dermatitis that I&#x27;ve dealt with for the past four to five years. Every morning when I wake up, or after I shower, I have a lot of white flakes in my eyebrow region that I spend about 20-30 minutes everyday in the bathroom roughly cleaning with my comb. This has resulted in a lot of redness in my eyebrow area, and a loss of eyebrow hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t really care to treat this until about a month ago when I got hit by a car, broke my arm, and tore a muscle in my leg. This meant that I couldn&#x27;t shower for about 9 days. During this period, my seborrhea got REALLY bad. My eyebrow region was almost entirely covered in white flakes - I looked disgusting. After rigorously cleaning them with my comb, I lost even more eyebrow hair. I decided then that I had to do something about this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read online about the benefits of pure, raw castor oil when it comes to hair and eyebrow growth, so I decided to give this product a shot. All I can say is &amp;#34;Wow.&amp;#34; Not only did my eyebrow hair grow back (more plentiful and healthier than before) in a short amount of time, BUT the seborrhea there is almost gone. Because of this product, I no longer have to spend half an hour in the bathroom combing my eyebrow region bare of ugly, white skin flakes in the morning or after a shower. All I ever get nowadays is just one or two small white flakes that aren&#x27;t embedded in my skin - a quick shuffling of the comb in my eyebrow region removes them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would wholeheartedly recommend anybody having problems with eyebrow hair regrowth, or seborrhea to use castor oil. I apply a small amount twice a day, once in the morning and once at night, with a q-tip. Although this oil can also regrow one&#x27;s hair, I don&#x27;t recommend using this particular product just because the bottle is VERY small, and hence it would be a bit expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product. After one month of use, the bottle is still quite full. Thank you Tropic Isle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, I&#x27;m a guy.</li>
            <li> It has mold in it after only having it for 2months ): and saw no hair growth</li>
            <li> I like this product. Took a little while to get used to the smell, It is just a strong woodsy smell, but i liked it</li>
            <li> I bought this product because I thought it was the best option with helping my hair to grow around the edges and temple.  After using this product for about two months, I have not seen any hair growth in these areas at all.  However, I wrap my hair every night so some of the oil that I put on my edges gets on the rest of my hair.  Since using this product, my hair has noticeably grown in length!  My mom, husband, and co-workers have all commented on how my hair has grown in just a short time, so for that reason, I am impressed with this product!  As for my edges, my mom has been using emu oil on hers for around the same amount of time that I have been using the castor oil, and her edges look so much better!  So I have been using the emu oil on my edges for about two weeks and already I have noticed that my hair is starting to grow back!  Plus, I like the texture of the emu oil better.  So my new regimen is that I put the emu oil on my edges and brush just a little bit of the castor oil through the rest of my hair, concentrating on the ends, and then I wrap it. This is just how it has worked for me and maybe this can help those who haven&#x27;t had as much luck as others using the castor oil to treat the hair loss around the temple/edges.</li>
            <li> Great product, fast shipping.</li>
            <li> yuck this thing is soooo stink and thick cant even give it a chance to see if it works or not smells like hot butt, totally wasted my money :(</li>
            <li> OMG! Love this product wow&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m long transitioning from relaxed to natural I&#x27;m around 6-7 months post meaning I have not relaxed my hair in that time span, I had damaged edges also some thinning do to years of poor hair care such as over processing, repeated heat styling. so of course I did some research to learn if their was any product out on the market that could help me improve the health of my hair I did various searches on the net, I also watched numerous hair video&#x27;s etc &amp; I noticed that many in the hair community especially the natural hair community use castor oil in particular Jamaican Black Castor oil, so I figured I may as well try it right&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using it as soon as it arrived I was excited but also a bit sceptical because I didn&#x27;t know if all the hype is real or not, but I noticed improvement in my hair within three weeks give or take a day or so. this stuff works! especially if used daily along with co-washing or regular washes because in the first three weeks my edges were a little better I had to do a double take in my bathroom mirror because I almost couldn&#x27;t believe it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong I&#x27;m not saying my hair grew overnight or anything but my hair has become thicker my edges have filled in there is real improvement in my hair, &amp; when used on a consistent basis with a regular hair care routine it works. I apply it on my edges at night before bed gently massaging it in &amp; after I&#x27;m finished I place my satin bonnet on my hair, I also use it on my twist outs with other oils &amp; creams I&#x27;ve noticed less tangles as well as less single strand knots since adding the product to my regimen my hair loves this stuff&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only cons are the oil does not smell so good though you can mix it with other oils to improve the smell, the other con is the oil itches when you first start applying in your hair &amp; scalp but that usually lessens after your scalp gets use to it, but to me the pro&#x27;s outweigh the cons of this product Iwill definitely be repurchasing this product &amp; keeping in my my hair care routine Love it!</li>
            <li> I ordered this product because I have very dry and brittle natural hair.  I have been using this product for about 2 weeks and I have seen a big difference in the way my hair feels.  It&#x27;s softer longer and has a shine that it didn&#x27;t have before. It was packaged in a neatly wrapped box and it was delivered when it was promised.</li>
            <li> Recently purchased to use in my hair and already I have noticed a difference. My hair is thicker smoother and lot more managable. Will have to purchase again</li>
            <li> I use it in my hair and it is perfect&lt;br /&gt;Just a dab will do you last forever Thank you</li>
            <li> this is a thicker oil, the viscosity would not be to many people&#x27;s liking but for thicker ,kinkier  hair ,your tresses will thank you I use on my scalp and that of my daughters&#x27;,  to lock in moisture after a shampoo since black peoples hair dry out easily and is quite delicate. the price I  was not happy with and can get it cheaper now ,I initially  paid  $8.15 for a 4oz bottle so will not get it here again if I can help it.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and this oil is great for growth and sealing your ends to prevent breakage. I use it in my hair gel but it&#x27;s very versatile.</li>
            <li> Got it very fast and for a fair price! exactly what I was expecting the oil to be and is wonderful for my relaxed hair when I do the ghe and baggy methods</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for almost a year now. At first it didn&#x27;t seem to work, but now I can really see tremendous hair growth at my hairline.</li>
            <li> I dab a little bit of this oil on my hands, combined with a lightweight leave on hair conditioner. I put most of it on the roots of my hair and then smooth the rest up to the roots/scalp. My hair is long, wavy, and naturally frizzy. It does not take away all of the frizz, and I don&#x27;t expect it to. What it does do is make my hair soft and shiny and scalp less dry..</li>
            <li> After reading so many reviews, I am glad I bought this oil. I use it on my edges. I also add this oil to my conditioner to pretty-poo or deep condish. It does not leave your hair greasy. It&#x27;s great. Highly recommend this.</li>
            <li> I really like the product and looking to see great results! Thanks Tropic Isle!!  I will keep you posted on the great results!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d give this a higher rating if it smelled better or had no scent at all. Overall, very good for my thick dry hair.</li>
            <li> This oil is very thick. And just a little should cover your head. The bottle is glass and this stuff makes my hair thicker and much longer!&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to buy this product because i have fallen in love with it!</li>
            <li> This review is solely based on the product&#x27;s efficacy on eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, it&#x27;s pretty damn effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, some background: being a light-skinned Asian, I&#x27;m not endowed with luxurious lashes. They&#x27;re very short, and rather thin on the bottom lash line. I&#x27;ve been applying castor oil to my eyelashes every night for 2 weeks and can see a noticeable difference in length when it comes to my lower lashes. They aren&#x27;t necessarily fuller because that would require more hair follicles, but maybe in more time. As for the upper lashes, it&#x27;s not as obvious. They&#x27;re so thick and, try as I might, they don&#x27;t curl that the difference is not as dramatic as what&#x27;s going on below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest seeing what you can get out of this before dropping dough on Latisse.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and made my hair have a dewy look , didn&#x27;t make my hair feel greasy! Hope that I see rapid hair growth results and hope that it helps regrowt my damaged edges... I like the consistency: not to liquidy yet not to stiff like grease. Versatile: can be use on face or body... Mix with hair moisturizer.</li>
            <li> My beard is completely full now since using this product. It&#x27;s been 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling very moisturized. This is an excellent product. first time using you may be a little skeptical because of the thickness however it&#x27;s not sticky just really thick and penetrates right into the scalp. Here is a link to my youtube video of how I use this product.    [...]</li>
            <li> I would buy this product again i&#x27;m still using it and it does appear that it has helped the edges of my hair to grow back in thicker.  So it seems to work for me. The oil is light, not thick.</li>
            <li> This really made my hair grow as promised... will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> This oil has a thickness and heaviness and a unique smell. I like to use it in conjunction with other oils to tone down the uniqueness of it&#x27;s smell.  I like that consistancy that help other oils add moisture to the skin especially in winter weather and season.  Experiment with it and your favorite oils, you just might make a wonderful surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just an update concerning this product; it works and penetrates areas where there is arthritis, you can feel the tingeling--not burning. The smell is easy to cover up so I want to give this additional info that can be so helpful to arthritis sufferers.</li>
            <li> This is a good product,  it doesn&#x27;t smell the best but it&#x27;s a good product .  I do not use this product everyday.  i thought it would be greasy , but it is not. I have mixed other oils like unrefined avocado oil and it works just fine for my hair, especially in the winter month.</li>
            <li> This is the best product to regrow your hairline.. I highly recommend it. The seller is A1... This is a must for Afro American hair.. Thank you again...</li>
            <li> JBCO has worked on my troublesome nape area. Since its a pretty thick and potent oil, I mix it with a carrier oil like avocado or sweet almond oil to minimize the shock it could have alone to my scalp. Recommendations: put the bottle under hot water to help loosen it up before using; use it once a week or overnight as a pre-poo; use a clarifying shampoo to ensure oil rinses out completely.</li>
            <li> This is and ok product I usua get this at my local beauty store this product is a little watery not the same</li>
            <li> This castor oil is GREAT! I bought it to increase hair growth in an uneven area. My hair was broken off in the back a few years ago because of exercise and keeping my hair in a ponytail while I did it. Big Mistake. My hair back there has grown, but it still hasn&#x27;t caught up with the rest of my hair. I&#x27;ll describe what has happened since buying the product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Makes my hair naturally more shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Has made my hair color richer. I have dark brown hair that I was recently thinking about dying black, but there was no need after using this product. I love how dark and healthy it looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Made my already thick hair even thicker. This stuff will thicken your hair up within the first couple of weeks if used every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been three weeks of JBCO scalp massages and I already have new growth coming in. Some people complain about this product causing itching when applied to the scalp. I personally feel a little bit of a tingle, and mainly blood rushing to my scalp. My scalp gently pulsates after I do the massages, and I LOVE it. The feeling lasts about 20-30 minutes. You can definitely tell that this stuff is increasing scalp circulation, which is essential for hair growth, and bringing all the nutrients to your scalp. If you have relaxed hair, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it on all of your hair, unless you plan to wash it out soon. It isn&#x27;t the type of oil you can style your hair with, because of its thickness. But applying it to your scalp and ends on a consistent basis is definitely recommended, as well as using for a pre poo treatment, or sealing moisture into damp hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t as bad as some people make it out to be. It smells woody, and the smell fades soon after you put it on your hair, especially if you use it on your scalp only. If you&#x27;re concerned about the smell, mix it with coconut oil. Or put it on at night before you wrap up your hair. It won&#x27;t smell at all in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;I just orderedanother bottle. This will certainly be something that I intend to use constantly.</li>
            <li> This is the best I have ever tried on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I used to be a blonde for over 20 years or more and now I am&lt;br /&gt;what God gave me. I never knew my hair was so dark and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I use this with a shot glass in my shampoo bottle. It is like magic.&lt;br /&gt;I also every two weeks apply all over my head and wrap it up with a plastic and leave it on while cleaning or cooking and when I take a shower that night it comes out amazing with a thick coat on it. I will take that off on the next shampoo since my hair still looks clean.&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my dogs shampoo also and my family. I even apply a little on a q-tip and very carefully apply on my lashes. It really helps them so much because I had nothing hardly for lashes.&lt;br /&gt;My other favorite hair product is \\&quot;Mixed Chicks\\&quot; leave in conditioner, It is costly, but well worth the price. Now, I have beautiful hair and I buy two bottles all the time. It does have a smokey smell. But who cares when you get the results like this? Good Luck and hope I help you out...Eileen</li>
            <li> This Jamaican oil works great on Our hair. We recommend this oil very much.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Makes my hair very soft and manageable&lt;br /&gt;Good for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;Works on eyebrows and eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;Smooth consistency&lt;br /&gt;May help hair growth (I will update on the state of my hair next week, I have only had this product for a few days)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Has an odd odor, smells very musky. Almost like fire or dust? It&#x27;s not a bad smell, just not a good one either.&lt;br /&gt;Very thick, makes it a bit hard to apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d recommend this, it seems to work and is wonderful for eyebrow regrowth and hair growth. Love it!! :)</li>
            <li> I love it only thing i thought the bottle was a larger one.  I can find the large one here for the same price</li>
            <li> I JUST LOVE THIS OIL AND SO DOES MY HAIR!</li>
            <li> Works well. Amidst the smell, I mixed it with coconut oil to get a pleasant scent and it also seals and moisturizes my hair. Great buy. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping. Not crazy about the smell of the oil itself but it works.</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t great but it does serve it&#x27;s purpose</li>
            <li> I just received this bottle and I&#x27;m NOT please with the size of the bottle!!!</li>
            <li> ONce you get pass the smell it works well.</li>
            <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this product. While thick in consistency, I find that my scalp absorbs it overnight. This has also helped with my hair growth.</li>
            <li> The item was exactly as described. My hair is fine so I normally mix it with shea butter or with other oils for a moisturizing spray.</li>
            <li> This product is a bit to thick and sticky for my liking. It does have an odd smell to it, which doesn&#x27;t bother me as I only wear it at home. Aside from it being sticky and thick, I love how it&#x27;s made my hair look so much more healthier! My dead ends are no longer dead and dry looking. As far as hair growth I&#x27;m not really sure yet as it&#x27;s only been around two weeks.... I would definitely purchase again. I give it 4 stars only because of it&#x27;s stickiness and smell</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t even know why I bought this.</li>
            <li> This product was used in my hair and made my hair break out.  I would not recommend this for black hair.</li>
            <li> Among my favorite additions to my hair regiment. I use this with Wild Hair Growth and Shea Butter, at night.  I&#x27;m also taking hair supplements. The combination is yielding amazing results.  I&#x27;m very happy to have found this.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t say I love the smell but I love how it works my hair. Will buy again.</li>
            <li> i recieved this product 8days ago and used it as soon as i got it in my hand 8days later it seems as if my baby hair is growing back in  already now mind you i&#x27;m 46 so when i say baby hair i mean i have hair growing in fine already thank you for this product i hope my hair is actually growning and this is not a dream cause i want a ponytail.....</li>
            <li> Using it for my hair. I noticed that when I used this product on my scalp, it helped with my hair lose. I didn&#x27;t use it for over a week and I can tell a difference and I started to shed a lot of my hair again.</li>
            <li> Love this product. Smell I have gotten use to so won&#x27;t complain there lol. It&#x27;s a great product for hair &amp; body. It has made me a believer in hair/ all purpose oil. Loyal to jbco</li>
            <li> My Black Castor oil arrived in good shape and very quickly. This seems to be a good company and I would purchase from them again. I am using it for my brows and lashes. It&#x27;s still too early to give a report on the results, but it&#x27;s a very nice product so far.</li>
            <li> Great product to grow thinning areas of natural hair. Just a dab of oil is needed daily massaged in the scalp only to promote hair growth. AWESOME, AWESOME, AWESOME!!!! Saw results in about 2 months.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t used it for too long, the product smell is barely noticeable, slightly thick consistency. I like it. Looking for it to aid hair growth.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I can&#x27;t have enough of it. It&#x27;s very thick but I like mixing it with sweet almond oil for hot oil treatments once a week.</li>
            <li> I bought this one for myself and repurchased shortly for my mom, this made our scalp itch soon bad, I haven&#x27;t tried the original jamaican black castor oil without the lavender, I heard it was good but boyyyy it was terrible, made my scalp itchy and red. Ended up at the doctor&#x27;s and had to get a prescription shampoo to relieve the itchy for me and my mom!!! I want my money back for both of them &amp; I will be doing a review!! BEWARE DO NOT BUY, UNLESS YOU WANT A HIGHLY IRRITATED SCALP!! Hope they give me my money back for the 2 bottles I bought from them, next time ill stick to my lavender jamaican black castor oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d heard of the effectiveness of Castro oil to regrow hair, was a bit skeptica . But for a few dollars figured why not. After a month&#x27;s (morning and evening) use around my edges, that feel out due to styling, my hair has GROWN BACK ! I have been so impressed I bought bottles for family members with similar hairline issues. I can&#x27;t attest to its effectiveness for pattern baldness or hormonal based hair lose, but for lose due to styling this is absolutely an amazing solution.</li>
            <li> This stuff is excellent. It has many uses and great for my hair growth.</li>
            <li> I have damaged relaxed hair and I didn&#x27;t see a difference whatsoever. But I used it on my eyelashes and it made them thicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe if you use it regularly and have a routine it&#x27;ll work for you.</li>
            <li> I was wrong about the JBCO!!! What I experienced was a normal reaction to the product, and not an allergic reaction! Sorry for the confusion! This is a great product!!</li>
            <li> I forgot castor oil have a smell</li>
            <li> I like how it gave me boost in my hair growth, conditions eyelashes. The only complain is, it took some effort to wash it out .  4 oz.  lasted me a loong time.</li>
            <li> This product was delivered to my house in no time. It actually came 1 day before the date it was suppose to come, the sooner the better. Nothing was damaged, it was packaged very well. Not only did the product help to clear my skin, but it also thickens my hair. I am in Looovveee with Jamaican Castor oil, i highly recommend it.    However, it&#x27;s not the best product for those who are worried about it weighing their hair down, it is very heavy, and sticky. Although it is heavy, one can use minimal amounts in the hair,because it spreads very easily. A little of this (dime size) goes a long way, and if much isn&#x27;t in the hair then the hair won&#x27;t feel heavy or weighed down at all. Only downsize to this is that it does have a bit of an odor, nothing 2 smelly, just a bit of a smell. It wouldn&#x27;t be noticeable unless someone smelled your hair.</li>
            <li> My friend cut four inches or more of my hair April 27th. I immediately ordered this product because i had been researching it before this happened. Well i havent even used it constabtly but my hair is literally all the way grown back as of August 28th. So about 4 1/2 inches in four months. I was in the process of growing my hair when she cut it so i was devistated, but this product saved my life! Lol! Im almost bsl btw maybe 2 inches away and that is my goal length! All smiles!</li>
            <li> I use this once a week to lightly moisturize my scalp..sometimes I mix it in with my leave in conditioner. My hair gets so dry in the winter and JBCO has left it my hair soft, really helps to define my curls and I have seen a difference in the thickness of my hair.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  I wanted to use it for my scalp.  Too oily and didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> Awesome, awesome, awesome product.  Worth your time and money.  Brings fullness and life back to your hair just be careful not to use too much.</li>
            <li> I bought this to use specifically for my hair because I heard that it helps with thinning hair. I haven&#x27;t really used it enough yet to see results</li>
            <li> This product is like magic. I recommend this product to people that have hair loss. This product will make your hair grow for men and women. Start seeing results as early as 2 weeks. For men with thinning or wanting a full beard try it out. For women with hair loss or thinning it will correct your isse as well.</li>
            <li> Great for moisture and for restoring thinking hair.</li>
            <li> I am African American with natural 4b/c hair and this product is magic. Works well on the nape of hair, edges hairlines all over! I mean it&#x27;s just fantastic</li>
            <li> This is a great product!  It&#x27;s a little on the thicker side, however, I like that. I add a couple of essential oils (rosemary, peppermint, &amp; tea tree) and massage my scalp with it. My edges are coming in slowly, so I&#x27;m happy.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I love it! It works wonders and the price is great too. I used it on my eyelashes because I read on another review that a girl did that and it worked for her.. I was very skeptical of course but my lashes never  looked so good! I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for about two weeks. The first week I did not notice the smell, the second week it was like someone was constantly waving one of those Crayola Licorice Scented Markers under my nose. Remember those? That marker scent was so awful and this oil smells exactly like it! I want to use this more because it&#x27;s nice and viscous which lasts a long time and your scalp does not dry up. I plan on using it about three times per week. I do not know if I would recommend anymore than that. People will run away from you because they cannot stand the scent!</li>
            <li> This is a great oil for thickening hair.  I am transitioning from relaxed to natural and use this oil to help thicken some of the thinning areas in my hair.  After about a few months of use I have seen tremendous results.  Great product and delivery was fast also.</li>
            <li> LOVE THIS PRODUCT! I have been using it for 2 weeks already n my hair has gotten so thick and my hair was so thin!! But I mean my hair is REALLY thick now at my roots and I&#x27;m waiting for it to grow out to reach my ends..bc u c the difference from my roots to my end of my hair I xan only imagine how long my hair will be after using it for 6 months...also I put it on my scalp ONLY every night..n I use it to do a hot oil treatment once a week</li>
            <li> So far so good. I havent been using it very long,but i can already see a change in how my hair looks,and feels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used castor oil since I was a child and I&#x27;m not sure of the same effects but I&#x27;m back to using it for totally different reasons(Thank Goodness).  I&#x27;ve heard about this type of Jamaican Black Castor Oil is suppose to be the top of the line.  I&#x27;m so, so pleased to have found it here on Amazon.  I may need to take a heeping tablespoon full for old times sake????  Naaawww!</li>
            <li> Purchasing this product was the best choice I ever made. I&#x27;ve been using Jamaican Black Castro Oil for a month now and my hair continues to grow inches. My scalp no longer dries up like how it did with other products, this castro oil keeps it very oily just the way I like it. I HIGHLY recommend Jamaican Black Castro Oil if your wanting to see result on Hair Growth. :)</li>
            <li> this thing smell so bad, i tried a little and i got a bad allergic reaction, i dont recommend this to nobody.</li>
            <li> Made my hair itch like crazy</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell but I add it to my conditioner. I love the way my hair feels and it seems like it&#x27;s grown a bit but it&#x27;s too early to tell right now.</li>
            <li> I noticed my eyebrows getting thicker and my eyelashes getting longer and thicker... great product!!! Have used it for only a week and will continue to use it</li>
            <li> Apart from the smell (like wood) it works great for moisturizing my natural African American hair. I mix it with other oils (jojoba etc.)  because it is pretty thick.</li>
            <li> I like that the product is very think and I have been using it on my edges for growth and also on my twist out for shine, but I dont like the smell (it smells like cigarettes).</li>
            <li> IT WORKS BUT ITS TOO OILY AND IT STINKS OR AS THEY SAY IT AROUND MY WAY IT STANKS :)</li>
            <li> I use this product around the edges of my hair.  It really works and helps your hair to grow.</li>
            <li> I always re-order. Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I had to try this product castor oils is excellent for your hair, This oil is a must have oil forget the other oils. Awesome for growing out your Perm</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil is a good product. I use it on my hair. It leaves my hair soft and moist and I&#x27;ve heard castor oil help to promote hair growth which was the main reason for me purchasing it. I have notice that my hair is thicker since using it I have been using it more than three months now. Will continue to use it and see what results I will continue to yield. Good product.</li>
            <li> i got this hoping to fill in my beard better. does not work.</li>
            <li> This oil is terrible, it really sucks.  I had heard such good reviews on this castor oil.  I couldn&#x27;t wait to purchase the oil, because all I ever heard was great things said about the oil.  Well I purchased the oil, and used it for about two weeks.  The first week was great, my hair was moisturized and looked great.  My hair care professional told me that my hair looked great, and the castor oil was good for my hair.  The next week I put the oil on my hair as usual, but I decided to put some on my scalp.  I put the oil all over my head, and about an hour later I was itching like crazy.  I didn&#x27;t know why I was itching so much, so I washed my hair; and blow dried and reapplied the castor oil again.  After about the 2nd day I realized it was the castor oil, my scalp was on fire. My scalp itched profusely and my hand itched as well.  That&#x27;s what made me realize it was the castor oil, because I would put the castor oil in the palm of my hand before I would apply it to my hair.  I stopped using the oil, and had my stylist wash my hair.  My scalp itched for days after my hair was washed, I didn&#x27;t stop itching until the third shampoo. This oil was very disappointing, and I will never purchase it again.  All the rumors as to how great this product is,well it&#x27;s a lye.  The oil is pretty good for the hair, but terrible for the scalp. Unless you really want your scalp to itch like crazy, I would recommend that you not purchase this product for your hair</li>
            <li> I have relaxed 4a/4b hair and this stuff works. I moisturize my new growth and I seal my hair with this and jojoba and grapeseed oil and it&#x27;s rly shiny. My new growth is thicker and my hair did grow a little bit faster. I would definitely re purchase this but the 8oz I have the 4 oz and its goin fast.</li>
            <li> Great as always. Works we&#x27;ll on my natural hair.</li>
            <li> I rub this along my edges and use it to seal my ends. It works great! I haven&#x27;t noticed growth per se, but I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks. One complaint is the smell. It smells like cigarette ashes. But the smell seems to go away after a while. Either that or I&#x27;m just used to it.</li>
            <li> I have been seeing this recommended on YouTube for hair growth for a pretty long time. I originally bought this about six months but only used it sparingly when I noticed my hair was dry. I never noticed the results everyone raved about so it took a backseat to my Dabur Vatika coconut oil. Recently, I have been doing my own hair (I was natural for 3 years and switched back to relaxers) which included amping up my regimen. I apply this black castor oil to my temples, outer edges, and ends of my hair. I lie to you not, just in the two weeks of me using it REGULARLY (I apply it every night and then wrap my hair) my hair is noticeably growing. My temples are extremely thin, partly hereditary and partly due to tension alopecia, and I have noticed parts that were bald and slick, now have fuzz and are filling out. Like I said, it&#x27;s only been two weeks; imagine the results for YEARS! If your goal is hair growth I absolutely, positively, definitely recommend this for you.</li>
            <li> Positive results in a few short weeks.  This item doesn&#x27;t have the greatest scent, but I don&#x27;t care -- LOL, it fades after a few hours.  I can see great results in areas that were thinning.  I will be ordering more, when I run out!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I am happy that I read other reviews and took a chance.</li>
            <li> So I got this product because there were so many clamoring about how amazing it was at restoring edges. I have yet to see the justification for this hype. Now granted, I didn&#x27;t use it every day because it was SO thick i felt like my follicles couldn&#x27;t breathe let alone allow somehting to grow. I had oil stains on my pillow which definitely is not what I signed up for</li>
            <li> This product is one or the best if you are going natural I also use it for the edges of my haiy</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feel every morning.. I noticed it my skin is soft all over. I mix this oil this with coconut oil!! Dry up fast after application. i think i been using this oil for two weeks now. So far two of my friends noticed how my face look so flawless!!</li>
            <li> the product arrived on time as described and in excellent condition. I would buy from this seller again. I&#x27;ve used it in my hair and I like it. the smell is like cigarette ashes but its mild and I don&#x27;t mind.</li>
            <li> I really like the castor oil.  I massage into my hair and scalp before washing my hair and it just makes my wash process so much nicer.  My hair feels softer, less tangled, and my curls are more defined.  It&#x27;s very thick so a little goes a long way on my shoulder length hair.</li>
            <li> Keeps my eyebrows and hair stong. Ive noticed a little growth with this as well.</li>
            <li> Love this brand cos its grew my edges back thicker i seen growth 3&#x27;wothin a month time i mix mines with coconut oil thanks this is my 4th bottle keeps on hand</li>
            <li> I used this product as a deep moisturizer and sealent. I added JBCO, Olive Oil Growth Oil (you can find at any drugstore it comes in a green bottle), Marracon Oil and a bit of water. The JBCO is thick but I don&#x27;t mind it because I don&#x27;t have to worry about it running down my face and neck after application.</li>
            <li> has an odd smell and is pretty thick. But i mix it with coconut oil and then put it on my hair and leave on overnight. I have black hair and the next morning it makes my hair look even more black (temporarily), which i like.  It does take about two times shampooing to get most of the oil out.</li>
            <li> GREAT PRODUCT FOR HAIR GROWTH</li>
            <li> This product is a MUST have for me. I didn&#x27;t purchase it off Amazon though, but I have the same one. It&#x27;s amazing! I have relaxed hair, and am African American. I started using it back in November and for me, it has:&lt;br /&gt;a) grown out my hair especially where I needed it in the nape and other thinning areas&lt;br /&gt;b) strengthened my hair&lt;br /&gt;c) softened my new growth BEAUTIFULLY&lt;br /&gt;d) reduced my split ends to virtually none! (no exaggeration! I did a relaxer touch-up today and decided to get a trim and she told me I didn&#x27;t need one! The last one I got was in November.)&lt;br /&gt;e) reduced my breakage about 80%&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing product. Don&#x27;t expect overnight results because what product really gives you overnight results? It took me about a month to see it and I was amazed! About two months into using it, I noticed that in the shower and when I combed my hair, it was falling out. But it was falling out in long pieces with the white part at the end. I didn&#x27;t have any short pieces, which meant my hair was shedding and NOT breaking. So, so happy! I didn&#x27;t have any itchiness, but if you did, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s removing toxins from your scalp.</li>
            <li> I bought this product after watching several YouTube videos of others who have used it and a lot of reading about its potential usefulness in my situation.&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased. It took a little while to get used to the thickness of it but after that it was all good.&lt;br /&gt;My order arrived very quickly and I have had no problems.</li>
            <li> It has a weird smell to it. When I received it, the item was leaking.</li>
            <li> The first time I used this oil it made my hair sooo shiny and strong. After that I didn&#x27;t notice much of a difference. I think it&#x27;s a good product to have. I actually mix it with either EVOO or EVCO because it is VERY thick (like syrup). It didn&#x27;t make my hair grow at all, but it is a great moisturizer if you have dry hair. A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Use a carrier oil if this is too heavy. The scent is a bit off putting initially,  but after about 10 minutes it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome! I use it in my hair and my hair loves it too! I got the product very quickly after ordering it and it came in a very protective packaging which i definitely appreciate.  Overall its a great product. I have ordered it more than once and will continue to order it!</li>
            <li> This is an awefu product.  It smelled like ashes and it made my scalp sore</li>
            <li> it is perfect. My eyebrows are so full now its great :)</li>
            <li> I used this product in the past and stopped for whatever reason, and now I remember why. It literally made my hair fall out ! I&#x27;ve been using it for the last 3 or 4 months to fill in small thin areas around my edges.  I&#x27;ve been protective styling with a crochet - worn away of my trouble spots, and wigs. I work a lot so I wasn&#x27;t really paying attention to my progress and with its reputation I just assumed it was working.  I finally checked it out nd both sides of my hair where I&#x27;ve been applying are gone, like I got a short cut. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend if you have a very sensitive scalp. The oil must be too heavy. I will now just use my pine tar and ovation.</li>
            <li> Smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. It has helped relieve the itching and keep a shine to my hair. Definitely buying again</li>
            <li> Helps a lot with my edges</li>
            <li> There are a few things I want to clear up about this product. I used the whole bottle last year and am done with it. I switched to coconut oil to try something different but I would like to start using another JBCO castor oil on my hair. I didn&#x27;t have any bad experiences with this when using it. But I see a LOT of people on here saying how it causes severe itching, head aches, shedding etc. The severe itching comes from when you put too much on your scalp. I made the mistake of doing that one day. Putting too much JBCO on my scalp and hair and let me tell you it was itching so bad that week until I washed it out. Once I washed it out there was no more itching. Then I started using it twice a week and not putting so much in such a little time on my hair and scalp and no itching. People also say it causes headaches. Again you are probably using too much and that is another side effect of putting too much JBCO on your hair and scalp in such a short time period. I see some people saying they put it on 4-6 times a week. I would say you should put this on at least 2-3 times a week. It&#x27;s not going to make it grow any faster by putting too much on it. And yes this stuff is very thick and greasy. So you really only want to put a little on your hair unless you like that mucky feel and look. As for shedding I never experienced that either. Again putting too much on your hair could be causing it to shed. And lastly the smell. I had heard people saying how the smell of this stuff is overwhelming but when I got it and sniffed it I actually couldn&#x27;t smell anything. Now when I started using it down then I could smell it and it smelled like ashes. But to me it wasn&#x27;t a bad smell or overwhelming. But what do you expect to happen when you look at the ingredients in this. If you don&#x27;t like the smell I&#x27;d suggest buying the lavender, coconut oil JBCO, etc. If you want good hair growing results I also suggest switching to organic shampoos and conditioners, take LOTS of vitamins especially biotin, prenatal pills etc, and find good hair creams to use. When my hair broke off from the breast reduction surgery I had I did research on what vitamins I need to take, the kind of shampoos and conditioners to use, and what are some good oils to use to aid in hair growth. Now granted any product you use there could be negative side effects you experience but you have to take in consideration of using things in moderation and not going overboard because you want fast hair growth. I relax my hair and I usually relax it every 2 or 2 1/2 months because that&#x27;s how fast it grows. And in between I usually get about 4 or so inches of new growth. Right now I am on crappy chemo which thins my hair and makes it more prone to shedding and breakage. Plus I am anemic which also can make your hair thin and prone to breakage. And before my surgery my hair was long and thick down to my shoulders and then capoot I had to start over. So you also may want to make sure you don&#x27;t have any underlying medical conditions that aid in shedding and breakage.biotin, prenatal pills etc, and find good hair creams to use.

            <li> I love this product I will recommend it to all.</li>
            <li> Ive heard its good, im not regular using it so cant coment</li>
            <li> Smells smokey but doesn&#x27;t bother me. Great so far for me because it moisturizes without being too heavy.  Only been using a few days so, I don&#x27;t know about growth but I&#x27;m hopeful.</li>
            <li> wonderful product for moisturizing. Also, stays on the hair a long time and does not dry out hair. The smell is nutty, and it mixes well with other products.</li>
            <li> love, love, love this product. very good with thickening and growing the hair. I will always order this product. A++</li>
            <li> I have been natural for about one year &amp; it has been very hard for me to find products that aid in african american hair especially being natural.My hair is vey curly &amp; thick &amp; i was having problems finding a product that will give my hair the needed moisture,that was until i ran across a very wonderul product &amp; the name of that product is jamaican black castor oil.This is the best &amp; i couldnt be natural without it.This product will defenitly be a staple product.I advise everyone out there to try this product you will not be dissappointed because it delivers everytime,thanks jamaican black castor oil.</li>
            <li> I went from having no edges all of my life to them being full in less than a month. I&#x27;ve been trying to grow my edges for years so I was very surprised when this item worked so well. It&#x27;s now in my daily hair regimen and I will continue using it. Because it&#x27;s so thick, I poured it in a bottle with a nozzle on the end and I heat it in the microwave for about 10-15 seconds. Makes it thinner and easier to use, but use it sparingly. Less is more.</li>
            <li> good quality for the price</li>
            <li> Using to help grow edges out, seems to be working</li>
            <li> I was expecting something good from this oil but got disappointed. The oil is as think as machine oil. It is hard to massage into scalp. I have not seen any good thing in my hair after shampooing. I need to switch to something else.</li>
            <li> Is your hair thinning? Edges breaking off? Want thicker hair? This is the oil for you. One of my fellow natural hair bloggers recommended this product to me and I have not been disappointed. I do not have a problem with thin hair or breakage but I would to ensure that doesn&#x27;t occur. I started using this product daily to apply to my hairline prior to smoothing it back. Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair all over is really thick and really strong. It has a nutty smell to it and a thick consistency. It smooths onto your hair very easily and is absorbed well.</li>
            <li> I wash my face with black soap and use witch hazel as a toner and this black castor oil as a moisturizer and this has solved my combination to oily skin. Due to the castor oil being so thick, I literally use just a tiny dab on my face. It doesn&#x27;t leave the skin oily and actually prevents my skin from becoming oily. I also notice within 24 hours, it dries out and purges black and whiteheads   Several months later:  This oil is too good to be true. It thickened my hair and has tremendously reversed my damaged hair. I previously used this on my hair and I had stopped using for several months. Since this past summer,  I have been battling damaged hair due to protein overload from protein treatments, blow drying and coloring. I have experienced extreme dryness and shedding for months and single strand knots. Last week I had decided to go back to using this oil and saw immediate results of soft, moisturized hair and less hair shedding. This oil is a hair life saver</li>
            <li> This stuff really smells bad. I read that Jamaican oil was better than others, and maybe it really is, but the smell is so bad I don&#x27;t want to use it.</li>
            <li> Did wonders for my hair, love it.</li>
            <li> this oil is very thick and coats the hair very well. locks in moisture for days. may be to thick to place on scalp...</li>
            <li> I like this product it is what I expected and then some, I mixed it with some other oils and it is so good. I am so glad that I ordered two.</li>
            <li> I did my big chop and went natural October 2010 and I ordered this around the same time. I use this in my deep conditioner and in my daily hair regimen. My hair is very soft, moisturized, and growing like crazy. The smell is not so bad. You honestly get use to it. I recommend this for anyone!</li>
            <li> I ordered this after reading reviews about how great this product is. So far I must say I am impressed. Since I&#x27;ve been using this my hair has been softer and just feels healthier. I mix it with other oils because its sooo thick. I haven&#x27;t seen the rapid growth as some but the overall health of my hair is better...I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves this product.She ordered it about two-three months ago. I&#x27;ve personally noticed that her hair has gotten thicker. So I&#x27;d say give it a try.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil for my scalp issues and it works great. It is also good on my dry cuticles and feet in this cold chafing weather. I&#x27;ll definitely order more.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my hair to help with thickness and hair loss. It works.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and good for hair and body.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful! I love it. It&#x27;s very viscous like honey almost and you only need a few drops. I use it on my hair, skin, eyelashes and eyebrows. And let me tell you that my eyelashes have nearly doubled in length in a month. I also have a patch of eczema on my arm and it soothes it better than any kind of lotions I&#x27;ve ever tried. I mix a couple drops with cocoa butter and my skin is glistening like an ethereal goddess. I just want to dip myself in it from head to toe. If you haven&#x27;t bought this oil yet please do. You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
            <li> This was another product I found out about on youtube and I use it everyday on my hair, face and daughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> Love it it realms for you hair</li>
            <li> Worth the price. I use this product every other day. No smell. Doesn&#x27;t leave my hair gummy or sticky. Will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> Get for edges and bald spots. I am so happy found this product. If you are thinning or balding check this hair product out. I love it!</li>
            <li> I like this oil. I use it on my skin and on my hair. The smell of Jamaican Black a Castor Oil is strong and nutty, but that is to be expected. As all other castor oils, it is thick and viscous. The product was well packaged and arrived in a timely manner. I will definitely order again!</li>
            <li> The product works great. Moisturizes as it&#x27;s supposed to. The smell is pretty strong, but that&#x27;s what you should expect being that it&#x27;s castor oil. Great for hair growth- especially when transitioning.</li>
            <li> This oil is wonderful! I use it to oil my scalp and to seal moisture into my hair. It does a great job at doing both. My scalp is healthier and it gives my hair a beautiful shine that lasts for days. I love it.</li>
            <li> This product has a horrible smell - it smells like old cigarettes.  The bad smell is strong and I can&#x27;t use it.  I&#x27;ve purchased Jamaican Black Caster Oil from other companies and did not have this problem.  I would never buy Tropic Isle Living JBC oil again.  I tried to return it, but I missed the return window.</li>
            <li> This stuff did make my hair soft...but it caused my scalp to itch like crazy!  After about two or three uses, I had to trash it.  Just be warned.</li>
            <li> i have been using this one for around 2,3 months already but i already stop using it since i dont see any results at all! im kinda disappointed. i bought this because i saw many positive comments from the site, but it turns out neutral!</li>
            <li> Black castor oil great</li>
            <li> This is excellent for a person growing thier your hair out. It has a thick consistency but it&#x27;s so worth it because it helps your hair grow so much.</li>
            <li> Im using a mixture of almond oil, coconut oil, JBCO, argan oil, tea tree oil, peppermint oil for GHE every other night or so. Been natural for 5 years but used heat alot to damage my hair. There is a considerable difference in the thickness of my roots and its just a clear when flat ironed. Been trying to drink water and eat healthier too. So it would be all of the above. I even tried the inversion method for a couple days, maybe saw a 1/2&#x27; difference but braided my hair half way through the week. Will see what happens for the next 3 months but my hair is definitely thicker and has grown 4&amp;#34; since May</li>
            <li> For hair growth, castor oil is definitely the way to go! The smell is not all that great but, it is tolerable considering that I saw a nice amount of growth while using this oil along with a few other oils. I use this both as part as a treatment while sitting under a dryer, as well as putting a little on my scalp between washes. Its a great product and I would definitely recommend it for hair growth.</li>
            <li> Had this for a few weeks and it&#x27;s working as expected. Fortunately I&#x27;m not taking a tablespoon full everyday like my Grandmother had to as a kid. But I do apply it weekly. Thick but manageable new growth coming in and there isn&#x27;t any unbearable odor. It also isn&#x27;t actually black.</li>
            <li> come with good quality and long usable date!</li>
            <li> I love this ptoduct.my hair love it to.... I recommend for anyone with short hair and also thin hair.... use it everyday for good result... love it</li>
            <li> This castor oil is nice.  I mix it with other oils to create a special blend for my hair.  It is very thick but it does not leave your skin feeling oily.  It absorbs well.</li>
            <li> This is a product I order alot, this stuff works great on my natural hair and I have to have it.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon so far is the only place I can find the real deal.&lt;br /&gt;Love, Love, Love my Jamaican Black Castor Oil!!!&lt;br /&gt;Try it on your natural hair, you&#x27;ll love it too!!&lt;br /&gt;Winner!!</li>
            <li> Did not work for me. Made more of my hair fall out.</li>
            <li> I love extensions and I wore the clip ins once in a while. Last spring I wore them so much( my hair is straight, light brown and very thin) and I wore them so much I got two bald spots on the sides of my scalp, where the accidental pulling happened. I was freaking out and tried this oil after I read about it. And it worked- combined with me not wearig extensions for a few weeks but the hair grew back quickly.&lt;br /&gt;The substance is very thick, oily and quite smelly. Weird smell, not bad, just strong, but nothing you cant get used to. And it does the job. I used it overnight and I would put a towel over my pillow so it doesnt soak up any of the oil..</li>

            <li> I have thick, medium/coarse textured curly hair, that can be rough, frizzy, dull, you name it. Not anymore! With this oil, I can just co-wash, condition my hair (and use some to leave in), seal my hair with this oil... and I am left with baby soft, shiny, healthy hair that grows faster than usual. I&#x27;ve used this forrrrr... hmm. Over a month. My hair was above my shoulders, now it&#x27;s nearly below my shoulders and growing. I used it on my face before going to bed, and I am left with glowing skin in the morning. When I use it on my eyebrows, they grow faster, though not any darker. I used it on my eyelashes... they grew longer, not sure about darker/thicker, but maybe I should keep on using it for more time. Eyebrows/eyelashes take months to grow and thicken during treatments, after all. Either way, this is a great product. I brought it in the 4 oz size, but when I run out, I&#x27;m going to run and get me the 8 oz size! It&#x27;s worth it, I tell you!</li>
            <li> This makes my scalp itch uncontrollably.  I read that this is supposed to happen, but I can&#x27;t take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe I will use if for other ailments as recommended.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!!! A must have for hair.</li>
            <li> I use this product for all types of things. Skin hair, brown spots.....you name it. I am impressed with the results!</li>
            <li> The product seems to be working just fine. I&#x27;ll have to give another review in a couple of weeks before I can say definitively that it&#x27;s working.</li>
            <li> J.B.C.O always makes my hair soft and pliable when I use it and it makes my hair grow very quickly.</li>
            <li> This product is great.  I add it to my lotion for after my bath.  I use it as a hot oil sort of treatment before I wash my hair.  Overall not disappointed.</li>
            <li> Being that I haven&#x27;t had this product long enough to see a noticeable difference I only rated it 4 stars. But it is very good quality.</li>
            <li> I saw on youtube that this thickens your hair. It is awesome! I am loving this product and will definately purchase it again!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used oil on my hair before: Coconut, Apricot, Argan...etc but Castor oil is in a class of its own. I bought it because its suppised to help hair growth. It&#x27;s extremely thick and it doesn&#x27;t absorb as quickly as other oils do. I made the mistake of putting way too much on at first. A little definitely goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I would probably dilute this with another oil to make it easier to apply. I used it 4 times a week and I did see my hair get thicker and it looked healthier as well. I didn&#x27;t see much growth lengthwise but my hair is notoriously hard to grow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tropical Isle Living is a good brand and the oil is high quality and a good price. I would order again.</li>
            <li> Do not buy...This smells so bad!!! Its awful smelling....I&#x27;d rather go bald then put this on my head again...NEVER!! Never...never again....</li>
            <li> Great product. Came quickly. The oil has many benefits so I look forward to seeing great results.</li>
            <li> Takes away the itch and hydrates my scalp.  Strong odor but i only noticed once out the bottle.</li>
            <li> Heard some very good things about this oil and I cant wait to try it for myself!! Got mine today!!</li>
            <li> Thick and moisturizing. I use this to deal my ends. I mostly use in the winter to protect my hair from the cold</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t work for me. it&#x27;s good for your skin, does nothing for your hair growth. waste of money, do nor recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, it has grown my hair and given it great strength and natural sheen, shine and protection!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product, if it wasn&#x27;t my wife would have told me by now.  It arrived on time, so no complaints.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but I felt the need to this time around. I have to say I was a tad bit skeptical about this product. But this is a gold mine! !! I had colored my hair about 3 years ago. Naturally black and went for a very light caramel, brown/blonde. . My hair was ridiculously damaged. Thin hair, broken strands, no volume, no curls and It just didn&#x27;t want to return to its natural state even after cutting it... I actually  had a bald spot and it looked like alopecia.  So I had been trying everything. I purchased this item almost 2 months ago and let me tell you, my hair is full of volume, my alopecia patch is nearly all covered with hair, my curls are slowly coming back and my hair feels extremely thick!!! I say if you seem to have the issues I had give it a try, you have nothing to lose!!! Beware it does smell a little nutty, but if you mix it with another natural oil, you&#x27;re ok... I rock it just like that. Bald spot was taken 5/10/15 grown in hair was taken today 6/11/2015</li>
            <li> Very sticky but good for healthy hair.</li>
            <li> leaves hair extra soft and manageable. Will write again in a month after I do a 30 day jbco challenge</li>
            <li> Used to mix a hair tonic for short natural soft  hair.  Hard to find these items in my area of Delaware.</li>
            <li> This stuff is so awesome!!! I love how soft this stuff makes my hair feel.  It really is great when combined with other products, and I add it to my leave in conditioner which makes my hair more soft.  I would recommend this for everyone!</li>
            <li> I use this for my hair and I will not use it again. It smells gross and is super sticky.</li>
            <li> I WILL NEVER ORDER THIS MESS AGAIN IT IS SO A FAKE IT DON&#x27;T DO ANY OF THE THINGS THAT IS LISTED ON THE BOTTLE THIS IS &#x27;&#x27;FAKE&#x27;&#x27; AND ALL LIES NOTHING BUT A WHOLE LOT OF FABRICATION AND THE FEEDBACK FROM OTHER PEOPLE ON HERE REALLY INTICED ME IN TO BUYING IT WELL ALL OF THAT WAS STRAIGHT OUT LYING ABOUT THIS PRODUCT I PROMISE YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF AND BELIEVE ME YOU WILL SEE IT IS A SMOKE SCENT FRAGRANCE OF LIES</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 3 weeks. To see the results I&#x27;m hoping for, I will need to give it 2 - 5 more months.</li>
            <li> definitely value for money!! feels great to apply to hair and skin and leaves the scalp feeling great and moisturised!</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this stuff! It&#x27;s like magic in a bottle. I rub it on my baby&#x27;s scalp, on my face, eyebrows and lashes. It&#x27;s incredible and there is healthy growth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for 2 months &amp; I&#x27;m on my second bottle . I swear by this stuff ! My hair was at neck length &amp; now it is at shoulder length. My relaxed hair has also become thicker &amp; stronger + I have lots of new growth.</li>
            <li> I think this is going to be a great product, only because my friend are giving it such high praise. i haven&#x27;t notice much of a difference yet but i only been using it a short time. i hope i have great result like the others. i will let you know. Thank You.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. I ordered this to make a DIY Natural Hair Moisturizer. I&#x27;ve experienced my hair thinning. Hopefully...this will help.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t like the smell</li>
            <li> Love it! Bought a 8oz.</li>
            <li> I love JBCO. i like the thickness of it and the shine. the smell isnt horrible but its not lollipops and cupcakes.lol. it really works wonders</li>
            <li> I love this oil. Its just right for all my needs. My hair,my skin,my aches and pains. It over all makes my body feel so good. I love yall for making this. XOXO :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is amazing it does what it is suppose to. People talk about the smell. It wasn&#x27;t that bad to me. I use it on my hair and it really has grew and gotten thicker. So this stuff is a KEEPER!!!</li>
            <li> This is by far the best oil I&#x27;ve used on my natural hair. Leaves my hair soft. I received this product very quickly too!</li>
            <li> Anyone from the west Indies has this product . It certainly does what it says.  I use as a deep conditioner for my scalp with coconut oil. Good stuff</li>
            <li> Really thick oil. I like it, especially on my edges to help lay them down. I&#x27;ve even used this on skin &amp; it&#x27;s good.</li>
            <li> You must be crazy if you do not buy this product.  I have been using this product for about a week and I have to tell you my hair is longer and thicker and even healthier.  I usually use shea butter but because it is summer time I have to put the shea butter up until the winter.  OMG my hair is amazing and lovely.  Black Castrol works it works.  My edges are back and thick now and I have natural dark coloured jet black hair and it has help the shine in the hair. yes it is thick and the smell may not be to your liking but at the end of the day your hair will thank you bc hair needs natural ground earth products. ALSO you must eat healthy as well and exercise your hair needs that too. YOU MUST GET THIS.  You will not be disappointed. UPDATE!!! It is has been a year since I started using Black Castrol Oil and I STILL USE IT!!! What an awesome product!! My hair is extremely longer, thicker and healthier.  In the process I tried other products and ummmm no no ... does not compare.  I know people complain about the smell but it doesn&#x27;t matter it works that is what matters.</li>
            <li> Very thick. I use it in a mixture of other oils for my hair. A little goes a long way. I just hope it doesn&#x27;t spoil before I finish the bottle.</li>
            <li> I use this on my fading hairline and it&#x27;s growing back fast...this stuff works great especially if you have some hair breakage.</li>
            <li> I reviewed this product wrong.  I hit the wrong key on my phone and reviewed the wrong item.  I wouldn&#x27;t dare put this on my acne prone skin.   So, this is the 2nd review to clear things up.  I only use this jbc on my hair.   Sorry.</li>
            <li> Works great on my hair.</li>
            <li> Bought this product to mix with some other oils to apply to my hair. It&#x27;s has work great for my hair. I have noticed if I want my hair to look healthy and strong you have to give it a little extra help as you age.</li>
            <li> I never knew about black castor oil until I read it on Thirsty Roots. Then I google it and found so much benefits from this oil. The main reason I bought it was for my hair and my hair is thick and my edges have grown. My hair is happy and so am I.</li>
            <li> This product is good stuff.  It keeps the hair extremely moisturized, which is a necessity for natural hair.  I haven&#x27;t seen much breakage but it will thicken the hair, if you already have thick hair I would use sparingly.  Definitely a product to add to your hair regime</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s perfect, just what I needed for my hair and my skin. You get used to the burnt seed smell and the thick consistency the oil has, as I actually enjoy it now. Worth the buy!</li>
            <li> using this for hair regrowth and thickening. got here fast and im loving how shiny and luxurious its making my hair and eyelashes look!</li>
            <li> i started using it on the section of my hair that was naturally thin and fine and it has mad it thicker, i also use it to help regrow my mothers edges it it is working great!</li>
            <li> would have given this five stars but didn&#x27;t because of the smell. Other than that this product is great and will definitely be purchasing again for my hair regimen. Adds great shine, and promotes healthy strong hair and growth. My suggestion is to apply at night.</li>
            <li> I personally loved this castor oil, I used it to moisturize my hair before I go to sleep. I usually don&#x27;t just use it by itself, I mix It with some of my other oils because I don&#x27;t really like the thickness of it.. but it is really great.</li>
            <li> Completely NOT satisfy at all.  Used four bottles without any positive result.  Not as advertised. Wonder if this company has 100% satisfaction guarantee?  That would be nice.</li>
            <li> I did the big chop last September and it is amazing how much my hair has grown since then by using this product. I apply to my scalp as the inversion method before bed at least once a week. The smell isn&#x27;t bad, but still a bit strong. It is tolerable. Anyways, my hair is soft, strong and is growing! I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> This is my go-to.  I&#x27;ve purchased Tropic Isle before, and I will purchase it again in the future.  The seller is friendly, efficient, and fast!  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff I will continue to by its my second bottle and I&#x27;m working on my third I buy it every month my hair is growing fast</li>
            <li> This is a great product if your staying indoors for the day. It&#x27;s very thick and sticky and has a strong, though not necessarily bad, odor that others might find off-putting. This made my hair grow like crazy! It a months time i think my hair grew an extra two inches or so. Definitely worth purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This stuff makes my hair really soft. I don&#x27;t know whether it promotes hair growth or not but as far as making my hair manageable, this oil gets the job done.</li>
            <li> I have always had thick long natural hair but recently from using the flat iron a lot, my hair started to thin out at the ends. So I started to research what I can use to make my hair thick again and I found Castor Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using Castor Oil last month in December and I must say I see a huge improvement in my hair. My hair is starting to look like it&#x27;s old self again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend anyone to buy it. However, I must say it&#x27;s a kind of thick and oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I have also tired castor oil on my eyebrows and my sideburns and it made them much thicker.</li>
            <li> I used this product for a month now and only experience shedding NO growth! My hair is not relaxed and it sheds like crazy from using this stuff. For all the reviews that said this stuff stink... Please take our word for it! It smells terrible. To some it smells like someone behind, to me it smells like old ash trays. I now mix this with my shampoo/conditioner so the smell won&#x27;t stick to my hair. I also heard of a remedy to grow your hair using this and cayneen pepper( which I also purchase from Amazon) can&#x27;t wait to use the mixture! Hopefully I&#x27;ll see hair growth then🙏</li>
            <li> Love it and still have a good amount left!</li>
            <li> Two weeks of use and my hair line has started growing back. I am really pleased with product. I will be purchasing more soon.</li>
            <li> Started using it and have sen major growth in the past few months! I will definitely be ordering another bottle in the near future.</li>
            <li> My natural hair loves this stuff...especially the ends...reduces breakage!</li>
            <li> Personally, I like the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m into making my own body salves and hair &#x27;grease/dressing/pomade/cream&#x27;(whatever you want to call it).  My current concoction looks like a creamy mousse.  I simply added some of this Tropical Isle Living Jamaican Black Castor Oil (JBCO) to it and I like the results.  Our hair seems to be growing and we&#x27;ve experienced no adverse side effects to date.  Our scalps have not been itchy since applying the product and the stickiness isn&#x27;t an issue because I added this to a homemade hair grease/pomade (at least 4 capfuls to about 14oz of hair cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to mention all the ingredients, but to give you an idea, my homemade hair creams and body salves are made of natural oils, such as virgin coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil, unrefined avocado oil, jojoba, a few nut oils, true ivory unrefined shea butter(softened by stirring with a fork, NOT MELTED!!), calendula essential oil, tea tree essential oil, myrrh, ylang ylang extra...you get the idea, all natural ingredients.  For the summer only, I added about 6 drops of vegetable glycerine to it to pull moisture out of the air and into our hair.  Don&#x27;t do that in Winter because the air is dry from the heaters and furnaces being on and it will pull the moisture out of your scalp and the inside of your hair to moisturize the outside of your strand, which will quickly cause damage and breakage.  Vegetable glycerine is great for moisturizing during humid months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I don&#x27;t get what the big fuss is about the smell.  It doesn&#x27;t smell good or bad to me and since it&#x27;s mixed into a hair dressing when I apply it, I don&#x27;t smell it afterward in my or my daughter&#x27;s hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, that I also bought the same brand JBCO Hair food, which has a much more pungeant smell/odor than this oil.  I added some of this JBCO to it as well and applied that to our hair and scalp.  We still don&#x27;t see what is offensive about the scent and I can barely if at all smellit once it&#x27;s in our hair.  My suggestion, is that one could add a good essential oil to the bottle to tweak the smell.  I&#x27;d only put up to 6 drops though for such a small bottle.  Essential oils are powerful with wonderful benefits but could make you sick if not diluted well.  Always remember that essential oils can be diluted with oil only, so if you spill some or use it too concentrated on the skin or scalp, take coconut, olive, any vegetable or carrier oil will do to clean it off.  Water won&#x27;t do any good because essential oils are oil soluble.  Wash it off with the vegetable/carrier oil, then wash that off with soap and water.  Another suggestion, is that this brand of JBCO is also sold in scented varieties.  The only one I&#x27;ve seen so far is Lavender.  It&#x27;s supposedly slightly thinner in consistency, but people seem to like it and it smells good, so the reviews say (I haven&#x27;t and don&#x27;t plan on trying it, I&#x27;m satisfied with this original).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re going to add essential oil to this JBCO, I recommend calendula, blood orange, lavender...something with a nice scent.  You could use fragrant oils manufactured exclusively for fragrancing cosmetics/soaps/candles and the like, but I wouldn&#x27;t go that route unless you can find some made with plant oils and extracts instead of synthetic chemicals and no, I am not talking about body oils that you wear like perfume.  I guess you could but I personally would not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I liked the way our homemade hair dressing and the Tropical Isle Living JBCO Hair Food worked before, but adding the JBCO to them seemed to increase the results of what we were looking for:  shine, manageability, softening, sealing and growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil seems fine to me and I plan to buy much more of it.</li>
            <li> I love this. It feels amazing on my temples, and my hairline. It is working well. I will update this review after a few weeks using the product.</li>
            <li> I have fine, but loosely curled hair and this does great. I was having breakage problems around my hairline, mainly from sleeping without a cap or satin pillowcase. This works amazing, but does not smell all that great but is easily fixed with rosemary essential oil which is great at stimulating the scalp, so its my fav duo! Great shipping, will be buying more!</li>
            <li> Love this oil!! It has helped my locs grow fast as well as help oil my scalp</li>
            <li> Might be working on brows and parts in hair. Used nightly for 2 weeks so far. I&#x27;m 68 and white.</li>
            <li> Used it every day for two months and I&#x27;ve seen none drastic improvements. It did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
            <li> A little thick but I mix it with leave in conditioner, I link this product and would purchase it again</li>
            <li> We love it. Works great on our natural hair and a good moisturizer for skin. Smells good also. Would recommend to anyone that want their skin feeling great.</li>
            <li> i use this stuff in my oil mixture for my hair. It is very thick but I mix it with grape seed oil and olive oil. The smell is easily masked when accompanied with another oil. It moisturizes and seals my hair and gives it a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Leaves my beard soft and looking healthy. Would reccomend it to anyone. Smells nutty but easy to get used to</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this ever since I was a little girl and when I was back home. I use to add jt into my hair oil</li>
            <li> i love this stuff. it strengthens the hair and gives it moisture. then smell doesn&#x27;t bother me like some others were saying. it&#x27;s a lil nutty and I love nuts lol. but anyway I mix mine with my eco styler gel. well actually I but this on first strait out of the shower then I apply my hair gel. I have yet to try the home made flax gel but I will soon and see if this mixes well with my homemade gel...</li>
            <li> This stuff really and truly work. I had a dime sized area with out hair for 3 years related to a half wig that rub the area bald. I used this product for 2 weeks everyday and the area was dark with beginning hair growth. Amazing. Wish I had of taken before and after pics.</li>
            <li> I swear I loved this product, but it was so thick and hard to spread on my scalp. It did help to relieve my dry, itchy scalp and I would recommend this.</li>
            <li> Well I saw a before and after youtube video about Caster Oil and this girl used it for about 8 months for her eye brows that she had plucked excessively. It was an impressive comparison with instruction for the success.  I decided to try some on my receding hair line. Caster oil has been used for a very, very long time for various health uses...and folk remedies..and the Caster seed is used to make the infamous poison Ricen..used in the Tokyo subway terrorism attack...I plan to see what Wiki has on the chemical and history of this Caster plant.</li>
            <li> This oil is sooo thick. I do not seal my ends with this because it makes my hair so heavy. I only use this on my hairline. I also have mixed this with coconut oil and put it in an applicator bottle to grease my scalp. I only apply this 1 or 2 times a week because it is so thick.</li>
            <li> It works for my hair type which is type B3 curly. It&#x27;s good for keeping hair hydrated longer, so it feels less dry than before I started using it.</li>
            <li> Hey Everyone:)&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the JBCO as well as GrO AUT at the same time.. the JBCO came to me sooner so for about four days this is all I used.. it is very THICK however I notice my thin areas from wearing closure gad start to come back before my GrO aut even came in. I mean to say that honestly I read all the reviews but I had to try it out myself.. I gave it five stars because it did what it says. I will probably do a before and after some time in December!!!!&lt;br /&gt;One HUGE point I want to make is Initially I purchased the JBCO from my local hair store and I honestly believe it was fake because it didn&#x27;t do NADA..After using this I poured the hair store bottle down the drain Go WITH what is proven DO NOT expect hair store brands to work.</li>
            <li> works very well if you have breakage or thinning. i love this stuff especially in myhair but also on my skin</li>
            <li> This product has been AMAZING. I&#x27;ve used pharmaceutical grade castor oil to seal my coily 4c natural hair and had heard of the even better properties of Black Jamaican Castor Oil. It&#x27;s been about two weeks that I&#x27;ve had this and I&#x27;ve already noticed hair growth and moisture retention. I mix a little of this with tea tree oil and apply to my eyebrows for thicker growth. I&#x27;ve even started applying small drops of it on my 15 month old daughter&#x27;s hair 3x a week after nightly baths and her hair has been growing in thick, curly and strong. This is definitely going to be my go to brand and an oil I&#x27;ll be using more of in my hair regiment.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week now and I already see progress. I apply I t on at least 4 times everyday and it&#x27;s really growing my hair where I have bald spots. definitely going to order more when I run out</li>
            <li> I from Haiti I used to used it when I bought it I thought I bought something else until I smell it I was so happy yes why the change the name thu it&#x27;s good for every thing u can used for everything very good Haiti we made it call masketi</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for the last two years and it does wonders for my hair. It has a smokey scent so ladies if you don&#x27;t mind I say go ahead and try. I ended up buying two bottles because this is the cheapest price I&#x27;ve seen for it in a while. I apply it every other day directly to the scalp which results in thick and moisture locked hair. I would recommend this product to all women!</li>
            <li> I used to use Latisse, but it runs about $120.00 per month and, although I did see some improvement, it was not enough to justify the price. Then I discovered this product. After removing all makeup at night, I apply a bit to the lashes and lash line. I swear I see a difference - longer, thicker, and darker lashes. And it does not sting the eyes, or cause the slight skin discoloration that Latisse did.</li>
            <li> It made my hair crunchy and dry. I guess it&#x27;s just my hair texture, and I have 4C hair, but it made it crunchy. Maybe you&#x27;re only supposed to use it on the scalp, because I used it on the length of my hair. I will keep buying it, because it is a good moisturizer for dry lips and skin, but does not do anything for my hair and makes my scalp itchy.</li>
            <li> The product arrived quickly and smells so pure. The quality is good it manages my hair very well. This is a must have hair care product.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I noticed amazing growth on my temples.  Very thick and voluminous.  I noticed because it came in gray, and my hair was dyed dark brown.  Yes e product has a smell.  As others have stated, mix with scented oils appropriate for hair; I used rosemary oil and olive oil.  Great stuff.</li>
            <li> I have only used it for 5 days but I can tell a big difference in my skin texture and hair texture, I will get back with you in a few months</li>
            <li> I like this oil, not a harsh smell and I mix it with other oils!</li>
            <li> This oil has so many uses - but I use this on my scalp. This is wonderful for hair growth and strengthening plus it&#x27;s a great moisturizer! Just rub this on the scalp a couple of times a day and you will be AMAZED! This oil is thick and not runny, if you don’t like the smell or thickness you can mix with other carrier oils.   I had a severe hair loss issue and using this oil helped me grow my hair back in a couple of months! Consistency is the KEY! I LOVE it and would highly recommend it to anyone. If you find yourself getting bumps on your scalp, undiluted may be too strong for you.  Simply mix other olive, jojoba or another oil to ease the sensitivity.  I have used NUMEROUS brands of Regular Castor and Black Castor Oil - just look for 100% or pure and you can&#x27;t go wrong with either type or brand. I have indeed posted reviews on different brands because I have used these brands.  I use castor oil on my hair and my daughters’ hair and I mix my own hair products so I buy several brands as long as they are 100% / pure castor.  I hope this review helps!!</li>
            <li> Great customer service. Happy</li>
            <li> Hurts my scalp made my gland swollen scalp sore</li>
            <li> this is the best oil for hair growt i ordered two weeks ago i alreary can see my new hair</li>
            <li> Give me a few more weeks with this product and I will have more to contribute toward the thickness and growing power.</li>
            <li> I havent had it long enough to know if it truely works on my hair.The smell is not as bad as others make it out to be.</li>
            <li> Make my hair soft don&#x27;t put to much and you&#x27;ll be fine I love it because it make my hair grow.</li>
            <li> Love, love this oil. I use it on my daughter&#x27;s scalp and it takes away all dryness and doesn&#x27;t make her hair too heavy. Thankfully the cator smell is light. It&#x27;s done miracles helping her thick hair grow.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. I massage it into my hair and through it before I go to bed and then wash my hair in the morning. It has revived my hair. LOVE...LOVE... LOVE.</li>
            <li> Black castor oil is great for natural hair. I used it regularly. Because it is thick, I blend it with mustard oil. Great combination.</li>
            <li> could&#x27;ve  received a 5 star but when receiving the product the top or cap is a little bent thank God no jbco did not fall out anyway so far so good my hair has grown since this purchase and is very noticeable</li>
            <li> Good stuff, love it I use it for my eyebrows and I have noticed that they are getting thicker withtn a week of using it.</li>
            <li> The consistency is really thick and almost sticky but good for natural hair. I like the product overall but it was much smaller than I was expecting.</li>
            <li> I applied this to my hair exactly as told, rub into roots then apply to the rest,, I left it in for 2 hours and had nice results. I probably need to use it more. And alittle goes along way!</li>
            <li> This is a great oil for any type of hair. I mix it with another type of oil to thin it out because it is a bit thick. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
            <li> I like it and but the smell is not so pleasant. Therefor I mix it with other oils like olive, rosemary and vitamin e.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use this. ..fast shipping</li>
            <li> I purchased this after reading rave reviews from users who reported great success in regrowing hair.  I used it briefly but found it too thick, gummy and smelly. I actually found more hair falling out while I was using it. Sorry, didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Bad I recieve it damage but I got it intime seller don&#x27;t care about me I message him about it and he ignore my last message</li>
            <li> It really keeps my hair hydrated, and my edges are growing. I use it on my face as well. Since I have only used it a couple weeks I don&#x27;t know it&#x27;s full advantages but so far so good. I just hope by summer my slight bald issues will be mended.</li>
            <li> Seriously, this is great for hair.  I have natural hair and this stuff works great.  Also works nicely on skin. Must buy.</li>
            <li> I used to have really dry ends although I cut my hair about a 2 months from using this product. I researched the reason and the only reason I could find was that my hair was not very strong and I needed something like a hair reconstructor. I bought this product since I usually like going natural. I missed 1 teaspoon of honey with 1 teaspoon of coconut oil with 1 teaspoon of this castor oil, microwaved it until it all melted together and put that all over my hair. I left that it for about an hour and there is already a visible difference. The ends of my hair are no longer dry. I have used coconut oil with honey before but the affect of 2 together is nothing like the 3 together. Lots of the reviews were talking about it being too thick and unusable the solution to that is warming it up in the microwave for a few seconds.</li>
            <li> I have not seen any results yet. I will give it a few more weeks to see if I notice any results.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite oil it is multipurpose and that makes it better. I will continue to use this product. I now uses it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and the result is spectacular...</li>
            <li> Today is the first day that I am using JBCO and let me say that i&#x27;m quite shocked!  It does not smell as some people said there reviews on Youtube, so I didn&#x27;t mix it with any other hair conditioners or oils.  It is thick and not thin like other oils which I love!  I applied it on my scalp and new growth; it made my new growth feel so soft!  Before my new growth felt like a brillo pad :).  I will give a 30 day update as to how it is working thus far.  I recommend you order this product as soon as possible!</li>
            <li> product as described. I have been using it for few weeks now and I have seen difference in my hair. My hair were thinning badly and now when I brush my hair I see a difference, my hair has become stronger. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell.</li>
            <li> Very very good product! great for african american hair</li>
            <li> Stiil hoping for this to grow my edges. Overall its a good product as its made my hair grow alot and my hair is pretty black.</li>
            <li> i love this product. since i&#x27;ve been using it i see so a big difference in my natural hair. my hair is not longer dry. the oil helps to seal in the moisture when I have my hair in twist outs. love this oil!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this oil for two years now . I love how its makes my hair feel after I wash my hair . this is a staple product I only use castor oil since Im a kinky curly natural girl!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Well after researching hair growth methods and reading so many testimonials as to the wonderful results that so many others have experienced using this oil,I decided to give it a try.  I can gladly say that this oil is excellent!!  I mixed it with coconut oil to thin it out a bit , and greased my entire scalp. id this nights weekly and after only 2 weeks I saw thick black new growth even in thinning and balding areas in my scalp!!!!  That was all I needed to be convinced of the effectiveness of this stuff!! I ordered 2 more bottles right away so i&#x27;d never run out!!</li>
            <li> Great! I really love this.</li>
            <li> This is a miracle for thinning edges, Daily use every night before bed gre my edges back within a month!</li>
            <li> I bought this product after doing a lot of research on the benefits of Jamaican black castor oil. I saw several reviews claiming hair growth with this product, however that was not the reason I bought It. I have two daughters that have natural hair so I am always on the look out for a natural moisturizing product for their hair. I no I said I bought this for my girls but I like the product so much that I began using it in my hair. This product provides a softness to my relaxed hair that I have never had before. I can not attest to the growth power of the castor oil because my hair is thick and almost bra length anyway and I have not seen much change. But I will say that it make my hair feels a lot more healthy than before. I will be ordering again soon and I would and have recommended this product.</li>
            <li> My castor oil just came in today, it was delicately wrapped and everything! Very timely, and no damage done. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my 4c hair~!! :D</li>
            <li> I love to use this when my hair is wet &amp; I&#x27;m doing a two-strand twist style.  It makes my hair so soft and the twists last much longer than other products.</li>
            <li> I have not used it consistently enough to see any improvements in my hair growth or texture.  It is very thick and the smell reminds me of coffee grinds.</li>
            <li> So I bought this because I heard it was a great growth aid. I put it on my edges for a few weeks last year and my edges did grow but not as much as I thought it would. So I gave a little to my aunt to try (the little lasted her for MONTHS) , and she loved it! She has been bragging about it and she is def going to buy her own. The oil is very thick but surprisingly it didn&#x27;t last me that long, because I used it in a few of my hair concoctions. My NOW oils lasted me an entire year but this oil was gone after a few months. Luckily, I gave some to my granny, so she still had some left. So I asked her for it  this year and she gave it to me and I was able to use the rest of it just recently to make a hot oil treatment and to use it on my edges. I love the way it makes my hair look and feel. It is a great oil and it does wonders in hair concoctions, deep conditioners and hot oil treatments. You should def buy this to add to your already existing products. I made a hair concoction last year with a bunch of ingredients and this year I finally decided to use it and my hair had a growth spurt. It was amazing how quickly my hair grew and the Jamaican black castor oil def had a lot to do with it because I had used most of the bottle for the concoction. Jamaican black castor oil + MTG + Essential oils + base oils + mega tek + wild growth oil makes one hell of a growth aid. Thanks for reading.</li>
            <li> I do not know if it works or not because my hair has not grown but I have not used it on a regular basis but what I hate about this product is the smell, they should add fragrance in it or something. It makes your hair smell like fried chicken grease and it absolutely awful. I may try to pair it with a conditioner or something to alleviate the problem and will update my review after I do but if you are interested in using this product by itself it may not be the best idea unless you like walking around smelling like a deep fryer,which even using the smallest amount will make you smell like that.</li>
            <li> Odorless, but very thick and good for moisture. I also use in hair products. I think it works perfectly as a humectant.</li>
            <li> Well I was hoping this was going to work out ordering this imposter Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  But what I got was plain Castor Oil in a dark brown bottle, can you say rip off. When I opened the bottle I smelled the oil, no smell hum, so I got a clear plastic spoon to compare my cold press Castor oil to this oil and guess what I found out, SURPRISE to me, they are one in the same, I couldn&#x27;t tell the difference from where one started and the other left off. I wont be ordering from this seller again  BEWARE OF THIS IMPOSTER</li>
            <li> I use this stuff to moisturize my curls instead of gel our mousse. It keeps my spiral curls frizz free and bouncy. I haven&#x27;t noticed any growth on my edges that were destroyed in my teens wearing tight pony tails. Works great as a leave in treatment though.</li>
            <li> Hoping this stuff helps.. I&#x27;ve read so much about it helping thining hair. Been using it for a week now with no change in thickness but my hair has a really nice shine.  It smells a little weird, almost like bacon grease, the lavender version may be a better choice. Will update in a few months, hope it works.</li>
            <li> Super fast shipping. Great product for my hair journey and after using for a couple weeks my hair is really thicker and stronger and almost no shedding. I miss with olive or coconut oil because its so thick</li>
            <li> I received this product yesterday. I hope it works but I&#x27;ve only heard good things about it. Love that it was double bubbled wrapped and taped for protection. I&#x27;m dealing with post-partum shedding and my hair is thinner around the hair line so hoping this will restore the thickness I use to have a year ago.</li>
            <li> thanks for the prouduct i luv it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen lots of people talk about JBCO on you tube so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  This is my second bottle that I&#x27;ve ordered and it does seem to be growing back my edges.  I massage it in every night at bedtime.  I&#x27;m going to give this 3 bottles before I can really tell if it&#x27;s working or not but I believe it is.</li>
            <li> my hair is damaged because of this product ,horrible!!!!!!!! never never but this again horrible!!if you have a sensitive skin do not buy this .</li>
            <li> It slow down the shedding, I&#x27;m still waiting on it to thickening my hair. It does have a smell but it&#x27;s not that strong where you can&#x27;t stand it.</li>
            <li> Received it on time and it was the right product. The only things is I don&#x27;t like the smell it doesn&#x27;t smell it smells like ashes.</li>
            <li> Bottle came broken and all the oil leaked out. I was very disappointed</li>
            <li> great for the scalp - been natural for 2 years.</li>
            <li> Use it for my hair and body ache</li>
            <li> Still using product.  Have not seen full result of hair growth as was advertised from a certain magazine.  Will continue use.</li>
            <li> GREW MY DAMAGED HAIR BACK IN 3 MONTHS, ALL HAIR WAS THICKER AND FULLER IN 3 MONTHS - THE REAL DEAL... DEFINITELY BUY THIS.</li>
            <li> Great brand, you just can&#x27;t go wrong with the many uses of organic castor oil! love it!</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly and covers quickly I love it. The smell takes a little getting used to but it&#x27;s tolerable.</li>
            <li> The oil is very thick. I use it on my brows and eyelashes every night before I go to bed, applying it with disposable mascara wands. The only thing I&#x27;ve really noticed is that my lashes feel softer and not as brittle. I haven&#x27;t seen any growth with my eyebrows yet. My eyelashes don&#x27;t fall out as much as before. This oil is probably just helping to keep my lashes soft with all the mascara that I use everyday. Hope I see more from this product in the following weeks!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review on Amazon, but I felt I had to write something about this. I&#x27;m a long time user of castor oil and I decided to try this brand of black castor oil due to the wonderful reviews. As soon as I poured this oil into my hand, I got a strong wiff of cigarettes. It smelled like someone dropped their ashes into the bottle. I wished I had read some of the other one star ratings before I bought this. The label on this bottle looked like it was printed with a home computer. The oil from this brand doesn&#x27;t seem authentic. Don&#x27;t buy!!</li>
            <li> I saw rave reviews on you tube about this castor oil so I purchased it for my hair.  Not one to give up easily, I purchased a second bottle after getting no results with the first one.  Still no results.  Everything doesn&#x27;t work for everybody so this will be my last purchase.</li>
            <li> didn&#x27;t help with hair loss (woman). Actually felt like I was losing more hair after using this.</li>
            <li> This Jamaica Castro oil I use as a moisturizing oil for my hair and within a few days of using it, I could feel that the texture of my hair has improved. I love the way it make my hair feels so I will definitely reorder again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my second bottle.</li>
            <li> Received item as scheduled. Works great, I already see good results in my hair. I even used it as a massage oil on a pulled muscle.</li>
            <li> The product is a bit sticky. I have been using it for my hair and it have never been healthier. I also mix this with biotin and make all natural eye lash  moisturizer, works wonders. If your hesitate to buy, do so. You will not regret it.</li>
            <li> am using this oil to benefit my hair. I have ben busy so haven&#x27;t had the chance to do a good treatment. don&#x27;t particularly like the smell. we&#x27;ll see.</li>
            <li> I wish I purchased this sooner.  My hair is super soft and moisturized, I mix this with organic coconut oil for extra shine.</li>
            <li> I think it might do what it&#x27;s supposed to but the smell really makes it unbearable. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
            <li> I really like the Jamaican black castor oil, it has helped in areas of my hair that was really thin. I recently went natural from having relaxed hair for about 7-8 years. It has help with my edges that was stressed from braiding and the middle of my head.&lt;br /&gt;The smell which I know was a big issue for some I think is highly over exaggerated. I have a high sensitivity to smell and the Jamaican black castor oil is tolerable. It has a smokey burnt wood smell, but it doesn&#x27;t stay for that long once applied to your scalp.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to others as I recently bought a bigger size one for my mother. She loves it and uses it daily.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet and I can&#x27;t wait till I do. The shipping was very fast. Hopes it works! Bought this at good price too</li>
            <li> Smells bad but I just add some pomegranate oil with it to lighten the smell. Hope it will work for hair regrowth. No difference yet but I am not using daily</li>
            <li> I LOVE TO PUT THIS STUFF ON A BRUSH AND BEFORE BED DAB SOME ON AND GO TO BED.. MY HAIRS HAVE FILLED IN..i don&#x27;t use so much on my hair because ive found red pimento hair growth oil was a lot better.. but since I bought this already before that.. I now found a use for my eyebrows.. really great product</li>
            <li> Im trying to grow my hair and ive been using for 1 week and see no diff yet. its very thick and weird smelling.</li>
            <li> please please sell products that work...not looking for a miracle just real and honest results.  not worth the money...there are othjer products that you can use that are so much better</li>
            <li> I got it because I wanted to reshape my eyebrows since my wedding is coming up and my oh my I&#x27;ve seen eyebrow hairs I haven&#x27;t seen since high school!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls who threads my eyebrows suggested warming up the oil in those little plastic travel shampoo containers and heating it by placing it in water that was warm from the pot.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about this at first, what with it being talked about like the Messiah come again or something, but after doing some extensive research and watching a ton of youtube videos and reading reviews about it, I decided what the hell, and decided to give it a try. As you can see by my rating, I was not disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;ve always had thick hair to begin with, my edges were another story completely. So after receiving this in the mail, I&#x27;ve been massaging it into my hairline every morning when I wake up, and it has done wonders for my edges. They&#x27;re now almost completely full and all it took was two months of semi-diligent application (I&#x27;m not gonna lie, some days I got lazy and skipped the morning ritual).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I can think to complain about is the smell, but that&#x27;s an easily remedied situation. I just mix in some coconut and grapeseed or olive oil and that does the trick. As other reviewers have said, it&#x27;s pretty thick, so a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Oh my!  I thought that I could swallow anything as long as it&#x27;s helpful.  This stuff proved me wrong.  Wow, it&#x27;s horrid!</li>
            <li> This product made my hair shed a lot.  My hair was thick and down to my waist.  I used the product hoping it would grow my hair to my butt, not!  I couldn&#x27;t figure it out at first because of all the good reviews.  Now my hair is thin and back to bra length.  I am so upset .</li>
            <li> Love this stuff for scalp.  Helps treat edging/temple area break-off from caps, wraps, scarves.&lt;br /&gt;Economical, ecological solution for scalp needs.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard an seen so many reviews on this product. This is my second time purchasing this stuff. The last time I purchased was like 2 yrs ago maybe when I was trying to get my hair to thicken up! I was mixing it with mega tek, which it did make my hair grow &amp; thicken, I think lol! Now I use it on my eyelashes, toes &amp; more!</li>
            <li> just started using it. So can&#x27;t much. but have no doubt that i will work. Smell funny! Thick and original.</li>
            <li> I gave 5 stars because I&#x27;m just really excited to use this product on my hair. Hopefully all will workout. :D</li>
            <li> Great Product! It makes wonders and is excellent for what it does. I couldn&#x27;t be more happier and content with the effectiveness of this product.</li>
            <li> Not as I expected . But good for my colored hair . Would buy it again if I had problems with my hair.</li>
            <li> What can I say that has not already been said. Castor oil really helps to moisturize your hair. And if you have super dry hair like mine, this will help a bunch.  Not sure about all the claims to grow your hair though.</li>
            <li> this product was recommended by many people, I use it regularly but don&#x27;t see too much of a difference as people told me I would have. I know there is no harm from this product, so I will have to wait and see for results of hair growth with this bottle.</li>
            <li> After a while the stuff kinda started to smell like cigarettes . It had an affect in the beginning but it wore off and no longer works I&#x27;m gunna try and mix with Another other oil</li>
            <li> It is exactly what I expected. I bought it for my hair and I love the way it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> I used Castor Oil growing up and will continue to use it. It helps keep my feet soft and pretty and putting a little in my bath makes my skin feel healthier and just a dab used with my conditioner makes my hair feel so free and tangle free.</li>
            <li> This oil is amazing...soo happy I did research and decided to order this.Its a super thick oil but absorbs quickly into scalp.Surprisingly its not greasy which I love,Definitely notice a difference in thickness and growth within a month!!!Plus its great in my 2 year old daughter hair keeps it moisturized,her hair is also gotten thicker and has had some growth.I read on the reviews that people didn&#x27;t like the smell.To me its not bad smells like Evoo which isnt that horrible.Gonna pair this oil with Hairfinity growth supplement!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using two products Kalpi Tone and this....and I am still experiencing breakage, not sure if it&#x27;s the phase I am in right now or the product I need more time to tell.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Jamaican Black Castor Oil for about 3 weeks, and I can see a change in the thickness of my hair and also growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patricia,</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think that this is for chemically treated hair.  Within three months of using this, my hair started thinning like never before.  I finally had to cut it to try to restore it.  On the other hand, my daughter&#x27;s hair is natural and I use it on her hair which has become thicker and healthier with no adverse effects.</li>
            <li> This oil... i was so excited to get this line of products I use it on a regular it has done my scalp so much justice I will surly keep this on my shelf</li>
            <li> I can see a different in my thinning spots.  This has become the only oil that I use.  Make my hair so much better.</li>
            <li> The castor oil is good. Within one month, I was able to see some hair filling in. I like it.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product, it&#x27;s working wonderfully so far</li>
            <li> Thanks for a great product Tropic Isle.  This Jamaican Black Castor Oil works wonders on my hair. Will definitely purchase more bottle shortly.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if this oil is any good, but it will not work for me because I will not use it.  It is like pouring glue on your hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this because a lady told me it would help with thin eyebrows. I&#x27;ve noticed a slight difference but nothing extreme</li>
            <li> Smell like crap. So greasy my face breaks out.</li>
            <li> This Tropic Isle Jamaican Black Castor Oil, really works!!! I highly recommended this item.. when you start noticing some balding, try this and within a week or so, you will notice hair start growing.  I applied this product everynight before i go to bed. Thanks Tropic Isle!!</li>
            <li> Super great for longer eyelashes.</li>
            <li> It made my hair soft and manageable. I also applied to my lashes every night and it made them softer but not fuller as I would have liked but they also grew a little</li>
            <li> I love love love love love...did I say love this stuff!?!  I kid you not, this oil is a miracle in a bottle and it has caused me to grow my edges back after lots of hair weave damage.  I thought that my hairline was gone forever but oh Happy days...I&#x27;m backkkkkkkkkk!!  Of course I&#x27;ve gone natural for a while now but this was the missing key to give me a head full of thick, strong, shiny and beautiful hair.  Try it...you won&#x27;t go wrong..I just ordered a two pack 8 oz (each) a moment ago to ensure that I remain housed with this product!  Who knew that I could have a ton of thick wavy baby hairs like my daughter again....please try it ladies and gentlemen if you aren&#x27;t ready to shave your heads bald.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t care much for the smell, but I Loved how it made my hair feel !! Great buy especially if your transitioning back to natural like me !!</li>
            <li> Ive been meaning to order this for months. Its the best for regrowing edges. It came on time in a cute bottle. I only use a bit on each temple so it should last at least 2 months. It has a smoky smell that i found kind of strange at first but it ok now and it the thickness of syrup which i kinda like since my hair is thick as well. Its the thickest oil Ive ever used. It moisturises my edges very well especially since its thick. I has new growth already</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if its just me but this product leaves white residue on my scalp.Its great for skin though.</li>
            <li> I personally did not like the oil.  It is very sticky of course, but it also did nothing for my hair.  It made my hair very rough. Maybe i used it the wrong way by not adding something &amp;#34;extra&amp;#34; to it or something. I don&#x27;t know. Very disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li> I make my own hair care products. I add this with another oil for a hot oil treatment. The product is great I just hate the smell.</li>
            <li> I really enjoy the product and the very reasonable price for this product wished  I could get more at the price</li>
            <li> I recommend this product- I love using it as part of my natural hair regimen, it really helps retain moisture and grow it.</li>
            <li> I have been natural for 8 months and this product does wonders on my hair. My edges love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I really ddntknow what to expect because despite the reviews most products can be a hitor miss for my hair. I hve type 3Chair thats really dry and I found this product to be agreat moisturizer after I was my hair. I will definitely keep using it.</li>
            <li> I read online that this makes your hair thick, I read many great reviews on it, so i am trying it.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for natural hair. It strengthens and thickens natural hair. I am not sure what makes it black though.</li>
            <li> Most ppl use this product to grow back thinning hair or bald patches. I never encountered any of these but I use it anyway to keep my hair strong and thick. No product performs miracles. For the ppl that complained about it, you have to change your whole hair regimen and being balanced in other aspects of your life to see change. Diet, exercise, moisturizing, etc. This product works, but you have to work with it. The smell is a bit nuttier than I would like but it&#x27;s nothing toxic and you can always mix it or you a fragrant hair cream on top like shea moisture curl milks. I continue to repurchase this and I also get it in lavender.</li>
            <li> I just started using the product for hair growth.  I like it so far.  I had seen previous post where people complained of the smell and was hesistant to buy it at first.  When I recieved the product and used it, I barely noticed the smell.  The product does tingle for about 5 minutes when first applied, but then it subside.  Overall I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
            <li> Thus far I like the product and the results. Would repurchase and recommend.  Next time I will probaby order one that has a scent like coconut or lavender.  The product is thick as other reviews have indicated but I like that b/c it does help &amp;#34;lay them edges&amp;#34; or sealing ends when rocking a twist and/or braid out.  I have also mixed with other oils like coconut and/or jojoba when using as co-wash, deep conditioning, or with leave-in conditioners.</li>
            <li> Love love love it !!! This stuff is a little sticky like glue but it works my hair is softer and it&#x27;s growing I love it</li>
            <li> I recently purchased this oil,an so far I really like it.  I have african-american relaxed hair that is damaged and dry. This oil is one of the products I use in my hair,and I think it really does make my hair feel much softer than it has been in a long time.</li>
            <li> I just got this like 5 days ago and only used it twice so far. The first time it was sticky like honey or sap. I heated it today with coconut oil and its pretty drippy. Alot of my hair is damaged from bleaching so im trying to grow it a bit faster.. But Iwill let post results later if I see results.:)</li>
            <li> I bought this product primarily to help promote hair growth along my hair line.  I only used little dabs 1-2 times a week since it makes the hair look oily but I really have noticed a difference along my part after 3 weeks.  I use it on my ends as well when they are dry.  It has a distinct smell but it fades and I don&#x27;t notice it after I apply the oil.</li>
            <li> Ok let me start with the fact that I am Hispanic and I have done a lot of damage to my hair due to extensive flat ironing and dying. When I tried I was taken back by the smell and the thickness in consistency.  I was hoping it would help grow out my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I taken back. It helped restore moisture and thickness I had when I was a kid and it has help my hair grow in healthier and stronger. My ends have become more nourished and in the 3 weeks of use only 2 times a week ( bc of smell and oiliness) it works wonders so impressed and recommend this to anyone just remember ti mix it with a lighter oil and warm them up together&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;My hair has grown healthier and stronger because of this, the smell no longer effects me. I have noticed a healthy shine and bounce back in my hair. To use this I mix his with warm coconut oil and essential peppermint oil to stimulate my scalp. The peppermint oil also combats the smell. I leave this on for 24 hours or as long as I can.</li>
            <li> I use this to calm my hair down after I shampoo and condition.  I have been using it on my eyelashes too.  They seem to be growing!!</li>
            <li> I have started to use this product but  so far it is nice.  It feels sticky in your hand but not on your hair, I put it in my spray bottle to spritz my hair during the day.  Will write more after using longer.</li>
            <li> Good oil, I wouldn&#x27;t say it did miracles for my eyelashes but it does make a fantastic cleansing oil</li>
            <li> this was a great buy for my homemade lotions and hair lotions...it keeps my skin and hair looking nice....this is a great buy</li>
            <li> My hair started growing after two weeks.  This plus biotin will give you results.</li>
            <li> i tried it as soon as i got it in, well i think you are suppose to put it on wet hair because i put it on dry hair and it was just a mess. i got it all knotty. all though the smell is horrible i will keep using it if it works:)</li>
            <li> I think that this product is possibly too heavy for thin, fine hair.Even using small dime sized amounts my hair was weighed down and sticky. my hair is arm pit lenth and natural. I tried it on dry hair as well as wet hair, but it did nothing for my hair. Also, using my sulfate free shampoos, I had a difficult time removing the product. Many people swear by this product, but for me, it did nothing for my hair. I was using it to seal moisture but instead I was left with dull, dry lookinh hair. I gave it 3 stars because it did make my hair feel very soft and I love natural products. Unfortunately, I will not repurchase.</li>
            <li> I use this along with almond oil, and pure castor oil on my hair daily, and I really like how it makes my hair feel.</li>
            <li> Very nice product!  Fast shipping!</li>
            <li> They shipped my order within an hour of me placing the order. I ordered it on a Friday morning 4/3 and received my package the following Monday afternoon 4/6.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this to help with my edges and my hair. So far, I really like it! I&#x27;m waiting a few weeks until I measure the growth results of my hair and edges.</li>
            <li> I been using this product for one month and it made my hair so thick and full. However it did not grow my hair long yet, but now I have a head full of hair. My hair is much stronger and once again very thick, so thick i couldn&#x27;t comb my hair. It took me two hours to flat iron my hair today. This oil made my hair very coarse, to the point I want to get a perm but I won&#x27;t because I am trying to be natural. After i wash my hair and blow dry, I rub a nice amount in hand then rub it on my hair. I put the oil in a squeeze bottle with olive oil and I oil my scalp once every other day.</li>
            <li> The best to keep my hair moistorized and a little does go a long way when using it. Absolutely loves it.</li>
            <li> I love this product for multiple reasons.  By background, I am an African American woman.  It really helps with hair growth as well as reducing shedding.  The only problem is that it&#x27;s so thick, so I can only apply two days or so before I wash my hair.  Otherwise, it would weigh the hair down too much.  I also use it to moisturize my feet.  My feet are so soft and callus/shed free.  I would recommend this product to anyone.  I hear there are many uses and I just haven&#x27;t implemented yet, but I will start using for other things as well.  Will definitely repurchase.</li>
            <li> I can tell a big difference in my hair as far as thickness, I never had edges but now I do, I been using for about a month now and will continue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using this product to promote growth of hair along my hairline.  I think it&#x27;s too soon to say whether it&#x27;s a miracle cure :).</li>
            <li> It came on time &amp; in perfect condition. This was my first time trying castor oil. I thought it would aid in helping my hair to grow, I personally saw no growth while using it. But it made my hair healthy, aided in moisturizing, and provided shine and beauty. I would so purchase this again. I liked it a lot.</li>
            <li> Well I purchased this item and it smells a little weird but I think it is working. I tried it twice but I think I need some time for it to really work I will continue to apply and keep updating my results.</li>
            <li> I bought this product about a 3 weeks ago with the intention to use it to increase hair growth around my hairline, combat dry hair, and seal; so far, I&#x27;ve seen a great change in the moisture retention of my hair and the whole feel of it. I was expecting it to have a strong scent since other reviews stated it but it was much less lighter. It has a honey texture; great for coarse and dry hair. I would recommend it to anyone in the market for a new oil and so on. I prefer it to coconut oil. My current favorite!</li>
            <li> I love this product this is my go to oil never let&#x27;s me down....doesn&#x27;t smell too too bad. I always buy this.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it on my eyelashes and my hair.  I saw my eyelashes grow longer and thicker in less than a week.  Hair growth took a little bit longer, but I could see and feel a difference within seven days.  The thing I did immediately notice was that it made my natural hair easier to wet set- and the curls lasted longer.  I&#x27;ve been transitioning from relaxed hair to natural hair for about a year, and it&#x27;s been a fairly simple process.  This made it easier, with no pull at the point of demarcation between the natural and relaxed hair (and I have a LOT of hair.  The relaxed hair was past my shoulders when I started this process, and I don&#x27;t intend to do a big chop, but use a keratin strengthening process that has been working really well.  Note: use a great one by a professional). And I used it while it was still in the braids as a scalp moisturizer.  It&#x27;s relaxed my natural wave pattern.  Now I know why so many Jamaicans have thick, beautiful hair, no matter the texture!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little bit once a week or so.  I&#x27;ve had it for a while, and I think that I only used it one time more than once a week. A little bit goes a really long way.  I use an eye dropper and two or three dropperfuls did my entire head and along the hairline.  Just a tiny dab on my index finger works on my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I saw one review where the reviewer said that it worked great on skin.  I have pretty good skin, so I didn&#x27;t plan on using it for that.  One day, I burned my arm really badly, so I decided to give it a try.  Normally I use vitamin E oil on things like this, but I was out, and figured that this couldn&#x27;t hurt.  The reviewer was absolutely correct. I put just a couple of drops on it, and my arm was like new the next morning.  It stung like a bee at first, but after a few minutes, it was okay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing: I saw some reviewers complain about the smell.  To me, it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable unless my nose was right on the cap or bottle.It dissipates after a few seconds.  You can&#x27;t really smell it in my hair.  I&#x27;m really short, and people are always hugging me and playing in my hair.  I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on the way it smells with my shampoo and conditioner!  Everything from, &amp;#34;Your hair smells so good,&amp;#34; to &amp;#34;Whatever you&#x27;re doing makes your hair smell exotic. I could play in it all day!&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s worth it!!</li>
            <li> My hair, for some reason, doesn&#x27;t respond well to this one. I&#x27;ve read amazing reviews about this, but i didn&#x27;t like it personally. It&#x27;s ok, hence the 3 stars.</li>
            <li> I have never write a review about something before but for this one i have too. I have spend so much money to make my hair grow and after trying this product for only two weeks and i don&#x27;t even apply it every day i can see a lot of improvement in my hair. My edges are growing and i&#x27;m just so excited. i can&#x27;t wait to see how my hair will look like if i have to use this product for the all year. To tell you the truth i&#x27;m one of those people who have tried so many things just to make my hair grow and i was even taking pill but i didn&#x27;t see any improvement that i have seen for these two weeks. This product is the best and trust me if you purchase it you wont regret it. First when i purchased this product i thought it was going to be just like other product even thought i did read people&#x27;s review but im so surprise with the result</li>
            <li> never heard of this oil before but it works great and i recommend this to anyone who has dry scalp issues</li>
            <li> This is a very rich and lush oil.  I use it for conditioning my hair predominately.  I also use on my eye lashes and they grew longer and fuller.  Already order two more bottles.</li>
            <li> I really think this stuff does exactly what I hoped it would. It seems my hair has grown &amp; thickened within like maybe 2-3 weeks of using this oil. However, I must say I also took advice of previous commenters by taking my biotins in conjunction. So, to say the castor oil alone has grown &amp; thickened my hair would probably be a bit exaggerated. Also, the other reason I got this stuff was to regrow out my fairly thin edges on the left near my temple...can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve really seen any improvement there.&lt;br /&gt;Other things you should know I do that may have helped/hendered speed of growth, length or luster:&lt;br /&gt;*I&#x27;m a believer in dirty hair grows best, so I grease my scalp like 1x a week &amp; wash maybe 1x every month or 2. lol, Some of you may think that is so disgusting but, I don&#x27;t get out enough for it to be all that bad.&lt;br /&gt;*I basically diluted my castor oil (like a 1/4 castor to like 1/2 a tube of doo grow hair oil/grease)&lt;br /&gt;*I take biotin by Natures Bounty 5000mcg&lt;br /&gt;and...&lt;br /&gt;*I try not to wear my hair tied up so much. I use clamps, pins or what have you. Staying away from tying up my hair is beneficial sense it is reason I have slightly balding on my edge(s). This is also good to help prevent breakage of hair allowing proper, healthy growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Tropic Isle makers, I&#x27;m excited to see my hair length &amp; luster will be like in the coming future.(with continued use of your product, of course. LOVE THE VALUE. Of Course, I WON&#x27;T BE MAD IF IT&#x27;S MADE CHEAPER, price wise :-)</li>
            <li> this stuff is awasome, repairs damaged hair, softents hair and increases hair growth, a friend told me about this stuff as i have recently had a fire-breathing-accident and part of my beard was destroyed and its awasome, best to use in small amounts, dont care much for smell (smells a little musty) but you get used to it quick and its not bad just odd</li>
            <li> The best stuff for thinning hair edges! It also works very well as a hot oil treatment, natural hair need lots of mosture.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really know what there is to review about this oil, its like asking for a review of olive oil! Lol.. Anyway it came on time and was a little smaller than I envisioned but that&#x27;s fine as I just needed to get my hands on castor oil ad now I have it!</li>
            <li> Along with other products I believe this has aided in my natural hair&#x27;s health and growth.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> i bought 2 bottles about 1 month ago and i love it; it smells like coffee beans. im 10 months post relaxer and it has made my new growh soft and easy to manage. the only thing is that its so expensive. but worth the money!</li>
            <li> I just want to say I really love this stuff. I am natural &amp; I have 4c Type hair.&lt;br /&gt;This oil is really good on your edges to slick them back. So if you dont like&lt;br /&gt;to use Gels &amp; like to use good natural things...Try this you will like it!&lt;br /&gt;But the smell could be better. It kind of smell like BBQ. So if you mix it with&lt;br /&gt;Peppermint oil or Lavender it will give it a better smell.&lt;br /&gt;Please Visit my Website for more good products for Natural hair care.&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this several times since I find it to be a good castor oil, nice consistency makes great hand cream, but you really have to work it in because it is oil.</li>
            <li> Smells really bad, but got her fast and is a great price</li>
            <li> Love this product and seeing improvement in my hair growth.</li>
            <li> Great seller still waiting to see how product works for hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> Thicker than expected . Also I thought it would have a tropical smell lol this was my first time using and I would buy it again . You can use this product 2 to 3 times a week vs everyday bc it&#x27;s so thick . I only use it for my hair</li>
            <li> I recently wore some box braids that pulled my edges out.  It wasn&#x27;t my hairstylist fault. I ended up leaving the braids in for too long so there was buildup and when I took the braid out, my hair was pretty knotted. The knots were so bad that when I tried combing it out, the comb took off chunks of hair around my edges. Of course, I shed a few tears but tears don&#x27;t make your hair grow back so I went to the handy dandy internet for help and found some pretty great reviews of this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I shouldn&#x27;t be writing a review just yet but I&#x27;m honestly already really happy with the results I&#x27;m getting!  The pictures in the left column are from July 19, 2015 and the pictures on the right were taken on July 24, 2015. It hasn&#x27;t even been a week and I can already see a difference!  No, its not drastic but its definitely something. Both, my mom and grandmother, noticed the difference before I showed them any before and after pictures. I&#x27;ve been using JBCO along with emu oil twice a day (when I wake up and right before bed).  Its true that JBCO doesn&#x27;t have the most pleasant smell but its definitely worth it. Plus, after a few minutes, the smell goes away. Also, its not like everyone can smell it when you walk into the room-- they would literally have to sniff your scalp. The consistency is thick so you don&#x27;t need much. On top of that, It makes my curls pop and it adds shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with using this on my edges, I&#x27;ve been using it on my lashes and they&#x27;re longer, fuller and shinier too!  I&#x27;m so happy I decided to give this oil a try. You should try it too. And hey, if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, you&#x27;ve only wasted a few bucks. But don&#x27;t just throw it out, give it to a friend. You might change their life!!</li>
            <li> Love this ish buy it all the time</li>
            <li> this product is good and you only need to use a small amount. I really like the way it improves my hair.</li>
            <li> I am african-american and nothing tames my locks like this oil! It is thick and a little goes a long way. Plus the scent is really mild so it doesn&#x27;t conflict with my perfume. I have already purchased this product twice and will keep getting it for as long as Amazon sells it!</li>
            <li> I love this oil! It heals my hair and it helps making it strong ticker and perfect curls!</li>
            <li> great for softening and sealing moisture, im yet to do a hair growth experiment with this</li>
            <li> This product is great for mixing with other oils however be sure of how you store it so that it doesn&#x27;t get rancid.</li>
            <li> O.M.G This product.. so fabulous! Suuuper fast shipping.! I&#x27;ve been using this bottle for about 3 months now and the way it made my top and bottom eye lashes turn out.. WOW! They&#x27;re so long, dark, fuller just beautiful. I get compliments on my lashes all the time. I&#x27;m going to get an even bigger bottle and start using it on my hair, (: I highly recommend this product. &amp;#60;3</li>
            <li> So far, so good.  I have been using this for my daughters edges that came out from braids.  Stating to work a little will keep using and probable order more.</li>
            <li> Burned/scarred my skin (especially behind my ears). Maybe I&#x27;m just allergic and it&#x27;s not the oil? Dunno.</li>
            <li> I can see some improvement in my hair. I&#x27;m a cancer survivor and trying to get my hair back the way it used to be or close t o it.....wish me luck</li>
            <li> I really like the black castor oil. I used it to pre-poo my hair and it left it feeling very moisturized. I would by it again</li>
            <li> This is oil is wonderful. I dont leave the house without putting this oil on. I live in the northwest, so african american skin gets pretty chappy out here. So yes this oil is life!</li>
            <li> Great for dry skin or to soften your hair.  Probably would be great for babies too.  I would recommend purchasing.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It&#x27;s great for sealing in moisture to your hair!</li>
            <li> Did nothing for me. Does not work for everybody. Now hairfinity works. Go and try that product. Did not like it</li>
            <li> I used this with some other tropic isle products and the combo seems to be working wonders for my hair. The smell is a bit strong at first, though it does not stick to your hair after you wash it out. My normally thick hair was damaged pretty badly after a bad coloring and after using this for 2 weeks with the Jamaucan Black Castor Oil Protein Hair Conditioner I noticed a great improvement. My hair is now growing back faster than it has ever done in the past and feels much healthier and thicker. I have recommended this to my friends and family.</li>
            <li> D&lt;br /&gt;didn&#x27;t work be careful</li>
            <li> It works nicely on my hair and I use it as a gel. Makes my hair nice and shiny. Completely recommend!</li>
            <li> Its is great for your hair, but I get the same effect with NOW Castor oil for a fraction of the price.</li>
            <li> Mix this with other essential oils to add lustor to your mositerizings. Already have it just buying to keep my stock full.</li>
            <li> i use it as it&#x27;s an oil everybody recommend but it&#x27;s really too oily and I don&#x27;t see anything special effect on my hair but I keep buying as I don&#x27;t see any bad effect either</li>
            <li> I received this item very quickly from the seller. I am really happy about my purchase .I haven&#x27;t used this item that long to see any effects jbco may have on me. Honestly I&#x27;m not to sure what&#x27;s the best way to use this to regroup my edges from tight braids. Please anyone?</li>
            <li> Seriously if this product worked wouldn&#x27;t it be recognized by the entire world and be on the front page of a medical magazine?  I don&#x27;t any product out there really helps hair to regrow.</li>
            <li> Very very thick I bought this originally and a treatment for my hair but to be honest it is so thick I can&#x27;t even get it all over my scalp unless I want to spend 20 minutes trying! I don&#x27;t have time for all that when I have plenty of other treatments that work wonderfully and apply with the quickness. (note: I have very fine thin hair!)</li>
            <li> Good moisturizer.  I&#x27;ve used for the last 4 months and hasn&#x27;t really helped the regrowth.  My hair is thinning on the sides &amp; top.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty normal kinda like olive oil but I have been using it in my hair and it also makes my hands really soft</li>
            <li> Love this! My ends are filling in nicely.</li>
            <li> After five weeks of use I already see big improvements in the health of my hair. Less shedding and growth of about an inch. I oil my scalp with JBCO 4 or 5 nights a week, and apply it to my hair after my leave-in and before my styling product. JBCO is rather thick so a little goes a long way. The &#x27;smoky&#x27; smell doesn&#x27;t hang around long after application. I definitely recommend this product and will be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Love the black castor oil. Makes my hair soft and is working to thicken my edges. I&#x27;ve been natural for years now, and sometimes my default ponytail wears on my edges. I use this product all over, but especially on the edges and the crown. Takes some getting used to the smell, but it does not linger.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been dealing with a crazy itchy scalp, so I finally shaved my head to get to the root of the problem.  I just massage some of this JBCO on my head and it keeps it moisturized through out the day.  It&#x27;s kinda thick which is nice because I don&#x27;t want it to absorb into the wigs I wear.  I&#x27;m gonna keep trying it. A friend said that I should mix it with some shea butter along with tea tree oil and that should sooth my scalp as well.  I will probably buy again.</li>
            <li> Love the thick texture</li>
            <li> I love this product smell fresh and feels great on my hair.  I will do a follow up review after a Month of use.  So far so good.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I already have very thick hair, so Im not sure if it helps with that! What it does do is make my hair soooo soft and shiny! Even though I already have long hair, I can wait to see if it helps with growth! Only two weeks in ...</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to this oil because of all the reviews about it. It&#x27;s soooo thick that I feel like it clogs my scalp&#x27;s pores. I love to put a small amount in my hair before flat ironing it and it leaves it super smooth. I&#x27;d use it more if it weren&#x27;t so thick.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed some hair growth...i&#x27;m hoping I&#x27;m not imagining it cuz I need a perm soon..lol. Anyway, this stuff stinks! The smell is a No-Go, but bearable...if u want results, use it!!</li>
            <li> I am so happy with this product! I wanted my eyebrows to regrow since I had over plucked them when I was younger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is easily applied and stays on all night. I have also noticed my hair grows in straight if I use it diligently, because the heavy weight of the oil forces the hairs to move in the right direction! This is AMAZING for eyebrow regrowth since opposite direction growth is so frustrating when it already takes so long to regrow. The hair also grows back stronger, which is also nice since over plucking seems to thin eyebrows out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend using this every other day. I have noticed it ironically dries my skin out where I apply it, and if I use it every day, I will break out right next to where I applied the oil. Apply very very gently as you don&#x27;t want to remove your hair haphazardly in the process. Also, wash your face gently in the morning as well!</li>
            <li> I broke my ankle last winter and still have a lot of pain when I walk. I read some articles that said black castor oil was good for ache and pains as well as hair, skin, lashes and eyebrows. Majority of it is used on my ankle and I can honestly say that the first day I used it the pain went away!  Just to make sure I was&#x27;nt tripping out I had my mother to try it on her ankle and did not say anything eto her about it.  She was in a car accident years ago and her ankle got broke and she has had pain in it every since and nothing seems to help she even have had cortisone shots for it.  After she put it on her ankle she came eto be about 20 min. after and ask what was it because her pain was gone and she wanted more of it!  I gave her half of the bottle and niether one of us have been in pain.  I dont know how well it works for the hair,skin, lashes and eyebrows, but it is GREAT FOR PAIN!</li>
            <li> Will buy from again.  Lays my hair down nicely and I see my hair getting thicker and thicker as I use it.  It&#x27;s not a miracle oil but it does help with repairing and thickening the hair.</li>
            <li> Received this product and it&#x27;s not BLACK CASTOR OIL... PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE IT ...&lt;br /&gt;Contact Seller and educated him on BLACK CASTOR OIL he than instructed me to call the number printed on the label called this So called PHONY Tropic Isle Living and they said Black Castor Oil is indeed dk brown to black color.. this Product was no where near BLACK it&#x27;s in fact similar to Heritage Store Cold pressed CLEAR CASTOR OIL.. If you buy from them you will lose your money. I have Contacted the better business Bureau for this illegitimate company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen on Dr Oz of these Factories selling fake products while using misleading labels ... it&#x27;s a Marketing Strategy that this seller and the number on the label have been Conning out of people&#x27;s money!!! So if you buy this from this seller YOUR A FOOL  ... it&#x27;s not real ITS FAKE!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> did wonders for my lashes</li>
            <li> My hair has grown since using this product. I ordered more.</li>
            <li> Makes your hair soft and fuller at the roots but thats not good for the rest of your hair. My daughter suffers from dry scalp &amp; it does help with that but none of what I listed is why I purchased it. I apply it with a qtip to not over use. There has been no hair growth with usage. It&#x27;s about to be all gone and when that happens I will not replace this brand but may try another for my daughter.</li>
            <li> DONT SEE ANY RESULTS AS OF YET</li>
            <li> This did absolutely nothing for me, but give me an eye infection! Doesn&#x27;t grow hair and they won&#x27;t refund my money. So don&#x27;t fall for their claims!</li>
            <li> Received on time w/ great instructions on how to use via email.</li>
            <li> works really well, would recommend, need to purchase more. . . . . .  . . . . . .</li>
            <li> Used this to get hair to grow. A little goes a long way. Upon first use I put way too much on my hair (not good)! I then mixed it MegaTec and it really worked wonders. I also mixed it with Wild Growth Oil and coconut oil. Like I said a little does go a long way, so becareful. I&#x27;ve seen growth however Im just not the one to keep up with the usage.</li>
            <li> I bought the Tropic Isle Living Jamaican Black Castor Oil (4 ounces) about two weeks ago. I was going to wait longer to review it but I don&#x27;t need to. I apply this twice a day, morning and night, to my eyelashes and brows. In the past, I tried a growth product on my lashes that made them grow but I noticed that my eyesight was getting worse. I don&#x27;t know if that product was the reason or not but I did NOT want to take the chance and quit using it. Along comes the black castor oil. I apply it by putting some on my index finger and then holding my finger up to my eye and blinking it on, as if my finger was a mascara brush. This coats the lashes and the oil naturally and slowly drips down to the lash line. (Note that when it gets IN the eyes it doesn&#x27;t sting at all.) Then I run the remainder of the oil on my finger over my lower lashes. When I started, about 10 days ago, I could not see my eyelashes. They were just stubs. They have grown now to over half an inch and are looking good. My brows were always a problem area and I could not grow any hair at the inner corners AT ALL. Now, hairs are sprouting in that area (new hair!) and the rest of my brows are thicker and more defined. This is a miracle treatment for me. It also works on any dry skin patches and as a cuticle softener and hand lotion. It absorbs into the skin and is not sticky or greasy, telling me my body really needs this product. People say the smell is bad. Mine is VERY mild and reminds me of incense, not ashes. Bottom line is with consistent use, it works like a charm. Plus the bottle comes sealed which is an added security feature for me. I won&#x27;t be without it now...always finding new uses for it. A little goes a long way - the bottle still looks full, too. Great value! It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 3/7/2013  I just want to say that this was not a shot in the dark. My lashes are healthier and longer and stronger than ever. I also use this on my dry hands and it is healing. Once in a while, I do a facial treatment with it. The Living Black Castor Oil is amazing! In addition, this 4 oz bottle is still 3/4 full. You can&#x27;t beat this!al treatment with it. The Living Black Castor Oil is amazing! In addition, this 4 oz bottle is still 3/4 full. You can&#x27;t beat this!</li>
            <li> I was told about this product from family and friends. i have been sing it on my tow daughters hair and mine as well. Thank you so much. I just ordeed another for a friend at church</li>
            <li> I was astonished with the results. In a little of few days I took notice how incredibly thick and stronger my hair felt! I&#x27;ve read previous reviews and many people seem to complain about this product being too greasy or it has a stench to it. This is what I did; first I washed my hair twice with shampoo only after allowing it to air dry I parted my hair into sections beginning with the lower region and as strange as it may sound I used a hair dye brush applicator to brush the product onto the roots of my hair. Finally, I placed a plastic cap over my head and a role just.in case any would get on the pillow and WALLAH! After waking up in the morning I thought to myself, &amp;#34;How on earth am I going to get this out of my hair?!&amp;#34; It was incredibly greasy. Nevertheless I used Mane n Tail conditioner and it worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was very thin, dead, and had multiple split ends after using this product I can proudly say I&#x27;ll purchase again.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen the amazing growth results everyone has been talking about yet, but I CAN tell the difference in the moisture level of my scalp versus the routine I had before. It is thick the way folk describe, and it smells very different, but the thickness actually works for me, so I&#x27;m fine with that. I&#x27;ve used it as both a hot oil treatment and regular moisturizer; for the latter, I cut it with other oils (coconut, jojoba, vitamin E) and it works fine.</li>
            <li> I have been searching high and low to find something to thicken my hair i have been using this product for approximately  two weeks and it is amazing i can feel the texture of my hair changing instantly i love it and woudl definitely recommend it to others. great purchase</li>
            <li> It might not smell the best, but this oil gives my hair everything it needs. My dry itchy scalp has calmed down and my natural hair is left soft and moisturized.</li>
            <li> I never liked the thought of castor oil because I&#x27;ve seen on youtube that it causes a lot of shedding. Thankfully with my genetics and love for garlic, I shed significantly less than the average human being so I gave this product a try. I have been using it for the month of January to help even out my hair length and it has worked wonders. There isn&#x27;t a smell to this product necessarily and I applied it every night 3-5 times a week. It&#x27;s the perfect balance: not too thick and not too thin. Gave it to my mom to test out; definitely should give this a try. I am willing to purchase it again and hopefully will get similar results.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t what I expected...don&#x27;t like the smell.  I would return it, but I tossed the envelope.  I thought it would have a nice fragrance, but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product based on reviews I&#x27;ve seen on YouTube about how this product grows your hair. I&#x27;m a licensed cosmetologist and I know that on average hair grows up to a half of an inch a month so I&#x27;m not really convinced about miracle growth products. However, sometimes our (African American) hair do not grow the average due to damage, genetics, and other factors. I&#x27;ve experienced damage to my hair due to using relaxers and not maintaining my hair properly (I know shame on me!). However, when I began using this product, I noticed that my hair became thicker, shinier, and began to grow more! I&#x27;m impressed!  I also use it on my daughter&#x27;s hair and my face as a moisturizer combined with coconut oil. Excellent product and will recommend to my clients. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only con is that it can leave a sticky residue. You may want to use it at night but I noticed if you combine the coconut oil, it won&#x27;t be as sticky. Overall, you&#x27;ll love this product!</li>
            <li> I am waiting to see results, but the smell is not pleasant.  I have seen a lot of reviews so I am being patient.</li>
            <li> I love this product. My hair is much thicker than 8weeks ago. This is my second order and now I am trying to find this product locally. Wonderful product.</li>
            <li> it is really great!!! shipment was right on time so this is good seller to go through. the product is really doing wonders on my edges of my hair because has thicken my edges really really  good because they have always been so thin.</li>
            <li> very good product my hair feels very soft and radiant. I will be ordering this product again.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! I&#x27;ve been natural for 7 months and have been looking for an oil that I could use in my LOCO method on my 4 C hair. I&#x27;ve used it once and I definitely felt a change in the moisture retention of my hair, my hair was soft, bouncy, it didn&#x27;t leave my hair oily, and the waves that was created from the hair bands i used to stretch my hair were perfect. I&#x27;m definitely going to stash this in my Hair Gold pile.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I mix it with Kinky Curl, Jojoba Oil  and aloe vera to moisturize my hair.</li>
            <li> I Like this oil. Like most black castor oil it is very heavy. I use it to seal in moisture.</li>
            <li> Good price and it is very good!</li>
            <li> this product is a too thick for me and my girls. i would not put it in my hair or my girls ever again. going to stick with coconut oil 100% pure.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m loving it so far.</li>
            <li> I put it on my eyelashes at night before bed and it works.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve seen new growth on my edges after using for only 2 weeks! I&#x27;ve also noticed that my hair is crazy soft and so much more manageable. This is definitely now a staple item.</li>
            <li> it was what i ordered but the smell was a little much. but i did get what i ordered, no instrction on how to use</li>
            <li> Once mixed with my various array of oils (coconut, grape seed, olive oil, and tea tree) this product gave me a good amount of moisture to my extremely dry psoriasis scalp. I would definitely recommend mixing it with other oils though or else it will take forever to come out of your hair.</li>
            <li> I have just used two week, so I just notice it makes my hair softer. I will continue  use it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to help regrow my temple hair, which was ripped out by tight, weave-enhanced cornrows.  When I say ripped out, I mean ripped out -- folicles and all, to the point that it was just shiny skin.  I put this stuff on it maybe three times a week and in two weeks I had a reasonable amount of hair there, and in four weeks the hair was the length it was pre-cornrows.  Maybe it as my natural hair growth cycle, I don&#x27;t know.  But I had my temple hair ripped out by weave six years ago and it took two months for it to grow back.  So I&#x27;m going to give this black castor oil the credit.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m about two thirds through my first bottle and I must say that I&#x27;m very pleased with the results from using this product. I have very dry scalp and this product helped a lot in that area. Furthermore, it gave my hair a brilliant shine. Castor oil in general is very good for hair, even the damaged variety. Way back in 7th grade, I got my hair relaxed for the first time and it broke off within half-a-year. My  father and grandmother (both Jamaicans) recommended Castor oil for my damaged, patchy hair. Within a year and a half, I regrew my natural hair and my scalp and hair were back to a healthy state. Now as adult, I follow the footsteps of my wise elders (lol) and use this to prevent damage and add moisture to my hair.  However, I must warn you that this stuff itches like crazy if it left on the scalp for too long. Definitely wash hair within 8-10 hours of rubbing on the scalp.</li>
            <li> First and foremost, I&#x27;ve been natural for 2 years and my 4b hair has been fairly healthy throughout the entire time and is currently shoulder length. I decided to use this product to seal moisture and grow in some thin edges… let me tell you that this product is no joke. I absolutely love it. I&#x27;ve read a couple of the 1 star reviews (being nosey...lol) and although I feel for those people, all I can say is Lies they tell!! Not only has my already healthy hair grown, it has never been softer, no other oil provides the sealing protection, softness and itchy scalp relief as this. However, I will caution that a cap full is more than enough for one entire head full of hair. If you have short hair, use much less; a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a hair oil to stimulate growth and thickness and this worked. I am well pleased that I use it on my granddaughter&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li> This has really helped me grow my edges back. It does not work over night, it will take some time for this product to work.</li>
            <li> Great for you hair.  Have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I almost gave this product an unfavorable review when I first received it. It is clear, and the smoke odor was almost non-existent. I thought I had been ripped off, but I am glad I decided to try it any way because this stuff really does do as people have claimed as far as helping hair to regrow.</li>
            <li> This castor oil made my hair so soft! I also added it to my conditioner! I&#x27;ve been using to for 3 months now and my hair has done a full 360 turn around! And its gotten REALLY THICK!!!! TRY IT</li>
            <li> I just got this.  I&#x27;ve used it twice, so I can&#x27;t really give a \\&quot;review\\&quot; of the product&#x27;s performace or efficacy, but I can comment on the \\&quot;smell\\&quot; or odor that people complain about.&lt;br /&gt;THERE IS NO ODOR!  It&#x27;s castor oil for pete&#x27;s sake!  It&#x27;s smells like castor oil.&lt;br /&gt;No big deal.  Once you put it on your scalp or hair, you can&#x27;t even smell it.&lt;br /&gt;And the texture of this oil is not \\&quot;heavy\\&quot; either.&lt;br /&gt;This brand is \\&quot;lighter\\&quot; than the castor oils I&#x27;ve used in the past.  It dissolves quickly.&lt;br /&gt;I will add to this review at a later date if and when I get results, if any.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:&lt;br /&gt;01-14-12&lt;br /&gt;Observations:  WHY is this product called \\&quot;black\\&quot;?  This castor oil is CLEAR, like all other castor oils.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great!  It saved my edges.  I have locs, and my edges were thinning a bit.  This thickened and grew my edges back in no time with daily use.  Be sure to wet your hair first.  The only thing I dislike about this product is the smell.  It smells like I&#x27;ve been standing over a campfire.</li>
            <li> i take these very day along with garlic pills.  These were recommended with the hair regime.  It&#x27;s only been a couple weeks.  I am waiting out the results.</li>
            <li> Buying this until I die or I have no hair left.</li>
            <li> Great product...Works like a charm</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It helps tame my frizzy hair. My hair is softer and healthier than before. I haven&#x27;t used it long enough, so I am sure if will grow my hair.  One bottle last very long time.</li>
            <li> This is the best! I use it for my hair and face a little goes a long way. I also use it on my toddler hair to help with the thinning and it was grown in all the spots.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 24, and my hair had stopped growing a few months ago. This year has been ridden with stress and I have lost hair constantly, and struggled to grow it any longer than it currently is. Not only did it cease to grow, but I kept getting split ends everywhere, even after I had stopped straightening my hair and began only using natural products. It&#x27;s ridiculous how stress can physically affect your body, isn&#x27;t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After looking at a few options I decided to try this out, as it seemed inexpensive and not harmful like so many others.&lt;br /&gt;This oil really works. I have only been using this product for about a month and a half. It keeps my hair thick and moisturized and my hair has already grown a few inches!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I wash my hair, I let it air dry and then lather a small amount throughout. Be sure to massage it onto your scalp, as I feel this is where it is most effective.</li>
            <li> Great product to strengthen natural hair. I usually thin it out with almond oil</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I see any different, maybe and I think I can always use the cheaper version which cost about 2dollars</li>
            <li> I love this product. I see the results already in my hair. Delivery was quick.</li>
            <li> I was very pleased with the product. It met my expectation.</li>
            <li> Ok so this is 100percent real and im totally not paid for this or anything like that...this is my honest opinion...JBCO is worth a shot yess it made my hair shed bt i notice i was applyin too much you really dont need much in your hair. My hair is natural and im african american JBCO kept my hair feelin soft and fluffy when applied correctly when theres too much hair does fil a lil sticky...ummm i used it a lil over a month so far i believe if i continue i will see summ better results noo its not a miracle oil bt its pretty good for the hair my hair FEELS thicker and looks a little fuller nw...when i first used it my scalp did itch n tingle i used this for hair growth i havent seen a big difference yet ima try to mix it with biotin n c wat happens i plan to see how my results with olive oil will b like after i finish my JBCO btw i am a female....its NOT a MIRACLE OIL bt you should really give it a try...also i applied it to a part in my hair that was really thinnin and so far its fillin up sllowwly bt i do believe if i continue it will fade away</li>
            <li> This product came very quickly and i couldnt wait to use it. it does have a little werid smell but nothing i can handle. i used this product in my hair and my eyebrows that i plucked to much. my eyebrows are growing in places they wouldnt before and i have been using it on and off for the past month at night. I use it also in my natural hair before i co wash and it seems to be helping my scalp alot. Ireally like this product and plan to purchase again really soon</li>
            <li> I love this product for my hair. I experience so much growth! Has a slight smell but it&#x27;s castor oil, it doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
            <li> Still have it dont use much, weighs down hair.</li>
            <li> Definitely makes my hair thick when I&#x27;m using it. I&#x27; hopeful this translates into eventually growing thicker hair. It is exactly what it says it is....castor oil. I have light brown hair and it works just fine. Does not change hair color.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for and I received it very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this oil. I use it on my son&#x27;s hair because it was thinning and weak but after using this on his hair for a month it got thicker and healthier looking.</li>
            <li> I just received this before Xmas. My son told me that girls use this on their hair and I will try it and revise thus review soon enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was definitely safely packaged just the way i like it. SUPERB bubble wrap</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to still give it a try and see if my hair grows, but its hard to even apply it considering how thick it is. It spreads like honey and the greasy feeling stays in your hair until you wash it. I bought it specifically because i read reviews saying it went on your hair and spread easily.  Also, the smell is not something you want lingering in your hair if it did go on easy.&lt;br /&gt;I regret not reading the most recent reviews instead of the good ones.</li>
            <li> I love the thick consistency of castor oil. I&#x27;ve been using it in my hair and I love the way my hair looks and feels as a result. As a kid I hated this stuff, but it was probably because I didn&#x27;t use it it in my hair. Love it!</li>
            <li> This has been so helpful for many different things. For starters, it makes my new hair growth much thicker. I just mix a bit of it with an oil or in a creme and it works wonders. I keeps my hair so moisturized and soft.&lt;br /&gt; I also started mixing a bit of it into my lotion and cremes and it has made my skin very smooth and a bit clearer than it was before....it led to want to try mixing it into making a body scrub and it works!!! I love to make a scrub from brown sugar,aloe vera, salicylic acid and a bit of castor oil and put it on, and it leaves my skin soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have known about this product for years, but was very skeptical because of the thickness, I thought it would weigh my hair down and make it sticky. I was so fed up with my hair being dry, and not retaining any length. I have thyroid disease, which makes my hair very dry and brittle, I have tried everything you can imagine, glycerine, coconut oil. almond oil, carol&#x27;s daughter, olive oil, etc. I finally gave in to temptation, this is the best thing that has ever happened to my hair, after just one week, my hair is soft as cotton,no more breakage. I washed my hair, added leave in conditioner, then applied a little black castor oil to my hair while still damp, let it air dry and it was soft, I was really surprised, I thought for sure it would be dry. I am really pleased with this product, I hate that I waited so long to try it. I am sure I will be able to retain length with continuous us of this product. Thanks Tropic Isle...</li>
            <li> I would have to come back to see if there&#x27;s any new hairgrowth as a result of this product. It was odorless despite the brownish color, and it doesnt leave a flaky buildup like regular castor oil, so I can use it daily.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had the product for a couple weeks so, it&#x27;s a little too early to tell if it will help with growing my hair around my temples but, I am hoping based on the comments I read.  I can tell you that it has made my coarse hair very soft.  I use a very small amount in the palm of my hand and massage through my hair and scalp.  I added lavendar oil because the smell was a little oily but, I like the product so far.  My hair is very dry and normally soaks up any moisture.  I am applying this twice a week and it&#x27;s moisturizing my hair well. I am giving it 4 stars for that accomplishment alone! If it grows my hair longer, I&#x27;ll come back and update my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 14, 2013 - Update&lt;br /&gt;I decided to update my review since I have posts from people wanting to know about the product.  Thank you for your questions.  This product is still working well for me.  I have been using it for a little over a year and it has produced re-growth in the weakened areas around my hairline and, especially, in the back of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still use the product twice a week and immediately apply it after washing.  I do not use heat elements on my African-American hair and wear it natural so the product is wonderful at keeping my thick, coarse hair soft and reducing breakage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of caution, this product is very thick and oily so, be sure it is absorbed before laying your head on any linens or furniture. The first day of application I always wear a turban.</li>
            <li> I USE THIS AS AN ALL PURPOSE OIL, RECENTLY BURNT MY ARM :-( PUT THIS ON MY BURN AND IT HEALS MUCH FASTER AND MY SKIN LOOKS LIKE THERE WAS NOT EVEN A BURN</li>
            <li> I love the texture of this stuff. It has a honey-like consistency and color. It doesn&#x27;t smell like honey though. It has a burnt smell that takes a little getting use to.&lt;br /&gt;I am using it to seal my ends (I&#x27;m a natural with 4b hair) and I love it! My ends have never felt or looked this amazing. This is definitely a product to pick up if you need something to seal your ends with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Edit 1/27/2014**&lt;br /&gt;I originally said in this review that I was using this for an hair growth oil. I discontinued use for that purpose- I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. It however is still an AMAZING seal to use on the ends of my hair. Definitely pick this up if that&#x27;s what your looking for.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s making my hair grow like crazy. Use it with other oils.</li>
            <li> I have hypothyrodism and now going through menopause. I originally bought this in attempt to help with hair loss on my head. I used it 2-3 times a week overnight for approximately two months. It did not help with hair loss. It did seem to make my hair slightly less dry and shiner. I also tried it on my brows, lashes, and nail cuticles. When I put it on my lashes and brows every night I do notice a little more fullness. I rub it into my cuticles after I give myself a manicure.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping great price</li>
            <li> It makes your hair thick and long</li>
            <li> so far i like it, this is my first time purchasing this product, it has a distinct smell to it but tolerable. i bought it to regrow and thicken hair line, edge.</li>
            <li> Good stuff so far for what I need it for and I will be buying more.</li>
            <li> Kind of think but works like magic</li>
            <li> I tried this as well as the regular castor oil, I love them both but would probably prefer this one over the other one. This one cost a couple of dollars more but it works better in my opinion. I have natural hair and my edges were thinning from a hairstyle that I had that was too tight, this grew my edges back almost completely in 45 days, I could see some growth after 2 days. I also put this on my eyebrows for fullness and have friends that rub a little on their eyelashes. I had no problems with shedding like I have read in other reviews. This is my 3 bottle that I have ordered. The only slight problem I had was a small amount of leakage when shipped.</li>
            <li> I have tried them all and find this to be the best. It has cured the dryness in my 4b narural hair. It also makes my thin hair thick. My 2year search is over for what my hair needs. Black Jamacian Castor Oil is the best ever!</li>
            <li> Strange I have reviewed this at least three tomes, maybe my opinions are going back to Jamaica? It is an amazing at what it&#x27;s uses are all for, a lot of cure alls in one product, bonus there. For the hair it is thick so you do not need alot. Ilike to use after a hot bath as it soaks into your damp skin and you can really reap the rewards, especially before bed when your body recharges and heals. Strong believer in oils, and great to chase away dry skin!</li>
            <li> Very good oil for a very dry scalp.</li>
            <li> Love how this goes on my hair. I just hate that the bottle is so small. Hope I see results in growth though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the product every other night for the past two weeks but I haven&#x27;t seen any change.  Maybe it&#x27;s too early to make a conclusion.  I&#x27;ll keep using it to see if I get any results.</li>
            <li> Before purchasing JBCO I researched it for about a year.  WHY OH WHY did it take me so long to purchase?!!!!  This is a must have staple within your head to toe daily beauty regime!  It has a faint peanutty type of smell, but it&#x27;s nothing that I can&#x27;t deal with.  When I&#x27;m using this on my scalp and hair, whether it&#x27;s before bed or styling for the day, once I use it, I spray my hair with Palmer&#x27;s Olive Oil with Vitamin E hair spray because it has a nice clean smell that gives my hair that high gloss sheen all day long.  You will see results with this product so be patient.  Everyone&#x27;s hair grows at a different pace.  It also depends on how much and how often you apply this product.  I also use it on my eyelashes and around my eyes for my night moisturizer, as well as for blemishes, dry cracked skin, cuts, burns, it is an all purpose beauty secret.  A little goes a long way.  BUY IT, USE IT AND SPREAD THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT IT ~ ENJOY!!!</li>
            <li> I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY HAIR,LOVE IT,IT CAME EARLY I WAS REALLY PLEASED WITH THE SERVICE.GOOD FOR UR HAIR AND SKIN</li>
            <li> I mixed this oil with the protein conditioner. It made my fiance hair thicker and regrew my edges but that&#x27;s about it.</li>
            <li> I use  this oil for my edges , in my pre poo and deep conditioner as well as a sealant. will buy again as well as recommend it to anyone.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I heard it was a great oil for natural hair. I must admit I have used it all and had to order a bigger bottle. I love the thickness of this oil and it&#x27;s not greasy at all... my hair is growing and it&#x27;s healthy</li>
            <li> Ive experienced thinning hairline and non-existant edges most of my adult years. Ive even went to see a dermatologist for scalp treatments. It helped some but not much. She pretty much told me this is what I would have to live with from years of getting my hair braided. I recently went natural to try to get my hair healthy and just simply embrace my natural hair. I read on many natural hair blogs about this product. I was reluctant at first but decided to give it a try. I am sooooooooo happy I made the decision to go forward. Ive been using it for a few weeks now. Wasnt really sure whether it was working or not, but just figured I would give it time. I decided to dye my hair a week and a half ago, to give my hair a POP. Within days, like 3 or 4. I started to notice growth. It was easy to point out because my hair was now a chestnut blonde but the \\&quot;new hair\\&quot; looked black. It kind of reminded me of when a man shaves and you see the little stubble growing back. This was all over my head not just the hair line. I was so amazed but the product I was calling all my family and friends telling them. Oh and I had to show it off it. I would part my hair so they could see it. My mother was like what is that in your hair, I said NEW HAIR growing. Immediately she said whatever you are using I want some. Needless to say, i have about 3 or 4 people who have already said they want in. This will forever be a product in my stable.</li>
            <li> So far so good on this product I just don&#x27;t like the smell but it is doing wonders for the growth of my locs I love the product</li>
            <li> I started my Healthy Hair Journey in 2010 and when I first heard of this product I had to order it. My crown area had always been thin (I think it runs in my family) but when I started using the Jamaican Black Castor oil, a month later my hair had grown in sooooo thick in my crown.  It really works. Especially if you have a good regimen. A must have product!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!!!! I will be purchasing a larger bottle SOON!! I love how quickly it absorbs into my scalp!</li>
            <li> After reading all the reviews on this product, I thought it would help my hair grow. It&#x27;s been about two months of daily use and I haven&#x27;t seen any extra growth on scalp. I do use it on my eyelashes at night tho, and I have noticed growth there.</li>
            <li> I am only on my first bottle but so far working great ..I can tell the difference in my hair texture I&#x27;m starting to love it. smell not that great but bearable.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time getting moisture to stay in my hair, whether it&#x27;s winter or summer. What I have found that works is sealing with a heavy oil and baggying at night or during the day. I have also changed some of my hair habits, such as using cold water to rinse the conditioner out of my hair and using non-silicone conditioners.</li>
            <li> This is a heavy (thick) oil but when used properly it is great at moisturizing and adding softness.  My hair, lashes feel very conditioned and soft.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little sticky. I would not recommend it for those with relaxed African American hair (unless you want your hair to feel weighed down). I have &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; non-chemically treated hair and I only apply it to my scalp. After I wash my hair and apply it to my scalp, it feels really sticky. It doesn&#x27;t bother me as much because I suppose it&#x27;s good for my really dry, dandruff prone scalp. I can not give it credit for any unusual hair growth spurt, as I had read in other reviews.</li>
            <li> I combine this product with megatek for the complete hair growth serum and it works amazingly</li>
            <li> I love it!!! I literally had no hairline after tight weaves and heavy braids, now my hairline is back n strong after just a month and half of use</li>
            <li> love it, keeps my hair so mostiurezd  and did thicken my hair and take chemicles out of my hair since im going natural</li>
            <li> Love this product of supply gave me free I would be happy lol</li>
            <li> it is really  good  use on skin  I had a growth on my chest and I use it on the growth and it disappear after about 6 months was so happy that i  didnot have to hav it cut off</li>
            <li> Great for helping your hair grow. During one peak time my hair grew 4 inches in 2 months! Also my hair was a little thin around the temples and it&#x27;s grown back much thicker.</li>
            <li> perfect for my hair. very good product!!</li>
            <li> It came fast! I am starting to use it now. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I apply this oil on my edges every night before going to bed, but I&#x27;m definitely seeing results. And they were quick to sent in my product. Satisfied.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very nice, just don&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
            <li> All this hype about \\&quot;castor oil thickens hair\\&quot; or \\&quot;it fills in bald spots\\&quot;......well I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just my hair (or maybe genetics) but this ish DID NOT, i repeat, DID NOT, do CRAP for me. Or even the regular castor oil from CVS. I bought this JBCO back in March and now it&#x27;s July and none of my bald spots are gone :( I massaged it every other day in the areas with bald spots for at least 30 or so days and I did not notice any improvement. Now keep in mind, I&#x27;ve worn my hair out in protective styles and no braids at all. I applied it on my eyebrows daily and still nothing. My hair is currently natural (very kinky) but as far as I can remember, growing up, I always had less hair around my temples and at the back. For 8 yrs until last summer, I would keep my hair braided back-to-back with a few days of hair rest (yea yea yea, that&#x27;s pretty bad) and on top of that, my hair was probably never healthy. So I don&#x27;t know....I&#x27;m just disappointed. I had HIGH HOPES that this oil would do wonders for me according to these reviews and other natural hair forums I&#x27;ve read.</li>
            <li> I love it for my hairline and ends of my hair.  Its a very think oil that is good for my thick curly hair.  Others complain about the smell, but I have no problem with it.  Have and will purchase it again.</li>
            <li> This was my first time ordering this product and it met my expectation. My daughter uses it also for my grandchildren.</li>
            <li> Not quite what I hear or read about, but okay product. I would purchase again and the next time may dilute it with other oils.</li>
            <li> My friend introduced me to this product, so I wanted to purchase it for myself and see what I thought. This castor oil is incredible and makes my hair very soft, shiny and healthy! I&#x27;m definitely going to purchase more!</li>
            <li> put it in my hair every now and then- waiting for hair growth..... I have put some on my mustache to form a gohtee and it is starting to connect.... I have also used this for foot itch and ache and it works... this really is a all round healer.... &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a while now and I have not experience the growth that people speak of.  Besides that, I don&#x27;t notice anything different about this oil as opposed to the other natural oils for the hair.</li>
            <li> I love this JBCO.  I find the texture not as sticky and heavy as the other regular castor oil I have. I have very thick, coily, dense, often dry, natural AA hair. I live in dry southern Cali.  My hair loves this stuff. My hair is moist and has been growing like a weed. I am going to purchase an even bigger bottle soon. I put it in a little applicator bottle and put it on scalp and on my hands to rub in my hair.  For me, being natural for 10 months, it is a God-send.  I am no longer searching high and low for a miracle product. This stuff is the truth!!</li>
            <li> I love this product for my natural hair! It can have multiple uses for your hair; makes it soft &amp; promotes growth. I have noticed a big difference in my hair since I have started using JBCO. The product arrived much sooner than I expected.</li>
            <li> The best oil on the market for transitioning or natural hair.  Use consistently, you will see a difference in your hair strength and growth.  Just don&#x27;t overuse.  Use small amount while hair is wet and allow hair to dry naturally.  It is also healthy for your scalp’s healthy.</li>
            <li> NEEDS TO BE MIXED WITH SOMETHING OR ONLY USE A LITTLE BIT! DOES GREAT STUFF FOR UR HAIR ,MAKES IT THICKER</li>
            <li> I was losing my hair every day during the shower, while I comb my hair and so and so. I ordered this oil (delivery was very fast), the same day I received I put an small amount in my finger and give a 3 minutes massage in the scalp and I let it dry on my hair hours before I go to bed because this oil is very STICKY and smell very BAD, and I dIdn&#x27;t want to leave stains on my pillow.  Same day I put some oil into my hair shampoo  and conditioner bottle.  So next morning I rinse my hair as usual I put shampoo and conditioner and I noticed there is no hair in the drain and nothing came off when I comb my hair.  Nothing else but no hair loss. NO MIRACLES.  Good for me, Not good for other people.  I will continue using this product and I will put my feedback in about 30 days to see if this oil is really working or not.</li>
            <li> The shipping was standard. It arrived about 5-7 days after I ordered it. I purchased the product to grow out my hair edges. I seen a couple of reviews on youtube about how wonderful it was. My edges did grow back some, but not as fast as everyone claims, and it wasn&#x27;t really noticeable. I&#x27;ve only used it a month. I will try it for another 2 months to see.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t used the black castor oil yet, but bought it at the recommendation of a friend. Hopefully, I&#x27;ll have positive results.</li>
            <li> I love this oil, and my hair has grown alot since using it.  I have alopecia, it hasn&#x27;t cured the slick spot in my hair, but it has helped with the thinning along my edges.  I also use emu oil and aragan oil mixed together in a bottle.</li>
            <li> Bought it to help thinning areas and heal scalp damage. The smell takes some getting used to but other than that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
            <li> This is another great product it really works!  its a little thick like all castor oils so a little goes a long way.  i began using JBCO to make my hair denser in certain areas.  My hair and scalp had a lot of damage with all the perms, weaves, drying products, and by my not knowing how to care for my hair properly.  I apply this oil to my scalp at least 2 xs per week and massage my scalp for about 10 minutes after that. I&#x27;m happy to say that I can feel new hair growth in those less dense areas.  Give it a try, its also good to use to prevent or minimize dandruff.</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor oil works really well for locks  it helps seal the locks really well. if you you have loose edges it really does a good job keeping those edges smooth and flat. I was very happy with the results and friends and coworkers could see a difference in my hair. :) It is a bit strong when it comes to the smell so I caution the smell, you might want to open a few windows because the smell is pretty strong but it works really well and I am happy with the results that I got after using it. I loved it!!</li>
            <li> I believe in natural products.. and this product is truth .. hope you guy enjoy as much as I do..</li>
            <li> so far i see a difference in my four year old edges..i put it on her edges everynight or every morning..its very thick so you just need a lilttle bit..i would by this again and it does work</li>
            <li> Great for my natural hair and scalp. A friend told me about this product and she told me I&#x27;d love it and I do</li>
            <li> Once you get past the smell it&#x27;s good. It&#x27;s thick and I like that. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad but definitely not the best thing either.</li>
            <li> I ORDERED ONE THING AND RECEIVED ANOTHER....I WANTED THE JAMAICAN BLACK CASTOR OIL AND RECEIVED THE SHAMPOO INSTEAD.....OMG!!! WELL I GUESS THIS SITE IS NOT FOR ME . NOT STARTING OFF ON THE RIGHT FOOT.</li>
            <li> You all may not believe this but I just got this product 3 days ago and I already see improvement in my hair! I used it 3 days in a row (my hair is like a sponge and so it absorbs everything lol) And I literally just took a shower and washed my hair and let me tell you, it is SO soft, full and thicker than it was 3 days ago before I started using JBCO!I really can&#x27;t believe it! I am newly transitioning natural (going on 4 months in) with about 1-2 inches of new growth. I am also in the Castor Oil challenge with Kinkycurlycoilyme.com. If I am already seeing this great of results I can&#x27;t wait til 3 months down the road or even longer! Def. worth ordering. I all ready ordered a sec. bottle to have on deck once I use up this one!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;hearts;</li>
            <li> I got this product because I have been transitioning since Feb 2012 and I had a lot of breakage and shedding and I did not want to do the BIG CHOP, I did some research on U-tube and everyone swore by it, I have thin, chemically processed hair for 20 or more years, and I have to truly say that this product has thickening my hair in the crown areas where it was thining out. It is very thick, so I mix it with coconut, jojoba or avocado oils. I use it only once a week and I have seen wonderful results. I will be buying more of this product and will see what other ways I can use it.</li>
            <li> Well I just received my castor oil, it&#x27;s a small cute bottle and very thick when I touched it. The  packaging was well protected of the merchandise. I will be using it today and will update tomorrow on my use review :)</li>
            <li> I was under the impression that the bottle would be glass and not plastic.  This way the product will not get diluted or absorb into the plastic.  I haven&#x27;t tested the product yet. We will see if it is of good quality.</li>
            <li> this product is way to thick for ur hair.. i used it cuz it was recommended for growing hair but this is like putting grease in your hair</li>
            <li> I purchased the black castor oil for my hair, but have found out that it is good for skin and scalp conditions. I have been applying a small amount to my  thin hairline about 3x a week, I mix the castor oil with jojoba oil to thin it out and to reduce the smell of the castor oil. My hairline has thickened and I see an increase in overall abundance of hair. I recently began applying it to my skin when my eczema flares up and have found some relief. This oil is thick, so a little goes a long way. The only negative is the smell but it is not so strong that people would smell you coming.</li>
            <li> This oil is great!! It made my hair soft and I haven&#x27;t prem my hair in three months. When I use this oil you cant even tell..it doesn&#x27;t have a smell to it at all. It ls a thick oil and it gives my hair a shin that lasts all day. I don&#x27;t feel a tingle when I put it In my hair like the other reviews said. I like to use the oil at night when I wrap My hair.</li>
            <li> I started using this off and on and although I have not been consistent I see progress. I mix this oil with argan oil and peppermint oil, it makes my hair feel great, and it makes my hair thicker. I guess of I was more consistent I would see even more of a result.</li>
            <li> Item was shipped fast and is good quality.</li>
            <li> Item was shipped quickly; was please with the product.</li>
            <li> Making my hair grow like crazy! Love this stuff!</li>
            <li> Gross. Took me 5 washes to get the smell and oil out of my hair</li>
            <li> I have been using the JBCO for less than a week. I am transitioning to no heat styles because my hair has been over processed from years of excessive heat from hot combs. My hair is more manageable (fine 4B/C texture) with less breakage. I will give updates on my progress.    The BIG deal is that JBCO works well for my arthritic joints. I can&#x27;t use NSAIDS, Tylenol, or aspirin for pain. I manage my pain with diet (no wheat, corn, sugar, etc.) and gentle exercise. Even still, I get aches, especially in the middle of the night. Last night I rubbed some JBCO oil on my knees. In a few minutes I was able to go back to sleep, no more pain. The oil seems to absorb into the skin after a few minutes. This works better than the capsacin creams which can get into the eyes after applying the cream in the middle of the night.    Also this oil is excellent for rough cuticles and  heels. Apply the oil at night, put on socks and/or gloves, and awaken to softer, smoother skin. I am keeping this little bottle by my night stand and hope to never run out of it. That being said, for the people who are anti- oil or don&#x27;t like the feel of heavy oil,  this may not be the product for you    Update:  A note of caution as far as frequency and amount of oil to be used. Since castor oil is absorbed into the skin (laxative/purgative effect), I am limiting my use of the oil for heels and cuticles to weekly manicures and pedicures, not a daily practice. This is to balance it with my 2-3 times per week for my hair and the occasional use for my arthritis.</li>
            <li> This product was great! I applied it all over my scalp every night before I went to bed, and along my hairline, beginning about a month ago. I have noticed thicker hair growth, and it is just amazing.</li>
            <li> Very moisturizing.  Love this product!</li>
            <li> The product have a slight smell but i heard it was good at thickening your hair. So lets see how it works! Ohh &amp; the shipping was wonderful as well...</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! I use it to lay down my edges at night &amp; it has really helped my hair ( I have thin, very prone to breakage hair. ) I would definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> I finally made the decision to purchase a bottle of Jamaican Black Castor Oil.  I am not sure what all properties the other companies may have in their versions but I love this oil.  I have been natural for two years and I initially used regular castor oil and I must admit I did see results with growth and thickness but when I began to use the JBCO.  For over two months I have been using this on my hair, scalp and eyelashes/brows and I must admit I am noticing a greater change in all areas.  My hair is growing and retaining moisture with much more softness and I finally have &amp;#34;eyebrows&amp;#34; where I used to add them to make it look fuller.  I will contine to use this product in my daily regime.  There is a light coffee scent when first using but it disappears and is not so noticeable.</li>
            <li> I had never used this product.  It is very thick but  I have since learned that you need to warm it up to make it a little thinner.  A dime sized amoutn is all I needed to seal my ends very effectively.</li>
            <li> I use this product mixed with the Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil and as a back up the Hair Food. I haven&#x27;t used half of the product but have already reordered. I plan on keeping this as my main hair care and growth regime. I have a standing bi-monthly visit to the hair salon and my stylist uses &#x27;my mixture&#x27; as a conditioner on my hair. My hair is softer to the touch and I receive compliments about how healthy my hair looks.</li>
            <li> My hair is truly growing with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I cut out shampoos with sulfates and&lt;br /&gt;added this oil to my home made mixture and I can feel and see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I use this after every hair wash immediately.</li>
            <li> it weighs my hair down because it&#x27;s heavy, but I love that.  The Shine is amazing, I would recommend it!</li>
            <li> I am using the lavender scent now but I love this oil helps to strengthen my hair and also promotes hair growth! must use a little  oil is very thick.</li>
            <li> my hair is getting protein by me using this product, which is healthy</li>
            <li> It works really well with my hair and I am seeing regrowth. Slowly but surly. :) Good buy and reasonably priced.</li>
            <li> Very good product thick so a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> I believe I&#x27;m seeing a difference in my hair. Because of the winter I&#x27;m really protecting my hair with a moisture treatment I do &amp; this is great for it. I oil my scalp with this &amp; other products together, and I can tell the difference in the thickness of my hair from this summer til now. If you have hair lose you should try. I also use on my edges. There coming in more now. Using on hair for a month now.</li>
            <li> Best product ever.. makes hair fuller, shinier n healthier.. had to buy it for my mom, aunt and grandmaa :)</li>
            <li> I love using jamaican black castor oil for a number of health &amp; beauty purposes. Mainly, I use it (lightly) to moisturize my scalp post-shampoo. I also use it as a pre-shampoo deep conditioner along with some wheat germ oil and coconut oil. Aside from hair, a light dab moisturizes my face and skin. In the winter months, I apply some lightly to my lips for moisture and to fight chap. Oddly enough, this particular brand has been reported as having a &amp;#34;smoky smell&amp;#34; but I do not find it offensive. Maybe it could be the amount other apply??? To combat this, one could add essential oils like Lavendar.</li>
            <li> I use it to promote healthy and strong hair. The smell is ok and the oil is thick. Hopefully in 30 days I can see a change to my hair.</li>
            <li> I like the smell of this product, it&#x27;s a bit sticky. I really don&#x27;t know what to say other than we shall see how beneficial this product will be for my hair. I have been using it on my edges for a week now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 4/2/13&lt;br /&gt;The product is working a wonders on my edges. My edges are thicker than ever, they were previously damaged from the over wear of wigs. My hair is noticeably thicker as well. I can tell that it is growing. I am enjoying it overall!</li>
            <li> wow i was really happy this stuff really works can&#x27;t wait i will be buying more of this all so shared this with friends.</li>
            <li> This is a great product for your hair.. It helps to keep my natural tresses managleble. I can&#x27;t live without now..</li>
            <li> great product easy going on and made hair feel thicker. Keep  up good work, because this is a great product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard fantastic things about JBCO, so I decided to try it. I&#x27;ve been using this oil for temple hair loss, and let me tell you...I&#x27;ve seen more growth in 2 weeks than I did in 2 years. I would recommend this product to all my natural hair beauties because its great for shine, stimulating growth, and sealing.</li>
            <li> This product has a paste like feeling to it and for some reason smells like cigarettes to me.  With that said, it does a good job at moisturizing but I recommend that you take a very small amount and mix it with water or a water based product to help spread evenly through out your hair. Although it works, because of the smell, I won&#x27;t purchase again.</li>
            <li> My mom has type 4b or c or z hair, whatever you want to call it.  If you know the Andre Walker system, you know what I mean.  It is a beautiful hair type but very fragile.  She is 82 years years and last summer, had hardly any hair left in the front--not just the roots but the whole front of her head up to her ears had maybe 1/2  inch or less of hair remaining.  In the back, she had some hair, but it was ragged and all different lengths and felt rough.  She thought she was going to have to wear a TWA forever, like many of her friends her age who have basically jsut given up on ever having hair and shaved it off.  But she did not want to do this.  Though she is an older lady, she is very feminine and does not like her looks with this &#x27;boy&#x27; type hairstyle.&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to make a long story short, I sent her a bottle of this Jamaican black castor oil and she started massaging her hair and scalp with it.  I also made sure that she started sleeping on a satin pillowcase and wearing a satin cap, washing with her remaining hair in braids and using Shea moisture shampoo only on her scalp.  I told her to be very low manipulation and she wore a wig to cover up her damaged hair and give it a rest.  I taught her to finger comb only and also to use a little protein on her ends about once a month, after she washed. (Joico K-pak).  Lo and behold!  She lives in Florida and when I returned to visit her, barely 7 months later, her hair had grown so much!  the very short patches had grown a lot, the bald patches had filled in and the back had grown BELOW HER SHOULDERS.  My mother has never had hair below her shoulders in her life (this is difficult for many type 4b people as this hair type cannot take any abuse at all.  It was an unbelievable change.  My mother is so happy.  She continues to use this product as her scalp massage and moisturizer and her hair is not only growing like a weed but feels very fluffly, soft and not greasy at all.  Her goal is to grow her hair enough so that she can wear her natural hair in a bun and not have to wear a wig anymore and it looks like she will make this goal very soon.  We are both very happy.&lt;br /&gt;P.S I have type 3c hair which is a lot stronger than my mom&#x27;s (my dad was mixed-race and I got his hair type).  I have never had balding or breakage problems the way she does,  but I find that this product works well for me, too.  I massage a little on my scalp mixed with some peppermint  essential oil (few drops) and burdock root oil (which I also bought on Amazon.com) every night and I don&#x27;t have the itching problems I used to have sometimes before.  I think it makes my hair feel a bit softer (I have low porosity hair that tend to be dry) and I like it for me, too.she can wear her natural hair in a bun and not have to wear a wig anymore and it looks like she will make this goal very soon.  We are both very happy.&lt;br /&gt;P.S I have type 3c hair which is a lot stronger than my mom&#x27;s (my dad was mixed-race and I got his hair type).

I think it makes my hair feel a bit softer (I have low porosity hair that tend to be dry) and I like it for me, too.</li>
            <li> I very much wanted to believe the hype about this product, but al I got was a greasy itchy scalp. I don&#x27;t mean a little itch, more like a nagging, can&#x27;t think of anything else type of itch. Came on time and was packaged appropriately. Just not for me.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product for my hair, and it has not disappointed. Although it is a heavy oil, it absorbs well, and gives my natural hair a nice sheen.</li>
            <li> this product I don&#x27;t know. haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see a big change in hair growth. I like the way my scalp feels after using it.</li>
            <li> Love the feel of my hair, after I had applied it.  Looking for quick growth especially in areas that has no hair.</li>
            <li> So far so good. The shipment came when it said it would. The smell is not bad at all. It&#x27;s smells like castor oil.lol I&#x27;m seeing results on my edges but I wish it was a little quicker. It&#x27;s been about a month of usage. I am happy with the results though. My eyebrows &amp; eyelashes are growing and seem more prominent. I&#x27;ve recently ordered the red pimento oil as well... Hair journey continued.... I would totally recommend!!</li>
            <li> Smells terrible but I have noticed my hair is much more stronger now after about four months using it. Will recommend it.</li>
            <li> This product is great. I love how thick it is. I put it on my hair and it coats it nicely. I no longer suffer from dry scalp. It does have a light smell, and its not overwhelming. I definitely recommend this product. My hair now retains moisture better.</li>
            <li> What happen if i mix it with other oils and shea butter .. Please answer me as soon as you can</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t want to call this a miracle hair elixir, but this oil still has its uses. If anything, it works as both a remedy and a lotion. I also find that using this with the likes of [[ASIN:B000BNRKPY Heritage Store Castor Oil, 32 Ounce]] makes for a terrific combination. So, I recommend getting this. Not because it performs miracles on your hair, but because it keeps your hair healthy.</li>
            <li> The first thing I have notice since using this product, the breakage has stopped! I have been using it for 3 weeks and I see that my hair is growing! It makes my hair soft, not brittle like before.  My scalp use to be so dry.  This product help with that. I recommend this product. I will check back in 6 month and really tell you how its working.</li>
            <li> I expected an unpleasant odor, but not at all, it smells fine! I mix with Vitamin E oil and a drop of lavender oil. For me, I have seen no results trying to thicken my thinning Caucasian hair and eyebrows. It&#x27;s only been a month, though, and I read that it takes three months. I massage into scalp, leave on for a few hours. Eyebrows I apply nightly; hair twice a week on wash day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 2 months later - I know it works for others, I watched MANY YouTube reviews on this product, but they were 90% black girls, maybe that&#x27;s why it didn&#x27;t work for me? IDK but I hope you have better luck than I did. I didn&#x27;t see any change, and I gave up. I am a white girl with fine/wispy curly hair that has gotten very thin at the scalp. I&#x27;d read that JBCO works well for edges, so I was applying to the hairline where the baby hairs are that has been receding on my forehead. My eyebrows are sparse, too, and I thought this would help. I think it&#x27;s just genetics. I have virtually no arm hair anymore, either.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!! It really grows my hair, sometimes i mix it with coconut oil because its quite thick, but other wise it works great on  my hair, i ran out and decided to get another bottle, plus its free shipping! yayyy!</li>
            <li> this stuff is good as a heavy moisturizer during colder months b/c it is thick. my hair drank this up but i only used it every two days b/c it has some hang time in it.</li>
            <li> It is a great product that does wonder to the hair. The only turn off is the smell of the product. It smells like cigarettes and it is pungent. Although I will be a regular customer, the only thing I wish that would change is the smell without changing the quality o f the prodict</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had the results that most have suggested (after a couple of months worth of use); however, I plan to finish the bottle with the hope that my hair will thicken up a bit.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product, but I don&#x27;t use it anymore because the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> After hearing about this oil all over you tube and from natural hair lovers...I ordered it. I have been using it for a month now and my hair has gotten thicker then ever. I use it in a spray bottle and of course on my thinning edges. It is slowly but surely getting there when it comes to the edges but there was a lot of damage there. However I do see it working and will continue to use it nightly.</li>
            <li> If you are having problems with a damaged hair line from pulling on your hair this may work for you, but for me it cause a very little bit of hair growth and was extremely slow.</li>
            <li> And sticky.  I purchased this because my edges were thinning due to braids and after pregnancy shedding.  I heard this is supposed to help regrow your hair.  My beautician talked me into trying another product which seems to really help so I&#x27;m not sure if the oil worked or not.</li>
            <li> Very good quality oil, works well with my other hair care products. This combined with shea butter and coconut oil is the best softener/moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
            <li> I purchased this and found that after several weeks my hair felt thicker. I am still waiting on the hair growth part but I love that it makes my hair feel fuller. I do warn you not to use alot as the consistency is very thick. All in all it is good stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rechelle Gist</li>
            <li> Bought two more for my family members after raving about the first purchase I did of JBCO a month before. HIGHLY HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend! It really does help hair grow, keep eye area fresh and wrinkle free, removes scars, etc.</li>
            <li> Great product, I rub it everywhere, give myself a hair treatment, my eyebrows, the chest area, it&#x27;s supposed to prevent cysts from forming, so I rub in the chest area every nite, don&#x27;t know if its been proven but why take the chance, makes for a great oil rub, there is no real scent, maybe add some to make it more pleasing....</li>
            <li> I began using this product on 12/1/12 and have seen amazing results. My transparent edges are filling in and my hair has gotten thicker. I will definitely keep JBCO as a staple in my hair regimen.</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil I LOVE you. I used this product only once so far but I couldn&#x27;t wait to review it. I used it on my damp hair after I got out of the shower and combed my hair ( by the way I am an African American woman) and instantly my hair felt super duper soft!!! I mean I don&#x27;t have coarse hair to begin with it is wavy/curly and I usually don&#x27;t have a hard time managing it. But Oh my God this product to me is the BOMB! It doesn&#x27;t smell good and it has a very thick/sticky consistency like that of honey. But who cares about all that, the point is that it made my hair so SOFT!! I heard this product helps with hair growth as well so I will update in about 30 days. I definitely would recommend this product to anyone!!:))</li>
            <li> This is the truth.. edges and hair grows with this.. buy it and do not look back..</li>
            <li> It is working really good for my black relaxed hair but it is very thick and greasy. It does make the hair soft and my spot in the front is filling in. I pre poo with it, DC with it, oil my scalp once a week with it and I seal my edges once a week with it.</li>
            <li> It does not smell that bad. And the delivery was quick</li>
            <li> Works well but I do not like the smell.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t really see any difference, maybe because I stopped using it.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been using very long so I don&#x27;t know just how well it works. But it does smell like an ash tray. I make sure I either spray with Olive oil or add some other porduct to cover up the smell.</li>
            <li> I ordered this to increase the thickness in my hair but I have not seen a difference.  I would probably not purchase this again.</li>
            <li> This is hands down my favorite oil. It makes my hair thicker and aids in growth. I recommend to all natural girls!</li>
            <li> Best thing ever !! Been using it all my life</li>
            <li> Love, love, LOVE this little bottle of JOY!  My hair is thicker, healthier, and longer.  Awesome product and will spread the word.</li>
            <li> I have not used the porduct yet but it is exactly what I wanted. Plan on using it soon though</li>
            <li> Works really good!  Would purchase more for the price.</li>
            <li> I am using this product on my natural hair . So far so good. Service was quick and fast . I would recommend this product. I mix it with Jojoba oil . Traders joes .  I don&#x27;t have itching nor or burning . Also add mint or rosemary for smell</li>
            <li> I have been trying to grow my edges back for years because they completely fell out from wearing my always go to style single braids.but after i tried there other oil and it gave me more growth than anything i have tried biotin pills ,baby dont be bald,dr miricle, all oils. in 2 weeks my bald edges got thicker and new hair is coming in . but this oil is way better its thick and gives you moisture like nothing else i love it if you want thicker healthier hair Than BUY BUY bUy this brand of products.</li>
            <li> i&#x27;m not really sure it&#x27;s better than the drug store over the counter type of castor oil but i like the price and will continue to&lt;br /&gt;use.</li>
            <li> This smells awful!! I used it one time and immediately had to wash it out of my hair because of the horrible smell. I wish I would have been warned about the smell before purchasing this. Ended up throwing the whole bottle away.</li>
            <li> Started using this product about two months ago and it thinned out my edges even more. I am guessing it just works if you already have thick hair growing in but not with re-growing smh</li>
            <li> love this product, and that i am able to buy it on amazon prime. previous to this product i purchased dr. adorable but their prices are ridiculous for the product (peppermint black castor oil) and shipping. so i order the peppermint essential order separately and this brand of black castor oil and keep a few coins in the bank. boom!</li>
            <li> This oil has done wonders for my hair!! It is smooth, moisturized and shiney! I am so glad that I gave it a try.</li>
            <li> I am actually glad with this product.I use this oil as a mask for my hair and conditioning for my eyelashes.Oil is very thick so it is not leaking,i leave it overnight.Recommend.</li>
            <li> Great product. A little goes a long way.  I use after washing my hair, after applying a leave in, to seal my ends.  I am African American with relaxed hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this for use in my natural hair care regimen and DIY hair recipes.  Sadly, I can&#x27;t use it because the smell makes me gag! I&#x27;m not particularly sensitive to smells and &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;earthy&amp;#34; smells don&#x27;t bother me, so to say this stuff stinks is really saying something. I tried it in a few scalp oil recipes, hoping that adding it in small amounts to carrier oils would diminish the strong scent. Nope. It lingers around for days until I wash my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s sad it smells terrible since black castor oil is AMAZING for ALL hair types. It will moisturize, thicken, strengthen and rapidly increase hair growth. It increases blood flow to the scalp, supplying valuable nutrients to hair follicles. It will also prevent hair breakages, dandruff, eczema and dry, itchy scalp. Eyelash and eyebrow hair growth can be stimulated from applying it to sparse areas. I just wish it smelled better...</li>
            <li> Long lasting product. Great Price and gets the job done. I use it on my love spots, eye lashes, brows, any cuts I have and of course on my hair.  It is a bit sticky but do pant seem to build up. It reminds me of honey but not as thick.  The smell is not notice for long and isn&#x27;t that strong. Great stuff.</li>
            <li> Great product, love the thickness and how it put moisture in my hair would be able to write a better review after using it for a longer period of time.</li>
            <li> this is nice. I use it in my whipped shea butter. it helps moisturize and make hair feel thicker and stronger. I don&#x27;t use this product alone, I always mix it with something. oh and it has a smell, its not terrible but its not nice at all.</li>
            <li> I have very kinky course hair and it can get very dry and shed a whole lot. Since I started using the jbco it is softer and has stop sheding so very much now instead of a comb full of hair there is very little if any. I am not putting it on straight I mix it with my shea moister product I use and I do it every two days. I love the way my hair feels and looks I dont know about my hair growing more than normal but it only been about 1 1/2 mnths LOVE It!!</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil is a must for natural hair. It moisturizes, and seals moisture in. I add to conditioners and many other hair products. My hair has grown so much since I start using JBCO.</li>
            <li> This product is Awesome!! It grows and thicken your hair eye lashes and even your eyebrows. It works great on your skin. I just love it!!!! You can use this product for about anything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just trying different alternatives to normal &amp;#34;hair grease&amp;#34; and i have heard a lot about this product. I literally just got this yesterday, so i wouldn&#x27;t be able to comment on how useful it really is, but the price is great and you can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> I guess it is to soon to tell if it&#x27;s working.  Right now I haven&#x27;t seen in changes in skin or hair.</li>
            <li> I love Jamaican castor oil. All my nubians this stuff works great for us!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s ok, of course nothing works fast enough these days, but hopefully will start to see results. I would&#x27;nt recommend it to someone that&#x27;s not willing to wait for it to do it&#x27;s job.</li>
            <li> Not as described. Castor oil is clear, the dark bottle is deceiving. I&#x27;m not sold that this is Jamaican black castor oil at all. There is no smell or color. Not at all what I expected.</li>
            <li> My hair is black and long. Before a couple of gray hair is visible. I bought this product last month. It has made my hair thicker and also reduced gray hair obviously. Now none of gray hair can be seen. To me, it is more effective than other oil, such as coconut, Oliver oil, regular pure caser oil....but I still use this black caster oil with Oliver oil.</li>
            <li> This Black Castor Oil is the boom.</li>
            <li> Love it, used it on my hair regularly to give it moisture</li>
            <li> It smells awful but you can mix it with coconut oil. It makes your hair very soft .</li>
            <li> Love this will reorder in the future.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Sticky and smells like cigarettes. Had to mix with water and put in a spray bottle. Not a fan. Maybe I&#x27;ll try a scented version.</li>
            <li> I Was hearing a lot about this product in Natural Hair Forums and Blogs so I decided to order it also for my Natural Hair and OMG I see what the hype was about it leaves your hair feeling super soft!....In love and will be ordering it again.....Also received the product super fast and was packaged well!...Thanks</li>
            <li> I love this product! It does wonders for my hair.  I like to mix it with other oils so that it can last longer, like extra vrigin olive oil and vitiamin E oil.</li>
            <li> It really is a great product a little sticky though. I see results in my twist outs. It gives my hair much needed strength💜</li>
            <li> I am a naturalista. I use it for my scalp and to seal the moisture on the ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> this product made my hair feel soft and helped my edge grow back works great with my natural hair only thing is it smells terrible but i would recommend this product</li>
            <li> I love this stuff my scalp stays mositerized when I use it and my edges are coming in thicker they were thin before.&lt;br /&gt;shipping was just as expected would purchase again</li>
            <li> I purchased this because it is supposed to aid in hair growth.  I have not noticed anything positive or negative.</li>
            <li> Great for sealing in moisture. healps in length retention of hair.  A little of the product goes a long way.</li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff i lost my hair this year and used this stuff and all my hair started to grow back thicker and fuller</li>
            <li> This product has definitely thickened my natural hair and has kept my scalp moisturized! I even use it to seal my ends!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff...it keeps my hair nourished.</li>
            <li> The item is as detailed. The smell is very smoky (this is not unpleasant to me at all). I like the fact that it has no salt in it as that can be an issue if you are using this product for your hair as I am. I plan on mixing this into my shampoos (have done so already in my clay shampoo) and into my conditioners and hair oil treatments. It is sticky but so is regular castor oil but this seems even more so. YOU really must mix other oils with it to bring the stickiness down to 0. It is supposed to be very good for hair and scalp. I am excited as I have researched this for a little while and I have decided to now give it a try.</li>
            <li> I love love love Jamaican caster oil work we&#x27;ll on my hair</li>
            <li> I didnt use this product long enough to notice results it packed away on a shelf of my many hair products. I tried it because of the rave reviews this product was getting on natural hair care blogs that I follow. Although i didnt use it long i didnt notice any of the results other womer seemed to be getting.</li>
            <li> The product arrived before scheduled time which was nice. I have been using it for about a month and see some slow hair growth on thin edges and thinning crown. Hopeful to see more results in the near future. The smell is very minimal and doesn&#x27;t bother me at all. I do recommend getting the bigger bottle and the drop dispenser for less messy applications...</li>
            <li> First, it&#x27;s not a miracle drug so if that&#x27;s what your expecting then try else where. This product, like must, requires patience and routine use before you see the affects. I have been using it after a great friend recommended it and I can honestly say I am pleased with the product. The oil is thick and smells similar to coffee beans. I warm it between my fingers then apply to my scalp (every other night about three times a week) it has lasted well, I believe I&#x27;ve had it for close to a month. I also use it with coconut oil as a pre poo and enjoy it. Good purchase.</li>
            <li> I used this on my temples when hair began to thin.  All came back after a few weeks of daily message in places that were thinning</li>
            <li> I used to use plain castor oil but no I can&#x27;t live without my Jamaican black castor, u use it for my hair and it has saved my skin this winter! This is going to be my staple product for sure</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for natural hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling greasy or oily. It does leave a smokey smell but its not overwhelming.</li>
            <li> The consistency is way to thick for me. overall the benefits are good for you, so instead of using it for my hair i use it on my skin</li>
            <li> I just received this last week and what I can say right away is that this stuff gives moisture without completely weighing the hair down.  I like this much better than regular castor oil which seems a bit more dense.  I am one year into transitioning my hair and I have done the B/C yet.  Brittle and dry hair are very big issues when transitioning..it will really cause breakage if you are not careful.  This stuff when put on the edges of my hair and on the scalp really ads lasting moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about growth at this time but it sure does soften and moisturize so I already know it will be added to my hair regimen.  This alone will prevent breakage. I only gave this 3 stars because I am not sure about it&#x27;s stimulation for hair growth yet.</li>
            <li> I used this product for my natural hair castor oil challenge and it has done wonders for me and my hair. My hair was only about a inch long when I had started using it and after just a month my hair was reaching down almost to the tip of my nose. I am very happy with the product. The only problems I really had with it was the molasses like texture and smell. Aside from that I would recommend this product to anyone trying to grow their hair natural or not.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what black castor oil was until I read the reviews on Amazon while I was browsing for hair products. I thought why not try since the price was so great and the reviews were even better. Didn&#x27;t expect much other than another oil treatment that I would try and probably put aside with the rest of my &#x27;so-so hair products&#x27; that I purchased in the past. To my surprise this oil is really really good.  I only used is a few times but already in love with it. I have short natural curly hair and currently have dyed my hair so my hair is in much need of moisturizers and deep treatments. The oil is somewhat thick thus couldn&#x27;t imagine this being of much interest to people with fine hair. I rubbed a dime size amount on my hand  and massaged it in my hair after I washed it and my hair is soooo soft and shiny.  I like it and the only reason why I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is b/c it smells weird but that smell is only initially and doesn&#x27;t linger long.  Good when hair is wet or dry. Either way is fine. Would be careful when pouring it out of the bottle. Too much would make your hair heavy. Great for deep treatment with a bit of Nature&#x27;s Way Coconut Oil-extra Virgin (also on Amazon) and sit under the dryer for 15 minutes. Does wonders. Would buy again and recommend it 100%.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.&lt;br /&gt;i gave it 4 stars because i wasn&#x27;t too crazy about the smell.&lt;br /&gt;this oil made my hair very soft and it did grow my egdes that were&lt;br /&gt;starting to break off because i always wore my hair in pony tails. .</li>
            <li> it actually does promote hair growth. i used it on my eyebrows and within two weeks they nearly doubled in size. the bottle itself is pretty small though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still feeling this product out.  I have added it to my water bottle solution for my natural hair.  I hope it works well :-)</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! I use it in a damaged part of my hair that breaks and also on my edges. I have seen gradual improvement with this oil. My mother in law loves it too for her hair and aches and pains.</li>
            <li> Because of this product, I no longer use Minoxidil or Latisse!!! A MUST-buy for your hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes! Yes, Eyelashes!! This gem of an oil is our #1 best kept beauty secret ladies! (And gentlemen, of course) Let me tell you the 3 major ways this oil has changed my life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Hair: Female hairloss is a family trait that I have been blessed with. I have very fine hair to begin with, and it started thinning in my late 20&#x27;s. I used Minoxidil for the last 2 years to help with this. It&#x27;s very expensive for daily use and really trashes the exisiting hair you have, especially if it&#x27;s longer. It did not help me to regrow any hair, but it did stop more from falling out. About 2 months ago I learned about this product and immidiately noticed a difference. Withing a couple of weeks my hair was fuller, and I had regrowth! I&#x27;m talking about new hair, growing fast, and the condition of the length of my hair improved so much! At bedtime, I use an eyedropper and massage a few drops into my scalp every night. It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Eyebrows: In my teens I tweezed my eyebrows to practically nothing. Then when I decided to grow them out in my 20&#x27;s they grew back patchy and I still had to draw and fill them in. I thought I would have to do this for the rest of my life, but I thought since I had such great success using the oil on my hair, maybe, just maybe it could help my brows. And I was blown away! My eyebrows started growing back after about a week of using this daily. After 1 month, they are almost to where they were before I went tweezer crazy (and that was over 15 years ago!) They are so much fuller and the bald patches are filling in nicely. I no longer have to \\&quot;draw\\&quot; them in, just simply groom and define them. For me, this is amazing. I was always self concious of anyone, even my hubby of 12 years, seeing me without my eyebrows on. Now, I actually look normal without any make-up. lol. I just dip a q-tip in some of the oil and apply to my eyebrows evey night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Eyelashes: Naturally since my hair was, hehe I love saying WAS, so fine and thinning, my eyelashes were as well. They were fuller in my teens so I never thought I would have a problem with them. But now in my thirties, they began to thin, and were even alot shorter than I remember. I used Latisse and must say I had good results from it. But, the product was expensive for me to keep using. Finances are troublesome for my family right now and I had to make some cut-backs on \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; items. I cried as I watched my eyelashes lose their fullness and length. So, of course with the great results I had with my hair and eyebrows, I decided to try this on my lashes. I am so glad I did! My eyelashes are fuller, softer, longer, conditioned, and don&#x27;t fall out anymore.  I use a spoolie brush, but Q-tips or an old clean mascara wand will do just as good. I apply it to my top and bottom lashes very close to the lash line every night before bed, and also on my top lashes before applying make-up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such an easy thing to add to your daily regimen, and is so much cheaper than buying all of the other products I formerly used. I encourage everyone to try this. It really is no joke. This little bottle of oil has changed my life!night before bed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Eyelashes: Naturally since my hair was, hehe I love saying WAS, so fine and thinning, my eyelashes were as well. They were fuller in my teens so I never thought I would have a problem with them. But now in my thirties, they began to thin, and were even alot shorter than I remember. I used Latisse and must say I had good results from it. But, the product was expensive for me to keep using. Finances are troublesome for my family right now and I had to make some cut-backs on \\&quot;luxury\\&quot; items. I cried as I watched my eyelashes lose their fullness and length. So, of course with the great results I had with my hair and eyebrows, I decided to try this on my lashes. I am so glad I did! My eyelashes are fuller, softer, longer, conditioned, and don&#x27;t fall out anymore.  I use a spoolie brush, but Q-tips or an old clean mascara wand will do just as good. I apply it to my top and bottom lashes very close to the lash line every night before bed, and also on my top lashes before applying make-up in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such an easy thing to add to your daily regimen, and is so much cheaper than buying all of the other products I formerly used. I encourage everyone to try this. It really is no joke. This little bottle of oil has changed my life!</li>
            <li> Great for hair growth and replacement of edges</li>
            <li> I love this oil I&#x27;e heard so much about it every where when I researched products for hair growth. I mix it with other oils, put it in my conditioner as well as use it by itself. Would defininetly buy this again.</li>
            <li> Great product. Has done wonders to my hair.</li>
            <li> It is Really thick, and I have noticed my hair become softer after I shower.</li>
            <li> Great product! I noticed my hair got thicker.</li>
            <li> It does nothing!  It&#x27;s all hype!</li>
            <li> This is some good oil. I bought it for myself and some of my female family wanted me to order for them, so I did, so they wouldn&#x27;t use up mine.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and gooey and has a faint, but slightly unpleasant odor, but my hair LOVES Jamaican Black Castor Oil. It really protects it from the cold New York winters.</li>
            <li> My hair broke off really bad after I had it colored a honey blonde for a few months. My hairdresser suggested pure castor oil to help it grown back healthily (if that&#x27;s a word), and so far I haven&#x27;t seen any notable changes but the good news is my hair is breaking less so I guess that&#x27;s a plus. Not sure if it&#x27;s my fault that It&#x27;s not growing back as great as I&#x27;d like because I know its recommended you use it on a daily basis and massage the scalp when you do so. I don&#x27;t use it everyday because it&#x27;s really heavy.</li>
            <li> Thicker than Heritage however, very good product. Excellent moisturizer for both the skin and hair. As I said for Heritage castor oil, you can use this product as well for facial shaving. Seems mildly richer than the Heritage product but, they are both&lt;br /&gt;very good for whatever your needs in that category.</li>
            <li> I have a bottle of this at home, once I finsh with it I am not sure I will be repurchasing. Not because this is a bad product, it isn&#x27;t it didn&#x27;t do much for my hair. It is the real thing, but a tad bit to heavy for my hair. I didn&#x27;t try it on my skin, but I am sure it is very moisturing</li>
            <li> i havent seen any significant hair growth yet, but it does hydrates my hair and scalp and keeps it feeling really soft</li>
            <li> I HATE when I read the description and I think one thing, get it in the mail, open it (after paying good money for it) and then just toss it in the trash because it is NOT how it was described!!</li>
            <li> I was told to get this for my hair - and it is excellent for helping me with hair loss.  I was losing hair in spot in my head and in the front.  Once i started to used Jamaican Black Castor Oil, I saw improvement.</li>
            <li> This oil is working wonders. I suffer from alopecia and this is stimulating growth within my hair. Even the bald spots that I lost  that I would will not even thought that will grow hair is growing spouts of hair. I have been trying it for about several days now and it is a wonderful product.</li>
            <li> I love ❤ jbco been using it for over 2 weeks and my eyelashes are getting thicker and a little longer my eyebrow were invisible now after using jbco you can see my eyebrows they look darker and fuller love ❤ it</li>
            <li> Used in my hair! Great !</li>
            <li> It just didn&#x27;t do anything for me and the smell is horrible.</li>
            <li> Bottle showed up broken. Unable to use at all. Bad packaging</li>
            <li> Still waiting for results after 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> its very thick not watery like the ones you see in kroger or sallys,the smell is a little smokey and its dark clear</li>
            <li> I love this product my hair shines really well and I also used it on my feet and they are very soft because of it.</li>
            <li> This is a great oil, use it on my hair, its has got to be one of the thickest oil, the smell not so great.&lt;br /&gt;But i&#x27;m happy with it as i mix it with other oils.</li>
            <li> The edges of my hair were falling out, so I did reseach and found that this castor oil helps with the growing back of hair. So far,&lt;br /&gt;i do have results. I recommend to use it on clean hair.. it has made my hair softer..i do see little growth,</li>
            <li> I purchased for thinning hair.  I have alopecia and not sure if this helped or provided any benefit to me.  I still use it to oil my scalp when it is dry and itchy.  I have locs and this gives me great moisture.  Came fairly quick and I still have more than 3/4 bottle full.</li>
            <li> I use Jamaican black castor oil on my hair.  It grows and thickens my hair within 2 weeks.  Great product.</li>
            <li> This has really made me and my daughter&#x27;s hair grow! I&#x27;ve been using it for a while and I mix it with everything! Oil cleansing, scalp oil, and hair moisture sealant. I&#x27;m very pleased with this product. I&#x27;m texlaxed and my daughter is a straightened natural. Let me know if you have any questions...r.samantha85@yahoo.com</li>
            <li> Dont really see a difference after 2 weeks of use</li>
            <li> Amazing product! Edges are back thanks to it.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell.  I haven&#x27;t seen the results that was promoted.  I&#x27;m going to give it at least six months.  I do know that head itches a lot which I dislike. This product is used as recommended, but more time is needed before I&#x27;ll really evaluate it.</li>
            <li> Good on hair on its own or with coconut oil mixed.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick so requires some effort  but worth it.</li>
            <li> within the first couple weeks of use i started noticing growth my colour was growing out so i could tell the amount of growth i was getting. This oil has my hair super soft . ki did notice i was getting minor headaches though but that stopped when i mixed the oil with another oil to break it down so to speak.i will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> I use this product on my hair and skin. It is a heavier oil. i like the extra dark kind better for my hair.</li>
            <li> Verdict still out on hair growth potential.  My daughter used it, but I&#x27;m not sure yet if the new growth was mainly due to need for retouch of relaxer..</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering this item and I mix it with essential oils and apply it to scalp. I mix it because it is a bit sticky. Its great when you have braids or for a hot oild treatment before a wash. It brought my edges back!</li>
            <li> Great deal. The larger container. Pure oil is wonderful for my scalp. I really like the organic oil. Great deal</li>
            <li> I like this. It is very moisturizing and keeps hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking. Smell is kind of strong. Will be repurchasing.</li>
            <li> I chose it because of the reviews , and for what I have heard about it, I don&#x27;t use it every day, more like every other day, however I am not seeing results.</li>
            <li> This product did exactly what everyone says it does. It made my hair thicker I can&#x27;t say I saw any growth because I havent straightened it but the thickness was what I was going for anyway.</li>
            <li> Within one week exactly, I was able to see hair filling in. After one month, completely filled in...this stuff works wonders for male and female hair issues.</li>
            <li> Love this oil very good and thick use a little you won&#x27;t need alot. Our hair looks much healthier and feels stronger since using it.</li>
            <li> i only used it once and stopped because it made my hair fall off like crazy. it doesnt smell too horrible and it comes off easily when you wash hair but it didn&#x27;t suit me</li>
            <li> I really like it.  It really moisturizes my hair.  I mix it with my other essential oils to thin it out because it is so thick.  The smell wasn&#x27;t as bad as I thought it would be at all.  You just have to be careful not to overdue it with this oil.  A little goes a long way.  Again it is very moisturizing on my natural hair.  No more dry brittle ends.</li>
            <li> Works well for oiling the scalp after washing and clarifying. I&#x27;m adding it to my regimen. I&#x27;ll be buying a bigger bottle soon!</li>
            <li> I ORDERED THIS ITEM FOR MY HAIR EDGES AND IT REALLY WORKS. I WOULD DEFINATELY ORDER THIS AGAIN IF NEED.</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly. I heard all about this stuff and I thought to my self ,&amp;#34;ok why not just try it.&amp;#34; So I&#x27;m using it now and this stuff works wonderfully. I have only been using it for a week or so, and I can already see a difference in the thickness, texture, and lusture of my hair. Recently my edges broke off (lol) and now that I use this stuff I can really see them coming back. This oil has a very thick texture so you will want to be gentle when rubbing it in your hair or else you could tug on your hair too much and accidentaly pulling your hair out. Also with this oil, a little goes a long way, so unless you want a greased up head of hair only use a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> This item came on time as expected.Shipped nice and protected. I was worried about the amount being to small, but product is concentrated and very little is needed to do the job. I have relaxed hair and I love this product so far!!  I mixed it with organic coconut oil . Part my hair in wide sections at bedtime as needed fordryness. It leaves my hair shiny and healthy looking.I find that I don&#x27;t even use oil sheen spray as much as I use to. As for growth (lenth wise) I can&#x27;t say there has been much so far.However my hair is very thin as appears to look stronger, shinier, and almost imediatly in areas where my hair was short it has filled in nicely. I feel that I will have to stick to using it fathfully to get the length I desire. As for the smell it is not strong and bothersome in anyway.</li>
            <li> I am seeing results after a few weeks of using!</li>
            <li> I wanted a bottle of 8 ounce - 238 ml, enough oil using hair scalps, skin condition, burn, wound etc.</li>
            <li> It thickens your edges</li>
            <li> My last trip to the hair dresser she was could see a difference in my hair. It grew and was so much thicker. My edges are also growing back in.</li>
            <li> The second day after I got it, right when I was about to try it it fell off my counter and broke. :( I&#x27;m really sad I didn&#x27;t get a chance to test it out. Now I have to buy another, I heard about one that has coconut in it? It was hard to clean up even on hardwood.</li>
            <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this on my skin and hair, can&#x27;t say right now if there&#x27;s a difference. We shall see.</li>
            <li> This oil moisturizes my hair beautifully. I spray my hair with water and then seal with a bit of oil. It also works wonders on my eyelashes. They have doubled in size!</li>
            <li> So far im stilling trying to see if this was a good buy. I do love that it doesn&#x27;t have a bad ordor. will give it a few more months to see how I like it.</li>
            <li> This product is so versatile and it is truly healing.  I should have used this years ago. It&#x27;s good for hair and skin for babies to adults.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it because it&#x27;s too oily and it changed my pillowcases different colors.  I also don&#x27;t believe this product helped my hair grow.</li>
            <li> I received it pretty quick. I have really dry hair and I applied it for the first time yesterday.  My hair and scalp feels really good.</li>
            <li> Never disappoints!  Hair previously broken/thinned is growing thicker by the day.</li>
            <li> This is a good oil for eliminating frizzy hair, but as far as growth I really have not seen a difference.  I will try it for another month or so and see if I see a difference.</li>
            <li> This stuff really makes your hair grow.  If you are going natural, rub this in your scalp everytime you wash your hair.  Silky soft all week until next shampoo.  It does not have a scent either so that is nice.  Worth the money which is not a lot</li>
            <li> I purchased this item to see if it promotes hair growth. Nothing amazing yet, but I have only been using it for three weeks or so. So it may take a while to find out.</li>
            <li> Worked well for what I needed it for. Still not a huge fan but I think this product was pretty ok. Too much..wished there was a smaller size. Delivery was fast and packed well.</li>
            <li> This is the secret blend that will grow your hair and eyelashes faster than cold pressed castor oil. Good viscosity but not sticky or tacky. Does not clog pores.</li>
            <li> My hair did not grow and this product made my hair itch horribly. I use this for about 4 months</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a good product to help with dry hair. Not sure if it helps regrow thinning hair yet as I just got it. The smell is pretty nasty tho and I wish I bought a scented one. 4 stars due to smell.</li>
            <li> this is by far the best oil i ever used it grew my edges that was bald and thin now very thick and longer</li>
            <li> This product makes my hair soft and manageable. I also use it for my eyelashes. Its great for your hair and skin. I would definitely order it again from amazon. The price is afforable.</li>
            <li> If used consistently, this will grow your hair longer. I&#x27;m not sure if it grew new hair which I needed but I am continuing to use it so hoping it will.  Its greasy so use before bed only and find a good applicator I gave up and use my fingers to massage it in. Smell is not bad so no problems there. Overall a good product.</li>
            <li> My hair loves this product. . .It grows like a weed though. Will continue to purchase. Great for 360 wavers.</li>
            <li> The product arrived with the cap broken and the oil leaked all over the bottle.</li>
            <li> It  seems to be a great product so far and I am using this to promote hair growth in a couple of thin areas of the the scalp. I have been only using this product for a week now so I cannot say how effective it is. I will say this...that I use it on my face as well along with the emu oil and my skin feels incredible and I can see a difference in my skin already.</li>
            <li> I always order from flex the oil is great I seen a lot of improvement in my hair in the last couple of months</li>
            <li> Purchased for someone else... No complaints</li>
            <li> Served its purpose...happy with receipt</li>
            <li> my hair growth  was amazing</li>
            <li> grew my hair back so nice and thick!! and quick too.. it was great.. also it did well for my skin at night@@</li>
            <li> love this stuff really works great for dark age spots on African American skin</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t wait to use. Super fast shipping</li>
            <li> I love it thanks! It&#x27;s a great product will be ordering more! Works great it&#x27;s a lil thick and the mell doesn&#x27;t bother me much</li>
            <li> I use it for my hair and it works my hair line had started to fall out from a winter hat&lt;br /&gt;it took 2months but I now have new growth .</li>
            <li> I did not use this more than two weeks. I don&#x27;t really know if it works. It was too oily for my hair. It might be better for someone with really short hair.</li>
            <li> I went months without a relaxer and this oils made my hair look and feel healthier. I mixed it with other oils and used it each night.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product a few months ago and finally got around to trying it,after about 2 weeks I noticed New hair growing on the crown of my head where I had previous damage from a bad home bleach job.I have tried sevreal products to increase hair growth in the past with little to no success.Jamaican black castor oil is my holy frail and I will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I NEVER DO REVIEWS BUTTTT, I ORDERED THIS FOUR MONTHS AGO AND I CAN VOUCHE THAT THIS IS NOT AUTHENTIC BLACK CASTOR OIL. THIS OIL DID NOT GROW MY HAIR AT ALL, AND I WAS THINKING MAYBE THERE WAS NO HOPE FOR MY HAIR AFTER I FINISHED THE BOTTLE . BUT  THEN I  DECIDED TO GET ONE( the same &amp;#34;tropic isles black castor oil &amp;#34;) FROM MY LOCAL HAIR STORE AND IT WORKED!!!  THE SMELL WAS DIFFERENT AND EVERYTHING. THIS IS AN IMPOSTER.</li>
            <li> I have seen a difference in how rapid my hair is growing as opposed to pre-JBCO, my hair seemed to be growing slowly but not steadily...I use Biotin pills with the JBCO and it seems to be a winning combo.</li>
            <li> Came in the mail quickly. Have to say that I&#x27;m really liking the black castor oil.  I had heard and read some many great reviews, so I just had to try it.  I oil my scalp with it and my scalp has never been this healthy.  The oil is pretty thick and smells like ashes, but nothing you can&#x27;t deal with.  I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> I grew up using castor oil in my hair, and on my body but this one did not work for us.  My little girl  has flaky scalp so I wanted to use this to keep it nice and oily. It made her scalp itch like crazy!  I had to throw it away.</li>
            <li> Castor Oil is used for many different beauty remedies. I was particularly using it for my eyebrows. It makes hair grow twice as fast. The person that waxes my eyebrows recommended Jamaican Castor Oil because it works even better, as there are many brands out there to choose from. It worked great for me, I saw results the next day.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any huge improvements in hair growth while using this product. It is quite oily, so a little goes a long way.  So far, I have used this product for about three months.  I may need to use it longer to see significant results.</li>
            <li> This product smells much better than the JBCO produced by other companies, is thick and rich and easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for it&#x27;s ability to grow hair?  Here&#x27;s my experience with the product.  I had a half dollar sized patch at the top front of my hair that had visibly thinned.  I believe it was due to the tremendous stress I was under at the time, but no matter the reason for it, it was there.  After reading some things said about this product in a Natural Hair forum on FB, I decided to give this a try.  I applied it morning and night with a Q tip to the effected area over the course of a month.  At the end of that time I parted my hair and noticed that the thinning was less than it had been, and called my daughter over to verify, and she saw it too.  I&#x27;ve not been as diligent in using it since then, but I have noticed that the hair has not thinned again, nor has it filled in any more than it had when I was using it.  I stopped using it as often and then not at all because since I wash my hair once a week, the area in which the product was applied took on a very oily feel, so while I may try using it again, I will likely limit the use to once per day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope that helps.</li>
            <li> Pretty good I guess. My hair still sucks, but I&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s much that I can do keep it looking great for longer than 24 hrs at a time.</li>
            <li> In order to see the results from the Black Castor Oil, you must be diligent and have patience.  I did not use everyday and I did not have the patience to complete the bottle.  However, from the time I did use it (about 3 weeks), I do see some improvement on hair that was thinning near the edges.  So overall, I think this is a good product but you have to be willing put in the time to see optimal results.</li>
            <li> So I guess it&#x27;s true that this product works for some, but not for others. I used this product and after a week, I broke out with red bumps around the perimeter of my head which is where I applied the product. I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;ll stick to the regular castor oil.</li>
            <li> I like it, but it has to be thinned out for my use because it is too thick. I always mixed it with other oils and conditioner when using on hair, and other oils when using on scalp. I really didn&#x27;t care for it on my scalp and after two tries gave up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the strong earthy scent. It kind of reminds me of dirt. I think the oil is very moisturizing when mixed with other things, and helps give hair nice shine and sheen when used with conditioner for a deep conditioning treatment. For me I think this is not a product I need to use or will repurchase. I can get the same effects using coconut oil in my conditioners. Despite that I like this oil and would recommend it.</li>
            <li> Helps to seal my hair when I do my re-twist on a nightly basis. Gives my hair good, long-lasting shine</li>
            <li> I really like this oil and leave my hair soft and manageable and it does make your hair grow.the smell is not all that bad once you put it on your hair.I will order more.</li>
            <li> Wonders on my natural hair</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 1 year and 6 months natural and this is one of my staple hair products. It&#x27;s great for applying to the scalp, hot oil treatments and sealing in the moisture to the hair shaft after washing and conditioning. I also use castor oil as an ingredient in my Shea Butter Mix. It makes my hair really soft and shiny. Some people complain about the smell, which it DOES have, but it&#x27;s not bothersome to me. I&#x27;m afraid I can&#x27;t really describe the smell accurately...it&#x27;s just one of the those things you have to smell lol.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard really great things about this product so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I must use it a bit longer  to determine it&#x27;s worth but so far so good!</li>
            <li> After reading a pinterest pin on elongating and darkening eyelashes and eyebrows, I decided to try it myself. I bought this particular castor oil and Sundown Vitamin E oil 70,000 IU, as the pin also required vitamin E oil. I&#x27;ve never purchased either but figured they had pretty good reviews. After mixing them up in correct quantaties, I began to apply the oils and sure enough within 2 weeks of use my eyelashes were so full I didn&#x27;t even need mascara. I&#x27;ve read it has many other uses but I&#x27;ve only experimented with the one above.</li>
            <li> The oil is great. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the smell. Granted most oils have no smell, but I just wouldn&#x27;t want my hair to smell like this. It is great for the hair, so I will just use it on my scalp to promote healthier hair, and growth.</li>
            <li> This was an amazing product ...thank you so much for your service.I truly enjoyed the results and i recieved it quick.</li>
            <li> Smell not goood.  I use couple time than I put it trash,  I will never buy it again, Mabe you like it whose know</li>
            <li> Overall I feel that the product was good that is versitile with its different uses.  Was telling my neighbor about it and she was very surprised that I had never used it before. But will make sure that I will continue to use it from now.</li>
            <li> I like this product its very sticky so i like to put it on at night and rinse in the morning but I actually do see new hair comn in</li>
            <li> i got this and it pretty good it smells a little like coffee to me but i use it  on my skin and hair it make my skin soft...i will puchase this again.!!!</li>
            <li> I tried it on and it felt sticky, I guess that&#x27;s how these oils are suppose to be. Since I am south asian it didn&#x27;t really do the trick, my hair is still falling off. It was sticky, so find a different oil that is ratehr oily. Plus, this was a bit messy for me.</li>
            <li> Hello everyone. I purchased my item not off of amazon but the real website for this oil. The products I ordered were the oil and an applicator bottle because its so easy to apply that way. I used it as a pre poo and then I regulary washed and conditioned my hair. Then I styled my hair with the oil on my ends. Its the first day and I also am satisfied with the product. It shipped to me in 2 days. I already see more softness and managablilty and my hair is growing too already with it. Its like magic. You will not go wrong with this investment.</li>
            <li> I use it to grow my hair. It made my air so shinny and healthy. So glad I bought this oil.</li>
            <li> Purchased for my stepmom and she loves it. She said it has made so much difference with helping the dryness of her hair. Will be purchasing again for her.</li>
            <li> Product works as advertised.  It leaves hair a little greasy if too much is applied but other than that, perfect!</li>
            <li> I like black castor oil because it is much lighter and seemingly more effective in many ways than regular castor oils.</li>
            <li> I needed this product to help regrow my hair and help maintain health due to the use of my high blood pressure medicine. I also started taking Biotin (5000 mcg) pills. My hair has grown about 1/2&amp;#34; since January 15th of consitent use of the JBCO. I use it 6 times per week. I am going to review this again in the mid spring. I am also going to get a higher MCG Biotin pill and I&#x27;ll see if that helps.</li>
            <li> I love the product and I will be ordering again. I could see the change in my hair immediately! I used it with my heating cap prior to my normal shampoo &amp; condition.  All hair breakage stopped and my hair is soft and shines.  Shipping was quick.</li>
            <li> I have been using JBCO since February 2012. I really like doing my three times a week scalp massage with this stuff. I mix it with another oil (e.g. jojoba or Vitamin E) because it is kind of thick and doesn&#x27;t spread as well as I want it to on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair grows fast, but I think that this product has given my thickness a boost. I know women who swear by it, but I encourage people to use it to see if it works for them!</li>
            <li> I AM CURRENTLY 9 MONTHS POST RELAXERS, BEEN READING ALOT OF ON PRODUCTS AND JBCO IS ONE OF THEM PRODUCTS, JUST RECIEVED MY 1ST BOTTLES AND STARTED RIGHT AWAY USING IT, MY HAIR IS CURRENTLY IN BOX BRAIDS FOR 90 DAYS. I READ ALOT ON THIS PRODUCT AND NOW I AM AT THE WAIT AND SEE IF IT WORKS FOR ME APPROACH, I WILL GIVE IT TIME CAUSE NO PRODUCTS WILL WORK OVER NIGHT AND SO FAR I HAVENT BEEN DISAPPOINT ON NO PRODUCTS SO FAR WHEN I DECIDED TO GO FOR RELAXER TO NATURAL I AM ON A 2YRS JOURNEY, MY HAIR WAS CUT INTO A SHORT HAIR STYLE BEFORE I DECIDED TO MAKE THIS TRANSITION AND I HAVE BOUT 4 INCHES OF NEW GROWTHS AND BOUT 3 INCHES OF REMAINING RELAXED END WHEN I TAKE THESE BRAIDS DOWN I WILL REMOVE THE REST OF THE RELAXED END. SO 90 DAYS AND I WILL UP DATE THE PANEL, AND HOW JBCO WORKED FOR ME. WELL THE JBCO I THOUGHT WAS GOING TO BE THIK, BUT IT NOT WHAT I EXCEPTED, THE SMELL WASNT THAT STRONG AND I CAN BARE IT, JUST TO ME JBCO ISNT AS THICK AS OTHER HAIR FOOD OIL.</li>
            <li> I use this product every week, i have seen great results since using this. it has thickened my new growth and has increased my hair growth. this is a great product that African american ladies will truly see results and benefit from.My hair is relaxed.</li>
            <li> The mad scientist in me is always skeptical of products that claim to speed up hair growth, however the woman in me will try anything. First off, this oil feels more like molasses. Secondly,the smell is nothing to abhor (I&#x27;ve smelled worst in a few Carol&#x27;s Daughters products) and its manageable. I am only using this product on one side of my head and not all over, as I am generally cautious when trying a product for the first time. Let me say this product lays your hair down unlike any other. It definitely changes the texture of your hair. If you overapply it will certainly weigh it down and your hair will start to look stringy. If you are someone who prefers bounce like I do, use this product sparingly. I would say JBCO aids in thickening your hair and seals in moisture on your ends. As for hair growth, its not soley responsible for long and flowing hair (sorry ladies, its not). As with anything, a well balanced diet comes first. I&#x27;m keeping it in my regimen but also I&#x27;ve made lifestyle adjustments and wear a protective style to combat hair loss.</li>
            <li> Loved the results.  Will purchase again</li>
            <li> i was very happy with this product. It came very quick. I would definitely buy from this seller again and recommend it to my friends and family. product looks new and works great..</li>
            <li> The roasting gives it a burnt ash smell. I&#x27;ve noticed some improvement around my temples. Using it as a hot oil treatment has prevented my hair from being overly dry as the weather has become colder.</li>
            <li> Very thick, smells weird, does keep my scalp nicely moisturized and prevents dandruff. I would never use on anything other than my scalp bcs of weird smell.</li>
            <li> Based on review thought it would be good for my husband&#x27;s ankle pain...but did not notice anything significant.  Don&#x27;t need it for hair regrowth.</li>
            <li> Loved it! This is a great product, just what I was looking for...I will be ordering this product again soon.</li>
            <li> Love it, I saw an increase in thickness over a few weeks of application. I apply it twice a week after wash days</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s workings! It&#x27;s only been a month</li>
            <li> I am on my three bottle I use this for my skin and hair this is one of the best products that will always stay with me forever.  I use to have bad skin acne I saw on you  tube some reviews about BCO once I brought it I been hook ever since.  It does exactly what it says my eyebrows were very thin by me plucking them constantly.  Every night I used BCO to my brows and within weeks my brows were so thick and full that amaze me.  Also with my hair when I did my big chop I started using it every night on my scalp even used it as a hot oil treatment and my hair has grown so much it&#x27;s a amazing product.  Everyone I know that has use this product has given it rave reviews and I see why great product!</li>
            <li> this did miracles for me edges</li>
            <li> Great on hair!!!  I had some thin spots and used this oil, within a couple of weeks my thinning improved significantly!!</li>
            <li> My hair has always been relatively healthy and long (the middle of my back). Unfortunately, on and off I&#x27;ve suffered from a dry scalp and whatever I used failed to assist or help the problem long term..  I did a bit of research on the web and found several positive reviews about Tropic Isle Castor Oil. I apply to my scalp the evening before I go to get my hair wash; I wrap it or tie it down with a scarf, go to asleep. The following day my beautician washes it out (I use Alter Ego Garlic Shampoo). It took 3 treatments (3 Saturdays) but I noted a major difference; my scalp was no longer flaky and was growing at faster rate.  Once a month I now use castor oil as a scalp treatment.  My only advise is to add it only to the scalp and not the actual hair.</li>
            <li> people  you should buy this oill,  it&#x27;s amazing it&#x27;s like a magic done in your hair I really love it and I will buy it again</li>
            <li> Still waiting for results on this one.</li>
            <li> Best product out there! I love it !</li>
            <li> Order came packed very nicely! I enjoy the castor oil, it works perfectly on my hair. I recommend this product to anyone who is curious.</li>
            <li> I use this for my natural hair. It thrives on this stuff! Though the bottle is small, its viscosity makes up for it. Thicker than EVOO. There is actually an ample amount of product in it.</li>
            <li> This oil has helped me to grow and protect the edges of my hair. The bottle lasted over 4 months so far and is still going strong. It doesn&#x27;t take a lot coat your hair because  it is so thick, think syrup, but not sticky at all. I would recommend to any people looking for healthy hair or a thick oil.</li>
            <li> I will purchase this Castor oil again; it keeps my hair soft and moisturized.  I also use the hair food by Tropic Isle.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why people complain about the smell. It has a mild odor.  Add a couple of drops of essential oil to fix that. That&#x27;s what all natural, unrefined products smell like: earthy!&lt;br /&gt;It grows your hair. A small price to pay. It arrived quickly!</li>
            <li> My hair grew a lot in the past 3 months it was shoulder length now it&#x27;s to the middle of my back frfr</li>
            <li> I have adopted an all natural lifestyle for my hair, and I am sure glad that I added this to my regimen. I thought because of the dark color it would have a strong overwhelming smell. But actually, it just has a hint of something burnt or roasted, nothing to complain about. It is thick and it able to be spread easily. I use it generously through my scalp and I have noticed an improvement in my severe case of dandruff, and it also makes my natural hair very soft. I also add drops of it to my hair moisturizers and it does help maintain the softness. I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been hearing about castor oil being great for the hair for years. It&#x27;s not until I decided to transition that I became a bit more curious about this oil along with other oils and products. I&#x27;ve tried grape seed oil, olive oil, coconut oil and for the first time castor oil. I must say it has been a relief to my itchy scalp. If you suffer from dermatitis, this Jamaican black castor oil is amazing!</li>
            <li> I use this in home made hair and skin treatments I do at home.  I love it!  I can already notice my hair getting longer, shinier and healthier!</li>
            <li> I love this oil..Its a great source to make your hair grow! Ive used it for a child with patches of hair missing and it grew within a month.</li>
            <li> bought it to grow my edges...the smell is a little different like a woody burnt bacon smell but it is doing great i would recommend</li>
            <li> It makes my hair super shiny. I haven&#x27;t noticed hair returning where it broke off but it&#x27;s only been a month. Only draw back is it&#x27;s a little heavy.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking to replace your lwil maskriti because you a) can&#x27;t go to Haiti to pick up a jug or b) can&#x27;t go to Brooklyn/NJ to buy a bottle, then this product will do as a replacement.  It&#x27;s very expensive, especially considering how little you get (and compared to how much lwil maskriti you could get for the same price), but it works just fine.  I used this for my scalp, hair, and skin whenever NY&#x27;s awful winter weather threatened to make my hair fall off and dandruff flakes cascade off my scalp. Worked like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend using this as soon as you wash your hair for maximum benefit (I have 4c hair).  I have noticed that the benefits of this oil aren&#x27;t as great when I used it while my hair was dry. When I used it while my hair was wet, it eliminated the need for other moisturizing products, and I just put a little shea butter on my ends to hold my double strand twists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people don&#x27;t like the smell, but I really like it - this oil is all my mother used on my hair when I was younger.</li>
            <li> Extremely thick oil.....I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference in my hair but I do think the oil is authentic with real ingredients, it smells like charcoal so you might want to buy a scented version or drop some essential oils into it if that smell bothers you. My hair just didn&#x27;t like the oil. It did relieve dryness and itchiness of my eczema though.</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my Kiddos hair and sometimes on mine and so far i love the results.. If bottle runs up I will buy more.</li>
            <li> Its okay...need to get another scent...this one wasn&#x27;t to pleasant!</li>
            <li> I love this product is really good for my hair and skin just like the bottle says! I use it to smooth down my edges and I use it to seal my ends. Sometimes I even use a little on my body after a bath or shower great product!!</li>
            <li> the bottle was to small to share with friends  :&amp;#62;)</li>
            <li> this product work the same as regular castor oil so just buy regular  castro it&#x27;s no different so save yourself some money.</li>
            <li> Good stuff. Just started using it, so can&#x27;t state the results yet.</li>
            <li> Got this and mixed with my olive and jojoba oil...hair has grown alot and this stuff has a nice smell to it. Since it is thick I recommend mixing it with other oils just to be safe.</li>
            <li> Helped my hair grow..mixed with coconut oil</li>
            <li> I love the way this makes my scalp feel.  But must admit, I haven&#x27;t used it consistently to see a difference in growth in my edges.  I have to start doing it. This was the whole reason I purchased!  Love the way it feels, sometimes I rub it on my feet and hands.  It also lasts a while, you don&#x27;t need much to reap the benefits.</li>
            <li> I love it I will definitely buy it again</li>
            <li> His grandfather and his grandfather conduction velocity they are great&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very amazing to me with all your dealings with the speed and ease</li>
            <li> Still figuring if I love it or not, I really don&#x27;t know how to use it! But so far it seems to be ok</li>
            <li> This quality castor oil is multipurpose.  I&#x27;ve been using it to combat wrinkles and I use a clean mascara wand to put it on my lashes to keep them long and conditioned.  I used to use a Latisse knockoff, so they were still long, but my eyelashes have stayed long and lush with Jamaican Black Castor Oil, which is a lot less expensive and doesn&#x27;t sting!</li>
            <li> My edges were acting funny and becoming shorter on the sides due to being under stress and dying my hair. I thought this product would bring back my edges from listening and reading reviews, but it did not work for me. It&#x27;s so thick so I massage my scalp with this oil and mix it with another light oil, but nevertheless, I will use it till the bottle is empty. Oh and I have been using it going on three to four months.</li>
            <li> I found out about this type of castor oil online. It works wonders on natural hair. I use it, along with other oils and it really makes my feel hair soft and more healthier. Watch out for the smell because it smells pretty bad.</li>
            <li> I got this out of desperation (heard good things about healing scars and overplucked eyebrows). I had maybe 10% faith, but because at that moment I couldn&#x27;t afford the more expensive chemical concoctions, I chose this. After few months I swear by this and other natural oils, and I&#x27;m the type of person who normally scoffs at natural remedies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like sesame oil, and is really hard to spread. Put too much on and you&#x27;ll break out from the greasiness clogging your pores. But use tiny drops and this is amazing. I put mine on those cotton pads and gently dab all over face, then rub over eyebrows and lips. Let me tell you what it does for my sensitive skin:&lt;br /&gt;Mosquitoes love me. I always get huge bumps that inflame and itch pretty bad, lasting for days. I rub the oil on and they go down within 20 minutes, no itching, no redness.&lt;br /&gt;I bit my lip, hard. Rubbed a bit of oil and the thing never swelled like it usually does. Can be used instead of chapstick. A lot healthier and less addictive.&lt;br /&gt;Dry nostrils or dust/pollen allergies? Forget the addictive nose-spray. I just dip a q-tip in the oil and swab my nose. Instant moisturizing relief that lasts for days and I like to thing it purifies the boogers.&lt;br /&gt;Over-plucked eyebrows and/or thin eyelashes? I put this on once a day for a few months, and my brows grew back and got thicker (yay) and my lashes got longer. If you stop applying it on the lashes, they&#x27;ll go back to being thin. Depends on you.&lt;br /&gt;Got red/itchy eyes and no visine or lanoline on hand? I put a wee bit in my eye. It&#x27;s better if you do this before bed, otherwise your vision will suck and your eye area will be greasy and gross. The redness doesn&#x27;t fade right away, but it helps with the pain and infection.&lt;br /&gt;Sunburned and no aloe vera? Rubbed this on my burnt shoulders and neck, the next morning the redness and pain was completely gone. My fianc&amp;eacute;e couldn&#x27;t believe my sunburn was gone that fast. It also smoothes out the wrinkles I have on my shoulders from too many sunburns, so I imagine it will work well for the older folks. Also great for those dry, rough and itchy spots on your knees and elbows!&lt;br /&gt;Overdried hands and brittle nails from too much dishwashing? Dry, achy, swollen feet from running around all day? Soak them in a warm bath, and massage a generous portion of heated (warm the bottle in hot water) castor oil into them for a few minutes, and then put on cotton gloves and socks. Go to bed wearing those. Wake with sweet baby hands and feet, and reinforced nail cuticles. Thank me later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also mix this with other oils to create a super cream. I have yet to combine it with coconut/avocado/grapeseed/almond oil, whatever else I stocked up on. They&#x27;re all good on their own though. Also, if the smell bothers you, put in few drops of your favorite essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard the best use of this is for hair, but my scalp is pretty good anyway and I find it hard to apply and even harder to wash out, and it limps on me (medium length wavy fine hair) so maybe this is better for you ladies (and guys) with long, thick, dry, wild hair. I heard it works for some balding guys, too, but I can&#x27;t vouch for the hair properties at all (excluding eyebrows and eyelashes!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big bottle is a good deal too. Had it for few months and not even 1/4 way down yet.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and please don&#x27;t ingest this, unless you want to pay homage to the porcelain god.&lt;br /&gt;Also be careful to not get it on clothes, it&#x27;s pretty hard to get the stain out.</li>
            <li> I like it for  my hair and edges.</li>
            <li> Great on my natural hair!! Love it!! It works wonderfully!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of weeks but want to give it a full 2-3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I put some on my sister and she saw results within a few days so I believe it works.</li>
            <li> I absolutey love this stuff! It has totally boosted my hair care regimen to a whole other level!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair that is naturally very dry. Also, I do suffer with dry, sensitive scalp issues as well. Since I started using JBCO, my hair feels softer, retains greater moisture to it, and my scalp&#x27;s dryness has been greatly alleviated. And, this product has been aiding in increasing my hair&#x27;s overall health as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JBCO doesn&#x27;t really have much of a smell at oll to me. It has a slight, nutty scent that doesn&#x27;t linger in the hair at all. Also, it is quite concentrated in consistency. Therefore, a little bit really does go a long way with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am 100% pleased with this product. And, I definitely plan to continue purchasing it again and again!</li>
            <li> I decided to order this item instead of purchasing it locally because of the price. It was free shipping and it arrived in 2 days and was more than half off than if I had gone to the store near me. It was worth the wait plus I feel the quality is a little better than what I can locally buy.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair grow.  Good oil .</li>
            <li> REALLY HELP MY EDGES GROW BACK FULL I WAA PLEASED WIT RHW RESULTS AFTER 3 MONTHS</li>
            <li> This product came right away and it has been working great this far!</li>
            <li> I started using this product about 5 months ago and I believe that this product is terrific. I have seen little growth aroung my edges, but I am not gining up on it. But for the rest of my hair, my sylist said to me 1 week ago\\&quot; you have a head full of hair.\\&quot; I wear a weave and refused to look any other time. I have a timeline to look at my hair. I could not resist, my hair has really grown!! I had hair down my back, but my teenage son was killed in an auto accident and all of my hair fell out stress and meds to cope. Good luck everyone, I know my hair will grow long, healthy and full. With God and this product, it will be all good.</li>
            <li> chose it because i heard about this product online review.  yes i will recommend this product to anyone that ask about it</li>
            <li> Tropic Isle always delivers!</li>
            <li> I decided to use this product to help with my growth. I have only had the product for almost two weeks, so I am not sure what the full outcome will be, but so far I&#x27;m happy with it. Its heavier then I would like for my hair but I can deal with it to get the results I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will be getting more for treatments for my clients with hair loss.</li>
            <li> Its good and thick. I thinned it out with olive oil. Perfect for sealing. Didn&#x27;t do anything to thicken my hair. Overall good product.</li>
            <li> My hair had broken off around the edges, I researched how to grow my hair. I watch a number of people on youtube talking about how this product had grown their hair back. I ordered the product and have used it for for 3 weeks my hair is growning back. This product really works I have told several of my friends and they have started using it as well and their hair is growning.</li>
            <li> Smoky smell, thick texture, and wonderful for rehydration of dry scalp issues!</li>
            <li> The product came in nicely. I find it too heavy for my hair and a little irritating for my scalp even when I dilute it. It&#x27;s not an allergy issue and more of a comfort issue. However I do use it on eyebrows. I think this was a good product for my first experience with castor oil.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product to see if it would help the edges of my hairline grow back.  Actually I was really surprised it really works it takes time  but I truly could see my hairline getting thicker. I will definitely continue to use it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;Used alone and also mixed into condition.&lt;br /&gt;Leaves my hair shiny &amp; soft.&lt;br /&gt;Has a strong distinct smoky odor but it doesn&#x27;t last too long after applied to hair.</li>
            <li> This oil is extremely great but for my natural hair sisters . Can&#x27;t go wrong and love it. . Great purchase will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> It is VERY VERY greasy. I don&#x27;t have thin hair at all, I also rarely get greasy hair. I can go like 5 days before I begin to see grease/oils in my hair, but this stuff is really thick and greasy. I used it twice and gave up, it is just sitting in my bathroom. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using this if you are looking to grow your hair out or to restore health. I would say just pay the extra money on &amp;#34;It&#x27;s A 10&amp;#34; leave-in, I have been using this stuff (It&#x27;s A 10) for over 2 years and it really reverses the damage done on your hair. That product is worth the money! It detangles your hair as well. I also recommend trying Not Your Mother&#x27;s &amp;#34;Way To Grow Leave-In&amp;#34;, I didn&#x27;t have the extra cash to spend on It&#x27;s A 10 when I ran out and bought this instead. It&#x27;s a runner up, but it&#x27;s good!</li>
            <li> This is my second bottle of this magical oil. It has grew my daughter and my hair!! I recomend  this product to anyone thats trying to grow their hair.</li>
            <li> Love it and my hair does too.</li>
            <li> I use this oil on my natural hair and in my Deep conditioning treatments and also on my edges and i can def. notice a differance in thickness in my hair. I also sometimes use it as a sealant, it does have a smokey smell that I like and disappears as soon as you rub it on ur hair. I will be buying this again.</li>
            <li> I bought this product because of the wonders I hear it does for your hair. I have to agree, however, I won&#x27;t know for sure until I straighten my curly hair out. I was looking for a product that grows and thinkens hair and this JBCO has appeared to deliver. I have also used it on my eyelashes (careful with that though, it can get into your eyes) and seen them grow and on my dry skin and seen it glow (this is best for dry skin, my skin is combo so I can&#x27;t use it too much on my face, only when necessary). I&#x27;m sure there are many wonders untold about this oil, I am still looking.</li>
            <li> I have purchased many bottles of JBCO and this was my first disappointment. I purchase from the store but, was buying other things and throw this in the cart also. This product was not &amp;#34;black&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; like the ones I normally buy. This one was &amp;#34;light light brown&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;thin&amp;#34;. It looked like some type of oil with a small and I mean small amout of JBCO added and I only say this because of the ash smell. Tropic Isle, you want get anymore of my money!</li>
            <li> i like this this is my second time ordering it and when im done i will be ordering it agagin</li>
            <li> I love it. its raw and keeps my hair nice I was package in a plastic bottle and very oily. be careful when traveling</li>
            <li> Haitian Creole: L&#x27;wil Maskrayti. Same exact thing.</li>
            <li> I had no doubt about this.  when I got it I was waaay pleased.  I soak my once a week at least.  I Warm it up a little.  Perfect.  so good for my hair! :) I recommend this!</li>
            <li> I purchase this castor oil because I was told it would grow my hair around the temples where it have became bald. Since I started to using  this product my hair is growing around the temples and my hair is more easy for me to style. I have already recommended this product to my daughter-in-law.</li>
            <li> i will be using this as required for my hair. thanks to youtube.com for all the good advice giving to me.</li>
            <li> wonderful product looking forward to using more of this line I have recommended this product to other people can&#x27;t wait to order my next order</li>
            <li> This was okay but I did not like the smell.</li>
            <li> As the creator of [[ASIN:B0073JL73A Miracle Hair Growth Oil]] I know a thing or two about growing black hair long. So I can tell you with some authority that Tropic Isle Castor Oil is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s what the oil does best: It will thicken your hair like crazy! Thin edges? This is your product! The cool thing is you can use a little of it on your eyebrows and eyelashes at night to thicken them too! This product is also phenomenal as a sealant in your moisturize and seal process. A little goes a long way with this product, it is quite thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone wants thick,healthy hair, and I can definitely recommend this as a natural way to thicken your hair..</li>
            <li> Always use this brand</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t seen anything improve in my hairline and I have kinda seen it go back alittl more so I&#x27;m not sure if this stuff works I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month and still no improvements.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s done wonders for my hair but it&#x27;s extremely thick and I absolutely hate the smokey smell of it.</li>
            <li> Even though the seller shipped promptly, the castor oil was regular castor oil, and not dark with the consistency of true JBCO. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase again. I would just purchase regular castor oil.</li>
            <li> My stuff arrived with a cracked cap! I can&#x27;t even use it.</li>
            <li> I use and like this oil as a hair treatment, but frankly can&#x27;t find much difference between this type and the stuff from India that I buy from my online health food provider costing a lot less.  If you want to support the Jamaican economy, this is a good way to do so but I remain unconvinced that this is a superior product to any other.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s the only way to describe it is OMG. Some of my hair came out because of heat damage, I stupidly was hot combing my hair sometimes twice a day and some of my hair said NOPE and bye bye. I was devastated, one side was the shortest it&#x27;s ever been, a bit past my ear lobe. I did not give this a 5 because I&#x27;m still waiting for the extra umph that goes with JBCO but it&#x27;s been less than a month and my hair has grown back. I am AA with SLOW growing 4b hair so slow I can scream, I&#x27;ve mixed this product with pepppermint oil but I fully believe that my hair would not have grown back as quickly as it has with this product. Did I mention how SLOW my hair growth rate really is? It is thick so I diluted it with a melted hair growth grease, rub it in every night, and braid my hair into 2 braids and take it out in the morning. This is \\&quot;THE\\&quot; miracle product! I fully believe my hair would still be short if I wasn&#x27;t using this product. This is a must get for all women!</li>
            <li> Girlfriend said bottle was smaller than expected</li>
            <li> Has restored the softness and shine back to my hair.  My hair was starting to get very dry and look dull.  It was depressing me.  This really worked!</li>
            <li> Love it. It really works!</li>
            <li> If you were looking to regrow your edges or make your hair thick..this is the product! It&#x27;s a little thick and doesn&#x27;t smell the best but it&#x27;s nothing a little water can&#x27;t help.</li>
            <li> Helped my hair grow..mixed with coconut oil</li>
            <li> Just applied this stuff to my roots for the first time today. I left it on for about 2 hours. Washed it off with shampoo and now my hair feels ridiculously smooth. I will update in about a month or two whether it does anything to thicken and prevent breakage.</li>
            <li> I brought this product for my hair but this product has helped me eliminate pain in my joints and neck pain. I gave my girlfriend some when I visited her and it eased the pain she was having around her right shoulders. She even went to a Jamaican store and purchased her a larger bottle for her constant pain. I did not use this product a lot on my hair but man does it work wonders for pain! I love it!!</li>
            <li> Still using this. Can tell its straight from the islands.</li>
            <li> Seems to do its job....</li>
            <li> omg this oil i use for my hair,and ache and pain and it works wonders</li>
            <li> Havn&#x27;t seen results yet.</li>
            <li> Great product fro hair growth especially if you hair is thinning.</li>
            <li> Great Product. Good vendor.</li>
            <li> I started using this product on receipt, January 7, 2013.  I HAD a bald spot at the a nape of my neck.  I noticed hair growth after 2&lt;br /&gt;weeks.  On February 8, 2013, the bald spot was completely filled in with HAIR, almost 1/2 inch.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> It does an ok job at thickening but i did not see results for awhile and it wasnt unbelievable results, just being honest everyone ranting and raving about them receiving all these inches a month when in reality if ur hair grows fast or normal naturally ur going to get these results anyway because its your norm. Would not waste time on.this if your hair.grows slow already. U will be disppointed.</li>
            <li> The real deal..using it as I transition from perm to Natural.</li>
            <li> MY FAVORITE OF ALL THE OILS. MIXES WITH OTHER PRODUCTS WELL. FAST SERVICE ALONG WITH SECURE PACKAGING</li>
            <li> I tend to have dry, ratty, dull hair... tried everything including a barrage of different oils (vitamine E, olive oil, coconut oil, Argan oil, you name it)... All I ever got out of it was dry, ratty, dull and OILY-looking hair! Gross. Not with this product! It goes in a little thick, so it&#x27;s a bit hard to spread evenly (somebody here suggested mixing it with a tad of olive oil), or just spread a tiny bit in your palms and gently rub it in your hair... Worked wonders for me. My hair looks and feels luscious for the first time in my life! Wow! Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been using this on my brows in hopes this will help them grow back. I have not been consistent in applying every night, but I do notice a little more hair coming in. I will try to update this in a month or so on my progress.</li>
            <li> Very nice price for the size and the product really does wonders for my naturally kinky hair.  Highly recommend to anyone! Especially for Natural Black hair</li>
            <li> This castor oil is a multipurpose product. It can be used for a number of things. I use it as a hair and skin moisterizer.</li>
            <li> I used it on my daughter bald spots as well as my edges and I see some improvement very thick oil a little goes a long way</li>
            <li> Im in love with this stuff works moisture wonders on my hair...speciallly with me being afro textured hair it makes my hair softer.</li>
            <li> So this stuff certainly helps my hair, but i wouldnt leave it in my hair. I have mixed hair (i am Jamaican and irish) so i have &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34;, fine hair, thats wavy. This product is too thick and makes my hair look greasy. I put it in my hair an hour or so before I shower. Then I wash it out. I do this about 2 times a week. I notice my hair is stronger and looks healthier.</li>
            <li> Great usage for EVERYTHING!</li>
            <li> i mix it with grape seed oil to loosen it up a bit. so far i like it. I seal my ends with it .</li>
            <li> I received my JBCO one month ago. I am a natural and wear twist outs daily. I use JBCO as a prepoo weekly along with coconut oil.  I find that JBCO is thickening my new growth and the texture is becoming softer with a beautiful curl pattern.  I have less dandruff and use it on my scalp 3 times a week and on my edges. It has stimulated my growth rate and I definitely see a difference. Today, i will be ordering two more btls... one for me and one for my sister.</li>
            <li> CASTOR OIL, ALONG WITH THE WILD GROWTH, CASTOR AND PIMENTO IS THE BEST HAIR HEALTH AND GROWTH OILS ON THE MARKET</li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised  that this product actually works to promote hair growth as many reviews have said. I will continue to use it. I took off one star for the smell and the fact that it  is very heavy on my fine hair. I now mix it with other oils and I like it better.</li>
            <li> I did ALOT of research mainly for natural THICK hair growth and REgrowth (edges/nape) products and I repeatedly ended up with Jamaican Black castor oil. After more research I found it was ALL natural and wasn&#x27;t only great for hair but lots of other things! I was cautious because some ppl talked about the &amp;#34;ash&amp;#34; smell, but when I used it found that the smell was not bad at all. This was said to be the most trusted brand and that it was a little exspensive yet I found it on amazon (no surprise) for very cheap either way a little goes a long way. It was well worth the buy, I saw a difference within days. I am very happy I purchased it, and I hope my review helps someone else discover this natural secret! &#x3D;-)</li>
            <li> I received this product on March 5, 2013 and started using it right away. I was so excited reading all the reviews online about. Until I started noticing my hair was shedding more than usual. My hair is already naturally thin and I also have extreme thinning at my crown and my temples that I was going to target with the oil. Well now they are thinner. Like u can literally see my scalp!!! I&#x27;m already self concious about my thin spots and now they are worse. I washed my hair this weekend and tried a twist out and it looked horrible. I&#x27;m very upset. Now I will have to most likely wear a wig until these areas thicken back up. My reason for going natural was because my hair had fell out a lot after having my son. Now I feel like Ive gone back to square one. I can&#x27;t see how there are so many positive reviews for this stuff online but yet not many about the excessive shedding!!! I WANT MY HAIR BACK!!!</li>
            <li> did&#x27;nt work well on my hair,  hair shedding and does&#x27;nt work well with bleached hair. hope someone give a better review..</li>
            <li> Let me tell you that I&#x27;ve tried EVERYTHING! From Protectiv, Mane n Tail, Doo Groo, Palmers, etc. I&#x27;ve had this for only a month and I definitely saw some growth and my hair got thicker! Even my hair dresser was amazed at how much it grew( I hadn&#x27;t seen her in about 6 weeks) This is VERY recommenedable especially with breaking edges. I&#x27;m so happy with this product! I&#x27;m about to get my braids soon due to the warmer weather and I can&#x27;t wait!!! Get it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed :)</li>
            <li> I love love love this product! It does not have the best smell but it does wonders on my hair. It is a little cheaper on another website but it is a great product.</li>
            <li> Using for about a month now &amp; I do see a little growth</li>
            <li> I have been an ongoing user of the black castor oil and trust me when I say, this stuff really works!!! It makes my hair a lot thicker and fuller so it is always full of life and bounces beautifully catching the attention of many... I use it to steam my hair twice a month and use a mixture of this and tropic isle living red pimento growth oil to oil my hair every other day... Smells great and a bang for your buck</li>
            <li> Love this castor oil! It&#x27;s so thick and it makes my oil mixtures so much easier to apply to my hair!</li>
            <li> Great product. Have been using this ever since I was a child.</li>
            <li> been using it a week &amp; already see growth! around my edges are thinning from braids and right sew-ins so I decided to give this a try. I did a hot oil treatment with it and I also did the inversion method, within a week I began to see growth around thin spots. this really works and I&#x27;m very surprised and excited. I&#x27;m trying desperately to get my hair back to his it was after a bad haircut so I&#x27;m doing everything I can to get it back to its once bra strap length. I&#x27;m hoping this is my savior. wish me luck. :*</li>
            <li> I purchased this based on a friend&#x27;s suggestion for my hair. It is actually helping the senstive edges around my scalp. It looks like I am getting some new hair growth. Definitely worth trying for the price and quick delivery!</li>
            <li> I bought this for cosmetic uses on the advice of a friend. I loved it. It does have a smoky odor but it&#x27;s pros outweigh it&#x27;s cons in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Works great on my 9 month&#x27;s old hair.  It helped grow back her edges in a week.  I use it before I braid her hair and it softens it so much that she barely even notices when I am braiding it.  It is too thick for my relaxed hair, but works perfectly on her hair.</li>
            <li> Very itchy on scalp...but very moisturizing on hair.</li>
            <li> I am not sure if it works. But I will say it does help with my itchy sore scalp. I have this problem with painful itchy patches in my head. This is the only thing that gives me long term relief  update: coming back to edit my profile. I think this works best with natural hair , when I had a perm I&#x27;m not too sure it was helpful but with natural hair, it keeps my hair oiled and it actually shines! for 4b/c hair thats a miracle.. I&#x27;m not sure about growth but with the oils I&#x27;m sure it will help!</li>
            <li> Great product and came so quickly :)</li>
            <li> After all the good reviews and word of mouth about black castor oil, I decided to try it.  First of all, the oil is not black; its the same clear color as regular castor oil, just a little thinner.  Second, I&#x27;ve been using the oil for about 2 months now and nothing is happening.  It makes the hair soft and the scalp a little greasy, but I have not seen any growth.  I wonder if another brand would work better for me?  Well, different strokes for different folks!</li>
            <li> I use this for at hime remedies, like emergency lip balm and growing my eyebrow back. Its super thick!! I have put it on my eyebrows for 3 days and they have SO MUCH new growth! Ive been trying to grow them back for 5 years!</li>
            <li> Gross, smells awful and do not put in hair!  This was thrown away after one use. I will never pur chase again</li>
            <li> Best stuff out there for damaged hair. Natural and really no smell.</li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;m seeing the difference.</li>
            <li> I poured 1/4th the bottle into some hair greese. ( hard to distribute through my thick hair ) ive already used two bottles of greese mixed with this in about a 2 month period and my hair has grown a noticeable differenc. Im going to keep buying this......forever.  my hair also has less breakage and its sooooooooo much softer.</li>
            <li> The product did not build up in my hair.  I used it around my edges at night before tying on my wrap.  It appears that my edges are thicker and possibly stronger.  It does have an odor, but nothing unbearable to me.</li>
            <li> this works perfect for my natural kinky hair texture. Its not too heavy, depending on how much you use, and its a lasting moisturizer for our roots.</li>
            <li> Good product for price.  I like it.  Is as described.  A little is all that is needed.  I use it on a daily bases for my hair.</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve put this on for weeks and my temples are worst than they were. I was excited cause I researched it on here, youtube, &amp; google but for me my temples are now smooth when before they were thin (atleast I had some hair!).  I do NOT recommend this to anyone (I&#x27;m glad I only applied it to my eyelashes 2X which actually blurred my vision).  My advice~ Use at your own risk, it&#x27;s NOT for everyone.  Anyone have some other suggestions cause this one is epic FAIL!</li>
            <li> I purchased this JBCO in February because I had extremely dry skin around the edges of my hairline, which lead to balding spots. Within the 3 months my edges have completely grown back and the dry scalp no longer exists! I am really amazed at how fast this oil worked to regrow my edges-I now have thick edges! The oil is very thick and has a scent which I can live with, it&#x27;s all good! Good for your hair!</li>
            <li> I bought this because I had heard rave reviews about it on natural Black hair websites, and I&#x27;d also heard what it can do for your skin. It&#x27;s good stuff, really thick, so I don&#x27;t think it would make a good daily hair oil, but it&#x27;s definitely good in a small amount in a mixture of oils, and in skin products. I mixed mine in both a shea butter concoction and hair oil concoction (both in a style similar to Youtube&#x27;s Naptural85), and I&#x27;m very satisfied. The bottle looks small, but it does go a long way, and I still have more than half, although I do use it sparingly.</li>
            <li> I wear my hair natural. Use sparingly on my scalp after each wash.</li>
            <li> Grew back my edges within a month after having my 1st child, this stuff works.</li>
            <li> Excellent product, have purchased before.</li>
            <li> Love it so far will buy a bigger size. I used it in my hair with other oils and would use it again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m doing the castor oil challenge and have got rave reviews. Everyone says the smell is strongbut it really isn&#x27;t when you put on your hair, but I do understand that if you are use to your hair products smelling fruity and sweetthat this smell is off putting.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect, but was only pleasantly surprised with how much I liked this product! This product absorbed very well into the scalp and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy. This product can be applied to the edges and scalp daily, without having a build up. I&#x27;ve noticed less dryness around my hair line and my scalp seems to be more moisturized, since using this oil. I will be repurchasing this product once I&#x27;ve run out!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure of this doing anything out of the ordinary for my hair growth than I was hoping for. My temples have gotten thin over the years &amp; I wanted to try this because of so many reviewers great testimonies. I use this regularly by applying a little on my fingertips &amp; massaging onto my scalp maybe 2 times a week and the day before I plan on washing my hair, I use a bit more, just to let it absorb  more into my scalp. I also mix some into my conditioner on wash day &amp; it do make my hair soft from that. I will continue to do this until I come across something else with great reviews &amp; then i&#x27;ll give that a try. I was really hoping this would be my miracle oil. Everyone is different so you&#x27;ll need to try it for yourself to see if this will work for you.</li>
            <li> Love this oil. Use it in a mixture of other oils to keep my skin moisturized during this dry winter months.</li>
            <li> This product is way too concentrated. If you have sensitive scalp do not use. this product gave me a rash in my scalp and i would not say my scalp is sensitive. I tried diluting it with an other oil, and I still got a rash (however, not as bad as before). it does however make you hair shiny and smooth, but you need to keep it away from the scalp.</li>
            <li> causes great growth and thickening on hair and eyelashes. Definitely a keeper for my family. Arrived in great shape and quickly.</li>
            <li> This castor oil is a staple in my house. I mostly use it in my hot oil treatments or to moisturize my scalp. It is very thick and doesn&#x27;t smell the best, but the benefits are worth it.</li>
            <li> Jamaican Black Castor Oil is AMAZING for your hair. Being Jamaican myself, I&#x27;ve been using this specific brand and product since I was little and my mom was doing my hair. A little of this product goes a long way, so it&#x27;s best to not be heavy handed, especially on straight or loosely curled hair. While the smell turns some people off, as with quite a few natural oils, it&#x27;s benefits cannot be denied. With regular application, I use this directly on the scalp, it keeps your hair nice and thick. If you have thinning edges or thin hair in general, this may be your best bet other than taking a supplement such as biotin to really increase the thickness of your hair. The biggest suggestion I have for anyone who is looking to try this product for the first time is GIVE IT TIME. This is not an over night sensation type of product. It takes a while for your hair to adapt to a new regimen and for you to reap the benefits of a new product, so do give it time. If you sincerely cannot stand the smell, I would highly suggest layering your JBCO treatment with Oyin Handmade Juices and Berries Herbal Leave-In Hair Tonic. You can find it on Amazon and it smells absolutely DELICIOUS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, highly recommend adding this oil to your hair care routine. With a bit of patience, you&#x27;ll definitely see results!</li>
            <li> love it the best castor oil ever</li>
            <li> I strictly use it on my edges to keep them intact. Its a thick oil with a pleasant smell. It will work for all those naturals like myself. The 4 ounce is not all that big but it is enough. The thickness will allow you to use less and still get the job done.</li>
            <li> Great for the hair and skin</li>
            <li> good castor oil, the price is cheap and it works well. its seems authentic and i like that it comes in a glass bottle</li>
            <li> The oil is pretty thick and smells like sesame oil. It works okay to me, I prefer coconut oil as it less greasy and lightweight. You can use a Qtip and dip it into the oil then apply onto your scalps to prevent hair loss :)</li>
            <li> CAN&#x27;T SAY MUCH IT&#x27;S OIL.</li>
            <li> Worked great for my eyebrows. Give it a couple weeks to get working. It washes off easily with soap. I put it on my eyebrows at night, and sometimes I would put a very, very small portion on my eyebrows after doing my makeup just for shine. Beware that it is an oil, so if you put too much you will be greasy.</li>
            <li> It helps out a lot for eczema. Did not grow or thicken my hair. But a wonderful moisturizer, although I would recommend just using it on the scalp because it can weigh down your hair and make it look greasy.</li>
            <li> I have used before and my edges have never looked better</li>
            <li> This oil is great for hair and skin. I mix it with my cocoa and shea butter. It&#x27;s even great to just put in your hair after a workout or sweating to restore moisture. Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I love the price and the quality of this item it worked GREAT!  I would purchase it again from Amazon! The 4 oz only negative aspect of this item.</li>
            <li> use this before now on grandbaby&#x27;s air hair is growing</li>
            <li> As soon as I received this oil I automatically smelled it to see if it smelt of burnt ashes, and surprisingly I was pleasantly surprised that it smelled good. I just mixed it with my almond oil and diluted it with some water and generously applied it to my roots and ends and the next day my hair was nice and soft. I haven&#x27;t seen any growth yet but I&#x27;m sure I will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to those who are transitioning to natural hair.</li>
            <li> Good product itchy the first time i used it good results. great hair stimulation doesnt smell and stops breakage of hair</li>
            <li> Great for natural hair and skin. Strong smell when you initially use it, but it does fade away. Will continue to use this product</li>
            <li> Love this oil so far! I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair and on the many stretch marks I have. So far I see a lot of improvement on the stretch marks!! They have gone lighter. As for hair growth I cant really say it has helped me grow my hair because I&#x27;m currently using other products for that too. But my hair looks a lot thicker and healthy</li>
            <li> I bought it to see if it would grow my sides, based on youtube users positive reviews of the product. For me I felt it was too thick and messy...Maybe I needed to be more patient to see results, so far I have only used it for two weeks but not religiously.</li>
            <li> Very sticky to try and massage into hair</li>
            <li> I use the oil on my lashes and I have seen some growth in the 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using it. I will begin using it on my hair soon.</li>
            <li> If you are here to read the comments on whether this stiff works or not, just do yourself a favor and buy it already!!!! This stuff us AMAZING! I cannot believe the growth within 2 months of using this product. I will use this oil for the rest of my life. You will not regret buying it.</li>
            <li> I got great results from this product. I have no problems with the smell of it and will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> ❤❤❤ I&#x27;ve been using this a couple if weeks and I can already tell a big difference in my hair...my edges were starting to thin because of the constant wig wearing, but this product truly is a live saver. I apply it every morning before I put on my wig and then once again when I go to bed. The smell isn&#x27;t very appealing but hey long as it works I can deal with the smell.. Lol 🙌👍</li>
            <li> I already knew I loved this....I use it a sealer afer I spray on my leave in conditioner and put on my essential oils.</li>
            <li> Bought this to use on hair since I was told to try it in replace of my regular castor oil, and I must say that i was not impressed. I was told a lot of good things about what this could do for my hair but I haven&#x27;t seen anything differently happen in comparison to me using my other hair oils. It was also more expensive than the regular oil for less product.</li>
            <li> The oil is very thick, it has a castor oil smell. But that&#x27;s what makes the product effective. I will continue to use in hair treatments to see how much of a difference it makes, can&#x27;t say right now.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t see any significant hair growth, but my hair , as well as, my scalp were properly hydrated. It does have a smell that could be somewhat unwelcomed, but you can mask it with an oil of your choice to tone it down.</li>
            <li> Very strong smelling but I&#x27;ve only been using it on and off for a couple weeks and I can notice a difference. I&#x27;d recommend that you mix it with another oil like coconut oil, that was it smells good. The smell is TERRIBLE. but it works good.</li>
            <li> Very thick, and not liking the smell very muc .</li>
            <li> It was okay i have had better. This is good for mixing with other hair products, to give it that extra oil base.</li>
            <li> I only recently learned of the benefits of Black Castor Oil and I am very happy to have found this particular seller. Perfect packaging in a dark bottle to preserve the quality, excellent price and very generous 4 ounce bottle. Excellent consistency, color, and potency. This Black Castor Oil provides excellent results. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> mixed this with oils for hair. Still waiting. but great benefits</li>
            <li> I do not see any changes in my hair even after a few months later. This product is fake and useless.</li>
            <li> I use this on my skin, not my hair and it works great. Better than any facial lotion.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough about this oil, I have been using it for several years now.  It makes my natural hair soft and tames my crazy curls.  A little goes a long way.  Not all JBCO is created equal, but this one is a keeper.  I just wish they would stop raising the price on it.  You can also put it on skin irritations like Exzema</li>
            <li> this is a great natural oil to help regrow my edges and my crown in also thicken my hair a little go a long way with this product</li>
            <li> Tropic isle Jamaican castor oil is the best on the market can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. Thank you</li>
            <li> Good buy for a hair care product</li>
            <li> Great for my type of hair.</li>
            <li> I never write reviews! But this product is fabulous. After reading the reviews I decided to try it. After shampooing, I added a 1/2 tbs to conditioner sat under drier with plastic cap for 10 mins, then rinsed. My hair had a nice smooth texture with a killer shine. After styling I did not need a finishing product because shine maintained throughout styling process. Will definitely continue to use.  I gave it 4 stars because I haven&#x27;t experienced hair growth or thickness. After continue use will update..</li>
            <li> Tropic Isle&#x27;s Jamaican Black Castor Oil is amazing! I use it as a hair oil and as as a moisturizer for my skin. It works well for both. I notice my usually dry, thin hair is now thicker, fuller and more hydrated since I&#x27;ve been using this product the past couple weeks. My temples and hairline that were balding from excessive braiding and weaves is filling in. And at night after I cleanse, I use a small drop of the oil as a facial moisturizer. It works overnight to leave my skin supple in the morning. People can never guess my age ;)Try it!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really works,my hair looks little more thicker.</li>
            <li> Too early to comment on it.</li>
            <li> I got this oil because my hair was thinning ( transitioning from relaxed to natural) and a bald spot this oil is a 10/10 has helped me in anyway and has gave me a lot of NEW GROWTH !!! Would recommend to anybody !! Must Buy Have been using it since August 31 and I see a lot of improvement. Next i&#x27;m looking forward to the Tropic Isle Living Strong Roots Red Pimento Hair Growth Oil !</li>
            <li> Brings luster back to your hair.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for the last year after my hair broke off in the back, now the growth has made my hair even. I add a capful to my hair lotion, (shake it up really good) and i also part my hair and put it on my scalp, not every day but around every 2 weeks, not a lot. it helps with breakage and growth. I also use on my face after cleansing it, great moisturizer as it also helps skin problems. I am never without a bottle in my bathroom.</li>
            <li> This oil is great for thinning areas along the hairline, and promoting softer and longer hair. It takes a little while to see results, but its worth the wait. I massage this stuff on my scalp every night and notice that my hair is thicker and softer after 2 months of use. It may be a little thick for some, but a good solution would be to mix it with another oil like coconut or jojoba.</li>
            <li> Always great!  Love what it does for my skin and hair. . . . . . .. . ... .</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell great ... But it is so good ... Loved it!</li>
            <li> I am so lucky to come across this product. I am in love once again, just don&#x27;t tell my husband ;) In just a week of using this product I noticed results :) I was a bit spectacle but decided to try it, the smell is not so hot but after leaving it in overnight the smell did not linger no matter how much you use :) It made my hair soft, after wash, thick and when applied to scalp less hair fallout!! Definitely repurchasing :)</li>
            <li> Love it! so many uses!</li>
            <li> Just started using the product and so far so good.</li>
            <li> This product leaves my hair very soft, I have not used it for a long period of time yet but it seems like it will work. :)</li>
            <li> helped grow my thinning edges back. The smell isn&#x27;t the best but honey it works.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;Cathy B&lt;br /&gt;SF, CA Bay Area!!</li>
            <li> This oil is great for my hair. I massage it onto my scalp and roots every other day, and my roots are now super shiny, sleek and extremely soft. Ive only had it for a week, so I haven&#x27;t experienced any hair growth, but so far its been great.</li>
            <li> first off i bought this for hair but decided to also use it on eyelashes and brows. now the brows i knew would take awhile, they are only half there. no growth in years so far for the brows there is a few sprouts, slight but there. Now the eyelashes WOWWWW  growth. there is nothing like seeing results from a product. my lashes are longer, now i dont have to use the lengthing mascara i just use regular for the black color. so if thats an issue for you try using this very, good product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! Quality castor oil for a descent price!  It arrived in a timely fashion and was decently wrapped!</li>
            <li> I use this product as a staple product in the maintenace of my hair. Can&#x27;t live without this product!! I would reccomend for women who are transitioning to wearing their natural hair. I only use this as a remedy for dry skin, and exzema.</li>
            <li> i tried this cause everyone from your mama to grandma to friend to aunt everyone even on youtuble praised this. i tried this for two months straight i havent seen any results expect it gets my hair thick. but no growth i been using to my edged like crazy twice a day every other day and nothing. im gonna keep using it hoping my edged will grow back :(</li>
            <li> This is some amazing stuff.  It really helps with dryness and got my hair growing nicely.  It&#x27;s time to order some more!</li>
            <li> High quality castor oil..highly recommended</li>
            <li> Love my Jamaican castor oil. This smells as bad as the one back home and has the thick consistency but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair grow like the castor oil my mom used in my hair while growing up in Jamaica. AND ofcourse my husband hates the smell- but what can I do??</li>
            <li> This stuff has done wonders for my hair. But be careful. When i first started using this oil I was very heavy handed which caused my hair to be very limp and sticky. A little goes a very long way. It makes my new growth very soft and extra manageable. Highly recommended for all African American type four hair types.</li>
            <li> I never got my order the seller took my money so please do not order from this seller. I give the product itself a 5 star rating though because I have tried it before its amazing.  It grew my hair and filled in my thin edges. A must have oil for anyone on a healthy hair journey.</li>
            <li> I will never go without using this product in my hair regimen...it does wonders for my hair. I mix it in a moisturizing conditioner along with coconut oil as a preshampoo treatment and it does wonders for my hair.</li>
            <li> The jbco is a good product , i found a bigger bottle for cheaper locally so i will go there next time</li>
            <li> I researched and product before buying it. I read about it and watched youtube reviews everyone raves about this oil. I needed something to grow my thin fading edges. I wear a long weave and thought it looked silly with a long thick weave and thin edges. I can say I really love this product. The smell is not noticeable like people exaggerate about. This is the only thing that keeps my dry hair smooth and shining. It lays my hair down after I apply it I wear my silk scarf. It keeps my hair soft and edges looking natural. I don&#x27;t like the slick edge look. I can see a difference after a month. Slow progress is better than none. I will continue to use this product a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Has a strong smell. The amount in the bottle couldn&#x27;t really see if it did anything significant. I bought a bigger bottle of a different brand, and will see how that one goes. Also this one isn&#x27;t cold pressed, which is the better way of extracting the oil.</li>
            <li> Since I have started using it, my hair thicker fuller and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad that I added this product to my regimen.</li>
            <li> My hair line was very thin from using other product that did not agree and made my hair brittle, weak and evetually break off. I did dome research and found this product.  I massaged it into</li>
            <li> so happy i got my product and am looking forward to using it to grow my hairline back.... so happy</li>
