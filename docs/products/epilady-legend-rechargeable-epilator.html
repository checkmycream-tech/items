            <li>We don&#x27;t need to wait growth and these are amazing!!!  </li>
            <li>Does a great job!</li>
            <li>so this is perfect.</li>
            <li>Hurts to use but great results!</li>
            <li>Perfect!</li>
            <li>This is  a truly great epilator!</li>
            <li>This is the best one yet.</li>
            <li>i dont like the guide bar, but everything else is perfect</li>
            <li>This is a very good product.  </li>
            <li>lol</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it works great on the coarser hair of legs.  </li>
            <li>The charge holds for quite awhile and the shaver does a great job of removing hair.</li>
            <li>This product is great because I can travel with it.  </li>
            <li>I use the epilady for my brazilian, which works great.</li>
            <li>Works great.  </li>
            <li>Great price.</li>
            <li>This epilator was not as good.  </li>
            <li>Good customer service though.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t feel I get as good results with the epilady,</li>
            <li>I was hoping this would be as good as my sister in laws, but it is not.  </li>
            <li>LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>I tried this out for the first time on my bikini area and it works great!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love it!</li>
            <li>I have been using an epilator for over 13 years and have been lucky to have owned two very good epilators.  </li>
            <li>Great looking, easy to use, as describe, i do recommand this seller.</li>
            <li>The results are amazing.</li>
            <li>Also, it did not grab the hairs as well as I would have liked.  </li>
            <li>I guess I am on my own.  </li>
            <li>I seem to be on my own.  </li>
            <li>So the thing doesn&#x27;t work and I am on my own.</li>
            <li>so I cannot attest to its durability, but so far I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li>Ok so this thing is not as amazing as some people claimed.</li>
            <li>You are about to see how strong a woman you are!  </li>
            <li>more than pulled them.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>love it battery charge lasts forever</li>
            <li>I use the Epilady Legend on my face more than any where else.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m so glad a friend recommended this for me.</li>
            <li>What can i tell you more.</li>
            <li>I love that you can use it plugged in or cordless.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used both to compare which one gave me better results.</li>
            <li>The braun epilator has a pivoting head that contours to your body, which I love.</li>
            <li>I still use my Braun epilator, as I feel I get better results and is smoother when gliding over my skin (the epilady tends to skip).</li>
            <li>I Love this.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
            <li>but I had a Braun that I feel may have done a better job</li>
            <li>She seems to love it :-)</li>
            <li>if this is the first epilator, you would be good.</li>
            <li>I mostly use it for touch up, so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>if you haven&#x27;t done laser and your hair is &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li>on it is smooth sailing.</li>
            <li>and it had a built in light.  </li>
            <li>This could be improved by having a light.  </li>
            <li>This model feels cheap, sounds cheap, and will not remove the hair without rubbing and rubbing and rubbing across my skin, making it tender.</li>
            <li>I Always recommend the Epilady brand as I feel it is far superior to anything else out there on the market.</li>
            <li>I was excited to get my Epilator</li>
            <li>;) I won&#x27;t go as far as saying it felt good</li>
            <li>I bought it for my wife, who seems extremely pleased, and delighted in showing me her resulting very soft legs and other areas, so I am quite pleased with it as well.</li>
            <li>I tried to figure out how much time it saves me but decided to do something more fun with my time than math.</li>
            <li>I had an older version that had to be plugged in &amp; it seemed to work better.  </li>
            <li>Living at the beach, you can&#x27;t exactly get away with not shaving your pits!</li>
            <li>They take a little getting used to, but they are great.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it almost every day to make sure I stay smooth, but there are definitely fewer hairs each day.  </li>
            <li>The results are definitely worth it to me.</li>
            <li>Too large and bulky !  </li>
            <li>After the first inital epilation, I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft my legs were!</li>
            <li>Good value for price, My first one so can&#x27;t really compare to other models or brands.</li>
            <li>I bought my first Epilady in 1988.</li>
            <li>And my hair grows really fast!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure this is just breaking the hair off at the skin level, not actually pulling it out from the root.</li>
            <li>The braun epilator was the first epilator I&#x27;ve bought and the first one I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>been using epilady since they first came out....</li>
            <li>However, there was this lip at the top, I am assuming it&#x27;s a protective lip of some kind, which made it very hard to maneuver.  </li>
            <li>I find you need to go over the same spots multiple times with this one for good results.  </li>
            <li>But, it does hurt and it&#x27;s a little more time consuming than just quickly shaving.</li>
            <li>Previously, I was waxing using the Clean + Easy waxing kit, but it had its drawbacks:</li>
            <li>and it did stay charged the whole time I used it.  </li>
            <li>that didn&#x27;t matter and it stayed charged the whole time</li>
            <li>and I have to use it several times a week to keep my legs hair free.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend trying!</li>
            <li>I do wish I could buy replacement heads instead of having to buy a whole new device each time though.</li>
            <li>I only have to quickly go over the area about once a week to maintain the smoothness, as opposed to once or twice a day shaving with a razor.</li>
            <li>I finally ended up removing the entire purple part at the top.  </li>
            <li>Might be worth the try for you, but just note the above.</li>
            <li>In California I have the right to return the item purchased to the place of purchase during the entire warranty period.  </li>
            <li>love this, but you need thick hairs for it to really work.</li>
            <li>The thighs take longer to complete than the calves, and you have to go over the same area several times before it&#x27;s free of hair.</li>
            <li>Can be used on face, but causes some irritation; so do at night and not if you have someplace important to go for a few days.  </li>
            <li>The hair is not growing back as fast either..........</li>
            <li>As of now, the braun 5 works better, for me at least.</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I ordered the tiny Epilator as the same time, it is the only one of the 2 which is functional and actually removes the hair.  </li>
            <li>I have to admit I was a little scared when I was ready to use it for the first time.</li>
            <li>and there&#x27;s no mess.</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s fun to see the results last so long!</li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t work as well as my old one that is a different brand</li>
            <li>so I went back to my old brand.  </li>
            <li>No more razor burn or super itchy legs, or cuts from the razor.</li>
            <li>Pretty soon I bet I will just be dealing with a few survivors each time.  </li>
            <li>but as you continue to use it the pain is less and even initially the pain goes away fast.</li>

            <li> Pretty soon I bet I will just be dealing with a few survivors each time.  </li>
            <li> but as you continue to use it the pain is less and even initially the pain goes away fast.</li>
            <li> The first time using this on your underarm hair REALLY SUCKS, but trust me, from then</li>
            <li> Overall I would say it did the job, although it took twice as long, but I didn&#x27;t have anything else to do so</li>
            <li> Maybe my hair is just too fine, or there&#x27;s something wrong with my vitamin intake, but it&#x27;s not working the way I thought</li>
            <li> That was a long time ago, and I have become a lifetime fan and promoter of this product.</li>
            <li> I purchased it because I go on a lot of long road trips</li>
            <li> Yes I had a few adult beverages to get my nerve up.</li>
            <li> For the price though, I will need to use this for a long time!</li>
            <li> It only has two speeds and is not strong enough to pull out all the hairs.  </li>
            <li> (so takes you too much time to get your legs done), the tweezers are not good</li>
            <li> Definitely, do not buy it if you have previous experience with epilators.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hurts about the same or a little less than waxing actually</li>
            <li> but sometimes it does not always get every single hair!</li>
            <li> Does not really hurt at all on arms once you get the hang of it.  </li>
            <li> This product does not work at all like expected.</li>
            <li> This does not work at all how I expected</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected, but it will do for now.</li>
            <li> It usually gets most hsir and is not too painful.  </li>
            <li> In case, if you have other ones.. don&#x27;t even try it!</li>
            <li> My previous one was corded and I wanted one that I could use anywhere</li>
            <li> I do also recommend using it after a shower for less pain and to trim your hair a little if it&#x27;s longer than 1 inch.</li>
            <li> You do have to be a little limber for that &amp; the backs of your legs.</li>
            <li> It is painful, but would be worth it if the hair was all removed.  </li>
            <li> A lot less $ than waxing!</li>
            <li> My legs weren&#x27;t so bad, but the first trip over my underarms was something else.  </li>
            <li> First time is a bit painful but you get  used to the pulling</li>
            <li> Also painful at first</li>
            <li> The first use was a little shocking because, instead of ripping off an entire patch of hair at one time, it nibbles out each hair it encounters.  </li>
            <li> a graving the small hairs..</li>
            <li> I have a lot of numbness in hands &amp; legs &amp; it&#x27;s hard for me to shave.  </li>
            <li> At least you get to rip off a swath at a time instead of a slow, nibbling torture.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s slow</li>

            <li> I bought my first Epilady in 1988. I was hooked imediately. After the first inital epilation, I couldn&#x27;t believe how smooth and soft my legs were! That was a long time ago, and I have become a lifetime fan and promoter of this product. When the Discrette came out, I bought one for myself and my girlfriend, who is now hooked on this system. Since then, I have bought them for friends and my Daughter. I Always recommend the Epilady brand as I feel it is far superior to anything else out there on the market. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
            <li> Living at the beach, you can&#x27;t exactly get away with not shaving your pits! And my hair grows really fast! The first time using this on your underarm hair REALLY SUCKS, but trust me, from then on it is smooth sailing. I only have to quickly go over the area about once a week to maintain the smoothness, as opposed to once or twice a day shaving with a razor. I&#x27;ll never go back! I do wish I could buy replacement heads instead of having to buy a whole new device each time though. Oh, and I think if I tried using this on my legs, I might die! lol</li>
            <li> love this, but you need thick hairs for it to really work. i had done some later so my hairs were thinner, so this broke them more than pulled them. if you haven&#x27;t done laser and your hair is &amp;#34;virgin&amp;#34; you&#x27;ll be fine</li>
            <li> I finally used it this weekend.  I purchased it because I go on a lot of long road trips and sometimes I do not have time to get to my legs before the trip.  I wanted a cost-friendly option that I could use in the car.  This option allows you to do that.  I charged it overnight and it did stay charged the whole time I used it.  However, there was this lip at the top, I am assuming it&#x27;s a protective lip of some kind, which made it very hard to maneuver.  I finally ended up removing the entire purple part at the top.  Also, it did not grab the hairs as well as I would have liked.  I have been using an epilator for over 13 years and have been lucky to have owned two very good epilators.  This epilator was not as good.  I had to do it over and over to get the hairs and it still did not get them all.  Overall I would say it did the job, although it took twice as long, but I didn&#x27;t have anything else to do so that didn&#x27;t matter and it stayed charged the whole time so I am content with my purchase.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t take off all the hair. It is painful, but would be worth it if the hair was all removed.  I was very disappointed .</li>
            <li> I had epilady and i love it. We don&#x27;t need to wait growth and these are amazing!!!  I can do it myself in the any place and any your.</li>
            <li> love it battery charge lasts forever</li>
            <li> I use the Epilady Legend on my face more than any where else. Those nasty little fuzzy white hairs. And does not hurt half as bad as I was expecting. Used on legs. No pain. I&#x27;m so glad a friend recommended this for me. So don&#x27;t let those reviews about &amp;#34; it hurts &amp;#34; scare you. I guess everyone&#x27;s pain tolerance is different.  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
            <li> Love it! Does a great job!</li>
            <li> I read a ton of reviews on this product. I have to admit I was a little scared when I was ready to use it for the first time. I am not good with pain. Yes I had a few adult beverages to get my nerve up. I didn&#x27;t even need them. Well I did but not for pain. ;) I won&#x27;t go as far as saying it felt good but I wouldn&#x27;t call it painful. I used to shave my lower legs every day! That was a pain. I even used it the third time on my bikini area. Yes I did. And that wasn&#x27;t bad either. You do have to be a little limber for that &amp; the backs of your legs. I consider it exercise. I can&#x27;t believe I can now go about 10 days without shaving. I&#x27;ve now used it 3 times. I tried to figure out how much time it saves me but decided to do something more fun with my time than math. Buy it. You&#x27;ll like it.</li>
            <li> This is a very good product.  It works especially well on your arms and underarms.  I don&#x27;t think it works great on the coarser hair of legs.  You have to keep redoing it.  Can be used on face, but causes some irritation; so do at night and not if you have someplace important to go for a few days.  Does not really hurt at all on arms once you get the hang of it.  A lot less $ than waxing!</li>
            <li> Not exactly what I expected, but it will do for now.</li>
            <li> never used. Product looks scary.</li>
            <li> Didnt work well.  I tried to use it but it would still leave some hair and the ones that did get pulled seemed to just got trimmed by the speed instead of pulled fully out .</li>
            <li> I returned this........it didn&#x27;t work as well as my old one that is a different brand so I went back to my old brand.  Good customer service though.</li>
            <li> Great looking, easy to use, as describe, i do recommand this seller. What can i tell you more. I wish the same experience for you.</li>
            <li> This product does not work like it&#x27;s claimed to. I was quite dissatisfied with this product !</li>
            <li> This product does not work at all like expected. Does not remove hair.</li>
            <li> I am two days out of the return window for Amazon.  I guess I am on my own.  In California I have the right to return the item purchased to the place of purchase during the entire warranty period.  I guess Amazon gets around this.  I am upset beyond reason.  The item is noisy and doesn&#x27;t work out of the box and being two days out of the return period I seem to be on my own.  I have been a prime member since day one.  I cannot even contact Amazon on this matter.  So the thing doesn&#x27;t work and I am on my own.</li>
            <li> I had an older version that had to be plugged in &amp; it seemed to work better.  Maybe it&#x27;s the fact that it&#x27;s running on a (rechargeable) battery, but  I find you need to go over the same spots multiple times with this one for good results.  I mostly use it for touch up, so it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> This is my second Epilady. My previous one was corded and I wanted one that I could use anywhere so this is perfect. The charge holds for quite awhile and the shaver does a great job of removing hair. I charge it up the night before I am going to use it and find the charge lasts thru several uses.</li>
            <li> I was excited to get my Epilator and it didn&#x27;t work. I was very disappointed that it didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
            <li> Good value for price, My first one so can&#x27;t really compare to other models or brands.</li>
            <li> I had laser hair removal everywhere but my arms.  This product is great because I can travel with it.  It usually gets most hsir and is not too painful.  The hair is not growing back as fast either.......... I would have gave it five stars but sometimes it does not always get every single hair!</li>
            <li> I bought mine about two weeks ago when it was offered on WOOT.  Previously, I was waxing using the Clean + Easy waxing kit, but it had its drawbacks: you had to continually purchase refills of the wax and strips, and you had to be a contortionist to reach the back of your legs.  I was still having to use my Lady Remington for touch-ups because I couldn&#x27;t reach everything well.  Epilady has changed all of that.  I love that you can use it plugged in or cordless.  I have been using it almost every day to make sure I stay smooth, but there are definitely fewer hairs each day.  Pretty soon I bet I will just be dealing with a few survivors each time.  It pulls out hairs by the root just like waxing, but you do not have to purchase refills of any supplies ever.  The first use was a little shocking because, instead of ripping off an entire patch of hair at one time, it nibbles out each hair it encounters.  You are about to see how strong a woman you are!  My legs weren&#x27;t so bad, but the first trip over my underarms was something else.  The things we do.  I cannot imagine using this on my downtown.  I might keep the wax kit around for this job.  At least you get to rip off a swath at a time instead of a slow, nibbling torture.  I have only had my Eplilady for two weeks so I cannot attest to its durability, but so far I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
            <li> Rips your hair out or not at all. Returned product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure this is just breaking the hair off at the skin level, not actually pulling it out from the root. Maybe my hair is just too fine, or there&#x27;s something wrong with my vitamin intake, but it&#x27;s not working the way I thought and I have to use it several times a week to keep my legs hair free.</li>
            <li> I bought the epilady through a deal on Groupon. I also have a Braun silk-epil 5 epilator. The braun epilator was the first epilator I&#x27;ve bought and the first one I&#x27;ve used. I&#x27;ve used both to compare which one gave me better results. As of now, the braun 5 works better, for me at least. The braun epilator has a pivoting head that contours to your body, which I love. I don&#x27;t feel I get as good results with the epilady, BUT I do like that it doesnt need to be plugged in, in order to use it.    11-7-14 UPDATE:  I still use my Braun epilator, as I feel I get better results and is smoother when gliding over my skin (the epilady tends to skip). I use the epilady for my brazilian, which works great. Occasionally, I&#x27;ll wipe it out and do my legs, but the epilady is second on my list.</li>
            <li> Hurts to use but great results!</li>
            <li> I Love this.  I have a lot of numbness in hands &amp; legs &amp; it&#x27;s hard for me to shave.  The Epilady solves that problem for me.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s okay but I had a Braun that I feel may have done a better job and it had a built in light.  This could be improved by having a light.  For the price though, I will need to use this for a long time!</li>
            <li> Ok so this thing is not as amazing as some people claimed. However, it does get a lot of the hairs out AND you can go longer in between having to maintain. So there&#x27;s that. But, it does hurt and it&#x27;s a little more time consuming than just quickly shaving. Might be worth the try for you, but just note the above.</li>
            <li> I have used an epilator for years.  They take a little getting used to, but they are great.  I like it.</li>
            <li> Perfect! This is  a truly great epilator! I will never go back to shaving my legs again! First time is a bit painful but you get  used to the pulling and it&#x27;s fun to see the results last so long! Highly recommend trying!</li>
            <li> Works great.  I have used epilady products for over 30 years.  This is the best one yet.</li>
            <li> I tried this out for the first time on my bikini area and it works great! It&#x27;s hurts about the same or a little less than waxing actually and there&#x27;s no mess. Plus I purchased it at a discount so it cost about the same as one waxing treatment. I do also recommend using it after a shower for less pain and to trim your hair a little if it&#x27;s longer than 1 inch. I can&#x27;t wait to use it on my underarms and legs!</li>
            <li> Too large and bulky !  I am so glad that I ordered the tiny Epilator as the same time, it is the only one of the 2 which is functional and actually removes the hair.  Epilady is the only brand that I have used.  I purchased the Legend to replace one similar that I have used for over 10 years. This model feels cheap, sounds cheap, and will not remove the hair without rubbing and rubbing and rubbing across my skin, making it tender.</li>
            <li> Absolutely love it! The results are amazing. The thighs take longer to complete than the calves, and you have to go over the same area several times before it&#x27;s free of hair. Also painful at first but as you continue to use it the pain is less and even initially the pain goes away fast. The results are definitely worth it to me. No more razor burn or super itchy legs, or cuts from the razor. Definitely recommend. I bought it on sale for $35.99. Great price.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t actually know specifically what to say about this product. I bought it for my wife, who seems extremely pleased, and delighted in showing me her resulting very soft legs and other areas, so I am quite pleased with it as well. She seems to love it :-)</li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be as good as my sister in laws, but it is not.  It only has two speeds and is not strong enough to pull out all the hairs.  I went over my legs several times over several days and could not get the hairs.  I ended up returning it.</li>
            <li> if this is the first epilator, you would be good. In case, if you have other ones.. don&#x27;t even try it! It&#x27;s slow (so takes you too much time to get your legs done), the tweezers are not good a graving the small hairs.. Definitely, do not buy it if you have previous experience with epilators.</li>
            <li> This does not work at all how I expected and I have to go over  the same area over and over like 12 times to</li>
            <li> been using epilady since they first came out....i dont like the guide bar, but everything else is perfect</li>
