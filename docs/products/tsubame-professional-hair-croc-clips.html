            <li>Loved it!</li>
            <li>Great addition, arrived as described.</li>
            <li>Great price for these clips</li>
            <li>will prob be ordering some more!!</li>
            <li>Love  , theyre awesome</li>
            <li>love them, they work great!</li>
            <li>These are very strong durable clips!</li>
            <li>As a professional, I am VERY happy with the quality of these for the price!!</li>
            <li>Strong hold!</li>
            <li>Very light weight, they don&#x27;t pull on the hair</li>
            <li>They grip better than claw clips and are easier to slide in, too, when I am trying to get through this mop in a hurry.  </li>
            <li>These don&#x27;t have the alligator teeth and don&#x27;t do a group job of gripping the hair.</li>
            <li>Seem to be a great value so far!</li>
            <li>I am amazed how something of this quality is available so cheap !</li>
            <li>These are great, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean and take care of.</li>
            <li>Great product, especially for the price.  </li>
            <li>These are amazing, I&#x27;ll be able to do more with these clips than the other clips I have.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even need to use more than one clip to hold a large section of hair out of my way (shoulder length hair).</li>
            <li>but they don&#x27;t have that cool rubbery coating which is probably inconsequential anyway.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick.</li>
            <li>I was at first unsure if these clips would be durable.</li>
            <li>Absolutely can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve got a TON of hair and these make styling it so much easier!  </li>
            <li>First time I tried these type clips.</li>
            <li>I have super long and thick hair, and it holds it perfectly in place.</li>
            <li>These have as much tension as the color trak ones</li>
            <li>so they are very comftorable.</li>
            <li>These clips are big, sturdy and have fantastic grip on the hair.</li>
            <li>These clips hold hair very well.</li>
            <li>It worked very well.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I really like them.</li>
            <li>I do a lot of natural kinky/curly hair, these clips aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold the hair.</li>
            <li>Before buying these I had bought some cheap clips that increased by &#x27;blowdrying&#x27; time by constantly slipping in between sections.</li>
            <li>They may look flimsy compared to the expensive clips BUT they are sturdy and works great with section inch thick hair:)</li>
            <li>I highly recommend croc clips for sectioning large bundles of long hair.    </li>
            <li>These alligator clips work great for getting long, thick hair out of the way, while you blow dry and straighten your curly locks.</li>
            <li>These are the only clips that can hold my natural hair in place!</li>

            <li> These are the only clips that can hold my natural hair in place!</li>
            <li> A way better deal than the casual croc clip package you see at Walmart, which are 2 clips for 4 bucks.  </li>
            <li> I like the black clips over my silver that I normally use</li>
            <li> Use multiple if hair is super thick!</li>
            <li> After extensive use of both brands in the aforementioned, I realize that the coating on the color traks help for grip when your hands are wet with product, which is a big deal for me.</li>
            <li> However if there is any product on your hands the grooves on the handle portion are not adequate enough to stop your fingers from sliding .</li>
            <li> I used these once a week for about a 8 months and all but 3 are broken but for the price who&#x27;s really complaining....</li>
            <li> I have very thick 4b-4c natural hair</li>
            <li> The design is similar to other Croc clips, but when I use them on thick hair, the grip is not as tight.</li>
            <li> Other clicks pop or won&#x27;t close!</li>
            <li> On several occasions, a few of them broke under the stress of thick hair.    </li>
            <li> In the 6 months that I&#x27;ve had them, only one has broken.  </li>
            <li> The end is weak.</li>

            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold enough hair. The end is weak.</li>
            <li> I was at first unsure if these clips would be durable. For the price I paid, I&#x27;m not complaining! They may look flimsy compared to the expensive clips BUT they are sturdy and works great with section inch thick hair:)</li>
            <li> The design is similar to other Croc clips, but when I use them on thick hair, the grip is not as tight. So the hair is still sliding out of place.</li>
            <li> Love  , theyre awesome and they came in on time</li>
            <li> Loved it! Especially for the price</li>

            <li> love them, they work great! will prob be ordering some more!! very happy with the product and i will be back soon..</li>

            <li> Love!!! Students at my school keep asking me where I got them!!!</li>
            <li> These are the only clips that can hold my natural hair in place! Other clicks pop or won&#x27;t close! I probably will be ordering another pack just for when I do my friends&#x27; hair!</li>
            <li> These clips hold hair very well. However if there is any product on your hands the grooves on the handle portion are not adequate enough to stop your fingers from sliding .</li>

            <li> Great price for these clips</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve got a TON of hair and these make styling it so much easier!  They grip better than claw clips and are easier to slide in, too, when I am trying to get through this mop in a hurry.  I use them when I&#x27;m blow drying or curling my hair.</li>
            <li> Used this product while I was in Afghanistan to separate my hair on wash days.  It worked very well.  I have very thick 4b-4c natural hair and it can hold my hair in 4 sections with no problem.  In the 6 months that I&#x27;ve had them, only one has broken.  I would definitely recommend to a friend!!</li>
            <li> These don&#x27;t have the alligator teeth and don&#x27;t do a group job of gripping the hair.</li>
            <li> These are very strong durable clips! Work wonderful! Keep hair clipped up! Use multiple if hair is super thick! Thanks</li>
            <li> Great product, especially for the price.  I have super long and thick hair, and it holds it perfectly in place.</li>
            <li> First time I tried these type clips. I really like them. Hold the hair well. I like the black clips over my silver that I normally use, I end up throwing my silver clips away with my foils. With these I don&#x27;t have that problem.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist and regular clips sometimes just doesn&#x27;t cut it. These are amazing, I&#x27;ll be able to do more with these clips than the other clips I have. I&#x27;d suggest these clips to my hairstylist friends.</li>
            <li> The shipping was quick. I do a lot of natural kinky/curly hair, these clips aren&#x27;t strong enough to hold the hair. They are flimsy.</li>
            <li> These alligator clips work great for getting long, thick hair out of the way, while you blow dry and straighten your curly locks.</li>
