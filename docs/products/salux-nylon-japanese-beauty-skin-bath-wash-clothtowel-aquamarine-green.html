            <li>Love this product!!</li>
            <li>I am using this type of wash cloth for many years and think it is the best option.</li>
            <li>I honestly don&#x27;t know what I did without this product!</li>
            <li>They are BRIGHT and don&#x27;t match anything in our bathrooms.</li>
            <li>Fortunately, I was one of the customers who received this Salux wash cloth and it works great!</li>
            <li>He has always given me good advice</li>

            <li>These are amazing and I will never be without one.</li>
            <li>So nice to see them on Amazon.</li>
            <li>it suds up nicely.</li>
            <li>After reading many travel hints, one is that in Europe, many  hotels don&#x27;t provide wash clothes for your bathing, therefore it would be wise to bring your own.  </li>
            <li>Wow, what a great alternative to a wash cloth!</li>
            <li>I was not in a hurry and it took over 3 weeks for all to arrive and they charged me more than $30.00 in fees</li>
            <li>my skin felt/looked so much better.</li>
            <li>and I love them.</li>
            <li>The authentic one is made in Japan.  </li>
            <li>I received an authentic Salux cloth, made in Japan.</li>
            <li>I was expecting a more textile feel to it.  </li>
            <li>Much more comparable to a mesh bath puff.  </li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>It has a great, scrubby texture and exfoliates gently.  </li>
            <li>just make sure the get the ones made in Japan, not China or you will end up with an inferior product.</li>
            <li>Love the color.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>would be even better if it had a loop on it</li>
            <li>Reminds me of the bear rubbing against a tree &amp; enjoying it to the fullest.</li>
            <li>This scrub towel is so much better than the scrubbies that are tied together like a ball.</li>
            <li>and my skin feels nice and smooth afterwards.</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>This is so much better than a sponge.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s like giving yourself a massage in the shower :)</li>
            <li>Thankfully I received a genuine Salux, not some knockoff, and I can immediately see the difference!</li>
            <li>I have been using Salux wash Cloths for 40 years and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li>It was easy to spot what people are using in Sentou(neighborhood bath house), even back then the bright colored wash cloth was very popular, so I went out to get one</li>
            <li>THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THE ORIGINAL SALUX WASH CLOTH FROM JAPAN!    </li>
            <li>I love this towel because you do not need much soap to get a good lather.</li>
            <li>I feel so clean!</li>
            <li>so it could be easily hung up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Easily cleans after use .would order again and will purchase for friends</li>
            <li>Also, it rinses easily and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li>Arrived in fine condition.</li>
            <li>It really exfoliates your skin nicely.  </li>
            <li>* Light weight, you won&#x27;t mind packing it when you are traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but I like this just as well plus its great for washing my back.</li>
            <li>They last for months (6 months), wash great and exfloriate without scratching.</li>
            <li>This scrub is great for reaching the back.</li>
            <li>My skin is polished and smooth.  </li>
            <li>The color green was perfect in my bathroom</li>
            <li>You can use it on any part of your body and it leaves you feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>Fast-Drying, Easy to Clean, and Great for buffing rough skin!</li>
            <li>With puffs and sponges you can&#x27;t really clean the insides and mold is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>and I sometimes forget to pack it, I do not feel clean.</li>
            <li>I love this cloth, it is my favorite so far that I&#x27;ve used for exfoliation.  </li>
            <li>I feel super clean after using it</li>
            <li>The bath wash cloth feels so good as it can reach be used as a back washer, exfoliator, wash cloth all in one.</li>
            <li>But it works well, and my skin is nice and soft after using.</li>
            <li>I love it so much</li>
            <li>It helps to exfoliate the skin and is easy to care for, goes into the wash when needed and is fast drying!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great general exfoliator, and I highly recommend it to anyone dealing with breakouts.</li>
            <li>shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li>(JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN  [NOT in China],  or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH</li>
            <li>I use it while pregnant to exfoliate my belly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super hygienic because all of the soap rinses out and it drys in a snap.</li>
            <li>so dries quickly.</li>
            <li>I love this thing for all of the other reasons cited: it cleans, exfoliates, and leaves your body with a nice tingly feeling.</li>
            <li>So the very first thing I checked, after reading all the reviews, was the tag.</li>
            <li>Still usable that way, but that is when I buy a new one&#x3D;)</li>
            <li>* Very hygienic, rinses easily and dries quickly.&lt;br /</li>
            <li>They broke up my orderinto several pieces and charged me more for the shipping than the product cost!</li>
            <li>I have been using this towel for several months now and love it!</li>
            <li>It feels so SO much nicer than any loofah or sea sponge I&#x27;ve ever used, and leaves my skin wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li>The size is big and they are sturdy and they exfoliate my skin nicely.</li>
            <li>but I feel like it&#x27;s not as nice as the one I bought last year.</li>
            <li>They are a perfect back washer and made of nylon, so the rinse and dry fast.</li>
            <li>I can exfoliate my whole body &amp; it dries quickly.</li>
            <li>The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li>You would want something that dries quickly so you can be sure it would be dry when you need to pack again.  </li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>: The cloth I received was Salux brand and looked exactly like the product pictured.  </li>
            <li>Also you should eat a lot of fruits and vegetables that contain antioxidants and vitamins if you really want your skin to shine!</li>
            <li>got mine from M.V. Trading Co. and as far as I can see, it&#x27;s a genuine Salux.</li>
            <li>and I found them even better and longer lasting than the ones I had purchased before.</li>
            <li>(I also have given these as gifts to my family and friends, that is just how much I like them!)</li>
            <li>This works pretty well and is easier to wash than a bath puff.  </li>
            <li>it came in two sizes, it doesn&#x27;t fit nicely in the small area designated for it in my shower...</li>
            <li>So before I begin my review, let me first start by saying this review is for the seller and their knock off china wash cloth.</li>
            <li>It only requires a small amount of body wash to offer wonderful lathering.</li>
            <li>I also love how easy it is to scrub my back with this, especially between the shoulder blades.  </li>
            <li>it dries completely and is as clean as the day you bought them.</li>
            <li>Granted, these washcloths soften with repeated use, but this Leyijie feels very scratchy and the weave does not seem as consistent as the Salux.</li>
            <li>It is easy to reach your back.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended and very fast drying.  </li>
            <li>I really like this product.  </li>
            <li>It probably exfoliates just like the description says, too, but I&#x27;m not going to try it because I value my epidermis too much.  </li>
            <li>I will look elsewhere for the real thing.</li>
            <li>reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>These authentic Japanese cleansing cloths are WAY better than the softer American versions I see in local mass market retailers &amp; beauty shops.  </li>
            <li>I use it for whole body washing all over</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>They should post the names of those dishonest sellers as well as good ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>This ended up working better than a normal washcloth since it dried super fast which made it very hygienic.  </li>
            <li>My doctor recommended that I try a Salux for a really clean back.  </li>
            <li>I have tried to use the American way of sponges and wash clothes, but I cannot seem to get that really clean feeling as I would with the scrub wash cloth shown.</li>
            <li>Contacted Amazon immediately and am shipping it back for full refund.</li>
            <li>I really find a little puff made of net-type fabric is what I most prefer to use, and the netting will help debride the skin also.  </li>
            <li>The rough texture is good for exfoliation, but not too rough.  </li>
            <li>It is long enough to use like the picture, allowing you to give your back a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended.</li>
            <li>This really helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li>and this helps remove the dead tanned skin to give me a healthy even glow.</li>
            <li>These last as the quality is top notch and unlike natural bath brushes over a very short time develop mildew, not these as when you rinse them out</li>
            <li>They are long so that you can exfoliate your back well; they hold lather much better than a cloth rag.</li>
            <li>With thick lather, it feels nice on your skin--</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s easy to wash my back without arm strain that occurs with scrbbys made of similar material.</li>
            <li>For people who are really keen on scrubbing their back with a long strap of cloth, this is fine.</li>
            <li>They even have a new name now that I didn&#x27;t realize until after I ordered them.  </li>
            <li>have not used this new one yet, so the star rating is for the Salex I have used in the</li>
            <li>They dry out quickly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not that different from other exfoliating scrub options, but this one is a lot more hygienic than others I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li>I have seen imitations used exact the same photo on their package, that</li>
            <li>It has a wide enough weave that I&#x27;m confident I can get it clean (a problem with loofah and sponge options), but tight enough that it looks and feels very durable.</li>
            <li>Its 36 inch length makes back scrubbing very convenient.</li>
            <li>Most of the negative reviews are because they got ripped off.</li>
            <li>I also tan and spray tan frequently</li>
            <li>Fingers crossed that I get a real one next time.</li>
            <li>I have not used this Chinese product yet and will not return it (as we opened the package when it arrived to compare the quality to a real Salux washcloth.)  </li>
            <li>Your skin feels soft after using it.</li>
            <li>and they turn out to be too soft.</li>
            <li>We eventually settled on white because it is quite honestly the least offensive color choice.</li>
            <li>They also are long enough that it makes it easy to wash my back.  </li>
            <li>This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few</li>
            <li>The Salux leaves me with a back clean of any dried skin and with a gentle scrubbed feel.</li>
            <li>light weight and long enough to reach your back.</li>
            <li>My skin is pretty sensitive and as long as I don&#x27;t use it really hard, it&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
            <li>These are very long (probably around 30&amp;#34;) and handy to use for hard to reach places and for limited mobility that hinders one&#x27;s reach or bending.  </li>
            <li>Some people have recommended this product for use in combating a problem of infestation with &amp;#34;invisible stinging bugs.&amp;#34;  Since the microscopic bugs supposedly feed on a fungus or mold that grows on some people&#x27;s skins, the roughness of this long washing cloth, which can be used on hard-to-reach back areas, may be useful to debride the skin.  </li>
            <li>The old ones were strong and thick.  </li>
            <li>It is pretty rough.  </li>
            <li>SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I especially appreciate how thin the weave is, because that means it dries fast and can easily go through the washer.  </li>
            <li>These new ones are light and thin.  </li>
            <li>It allows you to use less liquid soap and lathers really well.  </li>
            <li>Actually, I&#x27;ve used one of these perpetually, ever since I learned about them while living on Oahu in the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>For it to really work, you can&#x27;t really take hot showers and if you do so, rinse in cold water for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li>The texture is a slightly rough plastic weave, pretty similar to bath puffs or any other exfoliating</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It&#x27;s like giving yourself a massage in the shower :)</li>
            <li> Thankfully I received a genuine Salux, not some knockoff, and I can immediately see the difference!</li>
            <li> I have been using Salux wash Cloths for 40 years and absolutely love them.  </li>
            <li> It was easy to spot what people are using in Sentou(neighborhood bath house), even back then the bright colored wash cloth was very popular, so I went out to get one</li>
            <li> THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THE ORIGINAL SALUX WASH CLOTH FROM JAPAN!    </li>
            <li> I love this towel because you do not need much soap to get a good lather.</li>
            <li> I feel so clean!</li>
            <li> so it could be easily hung up.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Easily cleans after use .would order again and will purchase for friends</li>
            <li> Also, it rinses easily and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> Arrived in fine condition.</li>
            <li> It really exfoliates your skin nicely.  </li>
            <li> * Light weight, you won&#x27;t mind packing it when you are traveling.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but I like this just as well plus its great for washing my back.</li>
            <li> They last for months (6 months), wash great and exfloriate without scratching.</li>
            <li> This scrub is great for reaching the back.</li>
            <li> My skin is polished and smooth.  </li>
            <li> The color green was perfect in my bathroom</li>
            <li> You can use it on any part of your body and it leaves you feeling silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> Fast-Drying, Easy to Clean, and Great for buffing rough skin!</li>
            <li> With puffs and sponges you can&#x27;t really clean the insides and mold is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> and I sometimes forget to pack it, I do not feel clean.</li>
            <li> I love this cloth, it is my favorite so far that I&#x27;ve used for exfoliation.  </li>
            <li> I feel super clean after using it</li>
            <li> The bath wash cloth feels so good as it can reach be used as a back washer, exfoliator, wash cloth all in one.</li>
            <li> But it works well, and my skin is nice and soft after using.</li>
            <li> I love it so much</li>
            <li> It helps to exfoliate the skin and is easy to care for, goes into the wash when needed and is fast drying!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great general exfoliator, and I highly recommend it to anyone dealing with breakouts.</li>
            <li> shipped quickly.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> (JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN  [NOT in China],  or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH</li>
            <li> I use it while pregnant to exfoliate my belly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super hygienic because all of the soap rinses out and it drys in a snap.</li>
            <li> so dries quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this thing for all of the other reasons cited: it cleans, exfoliates, and leaves your body with a nice tingly feeling.</li>
            <li> So the very first thing I checked, after reading all the reviews, was the tag.</li>
            <li> Still usable that way, but that is when I buy a new one&#x3D;)</li>
            <li> * Very hygienic, rinses easily and dries quickly.&lt;br /</li>
            <li> They broke up my orderinto several pieces and charged me more for the shipping than the product cost!</li>
            <li> I have been using this towel for several months now and love it!</li>
            <li> It feels so SO much nicer than any loofah or sea sponge I&#x27;ve ever used, and leaves my skin wonderfully smooth.</li>
            <li> The size is big and they are sturdy and they exfoliate my skin nicely.</li>
            <li> but I feel like it&#x27;s not as nice as the one I bought last year.</li>
            <li> They are a perfect back washer and made of nylon, so the rinse and dry fast.</li>
            <li> I can exfoliate my whole body &amp; it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> The shipping was very fast.</li>
            <li> You would want something that dries quickly so you can be sure it would be dry when you need to pack again.  </li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> : The cloth I received was Salux brand and looked exactly like the product pictured.  </li>
            <li> Also you should eat a lot of fruits and vegetables that contain antioxidants and vitamins if you really want your skin to shine!</li>
            <li> got mine from M.V. Trading Co. and as far as I can see, it&#x27;s a genuine Salux.</li>
            <li> and I found them even better and longer lasting than the ones I had purchased before.</li>
            <li> (I also have given these as gifts to my family and friends, that is just how much I like them!)</li>
            <li> This works pretty well and is easier to wash than a bath puff.  </li>
            <li> it came in two sizes, it doesn&#x27;t fit nicely in the small area designated for it in my shower...</li>
            <li> So before I begin my review, let me first start by saying this review is for the seller and their knock off china wash cloth.</li>
            <li> It only requires a small amount of body wash to offer wonderful lathering.</li>
            <li> I also love how easy it is to scrub my back with this, especially between the shoulder blades.  </li>
            <li> it dries completely and is as clean as the day you bought them.</li>
            <li> Granted, these washcloths soften with repeated use, but this Leyijie feels very scratchy and the weave does not seem as consistent as the Salux.</li>
            <li> It is easy to reach your back.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended and very fast drying.  </li>
            <li> I really like this product.  </li>
            <li> It probably exfoliates just like the description says, too, but I&#x27;m not going to try it because I value my epidermis too much.  </li>
            <li> I will look elsewhere for the real thing.</li>
            <li> reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> These authentic Japanese cleansing cloths are WAY better than the softer American versions I see in local mass market retailers &amp; beauty shops.  </li>
            <li> I use it for whole body washing all over</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> They should post the names of those dishonest sellers as well as good ones.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> This ended up working better than a normal washcloth since it dried super fast which made it very hygienic.  </li>
            <li> My doctor recommended that I try a Salux for a really clean back.  </li>
            <li> I have tried to use the American way of sponges and wash clothes, but I cannot seem to get that really clean feeling as I would with the scrub wash cloth shown.</li>
            <li> Contacted Amazon immediately and am shipping it back for full refund.</li>
            <li> I really find a little puff made of net-type fabric is what I most prefer to use, and the netting will help debride the skin also.  </li>
            <li> The rough texture is good for exfoliation, but not too rough.  </li>
            <li> It is long enough to use like the picture, allowing you to give your back a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> This really helped clear up my skin.</li>
            <li> and this helps remove the dead tanned skin to give me a healthy even glow.</li>
            <li> These last as the quality is top notch and unlike natural bath brushes over a very short time develop mildew, not these as when you rinse them out</li>
            <li> They are long so that you can exfoliate your back well; they hold lather much better than a cloth rag.</li>
            <li> With thick lather, it feels nice on your skin--</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s easy to wash my back without arm strain that occurs with scrbbys made of similar material.</li>
            <li> For people who are really keen on scrubbing their back with a long strap of cloth, this is fine.</li>
            <li> They even have a new name now that I didn&#x27;t realize until after I ordered them.  </li>
            <li> have not used this new one yet, so the star rating is for the Salex I have used in the</li>
            <li> They dry out quickly.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not that different from other exfoliating scrub options, but this one is a lot more hygienic than others I&#x27;ve seen.  </li>
            <li> I have seen imitations used exact the same photo on their package, that</li>
            <li> It has a wide enough weave that I&#x27;m confident I can get it clean (a problem with loofah and sponge options), but tight enough that it looks and feels very durable.</li>
            <li> Its 36 inch length makes back scrubbing very convenient.</li>
            <li> Most of the negative reviews are because they got ripped off.</li>
            <li> I also tan and spray tan frequently</li>
            <li> Fingers crossed that I get a real one next time.</li>
            <li> I have not used this Chinese product yet and will not return it (as we opened the package when it arrived to compare the quality to a real Salux washcloth.)  </li>
            <li> Your skin feels soft after using it.</li>
            <li> and they turn out to be too soft.</li>
            <li> We eventually settled on white because it is quite honestly the least offensive color choice.</li>
            <li> They also are long enough that it makes it easy to wash my back.  </li>
            <li> This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few</li>
            <li> The Salux leaves me with a back clean of any dried skin and with a gentle scrubbed feel.</li>
            <li> light weight and long enough to reach your back.</li>
            <li> My skin is pretty sensitive and as long as I don&#x27;t use it really hard, it&#x27;s totally fine.</li>
            <li> These are very long (probably around 30&amp;#34;) and handy to use for hard to reach places and for limited mobility that hinders one&#x27;s reach or bending.  </li>
            <li> Some people have recommended this product for use in combating a problem of infestation with &amp;#34;invisible stinging bugs.&amp;#34;  Since the microscopic bugs supposedly feed on a fungus or mold that grows on some people&#x27;s skins, the roughness of this long washing cloth, which can be used on hard-to-reach back areas, may be useful to debride the skin.  </li>
            <li> The old ones were strong and thick.  </li>
            <li> It is pretty rough.  </li>
            <li> SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I especially appreciate how thin the weave is, because that means it dries fast and can easily go through the washer.  </li>
            <li> These new ones are light and thin.  </li>
            <li> It allows you to use less liquid soap and lathers really well.  </li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;ve used one of these perpetually, ever since I learned about them while living on Oahu in the early 90&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> For it to really work, you can&#x27;t really take hot showers and if you do so, rinse in cold water for a couple of minutes.</li>
            <li> The texture is a slightly rough plastic weave, pretty similar to bath puffs or any other exfoliating</li>
            <li> this thing feels divine when soaped up &amp; stretched over my back &amp; pulled back &amp; forth.</li>
            <li> They last a long time.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t have any body part you can&#x27;t reach and wash with this(as long as it&#x27;s outside of the body, in case</li>
            <li> It extra long, so</li>
            <li> The wash towel is just wide enough and plenty long enough to grab an end in each hand and scrub, scrub, scrub my back.</li>
            <li> but I much prefer the &amp;#34;SUPER HARD WEAVE&amp;#34; sold by &amp;#34;Cure&amp;#34; in cobalt blue, also on the Amazon site.  </li>
            <li> Towel- Aquamarine Green]]&lt;br /&gt;Did not really pay close attention until after I opened it, and noticed that it was not made by Salux, but rather made by Leyijie, a Chinese company, making a similar, but not identical product.  </li>
            <li> I brought this product due to being overseas and not have a back scrubber for my back.</li>
            <li> Unfolded this cloth is about the width of a hand towel and twice as long.  </li>
            <li> I will continue to order them and use them for a long time to come.</li>
            <li> It is bigger than I expected</li>
            <li> It is too harsh and scratchy unless you keep it full of thick lather.  </li>
            <li> This one is made of a cheap material that feels very thin.</li>
            <li> Just rinse it out after your shower and hang it to dry.  </li>
            <li> It has very exfoliating texture but not too rugged and tough on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure how long you&#x27;re supposed to keep using them, but since it gets washed constantly I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years</li>
            <li> This Leyjie brand Chinese washcloth is green, just like the description says.</li>
            <li> , I think it&#x27;s too rough.</li>
            <li> Ordered a Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel- Aquamarine Green (Sold by: SCS Collectibles, Inc).&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> so I had a bit of scrubbing grit, but not as rough as the #300.  </li>
            <li> Check carefully in the description for the number you want.</li>
            <li> Had the actual wash cloth that I received been the same thick material that the Salux one is then</li>
            <li> Now if only they&#x27;d make a slightly smoother version for faces!</li>
            <li> I have used other look-alikes but nothing replaces it.</li>
            <li> set Salux apart from others, other products may have one or some of the characteristics but not all in one,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It might be a little rough for some people, but I like it.</li>
            <li> but this one is a little rough for my preference.</li>
            <li> (especially if you&#x27;re really dirty and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!!)</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the colors.</li>
            <li> Its not too rough but does remove dead skin.</li>
            <li> /&gt;They produce copious amounts of foam from small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package&#x27;s front side)</li>
            <li> It helps to scrub off dead skin tissue.</li>
            <li> Also, I ordered aqua and received green.  </li>
            <li> BUYERS BEWARE - DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE CHINA</li>
            <li> I fold mine a few times and then add soap....</li>
            <li> usually fully-dries in less then</li>
            <li> I would recommend that you would use caution on your face or other delicate skin</li>
            <li> I drink a lot of green tea!    </li>
            <li> It is shiny and thin and very, very rough.  </li>
            <li> I found it hard to get accustomed to using it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used it for at least about 6 months now</li>
            <li> Too bad this only comes in the mildly-exfoliating version.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting(nearly life time if you don&#x27;t mind using bad looking</li>
            <li> If you receive a knock-off, you should contact Amazon for a refund and rate the seller poorly.</li>
            <li> I should have read the other reviews before ordering so that is my bad.</li>
            <li> I ordered these and am sad to say that they are not at all what they used to be.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very thin cloth.</li>
            <li> Shame on them for false advertising :(</li>
            <li> So disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Otherwise, the length of the cloth is awkward, flapping all around your body while you try to soap each area.  </li>
            <li> and they came crammed in boxes that were in ill repair!</li>
            <li> This company practices bad business ,</li>
            <li> I am disappointed that we did not receive what was advertised and ordered.</li>
            <li> I was extremely disappointed!</li>
            <li> Soooo disappointed!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Fast-Drying, Easy to Clean, and Great for buffing rough skin!</li>
            <li> I really like this product.  It allows you to use less liquid soap and lathers really well.  They last a long time.  It really exfoliates your skin nicely.  It might be a little rough for some people, but I like it.</li>
            <li> The salux washcloth is a great product.  It makes my skin feel renewed.  Besides using it in the shower with soap, I take it into my swimming pool and rub my skin without using soap.  It helps to scrub off dead skin tissue. Its 36 inch length makes back scrubbing very convenient.</li>
            <li> This shower cloth is great. It removes dead skin very efficiently and I have washed it in the washer without damaging it.</li>
            <li> Salux Japanese towels stay away from this company !! They broke up my orderinto several pieces and charged me more for the shipping than the product cost! I was not in a hurry and it took over 3 weeks for all to arrive and they charged me more than $30.00 in fees and they came crammed in boxes that were in ill repair! This company practices bad business ,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS COMPANY!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> This Leyjie brand Chinese washcloth is green, just like the description says. It probably exfoliates just like the description says, too, but I&#x27;m not going to try it because I value my epidermis too much.  It is shiny and thin and very, very rough.  It does appear to be the same dimensions as claimed in the description.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I wanted. It is just what I remember getting while I was in the Marshall Islands. I feel so clean!</li>
            <li> I brought this product due to being overseas and not have a back scrubber for my back. Once I started using this towel my skin felt/looked so much better. I even use it on my face once a week for deep cleansing. I love this towel because you do not need much soap to get a good lather. Would recommend!</li>
            <li> Unfolded this cloth is about the width of a hand towel and twice as long.  It&#x27;s very thin cloth. The texture is a slightly rough plastic weave, pretty similar to bath puffs or any other exfoliating sponge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, that&#x27;s pretty much perfect.  I can fold/wad it up to make a sponge shape, then unfold it and get my back.  The rough texture is good for exfoliation, but not too rough.  I especially appreciate how thin the weave is, because that means it dries fast and can easily go through the washer.  It&#x27;s not that different from other exfoliating scrub options, but this one is a lot more hygienic than others I&#x27;ve seen.  With puffs and sponges you can&#x27;t really clean the insides and mold is an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: The cloth I received was Salux brand and looked exactly like the product pictured.  If you receive a knock-off, you should contact Amazon for a refund and rate the seller poorly.</li>
            <li> Good material! Exfoliates!</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I was one of the customers who received this Salux wash cloth and it works great! Your skin feels like a baby! For it to really work, you can&#x27;t really take hot showers and if you do so, rinse in cold water for a couple of minutes. I would not recommend this for your face. Also you should eat a lot of fruits and vegetables that contain antioxidants and vitamins if you really want your skin to shine! I drink a lot of green tea!    Most of the negative reviews are because they got ripped off. You can purchase this in your local Japanese or Chinese Market. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Salux cloth for almost 20 years now.  I ordered these and am sad to say that they are not at all what they used to be.  They even have a new name now that I didn&#x27;t realize until after I ordered them.  The old ones were strong and thick.  These new ones are light and thin.  So disappointing.  Also, I ordered aqua and received green.  I will look elsewhere for the real thing.</li>
            <li> This product is all they say it is!  I feel super clean after using it and it&#x27;s a great exfoliator for the body.  DO NOT use on your face though, I think it&#x27;s too rough.</li>
            <li> My doctor recommended that I try a Salux for a really clean back.  He said he has been using one for years.  He has always given me good advice and this is up there with the best of it.  The Salux leaves me with a back clean of any dried skin and with a gentle scrubbed feel.</li>
            <li> I was raised in a Korean American home. This is a staple in our bathroom. I have tried to use the American way of sponges and wash clothes, but I cannot seem to get that really clean feeling as I would with the scrub wash cloth shown. I also tan and spray tan frequently and this helps remove the dead tanned skin to give me a healthy even glow.</li>
            <li> I started using this in around 1975 in Japan(Nishi-Ogikubo, Tokyo). I have used other look-alikes but nothing replaces it. It was easy to spot what people are using in Sentou(neighborhood bath house), even back then the bright colored wash cloth was very popular, so I went out to get one myself.&lt;br /&gt;I have not used this new one yet, so the star rating is for the Salex I have used in the past.(See my photos in the gallery)&lt;br /&gt;The material has changed, so did the package. The lady on the front used to have her hair up. I have seen imitations used exact the same photo on their package, that maybe the reason they changed the lady.&lt;br /&gt;What set Salux apart from others, other products may have one or some of the characteristics but not all in one,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Invigorating&lt;br /&gt;* Generates lots of suds(saves soap)&lt;br /&gt;* Long lasting(nearly life time if you don&#x27;t mind using bad looking ones)&lt;br /&gt;* Very hygienic, rinses easily and dries quickly.&lt;br /&gt;* Light weight, you won&#x27;t mind packing it when you are traveling.&lt;br /&gt;* You don&#x27;t have any body part you can&#x27;t reach and wash with this(as long as it&#x27;s outside of the body, in case you are wondering).&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I see many reviewers got a wrong product from some sellers. They should post the names of those dishonest sellers as well as good ones.&lt;br /&gt;I got mine from M.V. Trading Co. and as far as I can see, it&#x27;s a genuine Salux.</li>
            <li> I have been using this type of wash cloth for about 10 years and I love them. I decided to try these cloths because of the reviews and I found them even better and longer lasting than the ones I had purchased before. I will continue to order them and use them for a long time to come. The size is big and they are sturdy and they exfoliate my skin nicely. (I also have given these as gifts to my family and friends, that is just how much I like them!)</li>
            <li> Ordered a Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel- Aquamarine Green (Sold by: SCS Collectibles, Inc).&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000MZX6QI Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloth/Towel- Aquamarine Green]]&lt;br /&gt;Did not really pay close attention until after I opened it, and noticed that it was not made by Salux, but rather made by Leyijie, a Chinese company, making a similar, but not identical product.  The authentic one is made in Japan.  The one I received was made in China.  Unfortunately there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to know if you will get the authentic one, or a substitute. Will return the product and re-order.  Fingers crossed that I get a real one next time.</li>
            <li> I am using this type of wash cloth for many years and think it is the best option. The shipping was very fast. Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> I ordered a \\&quot;Salux\\&quot; washcloth which is a Japanese product and did not receive that.  Instead, received a Chinese made \\&quot;Leyijie.\\&quot;  I have not used this Chinese product yet and will not return it (as we opened the package when it arrived to compare the quality to a real Salux washcloth.)  Granted, these washcloths soften with repeated use, but this Leyijie feels very scratchy and the weave does not seem as consistent as the Salux. We will try it but will not order this product again as it is not the brand that was advertised.  Salux is the gold standard and visibly, this Leyijie product is not up to par.  I am disappointed that we did not receive what was advertised and ordered.</li>
            <li> After reading many travel hints, one is that in Europe, many  hotels don&#x27;t provide wash clothes for your bathing, therefore it would be wise to bring your own.  You would want something that dries quickly so you can be sure it would be dry when you need to pack again.  This is one of those things that is so simple in nature but so valuable to use. The bath wash cloth feels so good as it can reach be used as a back washer, exfoliator, wash cloth all in one. I would recommend that you would use caution on your face or other delicate skin but otherwise it is great to use and perfect for travel.</li>
            <li> Some people have recommended this product for use in combating a problem of infestation with &amp;#34;invisible stinging bugs.&amp;#34;  Since the microscopic bugs supposedly feed on a fungus or mold that grows on some people&#x27;s skins, the roughness of this long washing cloth, which can be used on hard-to-reach back areas, may be useful to debride the skin.  Presumably, it might help to remove fungus.  I&#x27;ve used it for at least about 6 months now and I can&#x27;t see that it has made any difference in my efforts to prevail against the ISBs.  I found it hard to get accustomed to using it.  It is too harsh and scratchy unless you keep it full of thick lather.  With thick lather, it feels nice on your skin--if you keep it wadded up in a clump.  Otherwise, the length of the cloth is awkward, flapping all around your body while you try to soap each area.  I really find a little puff made of net-type fabric is what I most prefer to use, and the netting will help debride the skin also.  For people who are really keen on scrubbing their back with a long strap of cloth, this is fine.</li>
            <li> I received an authentic Salux cloth, made in Japan. The color is perfect, just what I was hoping it would be! I use it in the shower with body wash and it&#x27;s great, it creates lots of suds! It is bigger than I expected but I&#x27;m not complaining. Works great for exfoliating!</li>
            <li> This wash cloth is awesome. I love it! I always use loofah sponges but I like this just as well plus its great for washing my back. Its not too rough but does remove dead skin. I took this to a trip to Costa Rica where we didn&#x27;t have a washer or dryer. This ended up working better than a normal washcloth since it dried super fast which made it very hygienic.  Still use it at home!</li>
            <li> This really helped clear up my skin. It&#x27;s a great general exfoliator, and I highly recommend it to anyone dealing with breakouts. My skin is pretty sensitive and as long as I don&#x27;t use it really hard, it&#x27;s totally fine. I&#x27;m not sure how long you&#x27;re supposed to keep using them, but since it gets washed constantly I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 years and it&#x27;s in perfect shape with no mildew or tears.</li>
            <li> This works pretty well and is easier to wash than a bath puff.  I also love how easy it is to scrub my back with this, especially between the shoulder blades.  It is pretty rough.  I was expecting a more textile feel to it.  Much more comparable to a mesh bath puff.  But it works well, and my skin is nice and soft after using.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for these for months at different drugstores and beauty supplies in my area. So nice to see them on Amazon. I bought them in three colors. They last for months (6 months), wash great and exfloriate without scratching.</li>
            <li> This wash cloth is like a bath puff that&#x27;s been unraveled.  I love it.  It has a great, scrubby texture and exfoliates gently.  It is long enough to use like the picture, allowing you to give your back a good scrubbing.</li>
            <li> The best wash cloth ever.</li>
            <li> This is such a terrific product, where has it been all my life ! These last as the quality is top notch and unlike natural bath brushes over a very short time develop mildew, not these as when you rinse them out it dries completely and is as clean as the day you bought them. My already set skin is even silkier and I credit these cloths, just make sure the get the ones made in Japan, not China or you will end up with an inferior product.</li>
            <li> Love the color.&lt;br /&gt;Love the feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish it came in two sizes, it doesn&#x27;t fit nicely in the small area designated for it in my shower...</li>
            <li> It is scratchy, but feels good on your arms, hands, legs and feet, I would not use it on your face.  Your skin feels soft after using it.</li>
            <li> great product.  reasonable price.  shipped quickly.  would be even better if it had a loop on it so it could be easily hung up.&lt;br /&gt;add a hanger loop and it would be 5 stars</li>
            <li> This scrub is great for reaching the back. It has very exfoliating texture but not too rugged and tough on your skin.</li>
            <li> Bath or shower this thing feels divine when soaped up &amp; stretched over my back &amp; pulled back &amp; forth. Reminds me of the bear rubbing against a tree &amp; enjoying it to the fullest. soaps up like a charm. There is nothing that is comparable. It arrived quickly.</li>
            <li> My favorite bath cloth!  I buy them in all colors for my family!</li>
            <li> So before I begin my review, let me first start by saying this review is for the seller and their knock off china wash cloth. THIS REVIEW IS NOT FOR THE ORIGINAL SALUX WASH CLOTH FROM JAPAN!    Received my package today but to my surprise I received a \\&quot;knock off\\&quot; wash cloth that IS NOT Salux and IS NOT from Japan but is indeed from China. I was extremely disappointed! Had the actual wash cloth that I received been the same thick material that the Salux one is then I definitely wouldn&#x27;t have had a problem sticking with it. This one is made of a cheap material that feels very thin. Contacted Amazon immediately and am shipping it back for full refund. I should have read the other reviews before ordering so that is my bad. Soooo disappointed!! ):    BUYERS BEWARE - DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THESE CHINA KNOCK OFFS!!!</li>
            <li> The product I got was Leyjie brand!  I&#x27;ve never tried the Salux brand but this one is a little rough for my preference.</li>
            <li> These authentic Japanese cleansing cloths are WAY better than the softer American versions I see in local mass market retailers &amp; beauty shops.  I prefer the &amp;#34;rougher&amp;#34; scrub grain of the cloth as I feel it exfoliates longer, and wears longer before needing to be replaced.  Also, these cloths tend to run longer and wider than the American brand ones I&#x27;ve tried.  I will ALWAYS order these from now on...there&#x27;s no comparison locally.</li>
            <li> Not as soft as expected.</li>
            <li> These are very long (probably around 30&amp;#34;) and handy to use for hard to reach places and for limited mobility that hinders one&#x27;s reach or bending.  Highly recommended and very fast drying.  They are excellent with liquid soap or bar soap.  The #300&#x27;d is the roughest; I would have bought all #100 or #200 so I had a bit of scrubbing grit, but not as rough as the #300.  Check carefully in the description for the number you want.</li>
            <li> Great defoliant. My skin is polished and smooth.  Easily cleans after use .would order again and will purchase for friends</li>
            <li> Too bad this only comes in the mildly-exfoliating version.  The color green was perfect in my bathroom but I much prefer the &amp;#34;SUPER HARD WEAVE&amp;#34; sold by &amp;#34;Cure&amp;#34; in cobalt blue, also on the Amazon site.  If you want exfoliation, the towel by &amp;#34;Cure&amp;#34; is the one for you!</li>
            <li> (JUST BE SURE THAT YOURS-RECEIVED IS A GENUINE &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; PRODUCT, MANUFACTURED IN JAPAN  [NOT in China],  or its quality WILL NO-WHERE NEARLY MATCH THIS REVIEW)!&lt;br /&gt;If you DO receive a look-alike from an unscrupulous merchant and the package says &amp;#34;Made In China,&amp;#34; !SEND IT BACK IMMEDIATELY, UNOPENED, FOR A REFUND!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REVIEW OF THE ORIGINAL, &amp;#34;SALUX&amp;#34; JAPANESE-MADE CLOTH:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WATCH OUT DIRT AND BODY-GREASE...HERE IT COMES!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an almost-all synthetic, long washcloth with a REAL &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; propensity to &amp;#34;sloth&amp;#34; away dead skin, dirt and body oils that leave you feeling &amp;#34;invigorated&amp;#34; after every shower or bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They produce copious amounts of foam from small amounts of almost any body-wash liquid or bar soaps and the cloths, themselves, last me at least a couple of years before they must be replaced (always, because a couple of inches of their ends begin to tear off after that amount of time/usage, during the type of back-scrub motions as exhibited on the package&#x27;s front side)...I THEN continue to use the now-shorter, &amp;#34;spent&amp;#34; cloth for house-hold scrubbing of bath-stalls, stoves, ovens, soiled pots/pans, etc. This &amp;#34;recycling&amp;#34; act extends their VERY useful life-span ANOTHER few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It usually fully-dries in less then a couple of hours when hung from its end or draped in its middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;S GREAT!! (especially if you&#x27;re really dirty and don&#x27;t have sensitive skin!!)</li>
            <li> This scrub towel is so much better than the scrubbies that are tied together like a ball. The wash towel is just wide enough and plenty long enough to grab an end in each hand and scrub, scrub, scrub my back. It just feels so good. I use it for whole body washing all over and my skin feels nice and smooth afterwards. Also, it rinses easily and dries very quickly.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I can exfoliate my whole body &amp; it dries quickly.</li>
            <li> light weight and long enough to reach your back. a good purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this towel for several months now and love it! It extra long, so it&#x27;s easy to wash my back without arm strain that occurs with scrbbys made of similar material. It only requires a small amount of body wash to offer wonderful lathering. It helps to exfoliate the skin and is easy to care for, goes into the wash when needed and is fast drying!</li>
            <li> Actually, I&#x27;ve used one of these perpetually, ever since I learned about them while living on Oahu in the early 90&#x27;s. They are long so that you can exfoliate your back well; they hold lather much better than a cloth rag. They dry out quickly. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I now have two of these. I use it while pregnant to exfoliate my belly. It is the best!  You can use it on any part of your body and it leaves you feeling silky smooth.  Its a cheap price to pay for a great product.</li>
            <li> Wow, what a great alternative to a wash cloth! I love this thing for all of the other reasons cited: it cleans, exfoliates, and leaves your body with a nice tingly feeling. It&#x27;s super hygienic because all of the soap rinses out and it drys in a snap. I honestly don&#x27;t know what I did without this product! I love it so much I even got my husband (manly man) to try it and he&#x27;s now hooked too. My only complaint is the colors. They are BRIGHT and don&#x27;t match anything in our bathrooms. We eventually settled on white because it is quite honestly the least offensive color choice.</li>
            <li> This is so much better than a sponge. And no bacteria to worry about. It&#x27;s like giving yourself a massage in the shower :)</li>
            <li> So the very first thing I checked, after reading all the reviews, was the tag. Thankfully I received a genuine Salux, not some knockoff, and I can immediately see the difference! It feels so SO much nicer than any loofah or sea sponge I&#x27;ve ever used, and leaves my skin wonderfully smooth. Oh, did I mention the material? It has a wide enough weave that I&#x27;m confident I can get it clean (a problem with loofah and sponge options), but tight enough that it looks and feels very durable. I pulled and prodded one corner of the fabric, and it didn&#x27;t rip or stretch out of shape, my only worry, so basically I&#x27;m sold. Now if only they&#x27;d make a slightly smoother version for faces!</li>
            <li> I have been using Salux wash Cloths for 40 years and absolutely love them.  They also are long enough that it makes it easy to wash my back.  I&#x27;ve tried others once in a while and they turn out to be too soft. When we go on vacation and I sometimes forget to pack it, I do not feel clean. These are amazing and I will never be without one. Each one lasts me around 2 years before it starts to rip on the end.  Still usable that way, but that is when I buy a new one&#x3D;) I fold mine a few times and then add soap....it suds up nicely. Just rinse it out after your shower and hang it to dry.  It is nylon mesh so dries quickly.</li>
            <li> ...but I feel like it&#x27;s not as nice as the one I bought last year. Maybe it is my imagination?</li>
            <li> This is the second one of these I&#x27;ve bought and I absolutely love it! It is the only wash cloth I will use. Great quality, washes well (I&#x27;ve washed mine a million times and it still hasn&#x27;t frayed or fallen apart).</li>
            <li> I can only find them online.  They are a perfect back washer and made of nylon, so the rinse and dry fast.</li>
            <li> I also got the China knock off product, picture of the girl even looks similar. This is not a Salux! Shame on them for false advertising :(</li>
            <li> I love this cloth, it is my favorite so far that I&#x27;ve used for exfoliation.  It is easy to reach your back.  Love this product!!</li>
            <li> Arrived in fine condition. Lady loved it as her gift.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing body wash cloth!!! 5 stars!!! the best product for exfoliating the skin...</li>
