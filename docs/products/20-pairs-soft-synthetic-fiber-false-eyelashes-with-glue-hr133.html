            <li>I Love these lashes you cannot beat the price either.</li>
            <li>I love the way lashes make my eyes pop.  </li>
            <li>You get what you pay for and they were cheap!</li>
            <li>they don&#x27;t feel like plastic,unlike most eyelashes I&#x27;ve ordered in bulk.</li>
            <li>why i LOVE these lashes:&lt;br</li>
            <li>most lashes are but some are just junk that you have to do a couple lines of glue</li>
            <li>I will order more.</li>
            <li>SOMETHING BETTER</li>
            <li>I love them</li>
            <li>I love these guys.</li>
            <li>And I&#x27;ll try to fix them by curling them to look more even</li>
            <li>So I would save my money and buy something of better quality.</li>
            <li>There so worth it!!</li>
            <li>I wear lashes every day I love how easy these go on I</li>
            <li>My daughter goes through eyelashes very frequently and this was a great value for the money.  </li>
            <li>Very full and</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m ordering more right now!</li>
            <li>I love the full lash look they provide</li>
            <li>At first I was very excited about these lashes because I love full lashes and for this deal it was pretty good.</li>
            <li>Not crazy long but nice very full looking and a great length for a bold look!</li>
            <li>but they are super cute.</li>
            <li>These are HUGE, but they&#x27;re so plushy looking and lightweight.</li>
            <li>great price, but generic.</li>
            <li>so they are cheap material</li>
            <li>I had to trim them to fit my eyes, and yes you do need to flex the band a bit to get rid of the stiffness.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re fabulous.</li>
            <li>but so far so good.</li>
            <li>When I found this awesome buy of 20 lashes for such a reasonable price, I was so excited.  </li>
            <li>but they&#x27;re just fine, nothing really special.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re pretty flexible as is and very full.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re extremely full and no one will know they&#x27;re plastic.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend, will buy again! :)</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s only good for one time use.</li>
            <li>but you get what you pay for feels super plastic, wasn&#x27;t really blend able</li>
            <li>/&gt;-shipped quick</li>
            <li>I order a lot of lashes from Amazon and these are my favorite so far!  </li>
            <li>/&gt;They came in a cute box with little boxes inside that have 2 pairs in each, all really nice quality.</li>
            <li>The soft synthetic fiber make the lashes look sexy with any eye look or event.</li>
            <li>I think these lashes are worth the money.</li>
            <li>So many products for such a cheap price.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re the right fullness for my liking.</li>
            <li>and they last a long time with good care!...</li>
            <li>a lot of different lashes clump very easily, you&#x27;ll have to actually try, to be able to clump these.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Exactly as shown.</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Definitely buy weave glue to keep them bonded more securely.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I suggest buying hair bonding glue, the one with the red top, which you can find it in any beauty supply.</li>
            <li>These are not over-the-top lashes</li>
            <li>I am an avid eyelash wearer.  </li>
            <li>then don&#x27;t order these in the first place &amp; stop complaining :</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s very helpful that they have glue already !</li>
            <li>Overall though, the value is outstanding.</li>
            <li>They are good for everyday where as well</li>
            <li>And for 14, a total of two orders with 40 lashes, girl or boy ;) get it!!!</li>
            <li>The lashes look more real than products I&#x27;ve purchased locally.</li>
            <li>These are great for dramatic or colorful eye looks.</li>
            <li>you like the super natural look</li>
            <li>THESE ARE PURE GARABAGE</li>
            <li>Yet, I know a few people who love them!</li>
            <li>I loved these lashes, they last a long time, are great if you like a dramatic look, which I do.</li>
            <li>Too much work.</li>
            <li>No girl who wears lashes on the daily needs to deal with this kinda cheap</li>
            <li>They hold shape really well.</li>
            <li>but they just so touch the boundary of too much for work.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>The eyelashes look real and they get a lot of use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No matter how much glue I used, they would not stick.</li>
            <li>I will purchase more lashes in the near future.</li>
            <li>I also find that it is easier to pull the glue off these without damaging them because they are more durable than some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;thank</li>
            <li>They are full and feel like human hair lashes.</li>
            <li>they&#x27;re so thin on the glue line that the it sticks so much better, the more thick lines raise so much more than these.&lt;br /&gt;*takes</li>
            <li>but i personally think its definitely worth the price.</li>
            <li>I have been putting fake eyelashes on for many years, more than a decade and these have been very dissapointing and low quality.</li>
            <li>They look pretty good when you put them on, I gave it 4 stars because they are a little stiff</li>
            <li>Do not order these if you are going for a natural look!</li>
            <li>Loll they complete my look!</li>
            <li>If you like a natural look, donÂ´t buy this...</li>
            <li>they are not meant to look natural.  </li>
            <li>These eyelashes are soft</li>
            <li>/&gt;*not natural at all.</li>
            <li>I received them much sooner that I expected and that met my expectations completely.  </li>
            <li>The way the lashes look on you is like no other.</li>
            <li>They are not long or short.</li>
            <li>They are fairly long even for a more dramatic lash</li>
    </ol>

            <li> The way the lashes look on you is like no other.</li>
            <li> They are not long or short.</li>
            <li> They are fairly long even for a more dramatic lash</li>
            <li> /&gt;anyone having issues with the glue on the thin glue lash line and getting really irritated, lashes are a trick of the hand and also take technique and to find the right glue and holding it for the full 30 seconds and blending your lashes with the fake lashes with your mascara, and also an eyelash curler if you&#x27;d like.</li>
            <li> so I was excited to find these and how dramatic they looked in the pictures.</li>
            <li> They are very long and don&#x27;t look human at all.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re long for my eye shape, so I just have to trim them up a bit.</li>
            <li> They are a bit long</li>
            <li> I change them literally everyday because i like them to look natural and they do just that.</li>
            <li> but they are not flexible enough and harder to put on.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not really soft.</li>
            <li> They also took quite a long time to get to me.</li>
            <li> They went up on the price tho before they were only like 4$$ but other than that</li>
            <li> If you want natural get the ELF natural lashes or dramatic lashes by ELF.  </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re pretty bulky and difficult to put on (and I&#x27;ve been wearing false lashes for a long time) and it&#x27;s easy to get that wonky eye look.</li>
            <li> but that is a struggle because they&#x27;re really hard to curl and look even worse because they don&#x27;t fit into the eyelash curler.</li>
            <li> I look like a drag queen.</li>
            <li> I am in the military</li>
            <li> /&gt;*arrived sooner than expected.</li>
            <li> Even faster than the expected delivery</li>
            <li> I would of gave it 5 stars but the glue I got with the eye lashes were empty...</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend these to anyone who likes big thick lashes.</li>
            <li> although maybe a little stiff, it takes a few bends to get them decent.</li>
            <li> Other companies give you glue with each set</li>
            <li> I also recommend using the DUO dark tone lash glue for these lashes.</li>
            <li> cause if I didn&#x27;t they wouldn&#x27;t even glue down.</li>
            <li> I thought these would arrive sooner because of the previous reviews that say so</li>
            <li> They are long, thick, and dark.</li>
            <li> but i had a lot of trouble with this one.</li>
            <li> I wear them to work everyday.</li>
            <li> Even could give a few friends some too.</li>
            <li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
            <li> and they are so stiff that I had to soak them in water to even get them to bend into place</li>
            <li> I just wish they was not so stiff</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all dried out!</li>
            <li> We were a bit amazed by the fact they look small.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried to apply these a bunch of different ways but they always end up looking weird.</li>
            <li> Ridiculously hard to apply, comes glued on to the package too thick.</li>
            <li> Eyelashes are so thick it blocks people from seeing your eyeshadow.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-May be a little dramatic for day to day use</li>
            <li> Very stiff and hard to get on!  </li>
            <li> Must be for those with very small eyes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;-A little difficult to shape to one&#x27;s eyes</li>
            <li> These lashes are very fake looking, made of a heavy material that hurt my eyes and made them feel very heavy.</li>
            <li> The glue doesnÂ´t stick to the eyelashes, they are very thick...</li>
            <li> This is a must have if you like the dramatic look.</li>
            <li> But it does give you the dramatic look.</li>
            <li> Positive:&lt;br /&gt;-Full, dramatic look</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for dramatic lashes for a while now</li>
            <li> So, if you like a dramatic effect, you&#x27;ll adore these!</li>
            <li> VERRY DRAMATIC!</li>

            <li> Exactly as shown. No complaints.</li>
            <li> The glue doesnÂ´t stick to the eyelashes, they are very thick... If you like a natural look, donÂ´t buy this...</li>
            <li> I love these lashes! The soft synthetic fiber make the lashes look sexy with any eye look or event. There so worth it!! ;)</li>
            <li> These lashes were amazing...and they last a long time with good care!...I would definitely recommend purchasing these...They are good for everyday where as well</li>
            <li> I have had some in this style before.  they are not meant to look natural.  If you want natural get the ELF natural lashes or dramatic lashes by ELF.  These are great for dramatic or colorful eye looks.</li>
            <li> The way the lashes look on you is like no other. This is a must have if you like the dramatic look. Will be buying more soon.</li>
            <li> These are horrible for me. They make me look like I have crazy, bushy, spider eyes and they are so stiff that I had to soak them in water to even get them to bend into place cause if I didn&#x27;t they wouldn&#x27;t even glue down. Too much work. I look like a drag queen.</li>
            <li> My daughter goes through eyelashes very frequently and this was a great value for the money.  Quality was good and she got many uses per pair.  Would buy again.</li>
            <li> At first I was very excited about these lashes because I love full lashes and for this deal it was pretty good. But...they don&#x27;t stay on well. No matter what eyelash glue I use. The corners will always lift during the day. No girl who wears lashes on the daily needs to deal with this kinda cheap b.s</li>
            <li> LOVE! Definitely buy weave glue to keep them bonded more securely.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never been a fan of the glue that comes with lashes though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price. These are nice. Not remy but not too plasticky either! Not crazy long but nice very full looking and a great length for a bold look!</li>
            <li> These are HUGE, but they&#x27;re so plushy looking and lightweight. I get about 3 wears out of them! They&#x27;re long for my eye shape, so I just have to trim them up a bit. They&#x27;re pretty flexible as is and very full. I look like a doll in them. So, if you like a dramatic effect, you&#x27;ll adore these! They&#x27;re great for the beginner application wise.</li>
            <li> great price, but generic. they&#x27;re okay, I guess. but they&#x27;re just fine, nothing really special. I suggest to buy a better glue separately.</li>
            <li> I am in LOVE with these lashes! Granted they didn&#x27;t come with the glue they are still a great deal. They hold shape really well. They are fairly long even for a more dramatic lash but they are super cute. I also recommend using the DUO dark tone lash glue for these lashes.</li>
            <li> I think these lashes are worth the money. I take them off every night then pull the glue off and reapply them in the a.m. I suggest buying hair bonding glue, the one with the red top, which you can find it in any beauty supply. Also use tweezers to attach and hold them to your own lashes. I never have a problem with the corners lifting. I also find that it is easier to pull the glue off these without damaging them because they are more durable than some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;thank you :)</li>
            <li> I thought these would arrive sooner because of the previous reviews that say so but no, it arrived 4 weeks after I purchased them which was the estimated delivery date anyway. These are not over-the-top lashes but they just so touch the boundary of too much for work. I am in the military so of course I don&#x27;t wear these to work. The price, amount, and quality is why I gave it five stars. The glue that comes with these are useles but I only use Duo and never intended on using what came with it. Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> I have been putting fake eyelashes on for many years, more than a decade and these have been very dissapointing and low quality. Instead of making your eyes look bigger they look smaller</li>
            <li> I thought it was going to be great but you get what you pay for feels super plastic, wasn&#x27;t really blend able i had to fight with it to put it on and i do put on lashes alot but i had a lot of trouble with this one. Would not purchase again.</li>
            <li> I will purchase more lashes in the near future. The lashes look more real than products I&#x27;ve purchased locally. Thanks</li>
            <li> These look so good on to be plastic. They&#x27;re extremely full and no one will know they&#x27;re plastic. Great buy.</li>
            <li> I always worry about ordering lashes online but so far so good. They are a bit long but i always cut them so no big deal. I wear them to work everyday.</li>
            <li> Talk about buying in bulk! So many products for such a cheap price. Definitely the way to go! Great products as well!</li>
            <li> They look pretty good when you put them on, I gave it 4 stars because they are a little stiff but it was to expect for the price.</li>
            <li> I Love these lashes you cannot beat the price either. They are synthetic so they are cheap material but i personally think its definitely worth the price. I change them literally everyday because i like them to look natural and they do just that.</li>
            <li> These lashes are very fake looking, made of a heavy material that hurt my eyes and made them feel very heavy. I couldn&#x27;t even keep them on for an hour. I would not recommend these to anyone. I&#x27;ll be tossing them out.</li>
            <li> Hate it . Emd of story</li>
            <li> I loved these lashes, they last a long time, are great if you like a dramatic look, which I do. I would definitely recommend these to anyone who likes big thick lashes. (:</li>
            <li> I love the full lash look they provide but they are not flexible enough and harder to put on.</li>
            <li> I am an avid eyelash wearer.  I love the way lashes make my eyes pop.  When I found this awesome buy of 20 lashes for such a reasonable price, I was so excited.  I received them much sooner that I expected and that met my expectations completely.  VERY HAPPY!!</li>
            <li> Great lashes really love them! VERRY DRAMATIC! Could get 2-3 uses out of a pair. Even could give a few friends some too. Highly recommend, will buy again! :)</li>
            <li> Will never buy these again!  Very stiff and hard to get on!  Did not use them!!  Very disappointed!!  You get what you pay for and they were cheap!</li>
            <li> These lashes are the best I have seen. They are not long or short. They are full and feel like human hair lashes. You will not find a deal like this. You have glue in every set of lashes. The lashes were also well packaged !! Will be buying more !!</li>
            <li> I think the lashes are made out of plastic. It&#x27;s not really soft. But it does give you the dramatic look. I wouldn&#x27;t buy these again. It&#x27;s only good for one time use. Don&#x27;t bother using the glue that comes with it. It&#x27;s all dried out!</li>
            <li> These eyelashes are soft they don&#x27;t feel like plastic,unlike most eyelashes I&#x27;ve ordered in bulk. They&#x27;re the right fullness for my liking.</li>
            <li> very good product. will definately order again. does not come with glue as advertised. for each 20 you buy you will get 1 tiny tube of glue for all lashes. which totally is not enough.  i wanted seperate glue for each pack of lashes and that wasnt the case. Other companies give you glue with each set so i thought thats what i would get and i didn&#x27;t.  Lashes are full and beautiful.</li>
            <li> I order these all the time there are 20 pair they are full and beautiful. I wear lashes every day I love how easy these go on I only wish they had prime shipping</li>
            <li> I got these last summer. I have been using them on and off. They had an emty glue container inside each lash box. The only glue on them is the self adhesive. I like the thickness although maybe a little stiff, it takes a few bends to get them decent. Yet, I know a few people who love them!</li>
            <li> look really fake horrible product. for clown makeup</li>
            <li> why i LOVE these lashes:&lt;br /&gt;*not natural at all. and if you&#x27;re going for that look don&#x27;t use these!&lt;br /&gt;*reusable. most lashes are but some are just junk that you have to do a couple lines of glue and it just bulks up during the day. not with these though! they&#x27;re so thin on the glue line that the it sticks so much better, the more thick lines raise so much more than these.&lt;br /&gt;*takes mascara well. a lot of different lashes clump very easily, you&#x27;ll have to actually try, to be able to clump these.&lt;br /&gt;*arrived sooner than expected. that&#x27;s an obvious bonus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyone having issues with the glue on the thin glue lash line and getting really irritated, lashes are a trick of the hand and also take technique and to find the right glue and holding it for the full 30 seconds and blending your lashes with the fake lashes with your mascara, and also an eyelash curler if you&#x27;d like. i&#x27;ve had no issues with the glue i use and these lashes. i love them! will definitely buy again!</li>
            <li> Ordered them on Monday, got them on Friday (: Even faster than the expected delivery date.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They came in a cute box with little boxes inside that have 2 pairs in each, all really nice quality. The eyelashes look real and they get a lot of use out of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the super natural look then don&#x27;t order these in the first place &amp; stop complaining :b</li>
            <li> Definitely wouldn&#x27;t order these again. They feel like plastic and look like crap on. They also took quite a long time to get to me.</li>
            <li> just what i needed ! they shipped on time, and are very cute lashes !! it&#x27;s very helpful that they have glue already ! would definitely recommend this product to others !</li>
            <li> The lashes look as described. We were a bit amazed by the fact they look small. Must be for those with very small eyes. We use lashes on our modeling heads and these are much smaller than those we have seen and used before. Still a nice product.</li>
            <li> excellent product, thank you, and my grade is 10.</li>
            <li> I order a lot of lashes from Amazon and these are my favorite so far!  They easily last 7-10 days per pair and the band is flexible out the box.  I will order more.</li>
            <li> This set come with lash glue in each  packet and everyone  was emty... The lashes  where good but had to go out to the store to buy lash glue to use.</li>
            <li> They are very long and don&#x27;t look human at all.</li>
            <li> Do not order these if you are going for a natural look! That being said, these are wonderful. They are long, thick, and dark. I had to trim them to fit my eyes, and yes you do need to flex the band a bit to get rid of the stiffness. Overall though, the value is outstanding. I&#x27;m ordering more right now!</li>
            <li> Positive:&lt;br /&gt;-Full, dramatic look&lt;br /&gt;-Multiple uses&lt;br /&gt;-cut to size (if necessary)&lt;br /&gt;-durable&lt;br /&gt;-good quality (faux material)&lt;br /&gt;-shipped quick&lt;br /&gt;-great price/deal&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative:&lt;br /&gt;-A little difficult to shape to one&#x27;s eyes&lt;br /&gt;-May be a little dramatic for day to day use</li>
            <li> My headline says it all!! I&#x27;m just in love with these babies!! I have to hide these when my girlfriends come over because they always want to have one. I don&#x27;t like sharing these. Loll they complete my look! I&#x27;m definitely ordering again.</li>
            <li> PLEASE DON&#x27;T BUY THEY CAN&#x27;T EVEN BEND THESE ARE PURE GARABAGE DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY BUY SOMETHING BETTER HELL NO</li>
            <li> I love them I just wish they was not so stiff The over all there really good I will b ordering them again</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re fabulous. Very full and the lash line is slim so fits perfectly. And for 14, a total of two orders with 40 lashes, girl or boy ;) get it!!! Came in two weeks!</li>
            <li> I love these guys. can do myself.</li>
            <li> No matter how much glue I used, they would not stick.</li>
            <li> I have been on the hunt for dramatic lashes for a while now so I was excited to find these and how dramatic they looked in the pictures. But when they arrived and I got a chance to try them, out I don&#x27;t know what it is but, they just didn&#x27;t work out well. They&#x27;re pretty bulky and difficult to put on (and I&#x27;ve been wearing false lashes for a long time) and it&#x27;s easy to get that wonky eye look. I&#x27;ve tried to apply these a bunch of different ways but they always end up looking weird. And I&#x27;ll try to fix them by curling them to look more even but that is a struggle because they&#x27;re really hard to curl and look even worse because they don&#x27;t fit into the eyelash curler. So I would save my money and buy something of better quality.</li>
            <li> the lashes look plastic, very bad quilty</li>
            <li> I love these! They went up on the price tho before they were only like 4$$ but other than that I will remain getting these ! I would of gave it 5 stars but the glue I got with the eye lashes were empty... Still good lashes!</li>
            <li> They are alright. Ridiculously hard to apply, comes glued on to the package too thick. Eyelashes are so thick it blocks people from seeing your eyeshadow. But if that&#x27;s that you like, go for it.</li>
