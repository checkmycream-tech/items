            <li>I use this foundation with the Xtra top coat.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>Will buy again if I need more.</li>
            <li>I read the ingredients and it contains formaldehyde which was the cause of so many deformities in babies in the 60&#x27;s.  </li>

            <li>I opened this container in my bathroom and the odor was so strong that it made me cough.  </li>

            <li>This is a good product but not quite as filling as I expected based on others reviews.  </li>
            <li>This isn&#x27;t exactly the ridge filler I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>Do not give up after the first couple applications just keep at it.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really provide a clear coat and wears off very quickly.  </li>

            <li>I was paying as much as $7.99 a bottle.</li>

            <li>It is great if you want to strengthen your nails, fill in ridges or give yourself a \\&quot;poor woman&#x27;s\\&quot; french manicure.</li>
            <li>I apply two coats of Foundation II and then two coats of clear coat.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to try the clear coat to see if that makes any difference.</li>
            <li>I wear my nails very long now for the first time in years and don&#x27;t have to worry about them breaking, they feel like acrylic nails.</li>
            <li>It makes my nails look smooth, healthy and will not chip or peel for at least 3 days of hard use.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Good product; great price</li>
            <li> I started using this product after my sister-in-law suggested it. Her manicurist recommended it after she stopped using acrylic tips and her nails were very thin. My nails break and peel no matter what I do. I started using Foundation II as a last resort and I suggest it to everyone now. It looks great on your nail alone. There is no shine to this product. I even used it on my hubby&#x27;s cracked nail since we were out of super glue. It is great if you want to strengthen your nails, fill in ridges or give yourself a \\&quot;poor woman&#x27;s\\&quot; french manicure. I apply two coats of Foundation II and then two coats of clear coat. It makes my nails look smooth, healthy and will not chip or peel for at least 3 days of hard use. I am a big hand washer. Basically I use this product as a 1-2 coat base alone or under any regular nail polish. Also note that buying through Amazon was a $4 savings compared to my local beauty supply store. I was paying as much as $7.99 a bottle. Only $2.99 through Amazon. This product is a must have and for the male reader of this review, no one will know you are using it. Like I said - no shine if used alone and it will strengthen your nails.</li>
            <li> People have been recommending this to me for over a year. I just purchased recently and have applied multiple times as I change my nail color almost three times a week! It works amazingly, great base. Has evenend my nails out and even hardened them a little!  Good buy!</li>
            <li> I am using this in conjunction with an excellent liquid nail wrap and am extremely pleased. I have not broken or chipped at nail since using it. I did not even cover it with nail polish at it looks fine with a nude look. The products from my local drug stores were not doing me much good.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m on my third bottle, and this time I tried Foundation II. I don&#x27;t notice any difference they both are excellent. My nails have gone from weak and fragile to extremely hard and strong using this product alone. I didn&#x27;t know to use the clear top coat as I have always used my own. I wear my nails very long now for the first time in years and don&#x27;t have to worry about them breaking, they feel like acrylic nails. I could never wear colored polish as my nails were ridged and the polish always bubbled. With this foundation, those concerns are a thing of the past. I&#x27;m going to try the clear coat to see if that makes any difference. I will be hard to give up Sally Hansen&#x27;s Instant Dry topcoat as it so quickly dries my polish hard and strong. Will see!</li>
            <li> makes your nails stronger And much nicer looking.&lt;br /&gt;the price is very reasonable and the duo makes a great gift.</li>
            <li> This product does just what it said it would.  Could not find it in any beauty store.  Great product, would order it again.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love NailTek products! I&#x27;ve always had flimsy nails that were always snagging, so I had to cut them. This product enables me to have strong, long nail. I use this foundation with the Xtra top coat. The trick is to make sure you use it every day like it says on the directions to get the best results. I was so happy to have a beautiful french manicure on my own nails at my wedding!</li>
            <li> I really like nail tex products and will continue to buy them. I think this specific one is strengthening my nails.</li>
            <li> it peels off rather easily and takes the nail polish off with itself</li>
            <li> This isn&#x27;t exactly the ridge filler I was looking for.  It doesn&#x27;t really provide a clear coat and wears off very quickly.  I wasn&#x27;t pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> Please dont hesitate to buy this product its amazing!!!!!....I feel like I have found the secret to long healthy nails I get tons of compliments on my nails this works best when you use nail teks top coat as well</li>
            <li> I can truthfully say that this product has helped strengthen my unhealthy nails. I had false nails for awhile, and my nails were thin and brittle because of them. After using this strengthener, my nails are back to being strong and healthy!    Great buy for the price!</li>
            <li> Love this product!! Absolutely have to get this</li>
            <li> My nails suddenly started peeling awfully. I remembered that I had used this in the past and liked it. So I tried it again, and the peeling literally disappeared. My nails are stronger and harder as well. In combination with biotin supplements and moisturizing, my nails are the best they&#x27;ve ever been. The price is fantastic too, at the store it would be over $10. I HIGHLY recommend this if your nails are weak and peeling.</li>
            <li> This is a good product but not quite as filling as I expected based on others reviews.  I do like it, however as a base coat.</li>
            <li> Amazing product. I was suffering with brittle nails after my acrylic nails. I was desperate nothing was working to help me with the issue. I decided to buy this and just try it. After using this product for 1 month, I bought my second bottle. Just one month and my nails are perfect, strong, thicker and prettier healthier looking and feeling. I recommend this to everyone who has deals with brittle nails. Do not give up after the first couple applications just keep at it. The way I used it was, step1(applied this foundationII) step2(my choice of nail polish color) step 3(nailtekII Intensive Therapy). You do not have to apply any nail polish if you don&#x27; t want to but the FoundationII works best when combined with the Intensive Therapy II. TRY THIS do your nails that favour, you deserve to feel good about your hands and not hide your nails like I did for years. Good luck 😃</li>
            <li> Love this as a base coat. It strengthens my nails a lot. Would highly recommend, especially if you have weak, peeling, or ridged nails.</li>
            <li> the price was fantastic for this item and it makes my nails smooth before polish. Will buy again if I need more.</li>
            <li> I have noticed an improvement in enamel wear, especially when doing 3-4 layers  as base. Does good job of making surface even--and my nails&#x27; ridges are like teutonic faults! Great value and wear for the price!</li>
            <li> First Ridge Filler I&#x27;ve tried that really works.  Easy to apply, looks good, and lasts a long time.  As a man, I wanted something with no color, and no shine.  This stuff is great!  Makes my nails smoother, and doesn&#x27;t look like I&#x27;m wearing anything.  Makes nails stronger too.</li>
            <li> great my nails feel stronger after years or abuse from biting and washing</li>
            <li> Hands down the best ridge filler I have ever used. It fills in all the bumps and dries fast too. I actually threw my other ridge fillers out, I won&#x27;t be needing them again.</li>
            <li> I bought this because of one of the reviews, which stated it was &amp;#34;not shiny.&amp;#34; Wrong. It&#x27;s just as shiny as any nail polish, and didn&#x27;t even fill in the ridges.</li>
            <li> I opened this container in my bathroom and the odor was so strong that it made me cough.  I read the ingredients and it contains formaldehyde which was the cause of so many deformities in babies in the 60&#x27;s.  I hated to even through this in the trash to go to the garbage dump.</li>
            <li> Great stuff.  I can repair a damaged nail with it and a little piece of tea bag.</li>
            <li> I have vertical ridges on my thumbnails. I tried several coats of this product and it helped but the ridges could still be seen. I&#x27;ll keep looking till I find something that works.</li>
