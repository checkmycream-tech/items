            <li>After two nights I combed all the TJMaxx&#x27;s in my ate to get more, to no avail.</li>

            <li>My skins absorbs it very well, it smells great, and its doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>I love this cream.</li>
            <li>Good seller fast shipping</li>
            <li>it is so butter smooth -</li>
            <li>This one is light and doesn&#x27;t make me feel too greasy.  </li>
            <li>Vitamin C is so important for your skin.</li>
            <li>but so far, so good.</li>
            <li>Good basic moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li>Love the cream, goes on smooth and has a soft citrus smell.  </li>
            <li>I am SO glad I found this one here on Amazon, as it is no longer available at my two local T.J. Maxx&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>, over time may be anti aging with the vit c. right now just like the moisturizing effect.</li>
            <li>No one can guess my real age!</li>
            <li>I could tell a difference within the first two-three days.</li>
            <li>but my skin felt so good after just a few days of use that I purchased two additional jars.</li>
            <li>Be aware that any creams with Vit C has a particular smell to it.  </li>
            <li>I really like the Vitamin C in this cream.</li>
            <li>I love vitamin c and this products works extremely well.</li>
            <li>I forget to put it on at night but it works great on my neck and upper chest area each day before heading off to work - most people would not guess my true age and would be shocked to hear old I truly am.  </li>
            <li>I have very oily skin and most moisturizers sit heavy on my face.  </li>
            <li>I have used forty years worth of high-end as well as drugstore products on my face, including Regenerist, which had been my go-to facial product.</li>
            <li>We&#x27;ll see after a few more weeks...</li>
            <li>My skin is now clear, supple, wrinkle-free.</li>
            <li>I always get complements on my skin and am told how I look so young.</li>
            <li>My skin seems to soak up this product like a sponge and it feels so soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I have nearly used up a jar of this night cream that I bought at T.J. Maxx for $5.</li>
            <li>use Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant every few days and with both of these, my skin has started looking better within a week.</li>
            <li>There was a small problem with my order, but the seller attempted quickly to get it fixed.</li>
            <li>I cannot say enough good about this product, I have sensitive skin also, and it was quite broken out and had dark acne remains before I used this.</li>

            <li> I have been using this cream for almost two years now. I always get complements on my skin and am told how I look so young. No one can guess my real age! I am told I look 21 and I&#x27;m almost 37!!! I always get carded everywhere I go and the best part is I have No wrinkles either!  I love the feel of the cream and the smell. This product works!!!!</li>
            <li> My skin seems to soak up this product like a sponge and it feels so soft and supple. I just started using it but my skin felt so good after just a few days of use that I purchased two additional jars.</li>

            <li> I got a jar of this, along with the eye cream, at TJMaxx last year. After two nights I combed all the TJMaxx&#x27;s in my ate to get more, to no avail. I then combed the Internet....I don&#x27;t know how I ran across it here, but I am so glad I did. I have very sensitive akin, and it is excellent. Rich but nor oily, vitamin C is great for skin, and smells nice to boot</li>
            <li> Excellent.....wake up to nicer skin.</li>
            <li> I have nearly used up a jar of this night cream that I bought at T.J. Maxx for $5. I cannot say enough good about this product, I have sensitive skin also, and it was quite broken out and had dark acne remains before I used this. (About 4 or 5 weeks of use?) I didn&#x27;t know my skin could even look this good. Me! I could tell a difference within the first two-three days. I have used forty years worth of high-end as well as drugstore products on my face, including Regenerist, which had been my go-to facial product. I am SO glad I found this one here on Amazon, as it is no longer available at my two local T.J. Maxx&#x27;s. Great stuff at any price! My skin is now clear, supple, wrinkle-free. I am 62.</li>

            <li> I discover this product at TJMaxx.  I have noticed a different in my skin, it is brighter and less dry as a result.</li>
            <li> Be aware that any creams with Vit C has a particular smell to it.  Personally, I don&#x27;t like that smell. I have used this brand before without the VIT C and I liked it better.</li>
            <li> I love this product. There was a small problem with my order, but the seller attempted quickly to get it fixed. Thank you for the good customer service and great product. I love vitamin c and this products works extremely well. I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I love this cream. It&#x27;s not thick, a little goes a long way and it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I use Dermalogica Daily Microfoliant every few days and with both of these, my skin has started looking better within a week.</li>
            <li> I really like the Vitamin C in this cream. It makes a difference. Vitamin C is so important for your skin.</li>
            <li> excellent product, you will see results in two days ! Good seller fast shipping</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful moisturizer.  I live in Las Vegas and the weather is a bit harsh on my skin. I&#x27;m also an esthetician and vitamin C is great from building collagen and preventing hyperpigmentation. I&#x27;ve gotten great results with this product, that I&#x27;ve even decided to use it on my clients as well. I haven&#x27;t had any complaints about it.  Everyone loves their results and how if feels on their skin.  I would recommend it to others.  Love it!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of weeks, but I do think my skin is softer and a bit smoother. We&#x27;ll see after a few more weeks...but so far, so good.</li>
