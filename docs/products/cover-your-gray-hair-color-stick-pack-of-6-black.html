            <li>This is a great Product.  </li>
            <li>This cover gray stick is good for a temporary cover up between colorings.  </li>
            <li>The good is -</li>
            <li>definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li>Works good.</li>
            <li>Could not use the product after ordering 6 bulk order and gave it away to friends thinking what I ordered was a good product.</li>
            <li>After using this product, I found it highly effective in temporarily covering my gray strands that pop up in between dying all of my hair.</li>
            <li>Fiske Industries, Inc is great too, the package arrived really fast and packed well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li>The color still covers the gray, but the remnants get on your hands (easy to get off, though).  </li>
            <li>My wife is a happy with this reasonable priced product and price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good, temporary cover up, though.</li>
            <li>The good thing is that it does cover your grey</li>
            <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Thank you very much.  </li>
            <li>but she didnt really like it...</li>
            <li>Very convenient.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Use it for years.  and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>It works really well in covering gray.  </li>
            <li>thanks</li>
            <li>Overall, I can use this between full hair color.</li>
            <li>I found this product on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website and saw the high rating because of the lowest impact that it could have on your health and the environment.</li>
            <li>highly recommend everyone who needs this product to cover the gray hair</li>
            <li>Price on the high side but</li>
            <li>This is obviously not better than coloring your hair; but if you&#x27;re between color and have a few grays, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li>the product does not cover the gray matching the black ordered, perhaps the product does not know what black is and consider brown a more appropriate need for black hair.</li>
            <li>below standard but could be used for a very temporary fix.</li>
            <li>It is pretty easy to apply, but I have to go over the same grey a few times.</li>
            <li>There a couple of drawbacks:  (1) You can&#x27;t apply too much force when covering your grays because the top of the stick fell off of the first one I used.  </li>
            <li>is the second time I bought this product, the only one that is easy to use and  didn&#x27;t dry out like other brands.&lt;br /&gt;After</li>
            <li>If your hair color doesn&#x27;t match exactly, it will look a little obvious.</li>
            <li>over a years of trying random brands, I luckily found this one, from Amazon we can order the whole box of 6</li>

            <li> i chose the rating due to the quality of the product received by this company.</li>
            <li> it covers the grey, stays on until shampoo, does not make the hair stiff, does not smell and does not make hair looks greasy.</li>
            <li> but when you get to the bottom of the tube, some is inevitably wasted.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed , because this time it is so hard to get the color on my hair, I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s different from the other ones</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed , because this time it is so hard to get the color on my hair, I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s different from the other ones</li>
            <li> This cover gray stick is good for a temporary cover up between colorings.  There a couple of drawbacks:  (1) You can&#x27;t apply too much force when covering your grays because the top of the stick fell off of the first one I used.  (2) If your hair color doesn&#x27;t match exactly, it will look a little obvious. (3) If you touch your hair where you used the stick, it rubs off on your hands.  The color still covers the gray, but the remnants get on your hands (easy to get off, though).  Overall, I think it&#x27;s a good, temporary cover up, though.</li>
            <li> Product works well but when you get to the bottom of the tube, some is inevitably wasted.  Price is great.  Convenience of use is excellent.</li>

            <li> This actually works. It is pretty easy to apply, but I have to go over the same grey a few times. The good is - it covers the grey, stays on until shampoo, does not make the hair stiff, does not smell and does not make hair looks greasy. The bad is - it comes off easier when my hand touches the hair (but can be washed off). Overall, I can use this between full hair color.</li>
            <li> This product is Great !!!&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I bought this product, the only one that is easy to use and  didn&#x27;t dry out like other brands.&lt;br /&gt;After over a years of trying random brands, I luckily found this one, from Amazon we can order the whole box of 6 so it lasts for a while. Fiske Industries, Inc is great too, the package arrived really fast and packed well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend everyone who needs this product to cover the gray hair so don;t have to die it too often which could damage the scalp !</li>
            <li> This is obviously not better than coloring your hair; but if you&#x27;re between color and have a few grays, it works beautifully.</li>
            <li> My wife is a happy with this reasonable priced product and price was reasonable.</li>

            <li> The product is hard and it won&#x27;t color at all, in the past this product was much easier to use</li>
            <li> I bought this for my Mom but she didnt really like it...the color doesn&#x27;t stay for long, you have to reapply every 1-2 hours.</li>
            <li> Prompt delivery. Product works as advertised. Very convenient.&lt;br /&gt;Helps me go longer between coloring my hair. Price on the high side but&lt;br /&gt;its definitely a good buy.</li>
            <li> very good product!! thank you!!</li>
            <li> Works like a charm to cover the gray.</li>
            <li> Works good. Does what its suppose to</li>
            <li> Use it for years.  and fast delivery.  would recommend to others to cover those grey side burns and wiskers.  Careful when you kiss thou it comes off.</li>
            <li> This is a great Product.  It works really well in covering gray.  Thank you very much.  I will be ordering more.</li>
            <li> Wife loves this product.  Will order again.</li>
            <li> i chose the rating due to the quality of the product received by this company. the product does not cover the gray matching the black ordered, perhaps the product does not know what black is and consider brown a more appropriate need for black hair. Could not use the product after ordering 6 bulk order and gave it away to friends thinking what I ordered was a good product. I would not buy again. the product did now work well from this company. thanks</li>
            <li> The good thing is that it does cover your grey but it does not stay on for long and it is not water or sweat proof so be warned.Also you have to put a lot of it on so that it does cover the grey and you have to do this everyday until you purchase another product that will actually stay on. below standard but could be used for a very temporary fix.</li>
