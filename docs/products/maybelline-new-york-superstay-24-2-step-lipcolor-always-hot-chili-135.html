            <li>and this is the greatest lip color.</li>
            <li>Good Choice!</li>
            <li>A beautiful shade, and while it was drying.</li>
            <li>And wearing it without the lip balm is great, too - the lip color dries to a beautiful matte finish.</li>
            <li>and when I got home a 4:00pm it still looked great.</li>
            <li>This is a great product and I will be using it from now on.</li>
            <li>It does stay on, the color is great and the gloss refreshes it throughout the day, if I want to.</li>
            <li>So make sure you like the color, because it&#x27;s not coming off!!</li>
            <li>I really love this!!</li>
            <li>This shade (always hot chili ) is a shade i will keep purchasing , it matches my NC 35 complexion perfectly and accenuates my brown eyes and olive skin beautifully ..</li>
            <li>I really loved it.  </li>
            <li>I try others, but have never found a long-lasting one as good.</li>
            <li>Satying power is quite good too..great buy.</li>
            <li>Looks good for a night out, date, dinner etc.</li>
            <li>Seems like they have discontinued some really good colors.  </li>
            <li>I received 4 free tubes as a Bzz Agent, and will purchase more when they are through!!!</li>

            <li>I put it on and was able to eat, drink (through a straw!), and go about my day.</li>
            <li>Of course the Forever Chestnut looked like it was made just for me and was perfect for my complection, so I tried it first.</li>
            <li>I love this lip color!  </li>
            <li>I love this lip color!</li>
            <li>Try it - you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li>The lip balm adds amazing shine.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s light and feels great.</li>
            <li>I believe the color I use is a Rose color.</li>
            <li>but it own</li>
            <li>I received a package of 4 samples in the shades of Forever Chestnut, Timeless Rose, Wear On Wildberry and Everlasting Wine to sample.</li>
            <li>I received this product as a BzzAgent (which means that I try products with no strings attached and give my honest, unbiased, and unembellished opinions)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I loved all the colors and will be buying more.</li>
            <li>and I will be honest here and say I can use a tube of that brand for YEARS as I have tubes of it in every purse and every vehicle....</li>
            <li>I received a free sample from BzzAgent and I can honestly say I never knew lipstick was supposed to (or could!)</li>
            <li>Originally I purchased \\&quot;Berry Persistent\\&quot; and I really liked it!</li>
            <li>The colors I liked most were \\&quot;Timeless Rose\\&quot; and \\&quot;Wear on Wildberry.\\</li>
            <li>and they love it.</li>
            <li>After you put on the lip balm part your lips feel amazingly refreshing...    </li>
            <li>We both love it.</li>
            <li>I love that it lasts throughout the day without reapplying a dozen times.</li>
            <li>I have 5 children, 3 stepchildren and 17 grandchildren, 12 are girls and 6 of those are teenagers we all love LOVE MAYEBELLINE SUPERSTAY 24.</li>
            <li>Our family buys a lot of makeup and love to share beauty tips with each others.</li>
            <li>As a BuzzAgent, I was able to try this product.</li>
            <li>I put it on before work &amp; don&#x27;t have to put more on all day.  </li>
            <li>This is the best lasting lip color that works with any skin tone.  </li>
            <li>I have a preference for the darker colors becausr thry work better with my complexion, so I tried the darkest sample, \\&quot;Everlasting Wine\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li>Most times I have to settle for a brown or plum.</li>
            <li>Love  the Color</li>
            <li>And the colors are fantastic!</li>
            <li>My favorite lip color and brand.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d love to find the \\&quot;Berry</li>
            <li>Love the color.  </li>
            <li>Love this lipstick for stay power.</li>
            <li>My favorite lipstick and color.</li>
            <li>My lipstick looked just as great after dinner as it did when we left the house - and my husband was able to kiss me without worrying about smudging my lipstick!</li>
            <li>I do however think that it is a pretty good product, and lasts for some time.</li>
            <li>This is a great new product.</li>
            <li>, I love this lipstick and how easy to apply it is.   </li>
            <li>By the evening, while there was still a bit of color, if I were going out I would have added more color but for just going to the grocery store or another errand, I would have felt fine about my lip color.</li>
            <li>The best part is, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips!</li>
            <li>MOST IMPORTANTLY:</li>
            <li>The colors are beautiful, it does not dry out my lips, and IT LASTS!</li>
            <li>It does NOT wash off easily, with say soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>You have to wash it off with a strong make up remover</li>
            <li>You put the color on with a special tip brush and let it dry real good</li>
            <li>and I, like many others, received full size lip colors to use and review.</li>
            <li>I am a Bzz Agent and got a free sample from them.</li>
            <li>It is great to actually have a product deliver on what it promoses.</li>
            <li>I received a free sample of Maybeline 24 hour SuperStay Lip Stick as part of being a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li>Overall Impression: This is a great product.</li>
            <li>The lip balm section is nice...feels smooth and does make your lips feel moist.</li>
            <li>I am a BzzAgent and received this for free to test.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it.</li>
            <li>I have to say, I pretty much wear this lipstick every day now, and am loving it!</li>
            <li>I received free samples as a Buzz Agent to try and I have to be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li>You have to let the color dry first and that made me nervous but the moisturizer makes it feel great!</li>
            <li>and I felt like they just made the top layers of my lips peel right off.</li>
            <li>This is one of the better lip colors out right now.</li>
            <li>I got some free samples of this product through Bzz Agent and was really excited to give it a try.</li>
            <li>I was actually excited to receive these samples.</li>
            <li>worth every penny!</li>
            <li>this lipstick is a dream come true.  </li>
            <li>I am also a BuzzAgent and recieved my full size samples in the mail.  </li>
            <li>While I mentioned that the color did begin to fade before 24 hours, it didn&#x27;t fade unevenly in true lipstick fashion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s sold at discount and drug stores for around $9.99 which is a good value when you figure in how long it stays on your lips without having to re-apply.</li>
            <li>the color is easy to apply with the wand, my only problem is that it is more of a lipstain, and dries out your lips after a while.  </li>
            <li>I Love this 24hour lipstick  and gave a few friends some to try and they have fallen in love with it also!</li>
            <li>This product outperforms anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, and is definitely worth paying for.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I have fair skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes and my favorite hue is: Timeless Rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>&quot; They appeared the most natural.</li>
            <li>I still thought it was worth it.</li>
            <li>great everyday color, it stays on all day!</li>
            <li>It does get sticky after application if you don&#x27;t apply the clear gloss stick, but once you go over it with the gloss, everything is fine.</li>
            <li>I did have to reapply the balm once or twice throughout the day, but the color stayed exactly where I wanted it, on my lips.</li>
            <li>when you first apply it.</li>
            <li>It stayed on all day, with me only refreshing the lip gloss portion.</li>
            <li>It actually reminds me more of a lipstick than a gloss.  </li>
            <li>I received free samples of this product as a Buzz Agent, and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t, you will still have color, just not as pretty as you started the day with.  </li>
            <li>Ladies my lipstick usually only lasts say 1 hour at the most and I find myself applying chapstick all the time.</li>
            <li>I love the other 3 shades as well and wear them on special occasion with outfits they match.     </li>
            <li>It is great for long wear lovers, but does not last the whole 24 hours.</li>
            <li>First, let me say that I loved the available colors because as a woman of color it is hard to find lip color that appears natural.</li>
            <li>Love it and have been using a long time</li>
            <li>This was the first time I&#x27;d used the Maybelline SuperStay lip color, and I figured that dinner would be the real test ...   </li>
            <li>Color stays pure all day.</li>
            <li>I recently sampled the SuperStay 24 Color 2-step lipcolor by Maybelline New York and fell in love.</li>
            <li>I do recommend applying chapstick or a gloss on top so that your lips don&#x27;t dry out, but otherwise, it works fantastically!</li>
            <li>So I say thanks to Maybelline</li>
            <li>I really like this lip color.</li>
            <li>Drink a cup a tea and kiss my husband and leave no color on either (which my husband appreciated).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really like gloss</li>
            <li>In fact, I was so ready to not like it</li>
            <li>I received a sample to test and really like this lipcolor..</li>
            <li>It lasts through all the meals (really greasy foods will take some off tho).</li>
            <li>Very Drying.</li>
            <li>Then this morning I went to use the Maybelline again because my lipstick was in my purse instead of my bathroom where I was getting ready</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>BUT since I paid the money for it I thought I&#x27;d use it up and buy new stuff when it ran out and just chalk it up to a lesson learned, but then a funny thing started happening to my lips, it was like they felt severely chapped</li>
            <li>The second thing I liked is that the color really lasted for a long while.</li>
            <li>I tried this product and completely loved the colors, even the really dark red</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t flake, didn&#x27;t bleed, and stayed true to color for an entire 8 hour workday and into my activity-packed</li>
            <li>I was however really surprised by how well this lipstick works, the color really stays put, without fading or feathering!</li>
            <li>I smelled the tube and what was maybe only a month old bottle - two months at most, was completely PUTRID smelling.</li>
            <li>I am a new believer in this product!  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear this color, but a different one that is better for my skin-type, but the way it works is the same.</li>
            <li>but it didn&#x27;t look quite as vibrant.</li>
            <li>First things first, I&#x27;m not a big lip color person.  </li>
            <li>, I am not a lipstick wearer for the main reason that it gets all over the place, cups, etc.  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many products that promise to last, but I have yet to find one that actually did.</li>
            <li>The packaging doesn&#x27;t look that sleek or fancy, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem as nice as the other products available (at least upon first glance).    </li>
            <li>I was excited to try them because they are a long wear lipstick.</li>
            <li>I would buy this lip color the next time I need a good long lasting color.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend wearing this.</li>
            <li>The lip color does stay for the full day and while it looks like the packaging doesn&#x27;t include that much product for the price, you have to remember that one application will basically last you an entire day, and that really shows how affordable and cost-efficient this is.    </li>
            <li>Now as far as the color lasting, I did not think it lasted the full 24 hours</li>
            <li>Maybelline Super Stay 24 Lip Color didn&#x27;t literally last 24 hours for me, BUT it was by far the bast long-lasting lip color that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>This is definitely  my new lipstick of choice.</li>
            <li>I bought it in Always Hot Chili 135 expecting a nice deep berry color like in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually like a brown with a little purple in it</li>
            <li>I was initially very surprised to find that the lip color is not a lip gloss, but a liquid color that dries and stays put.  </li>
            <li>Exactly like what you&#x27;d buy at Walmart or CVS - only cheaper !  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this color in the stores and it remained consistently the same color.</li>
            <li>Although this lipstick may not last a full 24 hours, it sure does the trick for at least the work day!</li>
            <li>Upon the first application, I felt that the product really dried out my lips, but I remembered from the Bzzguide video that you could slather on as much of the balm as you wanted, and that really helped to moisturize my lips.      </li>
            <li>I love how long the color stays and how the moisturizing balm really helps to keep my lips from getting dried out.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s hard to find at the store, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it.</li>
            <li>The step two is to apply the clear shiny overcoat.....</li>
            <li>I have never had to reapply the color, but have put this clear moisturizer on a couple of times throughout the day.  </li>
            <li>It lasted from that morning until I went to be late that night without me putting any more on.</li>
            <li>After that, it felt completely weightless.  </li>
            <li>Everyone should at least try it, I beleive they will love it.</li>
            <li>I had been looking for a long lasting lip color, so I was very interested in trying this product.  </li>
            <li>You put the color stain on first wait about a minute for it to dry then apply the gloss.</li>
            <li>the differents shades are very pretty and the color does last a long time.  </li>
            <li>Not only does it barely last a couple hours, it comes off in pieces making your lips look funny midway through the day.</li>
            <li>This product really does stay on a long time and wont come off in places you dont want it to- even when you brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li>First Impressions: When I received the products in the mail, I immediately tried it out and decided to wear the pink color (there were 4 given to me to try) to a dinner out with friends.  </li>
            <li>It stays all day long even when wearing a neck gater (which normally will cause just about anything to rub off), and still have lip color for apres ski!</li>
            <li>Actually I would buy it whenever I need a new lip color.</li>
            <li>The only thing you need to re-apply is the second coat which is much like lip-balm.</li>
            <li>It was extremely uncomfortable but once you put the moisture on it feels amazing..</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even use the clear gloss throughout the day (as is recommended) because I am very low maintenance.  </li>
            <li>It really did last all day long, and didn&#x27;t come off.  </li>
            <li>This one, so far, has been different.</li>
            <li>Ever since I tried this lipstick I dont think I can go back to my old lipstick at all</li>
            <li>I have to put it on a few times a day, but it&#x27;s better than the average lip stick</li>
            <li>First you apply the color, and make sure you don&#x27;t make mistakes, as once this cures or becomes sticky - very difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li>The only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s pretty sticky, so be forewarned!</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t dry out my lips too much like other brands, and you can use any lip gloss to keep your lips moist without the color coming off.  </li>

            <li> I received this product as a BzzAgent (which means that I try products with no strings attached and give my honest, unbiased, and unembellished opinions)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I loved all the colors and will be buying more.</li>
            <li> and I will be honest here and say I can use a tube of that brand for YEARS as I have tubes of it in every purse and every vehicle....</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from BzzAgent and I can honestly say I never knew lipstick was supposed to (or could!)</li>
            <li> Originally I purchased \\&quot;Berry Persistent\\&quot; and I really liked it!</li>
            <li> The colors I liked most were \\&quot;Timeless Rose\\&quot; and \\&quot;Wear on Wildberry.\\</li>
            <li> and they love it.</li>
            <li> After you put on the lip balm part your lips feel amazingly refreshing...    </li>
            <li> We both love it.</li>
            <li> I love that it lasts throughout the day without reapplying a dozen times.</li>
            <li> I have 5 children, 3 stepchildren and 17 grandchildren, 12 are girls and 6 of those are teenagers we all love LOVE MAYEBELLINE SUPERSTAY 24.</li>
            <li> Our family buys a lot of makeup and love to share beauty tips with each others.</li>
            <li> As a BuzzAgent, I was able to try this product.</li>
            <li> I put it on before work &amp; don&#x27;t have to put more on all day.  </li>
            <li> This is the best lasting lip color that works with any skin tone.  </li>
            <li> I have a preference for the darker colors becausr thry work better with my complexion, so I tried the darkest sample, \\&quot;Everlasting Wine\\&quot;.  </li>
            <li> Most times I have to settle for a brown or plum.</li>
            <li> Love  the Color</li>
            <li> And the colors are fantastic!</li>
            <li> My favorite lip color and brand.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d love to find the \\&quot;Berry</li>
            <li> Love the color.  </li>
            <li> Love this lipstick for stay power.</li>
            <li> My favorite lipstick and color.</li>
            <li> My lipstick looked just as great after dinner as it did when we left the house - and my husband was able to kiss me without worrying about smudging my lipstick!</li>
            <li> I do however think that it is a pretty good product, and lasts for some time.</li>
            <li> This is a great new product.</li>
            <li> , I love this lipstick and how easy to apply it is.   </li>
            <li> By the evening, while there was still a bit of color, if I were going out I would have added more color but for just going to the grocery store or another errand, I would have felt fine about my lip color.</li>
            <li> The best part is, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips!</li>
            <li> MOST IMPORTANTLY:</li>
            <li> The colors are beautiful, it does not dry out my lips, and IT LASTS!</li>
            <li> It does NOT wash off easily, with say soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You have to wash it off with a strong make up remover</li>
            <li> You put the color on with a special tip brush and let it dry real good</li>
            <li> and I, like many others, received full size lip colors to use and review.</li>
            <li> I am a Bzz Agent and got a free sample from them.</li>
            <li> It is great to actually have a product deliver on what it promoses.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Maybeline 24 hour SuperStay Lip Stick as part of being a BzzAgent.  </li>
            <li> Overall Impression: This is a great product.</li>
            <li> The lip balm section is nice...feels smooth and does make your lips feel moist.</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and received this for free to test.</li>
            <li> Enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I have to say, I pretty much wear this lipstick every day now, and am loving it!</li>
            <li> I received free samples as a Buzz Agent to try and I have to be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much.</li>
            <li> You have to let the color dry first and that made me nervous but the moisturizer makes it feel great!</li>
            <li> and I felt like they just made the top layers of my lips peel right off.</li>
            <li> This is one of the better lip colors out right now.</li>
            <li> I got some free samples of this product through Bzz Agent and was really excited to give it a try.</li>
            <li> I was actually excited to receive these samples.</li>
            <li> worth every penny!</li>
            <li> this lipstick is a dream come true.  </li>
            <li> I am also a BuzzAgent and recieved my full size samples in the mail.  </li>
            <li> While I mentioned that the color did begin to fade before 24 hours, it didn&#x27;t fade unevenly in true lipstick fashion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s sold at discount and drug stores for around $9.99 which is a good value when you figure in how long it stays on your lips without having to re-apply.</li>
            <li> the color is easy to apply with the wand, my only problem is that it is more of a lipstain, and dries out your lips after a while.  </li>
            <li> I Love this 24hour lipstick  and gave a few friends some to try and they have fallen in love with it also!</li>
            <li> This product outperforms anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, and is definitely worth paying for.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I have fair skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes and my favorite hue is: Timeless Rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> &quot; They appeared the most natural.</li>
            <li> I still thought it was worth it.</li>
            <li> great everyday color, it stays on all day!</li>
            <li> It does get sticky after application if you don&#x27;t apply the clear gloss stick, but once you go over it with the gloss, everything is fine.</li>
            <li> I did have to reapply the balm once or twice throughout the day, but the color stayed exactly where I wanted it, on my lips.</li>
            <li> when you first apply it.</li>
            <li> It stayed on all day, with me only refreshing the lip gloss portion.</li>
            <li> It actually reminds me more of a lipstick than a gloss.  </li>
            <li> I received free samples of this product as a Buzz Agent, and was pleasantly surprised.  </li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t, you will still have color, just not as pretty as you started the day with.  </li>
            <li> Ladies my lipstick usually only lasts say 1 hour at the most and I find myself applying chapstick all the time.</li>
            <li> I love the other 3 shades as well and wear them on special occasion with outfits they match.     </li>
            <li> It is great for long wear lovers, but does not last the whole 24 hours.</li>
            <li> First, let me say that I loved the available colors because as a woman of color it is hard to find lip color that appears natural.</li>
            <li> Love it and have been using a long time</li>
            <li> This was the first time I&#x27;d used the Maybelline SuperStay lip color, and I figured that dinner would be the real test ...   </li>
            <li> Color stays pure all day.</li>
            <li> I recently sampled the SuperStay 24 Color 2-step lipcolor by Maybelline New York and fell in love.</li>
            <li> I do recommend applying chapstick or a gloss on top so that your lips don&#x27;t dry out, but otherwise, it works fantastically!</li>
            <li> So I say thanks to Maybelline</li>
            <li> I really like this lip color.</li>
            <li> Drink a cup a tea and kiss my husband and leave no color on either (which my husband appreciated).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t really like gloss</li>
            <li> In fact, I was so ready to not like it</li>
            <li> I received a sample to test and really like this lipcolor..</li>
            <li> It lasts through all the meals (really greasy foods will take some off tho).</li>
            <li> Very Drying.</li>
            <li> Then this morning I went to use the Maybelline again because my lipstick was in my purse instead of my bathroom where I was getting ready</li>
            <li> Thanks</li>
            <li> BUT since I paid the money for it I thought I&#x27;d use it up and buy new stuff when it ran out and just chalk it up to a lesson learned, but then a funny thing started happening to my lips, it was like they felt severely chapped</li>
            <li> The second thing I liked is that the color really lasted for a long while.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and completely loved the colors, even the really dark red</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t flake, didn&#x27;t bleed, and stayed true to color for an entire 8 hour workday and into my activity-packed</li>
            <li> I was however really surprised by how well this lipstick works, the color really stays put, without fading or feathering!</li>
            <li> I smelled the tube and what was maybe only a month old bottle - two months at most, was completely PUTRID smelling.</li>
            <li> I am a new believer in this product!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear this color, but a different one that is better for my skin-type, but the way it works is the same.</li>
            <li> but it didn&#x27;t look quite as vibrant.</li>
            <li> First things first, I&#x27;m not a big lip color person.  </li>
            <li> , I am not a lipstick wearer for the main reason that it gets all over the place, cups, etc.  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many products that promise to last, but I have yet to find one that actually did.</li>
            <li> The packaging doesn&#x27;t look that sleek or fancy, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem as nice as the other products available (at least upon first glance).    </li>
            <li> I was excited to try them because they are a long wear lipstick.</li>
            <li> I would buy this lip color the next time I need a good long lasting color.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend wearing this.</li>
            <li> The lip color does stay for the full day and while it looks like the packaging doesn&#x27;t include that much product for the price, you have to remember that one application will basically last you an entire day, and that really shows how affordable and cost-efficient this is.    </li>
            <li> Now as far as the color lasting, I did not think it lasted the full 24 hours</li>
            <li> Maybelline Super Stay 24 Lip Color didn&#x27;t literally last 24 hours for me, BUT it was by far the bast long-lasting lip color that I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> This is definitely  my new lipstick of choice.</li>
            <li> I bought it in Always Hot Chili 135 expecting a nice deep berry color like in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually like a brown with a little purple in it</li>
            <li> I was initially very surprised to find that the lip color is not a lip gloss, but a liquid color that dries and stays put.  </li>
            <li> Exactly like what you&#x27;d buy at Walmart or CVS - only cheaper !  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this color in the stores and it remained consistently the same color.</li>
            <li> Although this lipstick may not last a full 24 hours, it sure does the trick for at least the work day!</li>
            <li> Upon the first application, I felt that the product really dried out my lips, but I remembered from the Bzzguide video that you could slather on as much of the balm as you wanted, and that really helped to moisturize my lips.      </li>
            <li> I love how long the color stays and how the moisturizing balm really helps to keep my lips from getting dried out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard to find at the store, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it.</li>
            <li> The step two is to apply the clear shiny overcoat.....</li>
            <li> I have never had to reapply the color, but have put this clear moisturizer on a couple of times throughout the day.  </li>
            <li> It lasted from that morning until I went to be late that night without me putting any more on.</li>
            <li> After that, it felt completely weightless.  </li>
            <li> Everyone should at least try it, I beleive they will love it.</li>
            <li> I had been looking for a long lasting lip color, so I was very interested in trying this product.  </li>
            <li> You put the color stain on first wait about a minute for it to dry then apply the gloss.</li>
            <li> the differents shades are very pretty and the color does last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Not only does it barely last a couple hours, it comes off in pieces making your lips look funny midway through the day.</li>
            <li> This product really does stay on a long time and wont come off in places you dont want it to- even when you brush your teeth.  </li>
            <li> First Impressions: When I received the products in the mail, I immediately tried it out and decided to wear the pink color (there were 4 given to me to try) to a dinner out with friends.  </li>
            <li> It stays all day long even when wearing a neck gater (which normally will cause just about anything to rub off), and still have lip color for apres ski!</li>
            <li> Actually I would buy it whenever I need a new lip color.</li>
            <li> The only thing you need to re-apply is the second coat which is much like lip-balm.</li>
            <li> It was extremely uncomfortable but once you put the moisture on it feels amazing..</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even use the clear gloss throughout the day (as is recommended) because I am very low maintenance.  </li>
            <li> It really did last all day long, and didn&#x27;t come off.  </li>
            <li> This one, so far, has been different.</li>
            <li> Ever since I tried this lipstick I dont think I can go back to my old lipstick at all</li>
            <li> I have to put it on a few times a day, but it&#x27;s better than the average lip stick</li>
            <li> First you apply the color, and make sure you don&#x27;t make mistakes, as once this cures or becomes sticky - very difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> The only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s pretty sticky, so be forewarned!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t dry out my lips too much like other brands, and you can use any lip gloss to keep your lips moist without the color coming off.  </li>
            <li> At first, the lip color feels very dry and tight but the instant you add the accompanying lip gloss</li>
            <li> and I rarely branch out past a simple darker pink color.    </li>
            <li> The first time I used it, it stayed on only a few hours (still longer than any other).  </li>
            <li> would highly recommend this lip color (even if you&#x27;re not a huge fan of lipstick).</li>
            <li> think Maybelline was on the right track when they made this product, but to me, it still has a serious flaw.</li>
            <li> last this long.</li>
            <li> I have always tried products but they seem to not last a long time.</li>
            <li> My husband &amp; I went out for a romantic dinner this past week, and of course, I went all out - new outfit, hair done, makeup, even perfume &amp; extra jewellery.</li>
            <li> I will say that this does stay on for a very long time, although not 24 hours, but long enough for a night out and still there after waking up the next day.</li>
            <li> But, I will probably buy a different color, maybe a pink or a red, just because I like the formula and how long it last.</li>
            <li> So, I tried it out and after applying the 2nd step I waited, and waited, and waited for it to dry out.</li>
            <li> The lipstick stays on all day and is my favorite color, which unfortunately is getting harder and harder to find in local stores these days.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Sadly, this product was not for me, so I will keep on with my search for a long wearing lip stick or lip color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I would say that it is definitely long wearing lip color</li>
            <li> it stays on my lips through meals and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> In its glory, however, is its downfall: be prepared to have this lipstick on for a long time.</li>
            <li> It comes in about 30 different colors, which include eight brown shades, five berry colors, six shades of pink, seven purples, wine and plum colors, and four reds or corals.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had people ask me what my trick is to never reapplying lipstick all day long....</li>
            <li> It did the same thing as the other red.&lt;br /&gt;All</li>
            <li> I read and followed the instructions and for those 2-3 minutes my lips were extremely dry..</li>
            <li> I always had extremely dry lips</li>
            <li> This is a long-lasting lip color that doesn&#x27;t turn dry or roll off your lips.  </li>
            <li> is the lip color, and very dry feeling lips.  </li>
            <li> And I&#x27;ve tried some of the other 2 step long wearing lip colors before</li>
            <li> I would definitly recommend this for someone who doesn&#x27;t have want to drag around a tube so they can reapply throught the day.</li>
            <li> Finally I switched to plain old lipstick for a few days thinking that it was this Maybelline stuff that was drying them out and my lips started healing!!</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical about lipstick that would last all day but was willing to give it a try.</li>
            <li> Less drying than some of the other long wearing lipsticks.</li>
            <li> I have tried the long lasting lip color in the past with mixed, but mostly negative results.</li>
            <li> applied the lip color as directed, and left it on at least 3 minutes as directed, for it to dry.  </li>
            <li> The only thing negative that I would have to say is that it does feel a little dryer than my usual lipstick but for its lasting effect that is only a small flaw.</li>
            <li> I am also a BzzAgent and was originally reluctant to try this product as other longwear lipsticks had been disappointing due to excessive dryness.</li>
            <li> Ordered it off Amazon and the color is off, not as dark and will not stay on as well.  </li>
            <li> Not just the color, which was too dark, but</li>
            <li> The one thing I should mention is that the lip color does feel ... odd ...</li>
            <li> Just using the lip color by itself left my lips feeling very dry, uncomfortable.  </li>
            <li> My lips BURNED like crazy for two weeks straight and NOTHING would help and I have never had any problems with chapped lips.</li>
            <li> It made my lips feel quite heavy until it dried (about 2 minutes).</li>
            <li> This is my go to lipstick and wear everyday.</li>
            <li> I even went to my local CVS, and compared it to the other long wearing lip colors and decided to hate it.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s really kinda ugly.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;m not sure if its just how my lips are or if it does this for everyone</li>
            <li> so she never washes it of when she does to sleep because then she is usually on an airplane..</li>
            <li> I got samples of this product from BuzzAgent recently, and I must say, I was skeptical.</li>
            <li> The lipcolor is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t apply too thick or heavy.</li>
            <li> I usually buy a covergirl brand</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it would actually last 24 hours, as I&#x27;m very fearful about leaving makeup on my skin for that long, but it does last.</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a lipstick that I like.</li>
            <li> I get tired of putting it on over and over.</li>
            <li> Sadly, it did not meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Then you add the lip balm over the lip color, which then does make your lips feel moisturized, but sadly the lip balm does not stay on your lips for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I started using Blistex and Carmax and Chapstick over the color to try and fix what I thought were really bad chapped lips.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve NEVER had it smell like it had gone bad.</li>
            <li> You will NOT be disappointed.    </li>
            <li> this stuff will make your lips SICK!</li>
            <li> Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Then I bought \\&quot;Keep up the Flame\\&quot; and I hated it!!</li>
            <li> It cracks and flakes terribly.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I recieved this lipcolor as a sample from BzzAgent, and absolutely love the way it works! I don&#x27;t wear this color, but a different one that is better for my skin-type, but the way it works is the same. I believe the color I use is a Rose color. Once you put the color on and then apply the conditioner that is in the same tube, it lasts forever! I do recommend applying chapstick or a gloss on top so that your lips don&#x27;t dry out, but otherwise, it works fantastically!</li>
            <li> I was sent 4 samples of this product to test as a Bzz Agent, where from time to time I have been sent products to test and give my opinion on, as well as sharing coupons or samples with others.  I had been looking for a long lasting lip color, so I was very interested in trying this product.  Sadly, it did not meet my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied the lip color as directed, and left it on at least 3 minutes as directed, for it to dry.  Just using the lip color by itself left my lips feeling very dry, uncomfortable.  Then you add the lip balm over the lip color, which then does make your lips feel moisturized, but sadly the lip balm does not stay on your lips for long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What you are left with is the lip color, and very dry feeling lips.  If you are going to have to keep applying the lip balm, you might as well just have to keep applying lipstick, or whatever it is you put on your lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when the lip color starts to come off, it comes off in spots, so it leaves your lips looking wierd anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will also need a makeup remover product to remove all of the remaining lip color.  It does NOT wash off easily, with say soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadly, this product was not for me, so I will keep on with my search for a long wearing lip stick or lip color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Maybelline was on the right track when they made this product, but to me, it still has a serious flaw.</li>
            <li> I am a Bzz Agent and got a free sample from them. I was a little skeptical about lipstick that would last all day but was willing to give it a try. I used thie product on my wedding day because I didn&#x27;t want to be bottored with reapplying my lipstick seveeral times during the day. Well to lmy surprise I didn&#x27;t have to. It lasted from that morning until I went to be late that night without me putting any more on. So I say thanks to Maybelline I had a wonder ful wedding without worryingabout lipstick.</li>
            <li> I too am a Bzzzagent and receive 4 samples to try.  I am a chapstick girl and had almost sworn off lipstick because it ends up everywhere except on my lips. So, I tried it out and after applying the 2nd step I waited, and waited, and waited for it to dry out. I did have to reapply the balm once or twice throughout the day, but the color stayed exactly where I wanted it, on my lips. Not my glass, or my teeth, or my daughter&#x27;s cheek. It didn&#x27;t last 24 hours, but it lasted all day, and that is a winner in my book!</li>
            <li> I have a hard time finding a lipstick that I like. I get tired of putting it on over and over. Let&#x27;s face it, chapstick is easier! And I&#x27;ve tried some of the other 2 step long wearing lip colors before and I felt like they just made the top layers of my lips peel right off. So when I got an invite from Bzzagent to try Maybelline SuperStay, I was leery but decided to give it a try. You have to let the color dry first and that made me nervous but the moisturizer makes it feel great! And it stays put, doesn&#x27;t come off on napkins or glasses and my son even asked me why I had lipstick on the next morning at breakfast! I even tried using chapstick instead of the moisturizing coat to see what happens when that runs out. It still didn&#x27;t bleed onto anything. I have been very impressed and would really recommend this!</li>
            <li> Speaking from someone who applies lipstick in the morning and it is off by the time I arrive at work thirty minutes later...this lipstick is a dream come true.  The first time I used it, it stayed on only a few hours (still longer than any other).  Each day I wore the lipstick, the length of time it lasts has grown.  I don&#x27;t even use the clear gloss throughout the day (as is recommended) because I am very low maintenance.  I am a new believer in this product!  I received 4 free tubes as a Bzz Agent, and will purchase more when they are through!!!</li>
            <li> I recently received samples of this product to review from bzzagent. I really like this lip color. It is the only lip color that I have tried that actually lasts. You put the color stain on first wait about a minute for it to dry then apply the gloss. I applied it in the morning about 9:00am and when I got home a 4:00pm it still looked great. The only thing negative that I would have to say is that it does feel a little dryer than my usual lipstick but for its lasting effect that is only a small flaw. This is the only lip color I use now.</li>
            <li> I was sent four samples from BzzAgent to try. I read and followed the instructions and for those 2-3 minutes my lips were extremely dry.. It was extremely uncomfortable but once you put the moisture on it feels amazing.. yes the lip moisture doesn&#x27;t last all day but its not like you have to find a mirror to reapply it.. I used it for a couple off days and then I started to realize the moisture is now staying longer on and that after the 2-3 minuets that you but it own it isn&#x27;t that unbearable.. I always had extremely dry lips but I&#x27;m not sure if its just how my lips are or if it does this for everyone but my lips started to hold onto moisture longer and I started to stop carrying lip balm everywhere I went. I gave my sister and her foster moms each a color and they love it. Pamela one of her mom&#x27;s works for the aids foundation and is constantly flying around the globe.. so she never washes it of when she does to sleep because then she is usually on an airplane.. so I have it works..    Pros:   Last&#x27;s for 24 hours and sometimes longer..  After you put on the lip balm part your lips feel amazingly refreshing...    Cons:  You have to wash it off with a strong make up remover</li>
            <li> This is one of the better lip colors out right now.The colors lasts without having to do touchups through out the day.It is great to actually have a product deliver on what it promoses.My daughter and my girlfriend also thought this lip color was a bargain and also that it does what it promises to do.I would buy this lip color the next time I need a good long lasting color.Actually I would buy it whenever I need a new lip color.</li>
            <li> Love it and have been using a long time</li>
            <li> I got samples of this product from BuzzAgent recently, and I must say, I was skeptical. Not that I don&#x27;t trust the Maybelline line, but 24hour lip color?!?!  My husband &amp; I went out for a romantic dinner this past week, and of course, I went all out - new outfit, hair done, makeup, even perfume &amp; extra jewellery. This was the first time I&#x27;d used the Maybelline SuperStay lip color, and I figured that dinner would be the real test ...   I was amazed. My lipstick looked just as great after dinner as it did when we left the house - and my husband was able to kiss me without worrying about smudging my lipstick! I even double-checked my wine glass throughout dinner - no lipstick marks!  This product outperforms anything I&#x27;ve ever tried, and is definitely worth paying for. You will NOT be disappointed.    The one thing I should mention is that the lip color does feel ... odd ... when you first apply it. It made my lips feel quite heavy until it dried (about 2 minutes). After that, it felt completely weightless.  And wearing it without the lip balm is great, too - the lip color dries to a beautiful matte finish. The lip balm adds amazing shine.</li>
            <li> I got some free samples of this product through Bzz Agent and was really excited to give it a try. I would say that it is definitely long wearing lip color but I have to say that I think calling it 24 hour lip color is a stretch. I put it on in the morning. At first, the lip color feels very dry and tight but the instant you add the accompanying lip gloss, it&#x27;s light and feels great. I don&#x27;t find the gloss to be too glossy either, despite what the commercial shows. I was able to eat breakfast and it stayed put! Drink a cup a tea and kiss my husband and leave no color on either (which my husband appreciated). It stayed on all day, with me only refreshing the lip gloss portion. By the time I got home, I definitely still had color but it didn&#x27;t look quite as vibrant. By the evening, while there was still a bit of color, if I were going out I would have added more color but for just going to the grocery store or another errand, I would have felt fine about my lip color. So for a night on the town, this would be perfect! You could put it on and forget about it. That is awesome!</li>
            <li> I tried SuperStay 24 lipstain and also gave some to my youngest daughter. We both love it. I doubt I will ever use regular lipstick again. I love that it lasts throughout the day without reapplying a dozen times. It has a shades that will inhance any skin tone or preference. I have 5 children, 3 stepchildren and 17 grandchildren, 12 are girls and 6 of those are teenagers we all love LOVE MAYEBELLINE SUPERSTAY 24. Our family buys a lot of makeup and love to share beauty tips with each others. peace out</li>
            <li> I received a free sample of Maybeline 24 hour SuperStay Lip Stick as part of being a BzzAgent.  I really loved it.  It really did last all day long, and didn&#x27;t come off.  It didn&#x27;t dry out my lips too much like other brands, and you can use any lip gloss to keep your lips moist without the color coming off.  Everyone should at least try it, I beleive they will love it.</li>
            <li> Although this lipstick may not last a full 24 hours, it sure does the trick for at least the work day! I love that I was able to find my perfect shade because of the variety of colors, and have recieved many compliments on my lips. I would purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> First things first, I&#x27;m not a big lip color person.  I don&#x27;t really like gloss and I rarely branch out past a simple darker pink color.    I was given the Maybelline SuperStay 24 hour Lip Color to try as a Bzzagent and I was prepared to not like it.  In fact, I was so ready to not like it I even went to my local CVS, and compared it to the other long wearing lip colors and decided to hate it. The packaging doesn&#x27;t look that sleek or fancy, and it just doesn&#x27;t seem as nice as the other products available (at least upon first glance).    First Impressions: When I received the products in the mail, I immediately tried it out and decided to wear the pink color (there were 4 given to me to try) to a dinner out with friends.  I was initially very surprised to find that the lip color is not a lip gloss, but a liquid color that dries and stays put.  It actually reminds me more of a lipstick than a gloss.  Upon the first application, I felt that the product really dried out my lips, but I remembered from the Bzzguide video that you could slather on as much of the balm as you wanted, and that really helped to moisturize my lips.      Staying Power: The Color stayed on throughout the night.  I don&#x27;t know if it would actually last 24 hours, as I&#x27;m very fearful about leaving makeup on my skin for that long, but it does last. Unless you fervently scrub at it, it will not budge.    Color Selection: There are a ton of colors to choose from with this product, ranging from pinks to browns to reds and violets. The lip color does stay for the full day and while it looks like the packaging doesn&#x27;t include that much product for the price, you have to remember that one application will basically last you an entire day, and that really shows how affordable and cost-efficient this is.    Overall Impression: This is a great product. I love how long the color stays and how the moisturizing balm really helps to keep my lips from getting dried out.</li>
            <li> I received a sample of this product as a buzz agent to try and offer my opinion of. I was actually excited to receive these samples. I have tried the long lasting lip color in the past with mixed, but mostly negative results. This one, so far, has been different. The lipcolor is lightweight and doesn&#x27;t apply too thick or heavy. It also does what it says- it stays on my lips through meals and lasts a long time. It does get sticky after application if you don&#x27;t apply the clear gloss stick, but once you go over it with the gloss, everything is fine. I think I will be using this product regularly and I would definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I received free samples of this product as a Buzz Agent, and was pleasantly surprised.  I have to admit, I am not a lipstick wearer for the main reason that it gets all over the place, cups, etc.  I tried this product and completely loved the colors, even the really dark red that I know I would never had taken the chance on buying myself.  First you apply the color, and make sure you don&#x27;t make mistakes, as once this cures or becomes sticky - very difficult to remove.  The step two is to apply the clear shiny overcoat.....and this is the part that seals the color but also keeps your lips moist throughout the day.  I have never had to reapply the color, but have put this clear moisturizer on a couple of times throughout the day.  I have to say, I pretty much wear this lipstick every day now, and am loving it!</li>
            <li> I received free samples as a Buzz Agent to try and I have to be honest, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I have tried so many products that promise to last, but I have yet to find one that actually did. Until now! I am so impressed with this product I have been telling anyone that will listen all about it. The colors are beautiful, it does not dry out my lips, and IT LASTS! This is definitely  my new lipstick of choice. I went from not bothering to wear lipstick anymore at all, to never leaving home without it. This product is a must have.</li>
            <li> I received a sample to test and really like this lipcolor..the differents shades are very pretty and the color does last a long time.  You can get through your workday without reapplying and I even did a 20 minute workout, and the color was still there.  The lip balm section is nice...feels smooth and does make your lips feel moist.</li>
            <li> I received a free sample from BzzAgent and I can honestly say I never knew lipstick was supposed to (or could!) last this long. Even after TAKING A SHOWER, my lipcolor stayed, maxing out at around 19 hours. In its glory, however, is its downfall: be prepared to have this lipstick on for a long time. So make sure you like the color, because it&#x27;s not coming off!! The only complaint I have is that it&#x27;s pretty sticky, so be forewarned!</li>
            <li> The lipstick stays on all day and is my favorite color, which unfortunately is getting harder and harder to find in local stores these days.</li>
            <li> This is a great new product. I have always tried products but they seem to not last a long time. As a BuzzAgent, I was able to try this product. Let me tell you, I don&#x27;t think I will ever use anything else. It really last! I put it on and was able to eat, drink (through a straw!), and go about my day. I actually had to wash it off at the end of the day! It was still on there! I would definitly recommend this for someone who doesn&#x27;t have want to drag around a tube so they can reapply throught the day. The best part is, it doesn&#x27;t dry out your lips!</li>
            <li> I recently sampled the SuperStay 24 Color 2-step lipcolor by Maybelline New York and fell in love. It is the best ever in longware lipcolor I have ever tried. I received a package of 4 samples in the shades of Forever Chestnut, Timeless Rose, Wear On Wildberry and Everlasting Wine to sample. Of course the Forever Chestnut looked like it was made just for me and was perfect for my complection, so I tried it first. I love the other 3 shades as well and wear them on special occasion with outfits they match.     You put the color on with a special tip brush and let it dry real good and then you apply the lip balm, which you can re-apply the balm as needed. It comes in about 30 different colors, which include eight brown shades, five berry colors, six shades of pink, seven purples, wine and plum colors, and four reds or corals. It&#x27;s sold at discount and drug stores for around $9.99 which is a good value when you figure in how long it stays on your lips without having to re-apply. This is a great product and I will be using it from now on.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest lipstick!</li>
            <li> This is a long-lasting lip color that doesn&#x27;t turn dry or roll off your lips.  It lasts about 12 hours.  There is a bit of fade as the day wears on, but all you need to do is reapply the gloss stick.  If you don&#x27;t, you will still have color, just not as pretty as you started the day with.  I&#x27;ve been using this for several years now.  I try others, but have never found a long-lasting one as good.</li>
            <li> It does stay on, the color is great and the gloss refreshes it throughout the day, if I want to.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product, great color!  Have been using this lipstick for years.  Stayed on all day.....do not have to reapply, even after meals.  Only can get the Chili color on line, but it&#x27;s cheaper than stores.</li>
            <li> I love this lip color!  I put it on before work &amp; don&#x27;t have to put more on all day.  It lasts through all the meals (really greasy foods will take some off tho). The color is perfect for me too. It&#x27;s hard to find at the store, so I&#x27;m glad Amazon has it.</li>
            <li> This is the best lasting lip color that works with any skin tone.  This is my go to lipstick and wear everyday.</li>
            <li> Exactly like what you&#x27;d buy at Walmart or CVS - only cheaper !  I&#x27;m a scuba diver and even 80 feet under water -this stuff stays on.  The only time I fades off is when you&#x27;re eating greasy foods (but so do all over lipsticks). I&#x27;ve had people ask me what my trick is to never reapplying lipstick all day long....no trick...this stuff just works.</li>
            <li> I am also a BuzzAgent and recieved my full size samples in the mail.  I was excited to try them because they are a long wear lipstick. I have a preference for the darker colors becausr thry work better with my complexion, so I tried the darkest sample, \\&quot;Everlasting Wine\\&quot;.  I like the fact that the tube has dual ends, one for the color an one for the balm.  the color is easy to apply with the wand, my only problem is that it is more of a lipstain, and dries out your lips after a while.  Yes you do put on the 2nd step which is the balm, but youwill probably run out of that before the lipstick. I do however think that it is a pretty good product, and lasts for some time.</li>
            <li> I received this product as a BzzAgent (which means that I try products with no strings attached and give my honest, unbiased, and unembellished opinions)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Maybelline Super Stay 24 Lip Color didn&#x27;t literally last 24 hours for me, BUT it was by far the bast long-lasting lip color that I&#x27;ve ever tried. It didn&#x27;t flake, didn&#x27;t bleed, and stayed true to color for an entire 8 hour workday and into my activity-packed evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin, blonde hair, and blue eyes and my favorite hue is: Timeless Rose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this lip color (even if you&#x27;re not a huge fan of lipstick). It truly feels weightless and has no yucky taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OH AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: While I mentioned that the color did begin to fade before 24 hours, it didn&#x27;t fade unevenly in true lipstick fashion. Good Choice!</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and I, like many others, received full size lip colors to use and review. First, let me say that I loved the available colors because as a woman of color it is hard to find lip color that appears natural. Most times I have to settle for a brown or plum. The colors I liked most were \\&quot;Timeless Rose\\&quot; and \\&quot;Wear on Wildberry.\\&quot; They appeared the most natural. The second thing I liked is that the color really lasted for a long while. It was my anniversary and it lasted 7 hours through kissing, drinking wine, and eating dinner. The only problem I had was that Maybelline promises that it will not feather. After 7 hours it did feather. Now as far as the color lasting, I did not think it lasted the full 24 hours but my husband commented the next morning that the color was still visible on my lips!!!!</li>
            <li> I am a BzzAgent and received this for free to test. I will say that this does stay on for a very long time, although not 24 hours, but long enough for a night out and still there after waking up the next day. It&#x27;s not all on the next day, but I did not have to reapply during my nite out. I really love this!! worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I love this lip stain!!!! Like several others, I got four samples to try as a Bzzz Agent. I loved all the colors and will be buying more. As for lasting - it does. I ski and this is the greatest lip color. I put it on in the morning. It stays all day long even when wearing a neck gater (which normally will cause just about anything to rub off), and still have lip color for apres ski! The only thing you need to re-apply is the second coat which is much like lip-balm.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this color in the stores and it remained consistently the same color. Ordered it off Amazon and the color is off, not as dark and will not stay on as well.  Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> I love this lip color! I have to put it on a few times a day, but it&#x27;s better than the average lip stick</li>
            <li> Love  the Color it complements my hair and coloring, the lipstick stays on as advertised. I will buy this product again.</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo1XDQK46CNCIMT]]I recently received this product from Bzzagent.com. This is my Youtube review of this product. It is great for long wear lovers, but does not last the whole 24 hours.</li>
            <li> Ladies my lipstick usually only lasts say 1 hour at the most and I find myself applying chapstick all the time. Ever since I tried this lipstick I dont think I can go back to my old lipstick at all, I love this lipstick and how easy to apply it is.   This product really does stay on a long time and wont come off in places you dont want it to- even when you brush your teeth.  I highly recommend wearing this. I Love this 24hour lipstick  and gave a few friends some to try and they have fallen in love with it also! Enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I am also a BzzAgent and was originally reluctant to try this product as other longwear lipsticks had been disappointing due to excessive dryness. I was however really surprised by how well this lipstick works, the color really stays put, without fading or feathering! And the colors are fantastic! Try it - you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
            <li> My favorite lip color and brand.</li>
            <li> great everyday color, it stays on all day!</li>
            <li> I have this in three colors. Originally I purchased \\&quot;Berry Persistent\\&quot; and I really liked it! A beautiful shade, and while it was drying. Very Drying. I still thought it was worth it. Then I bought \\&quot;Keep up the Flame\\&quot; and I hated it!! Not just the color, which was too dark, but it wore completely differently. It cracks and flakes terribly. So I bought \\&quot;All Day Cherry\\&quot; in hopes to find a red that wore like the berry color I had purchased. It did the same thing as the other red.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, even the one that didn&#x27;t flake, they were just too drying and wrecked my lips. It is not for me. I&#x27;d love to find the \\&quot;Berry Persistent\\&quot; color in a different product!</li>
            <li> This shade (always hot chili ) is a shade i will keep purchasing , it matches my NC 35 complexion perfectly and accenuates my brown eyes and olive skin beautifully .. Satying power is quite good too..great buy.</li>
            <li> This lipcolor stays on as advertised.  However, it did stain my teeth which I can still see so I&#x27;ll not be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> Stays on as promised. Color stays pure all day. Less drying than some of the other long wearing lipsticks.</li>
            <li> Looks good for a night out, date, dinner etc.</li>
            <li> I am NOT a fan of this at all. Not only does it barely last a couple hours, it comes off in pieces making your lips look funny midway through the day. It dries out your lips also. BUT since I paid the money for it I thought I&#x27;d use it up and buy new stuff when it ran out and just chalk it up to a lesson learned, but then a funny thing started happening to my lips, it was like they felt severely chapped but without like cracks or anything. I started using Blistex and Carmax and Chapstick over the color to try and fix what I thought were really bad chapped lips. My lips BURNED like crazy for two weeks straight and NOTHING would help and I have never had any problems with chapped lips. Finally I switched to plain old lipstick for a few days thinking that it was this Maybelline stuff that was drying them out and my lips started healing!! Then this morning I went to use the Maybelline again because my lipstick was in my purse instead of my bathroom where I was getting ready and I was in a hurry. After applying to one lip I could smell a PUTRID smell....I smelled the tube and what was maybe only a month old bottle - two months at most, was completely PUTRID smelling. It smelled like it had gone RANCID. NEVER AGAIN will I buy this stuff. I usually buy a covergirl brand but they were out of my color so that&#x27;s why I tried the Maybelline stuff and I will be honest here and say I can use a tube of that brand for YEARS as I have tubes of it in every purse and every vehicle....you know, they get lost and you find one and it&#x27;s still got a bunch left so I use it and I&#x27;ve NEVER had it smell like it had gone bad. No wonder my lips were burned from this junk. BUYERS BEWARE this stuff will make your lips SICK!</li>
            <li> It literally will last forever until you physically wash it off.&lt;br /&gt;But the color was nothing like the picture. I bought it in Always Hot Chili 135 expecting a nice deep berry color like in the picture, but it&#x27;s actually like a brown with a little purple in it, it&#x27;s really kinda ugly. But, I will probably buy a different color, maybe a pink or a red, just because I like the formula and how long it last.</li>
            <li> Love the color.  Seems like they have discontinued some really good colors.  Love this lipstick for stay power.</li>
            <li> My favorite lipstick and color. It survives trips to the dentist, dinner, kisses. I won&#x27;t use another brand.</li>
            <li> This color was discontinued. found some here . Thanks</li>
