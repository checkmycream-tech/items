    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Great product!  </li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>I have kept it in the shower and its perfect for me.  </li>
            <li>Good for exfoliation!</li>
            <li>Works great with both bar soap or body wash.  </li>
            <li>The rubber isn&#x27;t even good quality as it discolored after 1-2 uses.</li>
            <li>The price is good for this quality.</li>
            <li>Works great for exfoliation and love the nubby side for massaging in lotion.</li>
            <li>Altho I think it would be a wonderful &amp; healthy routine for anyone, and even great for couples during intimate play/sensation play.&lt;br</li>
            <li>love this good product.</li>
            <li>The &#x27;peg&#x27; bristles just aren&#x27;t as &#x27;strong&#x27; for good body brushing circulation.</li>
            <li>Overall, great product and great price.</li>
            <li>okay.</li>
            <li>Satisfied with results.</li>
            <li>Easily hangs in shower.</li>
            <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t to coarse and the massager works great.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used this dry/massage/cellulite brush twice thus far, all over my body for approx 15 minutes each use, and so far it&#x27;s been wonderful.</li>
            <li>I have had a better one... looked as good, probably should have spent $10 more, but it does work</li>
            <li>This body brush handle is neither too long nor too short, ideal for brushing of abdomen and upper body ;  Boar bristles are the perfect firmness and have remained intact:  </li>
            <li>Great little brush.  </li>
            <li>definitely worth the price--solid construction.</li>
            <li>Love it leaves hair so soft</li>
            <li>I had to completely cut off the handle and just grab it on top.</li>
            <li>The pegs are rubber not wood, so they don&#x27;t apply the right amount of pressure.</li>
            <li>Pretty sturdy brush.</li>
            <li>No shedding on the brush and love the short handle.</li>
            <li>I have used this wet and dry- works great</li>
            <li>Soft bristles (not too hard), great price.  </li>
            <li>originally bought this one because it was free shipping, however, it was a mistake, because I ended up not using it, so I wasted the money.</li>
            <li>Soon, more than half of the bits were off.  </li>
            <li>It is fantastic for dry brushing.  </li>
            <li>the boar bristle brush in my opinion is not necessary but a nice bonus feature (my cat, on the other hand, seems to love it - found him chewing a nub off  a few days ago) .  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve actually been able to use this one consistently for the past 3-4 weeks, the jury is still out on results.  </li>
            <li>The new wooden massager I bought somewhere else has no handle, but a elastic band wrapped on the back of the massager, so you put your hand in the band and grab it, so you can hold it with ease and give the right force on the area where you want to scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li>use light pressure to brush and stroke, in back &amp; forth and small circular motions-</li>
            <li>I won&#x27;t be immersing it in water, just for dry brushing, so I&#x27;m not concerned about mold growth, which would happen with any frequently used bath scrubber made with natural materials.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m able to dry brush for 10-15 minutes at a time without irritating or breaking my skin.  </li>

            <li> recommend this product for daily, light-to-medium pressure, dry brushing &amp; cellulite massage.</li>
            <li> The other side of this brush, the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; side, just didn&#x27;t last.  </li>
            <li> I use it for dry brushing and massaging in cellulite lotion.</li>
            <li> I was surprised how stiff it felt even wet.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other body brushes in the past that nearly ripped my skin off and for that reason I stopped using them before observing any benefit.  </li>
            <li> long handle is very inconvenient, when you grab the long handle, and you just can&#x27;t give the right force on the area where you scrub.</li>
            <li> just a waste of money now I need to buy another one I do not recommend to buy this product</li>
            <li> I use it everyday on my legs and arms.  </li>
            <li> However the massager side is difficult to use because of a long handle.</li>
            <li> I tried using the wooden one side, and the other side is worthless and useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The handle/entire brush frame is made of a lightweight wood, the nubs are wooden(but seem delicate because they are inserted into a squishy rubber base), and the bristles are natural (not sure what material</li>
            <li> And if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough it grew mold after 1 week.</li>
            <li> And it is still hard to use!!!</li>

            <li> smoothes//exfoliates. i use nightly before lotion and noticed immediate improvement in consistency/smoothnees. definitely worth the price--solid construction. definitely recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Great product!  Works great for exfoliation and love the nubby side for massaging in lotion. Works great with both bar soap or body wash.  Sturdy too.</li>
            <li> This body brush handle is neither too long nor too short, ideal for brushing of abdomen and upper body ;  Boar bristles are the perfect firmness and have remained intact:  I&#x27;m able to dry brush for 10-15 minutes at a time without irritating or breaking my skin.  Massage nub brush opposite the boar bristle brush in my opinion is not necessary but a nice bonus feature (my cat, on the other hand, seems to love it - found him chewing a nub off  a few days ago) .  I&#x27;ve tried other body brushes in the past that nearly ripped my skin off and for that reason I stopped using them before observing any benefit.  I&#x27;ve actually been able to use this one consistently for the past 3-4 weeks, the jury is still out on results.  Overall, great product and great price.</li>
            <li> The other side of this brush, the \\&quot;massaging\\&quot; side, just didn&#x27;t last.  Every time I used it, one of the rubber bits would come off.  Soon, more than half of the bits were off.  I threw it away!</li>
            <li> I have used this wet and dry- works great either way- I was surprised how stiff it felt even wet.  I use the massager side after I do my FIR sauna suit and it has a lot of torque and pressure!  Pleasantly surprised</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this dry/massage/cellulite brush twice thus far, all over my body for approx 15 minutes each use, and so far it&#x27;s been wonderful. The bristles and nubs are intact. The handle/entire brush frame is made of a lightweight wood, the nubs are wooden(but seem delicate because they are inserted into a squishy rubber base), and the bristles are natural (not sure what material but it&#x27;s not nylon or plastic).&lt;br /&gt;I use light pressure to brush and stroke, in back &amp; forth and small circular motions- my feet, legs, front &amp; back, hands, arms, and neck. I think if this product was used without care or too aggressively the nubs might not hold up, but it shouldn&#x27;t be used in such a manner anyhow. I won&#x27;t be immersing it in water, just for dry brushing, so I&#x27;m not concerned about mold growth, which would happen with any frequently used bath scrubber made with natural materials.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for daily, light-to-medium pressure, dry brushing &amp; cellulite massage. Altho I think it would be a wonderful &amp; healthy routine for anyone, and even great for couples during intimate play/sensation play.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update my review after some time has passed, as this is only my 2nd day using my massage brush.//UPDATE 7/24/14: Been using the brush on myself 1-2x a week and it&#x27;s still in perfect condition.</li>
            <li> Love it leaves hair so soft</li>
            <li> love this good product.</li>
            <li> I tried using the wooden one side, and the other side is worthless and useless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The long handle is very inconvenient, when you grab the long handle, and you just can&#x27;t give the right force on the area where you scrub. I had to completely cut off the handle and just grab it on top. And it is still hard to use!!! So I gave that thing up, and bought something else. The new wooden massager I bought somewhere else has no handle, but a elastic band wrapped on the back of the massager, so you put your hand in the band and grab it, so you can hold it with ease and give the right force on the area where you want to scrub.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I originally bought this one because it was free shipping, however, it was a mistake, because I ended up not using it, so I wasted the money.</li>
            <li> The pegs are rubber not wood, so they don&#x27;t apply the right amount of pressure. Instead, they bend in all directions. The rubber isn&#x27;t even good quality as it discolored after 1-2 uses. And if that wasn&#x27;t bad enough it grew mold after 1 week. Gross!</li>
            <li> I have had a better one... looked as good, probably should have spent $10 more, but it does work okay. The &#x27;peg&#x27; bristles just aren&#x27;t as &#x27;strong&#x27; for good body brushing circulation.</li>
            <li> Good for exfoliation! However the massager side is difficult to use because of a long handle.</li>
            <li> all the fibers fall off the brush you cant even brush your skin! just a waste of money now I need to buy another one I do not recommend to buy this product</li>
            <li> I so wanted this to work.  The bristles didn&#x27;t last a week. Perhaps if you are disciplined enough to remove it from your shower and leave in the sunlight, the glue won&#x27;t losen the bristles.</li>
            <li> It is fantastic for dry brushing.  I use it everyday on my legs and arms.  The price is good for this quality.</li>
            <li> Soft bristles (not too hard), great price.  Actually works on cellulite.  Satisfied with results. Sturdy construction.  Easily hangs in shower.</li>
            <li> Pretty sturdy brush. I use it for dry brushing and massaging in cellulite lotion. No shedding on the brush and love the short handle.</li>
            <li> Great little brush.  I have kept it in the shower and its perfect for me.  The bristles aren&#x27;t to coarse and the massager works great.  Recommend</li>
