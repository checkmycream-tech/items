            <li>My dad bought these for me as a &#x27;get yourself something nice&#x27; gift and what girl doesn&#x27;t want more makeup brushes??</li>
            <li>, they are extremely soft and very good quality!  </li>
            <li>I would like to have given these brushes a great review but the truth is I have yet to be able to use them as their case and them came to me smelling strongly of chemicals (like paint but sickeningly strong).</li>
            <li>I love them.</li>
            <li>Overall great packaging, good brushes and i</li>

            <li>i think my comment was interesting and helpful for you</li>
            <li>and I just love them.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m so glad I got these.</li>
            <li>and I find these to be better than some of the BareMinerals brushes I have..</li>
            <li>They are so much more prettier than they are online.</li>
            <li>I love the colors I have and the pouch they come in.</li>
            <li>but it was ok</li>
            <li>For the price, these brushes are a great deal and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>/&gt;Again I love these brushes!!!&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I am in love with them..</li>
            <li>Love these Luxe brushes</li>
            <li>the case elegant and cute</li>
            <li>them out even more though.</li>
            <li>They are beautiful in person, and very soft.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was getting myself into when she said she needed new make up brushes but finding these was a great find.</li>
            <li>Now, to be honest, I have no idea what most of these brushes are used for, but the ones I have used are soft and of good quality.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good for the price, I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about a month</li>
            <li>they are so soft and just beautiful</li>
            <li>Beautiful complete set.&lt;br</li>
            <li>very soft brushes, great set.</li>
            <li>These brushes are great for any professional makeup kit.  </li>
            <li>The eye brushes alone have allowed me to make looks I&#x27;ve never been able to do before and the fan brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li>They are soft and the case they come in is very nice.</li>
            <li>They blend makeup easily.</li>
            <li>elegant .. soft .. good quality ..</li>
            <li>Really nice brushes and delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li>Beautiful and super soft</li>
            <li>The brushes do have an odor to them, I bought some brush cleaner and they are perfectly fine.</li>
            <li>After the brushes dried I just rubbed my clean fingers across the top and they look perfect.  </li>
            <li>Easy to clean.</li>
            <li>It was such a great deal‚ù§</li>
            <li>but I still like it to smooth out</li>
            <li>And about the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; to be honest I didn&#x27;t really smell anything.</li>
            <li>I was a little worried, but honestly the quality is amazing!  </li>
            <li>I ordered these around a month ago and, so far, I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li>but once you clean it it&#x27;ll go away ...</li>
            <li>Worth the money, and a great assortment of different brushes for someone just learning, or sunshine in a budget.  </li>
            <li>but I wish they came with more information on what the different kind are and how to use them.  </li>
            <li>Very soft and come in a nice case.</li>
            <li>These brushes are amazing and so soft!</li>
            <li>I love these brushes so much</li>
            <li>These work SOOO good for applying my Naked palettes</li>
            <li>brush come with a transparent protector very neat and elegant</li>
            <li>got received them quickly</li>
            <li>I purchased these for a personal set of brushes, and i love them!  </li>
            <li>And are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li>Great brushes some of them shredded a few hairs</li>
            <li>The eye brushes alone would make this set worth the money.</li>
            <li>Yes... they have a smell but everything fresh off a production line does.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Smell like fresh paint when recieve.</li>
            <li>and they were better quality than I had expected :-)</li>
            <li>Today I received my brushes and so far I love them.</li>
            <li>They are not the absolute best quality brushes out there, but they are WAY better than you would expect them to be for the price!!&lt;br /&gt;I am also very sad to say that I have paid way more for brushes of much lower quality :.(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>other than that...pretty good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li>Very soft brushes and applies makeup with easy.</li>
            <li>Soft but may have a strong smell but worth it.</li>
            <li>I almost didn&#x27;t order these brushes because I didn&#x27;t think a set of 24 brushes that only cost a little over $20 could possibly be good quality (hellooo!!</li>
            <li>But what you will get is a crazy good assortment of good quality makeup brushes.</li>
            <li>Other than that, these are great and soft!</li>
            <li>Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>I tested them a little by pulling the bristles and there was no shedding except in like one of them which is good</li>
            <li>The first time I washed the brushes I had a little bit of fall out from a couple of the biggest brushes but after that there hasn&#x27;t been any!!!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone I have shown these brushes to or used them on has loved them and asked me where I got them and of course I sent them</li>
            <li>the foundation concealer face brushes are not a kabuki like not dense enough to be kabuki but of high quality and nice application touch</li>
            <li>Obviously you&#x27;re not going to get top of the line brushes for $20.</li>
            <li>I suggest washing them first because of the plastic smell.</li>
            <li>They don&#x27;t shed, they are easy to clean and they are soft (but not too soft)</li>
            <li>but i used them today for the first time and</li>
            <li>but, when I got them I was very pleasantly surprised!!!!</li>
            <li>A bit larger than I expected though lol</li>
            <li>, I found that if you let them air out for about 24 hours the smell pretty much goes away.&lt;br</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re super soft.</li>
            <li>+ bristles are super soft.</li>
            <li>And does not shed to much.  </li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed much shedding, which is the problem I encountered with those pricey brushes.</li>
            <li>It looks just like the picture and the case is better quality then expected.</li>
            <li>Absolutely would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li>I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li>Wife really likes them.</li>
            <li>I got it really fast and really well packed.</li>
            <li>Better than I expected!</li>
            <li>The brushes pick up a decent amount of product and blend my powders very well.</li>
            <li>The bristles are very soft, feels like very high quality brushes.</li>
            <li>They seem well made, in fact, better than some higher priced bruses I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend Morphe &amp; Luxie brushes.</li>
            <li>My cousin has high end brushes and she chose to buy these</li>
            <li>They will shed  a little, but after that first wash they are fine.  </li>
            <li>reason why it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because alot of the eye brushes are just flat brushes and not that good for applying eye shadow, they&#x27;re too dense and firm.</li>
            <li>These brushes are very plush, soft and durable.</li>
            <li>The smell is of strong plasticky chemicals, but it does die down once you air it out.</li>
            <li>Because I needed new brushes and 2.</li>
            <li>Just new.</li>
            <li>Very soft</li>
            <li>These makeup brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li>I really recommend just spending a little bit more for specific brushes that you need for your makeup routine or kit.</li>
            <li>And they are amazingly soft!</li>
            <li>soft !</li>
            <li>she really likes them and when mixed in with her high end brushes you can&#x27;t tell the difference</li>
            <li>only complaint I have is that when you first open them the brushes and roll have a pretty strong plasticy smell but</li>
            <li>Well made, very,very soft and none of the bristles come out.  </li>
            <li>Brushes are really really soft.</li>
            <li>and they are so soft.</li>
            <li>Wow is all I can say I was so surprised in the quality and quantity of these brushes .</li>
            <li>They are soft, durable, and don&#x27;t shed during use or wash.</li>
            <li>and soft</li>
            <li>guess I just have to buy additional kabuki set or a beauty blender to complete the set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;arrival</li>
            <li>Good con very soft, bad con sheds a lot at first</li>
            <li>i use them on a daily the only thing i can say is that hair came misshaped but a little wash could fix that (: the brushes are amazing at apply product unlike other brushes that cake it on (:</li>
            <li>/&gt;They are super soft, it didn&#x27;t really shed when I washed them probably like 3 hairs for all the brushes, seriously!</li>
            <li>the is an angled and one flat straight (which I think is a little too large for brows)...</li>
            <li>The factory smell lasted only  about six hours when I aired them out.</li>
            <li>but I expected that with it being new.</li>
            <li>These are comparative to MAC and other high end line tools, including morphe brushes.  </li>

            <li> They are beautiful in person, and very soft.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was getting myself into when she said she needed new make up brushes but finding these was a great find.</li>
            <li> Now, to be honest, I have no idea what most of these brushes are used for, but the ones I have used are soft and of good quality.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price, I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about a month</li>
            <li> they are so soft and just beautiful</li>
            <li> Beautiful complete set.&lt;br</li>
            <li> very soft brushes, great set.</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for any professional makeup kit.  </li>
            <li> The eye brushes alone have allowed me to make looks I&#x27;ve never been able to do before and the fan brushes are fantastic.</li>
            <li> They are soft and the case they come in is very nice.</li>
            <li> They blend makeup easily.</li>
            <li> elegant .. soft .. good quality ..</li>
            <li> Really nice brushes and delivery was very fast.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and super soft</li>
            <li> The brushes do have an odor to them, I bought some brush cleaner and they are perfectly fine.</li>
            <li> After the brushes dried I just rubbed my clean fingers across the top and they look perfect.  </li>
            <li> Easy to clean.</li>
            <li> It was such a great deal‚ù§</li>
            <li> but I still like it to smooth out</li>
            <li> And about the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; to be honest I didn&#x27;t really smell anything.</li>
            <li> I was a little worried, but honestly the quality is amazing!  </li>
            <li> I ordered these around a month ago and, so far, I am very pleased with them.</li>
            <li> but once you clean it it&#x27;ll go away ...</li>
            <li> Worth the money, and a great assortment of different brushes for someone just learning, or sunshine in a budget.  </li>
            <li> but I wish they came with more information on what the different kind are and how to use them.  </li>
            <li> Very soft and come in a nice case.</li>
            <li> These brushes are amazing and so soft!</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so much</li>
            <li> These work SOOO good for applying my Naked palettes</li>
            <li> brush come with a transparent protector very neat and elegant</li>
            <li> got received them quickly</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a personal set of brushes, and i love them!  </li>
            <li> And are exactly what I wanted!</li>
            <li> Great brushes some of them shredded a few hairs</li>
            <li> The eye brushes alone would make this set worth the money.</li>
            <li> Yes... they have a smell but everything fresh off a production line does.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Smell like fresh paint when recieve.</li>
            <li> and they were better quality than I had expected :-)</li>
            <li> Today I received my brushes and so far I love them.</li>
            <li> They are not the absolute best quality brushes out there, but they are WAY better than you would expect them to be for the price!!&lt;br /&gt;I am also very sad to say that I have paid way more for brushes of much lower quality :.(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> other than that...pretty good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> Very soft brushes and applies makeup with easy.</li>
            <li> Soft but may have a strong smell but worth it.</li>
            <li> I almost didn&#x27;t order these brushes because I didn&#x27;t think a set of 24 brushes that only cost a little over $20 could possibly be good quality (hellooo!!</li>
            <li> But what you will get is a crazy good assortment of good quality makeup brushes.</li>
            <li> Other than that, these are great and soft!</li>
            <li> Very fast shipping.  </li>
            <li> I tested them a little by pulling the bristles and there was no shedding except in like one of them which is good</li>
            <li> The first time I washed the brushes I had a little bit of fall out from a couple of the biggest brushes but after that there hasn&#x27;t been any!!!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone I have shown these brushes to or used them on has loved them and asked me where I got them and of course I sent them</li>
            <li> the foundation concealer face brushes are not a kabuki like not dense enough to be kabuki but of high quality and nice application touch</li>
            <li> Obviously you&#x27;re not going to get top of the line brushes for $20.</li>
            <li> I suggest washing them first because of the plastic smell.</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed, they are easy to clean and they are soft (but not too soft)</li>
            <li> but i used them today for the first time and</li>
            <li> but, when I got them I was very pleasantly surprised!!!!</li>
            <li> A bit larger than I expected though lol</li>
            <li> , I found that if you let them air out for about 24 hours the smell pretty much goes away.&lt;br</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft.</li>
            <li> + bristles are super soft.</li>
            <li> And does not shed to much.  </li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed much shedding, which is the problem I encountered with those pricey brushes.</li>
            <li> It looks just like the picture and the case is better quality then expected.</li>
            <li> Absolutely would recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes.</li>
            <li> Wife really likes them.</li>
            <li> I got it really fast and really well packed.</li>
            <li> Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> The brushes pick up a decent amount of product and blend my powders very well.</li>
            <li> The bristles are very soft, feels like very high quality brushes.</li>
            <li> They seem well made, in fact, better than some higher priced bruses I&#x27;ve purchased in the past.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend Morphe &amp; Luxie brushes.</li>
            <li> My cousin has high end brushes and she chose to buy these</li>
            <li> They will shed  a little, but after that first wash they are fine.  </li>
            <li> reason why it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because alot of the eye brushes are just flat brushes and not that good for applying eye shadow, they&#x27;re too dense and firm.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very plush, soft and durable.</li>
            <li> The smell is of strong plasticky chemicals, but it does die down once you air it out.</li>
            <li> Because I needed new brushes and 2.</li>
            <li> Just new.</li>
            <li> Very soft</li>
            <li> These makeup brushes are very soft.</li>
            <li> I really recommend just spending a little bit more for specific brushes that you need for your makeup routine or kit.</li>
            <li> And they are amazingly soft!</li>
            <li> soft !</li>
            <li> she really likes them and when mixed in with her high end brushes you can&#x27;t tell the difference</li>
            <li> only complaint I have is that when you first open them the brushes and roll have a pretty strong plasticy smell but</li>
            <li> Well made, very,very soft and none of the bristles come out.  </li>
            <li> Brushes are really really soft.</li>
            <li> and they are so soft.</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say I was so surprised in the quality and quantity of these brushes .</li>
            <li> They are soft, durable, and don&#x27;t shed during use or wash.</li>
            <li> and soft</li>
            <li> guess I just have to buy additional kabuki set or a beauty blender to complete the set&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;arrival</li>
            <li> Good con very soft, bad con sheds a lot at first</li>
            <li> i use them on a daily the only thing i can say is that hair came misshaped but a little wash could fix that (: the brushes are amazing at apply product unlike other brushes that cake it on (:</li>
            <li> /&gt;They are super soft, it didn&#x27;t really shed when I washed them probably like 3 hairs for all the brushes, seriously!</li>
            <li> the is an angled and one flat straight (which I think is a little too large for brows)...</li>
            <li> The factory smell lasted only  about six hours when I aired them out.</li>
            <li> but I expected that with it being new.</li>
            <li> These are comparative to MAC and other high end line tools, including morphe brushes.  </li>
            <li> I have a few of them, but I had always wished for a high end set that are priced at hundreds of dollars.</li>
            <li> was one move flat straight small brush that I would use for my eyebrows...</li>
            <li> These brushes pick up makeup very well and after a week of having them I can say that they hardly shed.</li>
            <li> I placed them in a container to air dry overnight.  </li>
            <li> They haven&#x27;t broken and seem pretty well made, however on</li>
            <li> I wiped down the white fold over holder</li>
            <li> they pick little product.&lt;br /&gt;1.SMELL - yes they do smell when you open the package but it i not very strong and only after 5 minute you can not even notice it.</li>
            <li> This proves that you do not need an expensive makeup brush for the quality look.  </li>
            <li> They do have a very strong smell but that&#x27;s the only bad thing!</li>
            <li> I have all kinds of expensive brishes but decided to save a little but of money and gave these a try and they&#x27;re worth it(:!</li>
            <li> that&#x27;s less than a dollar per brush</li>
            <li> The eye brushes are decent, but the face brushes are very thin and do not pick up product evenly.</li>
            <li> they are all very soft, and had little to no fly aways!</li>
            <li> The plastic holder smelt a little funky, but I just threw it out.</li>
            <li> I washed all my brushes with liquid detergent and dried them with a bath towel.</li>
            <li> They came in the wrong color, and upon taking the plastic wraps off brushes, one of the brushes&#x27;s hair COMPLETELY fell out of the handle before I even got the chance to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Some</li>
            <li> It may loosen with use though, I also wish there was a fluffy blending brush, it would make the set 5 stars!</li>
            <li> This is coming from a makeup fanatic.</li>
            <li> I do not own a set of make up brushes.</li>
            <li> I usually buy those really expensive brush set but</li>
            <li> of the face brushes are too thin.</li>
            <li> They do have a weird smell</li>
            <li> So when I received this set in the mail I was completely shocked.</li>
            <li> They smell terrible, so I suggest washing them before using them.  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

            <li> Very fast shipping.  Great Great pricing.  I usually buy those really expensive brush set but this price and the quality of this product won me over.  This proves that you do not need an expensive makeup brush for the quality look.  These brushes are great for any professional makeup kit.  Easy to clean. And does not shed to much.  The bristles are soft and the brush helps apply a flawless look.</li>
            <li> Its a great value for the price.  It would have been nice if it was labeled.</li>
            <li> I like these...but I wish there were was one move flat straight small brush that I would use for my eyebrows...the is an angled and one flat straight (which I think is a little too large for brows)...other than that...pretty good brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> I just got these today and I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase! The case and brushes are of great quality. I would definitely buy again from this seller.</li>
            <li> This is a great value! The brushes do have an odor to them, I bought some brush cleaner and they are perfectly fine. Very soft and come in a nice case. Buy these!</li>
            <li> I bought the brushes 1. Because I needed new brushes and 2. Because they looked like the best value for the money. And they have fulfilled both needs. Now, to be honest, I have no idea what most of these brushes are used for, but the ones I have used are soft and of good quality. They seem well made, in fact, better than some higher priced bruses I&#x27;ve purchased in the past. I haven&#x27;t noticed much shedding, which is the problem I encountered with those pricey brushes. The case was a nice surprise. I was expecting a canvas type case, but the brushes came in a nice vinyl case.</li>
            <li> Obviously you&#x27;re not going to get top of the line brushes for $20. But what you will get is a crazy good assortment of good quality makeup brushes. The eye brushes alone would make this set worth the money. I couldn&#x27;t believe the different variety.  This is coming from a makeup fanatic.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re super soft. I love them. It was such a great deal‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è</li>
            <li> Well made, very,very soft and none of the bristles come out.  I washed all my brushes with liquid detergent and dried them with a bath towel. I placed them in a container to air dry overnight.  I wiped down the white fold over holder they came in. Remember ... these brushes will be used on your face and someone has handled them in the packaging process.  After the brushes dried I just rubbed my clean fingers across the top and they look perfect.  This is a good price and you get just about every type of shape needed.  Note: the case is well made and well designed.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this information is helpful.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good for the price, I&#x27;ve had these brushes for about a month and I wanted to wait to post a review so I can really good a feel for them.&lt;br /&gt;They are super soft, it didn&#x27;t really shed when I washed them probably like 3 hairs for all the brushes, seriously! It looks just like the picture and the case is better quality then expected. They haven&#x27;t broken and seem pretty well made, however on the stipple brush the hairs aren&#x27;t densely pack so it&#x27;s not that great but I still like it to smooth out fondation.&lt;br /&gt;One reason why it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because alot of the eye brushes are just flat brushes and not that good for applying eye shadow, they&#x27;re too dense and firm. It may loosen with use though, I also wish there was a fluffy blending brush, it would make the set 5 stars!</li>
            <li> Great brushes for the price.</li>
            <li> My girlfriend loves them a lot ! Soft but may have a strong smell but worth it.</li>
            <li> GREAT makeup brushes! I was a little worried, but honestly the quality is amazing!  A bit larger than I expected though lol</li>
            <li> Beautiful and super soft</li>
            <li> The brushes are great, the thing i didn&#x27;t like were the brissles of the brush. Just a bit too flimsy and remind me of plastic. Overall great packaging, good brushes and i got received them quickly</li>
            <li> These are amazing. The eye brushes alone have allowed me to make looks I&#x27;ve never been able to do before and the fan brushes are fantastic. The case they come in is great quality and very appealing. The factory smell lasted only  about six hours when I aired them out. Definitely would buy again.</li>
            <li> Bought these as a gift for my partner, she is in love with them! Very soft brushes and applies makeup with easy.</li>
            <li> Works, but doesn&#x27;t come with information on which brush is for what.</li>
            <li> They came in the wrong color, and upon taking the plastic wraps off brushes, one of the brushes&#x27;s hair COMPLETELY fell out of the handle before I even got the chance to use it.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the face brushes are too thin. However, the eye brushes work nicely.</li>
            <li> Brushes are really really soft. I suggest washing them first because of the plastic smell.</li>
            <li> These brushes are very plush, soft and durable. Great Bargain!</li>
            <li> I purchased these for a personal set of brushes, and i love them!  You can not tell the difference between my $50 blender brush and the blender in this set! These are comparative to MAC and other high end line tools, including morphe brushes.  I will purchase this set for my student artists, it is a great starter set.  Yes... they have a smell but everything fresh off a production line does.  They don&#x27;t shed, they are easy to clean and they are soft (but not too soft) Great buy for the money.&lt;br /&gt;www.blushnbliss.com</li>
            <li> so soft&lt;br /&gt;so durable&lt;br /&gt;so perfect&lt;br /&gt;so in love</li>
            <li> Great product, thank you!</li>
            <li> Great product with lots of selections.</li>
            <li> Great price for the quality</li>
            <li> very soft brushes, great set.</li>
            <li> Hi I gives these brushes to my wife cause she kept on buying brushes that wouldn&#x27;t work so I giveed it a try and I could tell you that she&#x27;s in love with these so I recommend it and they arrived in week ! :)</li>
            <li> I adore these brushes, use them all the time, and the bag for therm is well made and stylish.</li>
            <li> For the price of these brushes, I would recommend them to anyone! Amazing quality and they are so soft. The plastic holder smelt a little funky, but I just threw it out.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes so much (: they are so soft and just beautiful i use them on a daily the only thing i can say is that hair came misshaped but a little wash could fix that (: the brushes are amazing at apply product unlike other brushes that cake it on (:</li>
            <li> Absolutely would recommend to anyone. The bristles are very soft, feels like very high quality brushes. good!</li>
            <li> I really like these brushes. Very soft and I have yet to experience any shedding.</li>
            <li> Used. Washed. Used. Washed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, price is great. Beautiful complete set.&lt;br /&gt;Smell like fresh paint when recieve. Air out open. Just new.</li>
            <li> Definitely worth the money!!! These brushes are amazing and so soft! They do have a very strong smell but that&#x27;s the only bad thing! Loving them</li>
            <li> The best part about this brush set is the case. I adore the brush holder, and I would repurchase these brushes just for another brush roll. The eye brushes are decent, but the face brushes are very thin and do not pick up product evenly. I really recommend just spending a little bit more for specific brushes that you need for your makeup routine or kit. Its more expensive to waste extra product because these brushes pick up too much &amp; cannot evenly distribute it. Highly recommend Morphe &amp; Luxie brushes. I do think that BESTOPE is a fantastic seller here on Amazon though and the customer service is great.</li>
            <li> Their soft and work great! They do have a weird smell but once you clean it it&#x27;ll go away ... My cousin has high end brushes and she chose to buy these she really likes them and when mixed in with her high end brushes you can&#x27;t tell the difference</li>
            <li> Wife really likes them. I wasn&#x27;t sure what I was getting myself into when she said she needed new make up brushes but finding these was a great find. She s happy.</li>
            <li> According to my wife. They work really good. I got it really fast and really well packed.</li>
            <li> Better than I thought they would be.</li>
            <li> I &#x27;m very happy with my purchase. I read all comments here before i ordered it and i want to share you my opinion as well. I gave  4 stars to the product for only one reason:  the bristles for powder and blush brushes must have been denser then they are. they pick little product.&lt;br /&gt;1.SMELL - yes they do smell when you open the package but it i not very strong and only after 5 minute you can not even notice it. so it is not a problem&lt;br /&gt;2. QUALITY - actually i&#x27; m OK with the quality i hope it will not shed and brake after some days of use but i used them today for the first time and quality is very good for the price you pay. + bristles are super soft. adding pictures for you ladies. i think my comment was interesting and helpful for you</li>
            <li> Wow is all I can say I was so surprised in the quality and quantity of these brushes . You can never find deals like this in the stores !!</li>
            <li> They smell terrible, so I suggest washing them before using them.  They will shed  a little, but after that first wash they are fine.  They aren&#x27;t the worst brushes I&#x27;ve ever owned, not the best.  Worth the money, and a great assortment of different brushes for someone just learning, or sunshine in a budget.  They are beautiful in person, and very soft. I would buy again.</li>
            <li> The brushes are of good quality. Always take your time to read reviews! These brushes pick up makeup very well and after a week of having them I can say that they hardly shed. Also, all I can complain about is the smell of the bag they come in. The smell is of strong plasticky chemicals, but it does die down once you air it out. Other than that, these are great and soft!</li>
            <li> My dad bought these for me as a &#x27;get yourself something nice&#x27; gift and what girl doesn&#x27;t want more makeup brushes?? These had a brief plastic smell to them, but it lasted about fifteen minutes and that was it. These work SOOO good for applying my Naked palettes and I just love them. The fan brush is AMAZING and I&#x27;m so glad I got these. The case that they come in is actually very good quality as well which is surprising. I haven&#x27;t had any shedding with these and I find these to be better than some of the BareMinerals brushes I have.. Would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I like the brushes but I wish they came with more information on what the different kind are and how to use them.  I&#x27;ve been watching YouTube videos which is somewhat helpful.</li>
            <li> I do not own a set of make up brushes. I have a few of them, but I had always wished for a high end set that are priced at hundreds of dollars. I have tested those brushes at beauty stores. So when I received this set in the mail I was completely shocked. They are so much more prettier than they are online. And they are amazingly soft! I love the colors I have and the pouch they come in. The pouch has a lite smell to it but I expected that with it being new. I recommend these brushes cause they are lovely and work great.</li>
            <li> they are all very soft, and had little to no fly aways! none of the brushes were bent at all, and work amazing</li>
            <li> Great brushes some of them shredded a few hairs but it was ok I like this set allot</li>
            <li> Great quality brushes! I ordered these around a month ago and, so far, I am very pleased with them. They are soft, durable, and don&#x27;t shed during use or wash. The brushes pick up a decent amount of product and blend my powders very well. They don&#x27;t have the company name on the handle and two brushes arrived with dents, both of which may pose a problem for some. For the price, these brushes are a great deal and I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Good con very soft, bad con sheds a lot at first</li>
            <li> Nice; case was not as nice as I had hoped.</li>
            <li> I adore these brushes!&lt;br /&gt;First of all the brushes and the roll they come in, are beautiful!&lt;br /&gt;Second, they are extremely soft and very good quality!  I almost didn&#x27;t order these brushes because I didn&#x27;t think a set of 24 brushes that only cost a little over $20 could possibly be good quality (hellooo!! that&#x27;s less than a dollar per brush plus you get that stinkin&#x27; cute brush roll to keep them all in!!!)  but, when I got them I was very pleasantly surprised!!!! They are not the absolute best quality brushes out there, but they are WAY better than you would expect them to be for the price!!&lt;br /&gt;I am also very sad to say that I have paid way more for brushes of much lower quality :.(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have already used and washed these brushes multiple times. The first time I washed the brushes I had a little bit of fall out from a couple of the biggest brushes but after that there hasn&#x27;t been any!!!&lt;br /&gt;Everyone I have shown these brushes to or used them on has loved them and asked me where I got them and of course I sent them here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have is that when you first open them the brushes and roll have a pretty strong plasticy smell but, I found that if you let them air out for about 24 hours the smell pretty much goes away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again I love these brushes!!!&lt;br /&gt; I recommend them to everyone and  will definitely be ordering them as gifts for friends and family!!</li>
            <li> Very good! I really like it, great value for its price!</li>
            <li> Better than I expected!</li>
            <li> Bought these to supplement my brush collection and they were better quality than I had expected :-) and soft</li>
            <li> I would like to have given these brushes a great review but the truth is I have yet to be able to use them as their case and them came to me smelling strongly of chemicals (like paint but sickeningly strong). Hopefully the smell will disppear soon it&#x27;s been over a week.</li>
            <li> this set is great!! I am in love with them.. They are soft and the case they come in is very nice.</li>

            <li> I really liked them&lt;br /&gt;Supper soft !&lt;br /&gt;recommend it you guys and&lt;br /&gt;It came before the date it was suppose to be delivered !</li>
            <li> Today I received my brushes and so far I love them. I tested them a little by pulling the bristles and there was no shedding except in like one of them which is good(:! I have all kinds of expensive brishes but decided to save a little but of money and gave these a try and they&#x27;re worth it(:! Ima test them out even more though. And about the &amp;#34;smell&amp;#34; to be honest I didn&#x27;t really smell anything.</li>
