            <li>Nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li>I was provided a sample product for an unbiased and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The product came in a nice brown paper packaging and in a amber color glass bottle.</li>
            <li>When I received a coupon for this item I was thrilled to try it.</li>
            <li>Two years after the baby was born and the spots haven&#x27;t gone away on their own.  </li>
            <li>I have never used any Rose hip oil before by itself.</li>
            <li>I just received my Rose hip Oil</li>
            <li>three days with this rose hip oil</li>
            <li>I received this as part of a promotion and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li>put three drops in my palms, warm it up, and pat it over my face, neck, and chest.</li>
            <li>This is because rose hip seed oil is suppose to regenerate the skin from trans-retinoic acid found in the oil.</li>
            <li>Received at discount for honest review, and I can honestly recommend.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of product that feels like a great luxury, so when I received a promotional code for it, I was excited to order.</li>

            <li>Many thanks for a great oil!!!  </li>

            <li>The break outs shrank, my skin tone is becoming more even</li>
            <li>so when I noticed a discount deal I was excited to get it!  </li>
            <li>Just based off a weeks use I am pleased with how easy it is to apply and soaks in without being greasy or not pleasing to my skin.</li>

            <li>Also, very friendly and attentive customer service.</li>
            <li>The smell is clean plus you know this is true unrefined rose hip oil by the color, unrefined rosehip oil is an orange color and this rosehip oil is orange.  </li>
            <li>It never leaves a greasy film and soaks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li>This product absorbs very very quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li>The oil absorbs very quickly and does not leave me feeling slimy.  </li>
            <li>It does have quite a strong smell but that soon disperses.</li>
            <li>Even in a warm area if one gets too much sun that can dry the skin out and the rose hip oil is great to help that too.</li>
            <li>just have to say that this is a pretty amazing company.</li>
            <li>so this suits me fine.  </li>
            <li>Already I am noticing my fine lines easing.</li>
            <li>This oil is light and easy absorbable.</li>
            <li>Wake up with skin feeling soft and pleasant to touch.</li>
            <li>The customer service is top notch and any question I have is quickly answered.</li>
            <li>Good oil, very little scent, good for Ayurveda~ :-)</li>
            <li>I am very pleased and impressed with this particular rosehip seed oil and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li>and they have great customer service and a great philosophy behind their products.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve notice a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>Fantastic communication.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Everything I have ordered from this company has been fantastic quality.</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a great moisturizer for your skin - look no further!</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is such a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>I use a light dusting of face powder in the morning for my makeup now</li>
            <li>It has a light earthy oil smell that dissipates.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Goes on smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li>Makes precise use easier.</li>
            <li>I am blessed with almost flawless skin and few wrinkles</li>
            <li>Also, I wanted a light oil to put on my face before using my light mineral make-up to be a sort of seal for the make-up and protection for my face.  </li>
            <li>Feels great and after only a couple of weeks</li>
            <li>It also has made my acne scars start to fade and my skin tone has greatly improved overall.</li>
            <li>This brand is light, and does not make my skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li>So far, so good.</li>
            <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t use it on its own for heavy moisturizing, but it&#x27;d be a great add-in for recipes with shea butter.</li>
            <li>So far so good</li>
            <li>If you are very sensitive to odors you may not be able to use it because it is very strong.  </li>
            <li>And you see results right away :)</li>
            <li>My make up can go right on top for the day.</li>
            <li>It smells very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li>It is light and has a clean scent and when used alone, it soaks into my face with no oily shine.  </li>
            <li>Also, the owner of Better Shea Butter is fantastic and always answers emails quickly if ever any problems and is super sweet.</li>
            <li>Yes, it doesn&#x27;t really smell pleasant at all, but I just use it with a nice smelling facial cream.</li>
            <li>I bought this during a promotional period and found the rose hip oil AMAZING for helping with my dry hands.</li>
            <li>I recently starting using the Rosehip Seed Oil alone on the mornings and it is amazing!</li>
            <li>It has an earthy smell and rich yellow/orange color...</li>
            <li>First of all, I love this company.</li>
            <li>And the packaging is pretty cute too.</li>
            <li>and I am so excited about my results.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this Rosehip seed oil during a promotional period.  </li>
            <li>Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li>I was so excited to receive this with a promotional coupon.</li>
            <li>then you know it must be kept cool and out of the light</li>
            <li>I use the Rosehip Oil on my nails and on my face, and I have noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li>Opening the bottle, the oil smells sooo fresh!</li>
            <li>First of all I love this company.</li>
            <li>The resulting moisturizer feels great on my skin and I am looking forward to the long term benefits!</li>
            <li>Better Shea Butter is an amazing company and this rosehip seed oil is terrific.</li>
            <li>I was honestly worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like the smell of the oil because I am very sensitive to smells (they give me a headache).  </li>
            <li>The cute packaging makes this oil a nice gift for somebody interested in natural products.</li>
            <li>and the result is soft, healthy skin!</li>
            <li>It does absorb into the skin, but nothing special.</li>
            <li>My hands are much softer, my dark spots have lightened &amp; they feel great!  </li>
            <li>I need it as I age to help prevent more wrinkles ,help with &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; spots, and keep my skin healthy in general.  </li>
            <li>This product, as well as Shea Butter from Better Shea Butter comes with a recipe book- make the recipes, you will be amazed and most likely never purchase toxin filled store bought products again.  </li>
            <li>I personally like the smell of this rose hip oil, its just a good, natural scent, not flowery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It gives my fingernails a nice, natural shine.</li>
            <li>This oil is made from the seeds of Rosa Canina, a wild climbing rose, found in South America.  </li>
            <li>Ethically sourced and consistently outstanding.  </li>
            <li>The fair scent is not overwhelming and makes it nice to use at night when I am resting.  </li>
            <li>I love the fact that is does not have a strong over powering smell and is not a heavy oil and does not leave a oil feeling after use.</li>
            <li>The smell is pretty strong</li>
            <li>I was lucky to try this Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li>Used in a face moisturizer it just absorbes quickly.</li>
            <li>I apply this out of the shower and it soaks into my skin quickly with no oily residue.  </li>
            <li>I have been applying organic rosehip seed oil on my face, neck, and body for awhile now and have tried many brands, so I was extremely glad to be asked to review this via a promotion and to provide my personal opinion.  </li>
            <li>They have never failed to get back to me if I tried to reach them and were always so nice!</li>
            <li>Now, I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant</li>
            <li>but I was pregnant 3 days ago and did not look like this.</li>
            <li>It was still discolored but was healing quickly.  </li>
            <li>It arrived quickly and packaged in a sealed brown envelope.</li>
            <li>I have been using it on my face, it absorbs quickly and leaves no oily or greasy feeling or residue.  </li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy feeling.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend:)</li>
            <li>:) highly recommend</li>
            <li>I live in an incredibly hot and dry climate and am always searching for the perfect moisturizer that will hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy.  </li>
            <li>the e-book is a huge plus, very helpful!</li>
            <li>I also starting experimenting with using it in scars on my body and so far so good!</li>
            <li>Subtle but great smell, absorbs quickly, and is overall a great product.</li>
            <li>It does have a very distinct smell, and I can see how some people would associate it with fish oil, but that wasn&#x27;t my first instinct when I opened the bottle.</li>
            <li>The oil is a golden color &amp; does have a mild scent.</li>
            <li>First off for me is packaging, I am a sucker for a great package!</li>
            <li>The scent straight out of the bottle was a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li>love finding a natural alternative to two cosmetic issues that works!</li>
            <li>Just received several products and I am in love!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a licensed skin esthetician and I cannot tell you enough how much I love this product!</li>
            <li>This oil absorbs nicely, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, and seemed to soften his rough skin.</li>
            <li>My skin loves it, the oil soaks in completely leaving my face and neck very smooth.  </li>
            <li>It is very light and absorbs quickly (it is not heavy or oily like coconut oil).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have deep lines more like fine lines but am hoping this will help gradually with that.</li>
            <li>I made sure to buy cold-pressed and organic, so this particular RSO was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li>It is pure ( no additive) and genuine Rosehip Oil, with its distinct smell and color.</li>
            <li>The bottle is glass, as is the dropper and its was securely packaged in bubble tape, so no broken anything.  </li>
            <li>Better Shea Butter is the only shea butter I use in my own natural skin care line.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li>It does have a distinct smell..</li>
            <li>The dropper is really handy as you only need the smallest amount.</li>
            <li>I use only organic natural products and my skin is in great condition.</li>
            <li>My skin that already has the a pink glow most times, got even more radiant.</li>
            <li>Love this oil so far.</li>
            <li>I received the Rosehip Seed Oil last week and was looking forward to trying one of the recipes in the free eBook that I was able to download.  </li>
            <li>As far as Rosehip oils go, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li>The company also sent out separate instructions on how to use/store product properly and it was a nice touch.</li>
            <li>It takes about 5 minutes to feel absorbed.</li>
            <li>but it would be fun to try some of the recipes out.</li>
            <li>This is a powerful oil that should have come out of the closet along time ago.  </li>
            <li>This helps keep the oil inside fresh.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li>It has a really nice smell, but don&#x27;t expect it to smell like actual roses.</li>
            <li>I never thought I would be a person that would start using oils for a more natural approach to healing-</li>
            <li>When I initially thought about using an oil of any kind, I automatically assumed it would be greasy.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this brand, I am planning on purchasing other essential oils from them also.</li>
            <li>By the way, the RSO is very lightweight on its own and does absorb into your skin nicely, with very little greasy residue.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using their shea butter for awhile now and it is superior to all other shea butters that I have tried.</li>
            <li>Now what to use the Rosehip oil on you are wondering right?  </li>
            <li>I was right.  </li>
            <li>My skin is super sensitive and this oil leaves my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li>I kept reading such positive things about rose hip oil</li>
            <li>It only takes maybe 8 drops total for my entire face, it absorbs perfectly, hydrates well, feels silky on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a significant oily residue.</li>
            <li>It does have a unique smell that is true to 100% pure high quality Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>I really enjoyed the scent and like the little dispenser at the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li>It is too strong to apply directly to skin-I tried.</li>
            <li>and she said itâ€™s very gentle and</li>
            <li>Ok seriously, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li>The oil comes out of the bottle super concentrated, pleasant smelling, and thick.</li>
            <li>The dispenser is also great for getting the small amount or large amount needed depending on what area of skin one is using it for.</li>
            <li>At first it made my face break out</li>
            <li>Your face may break out a bit for the first week</li>
            <li>this is exactly how rosehip oil should be.</li>
            <li>This worked great as it is not too thick.  </li>
            <li>rosehip seed oil actually has a certified organic label.&lt;br /&gt;There are too many cosmetic products on Amazon that claim to be organic, but without the proof of a certified label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li>I mix it with their organic shea butter to make a night cream - very healing and moisturizing!</li>
            <li>First bottle smelled like rancid fish oil.</li>
            <li>This is my first time trying this type of product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li>funny smell, but disappears soon sfter applying</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I had a dental appointment today and was asked what I use on my face because I look a decade younger than I am :-)</li>
            <li>It does exactly what I want...</li>
            <li>My last favorite use for it is on my stretch marks after having three kids.</li>
            <li>Will be back for more of this oil once I run out.</li>
            <li>clears up acne if uses consistently.</li>
            <li>I took before pics and will be interested in checking every 2 weeks to see if there is a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li>I really wish I&#x27;d known about this blessing of an oil years ago!  </li>
            <li>The first two days I did have a break out or two which made me worry a tad</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>This is my first time using this product.  </li>
            <li>After my skin is back to being healthy,  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li>My favorite facial oil.</li>
            <li>and I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>been using it in him religiously and his eczema is so much better.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very hopeful!</li>
            <li>and my foundation goes on smoother when I use this first.  </li>
            <li>Nice and dry, soaks in fast without being overly greasy.  </li>
            <li>Very moisturizing and just seems to drop right into the skin.</li>
            <li>We did not read how much is needed yet, so he applied 4 more drops to his face and left.</li>
            <li>The last one I used had a much stronger scent &amp; a darkish orange color, so I like this better.</li>
            <li>From what was left in my bottle, this is definitely the superior of the two options.</li>
            <li>Very ;)) customer.</li>
            <li>Anyways, I recommend this organic cold-pressed RSO to anyone and everyone, even those who have super sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I have used this oil in several different recipes for skin care products and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>The vendor is terrfic with following up and product arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li>My skin went from being dry to being really healthy in about a week or so</li>
            <li>You can try this if you have dry skin and it will give you a more glowy complexion</li>
            <li>I will have confidence applying this to my skin knowing that this is pure rosehip seed oil and made with quality.  </li>
            <li>Pure and healthful moisturizer</li>
            <li>I tried it on dry hands and it worked great because it sinks in and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually more conservative about my reviews, but I feel strongly that people should at least TRY this product.</li>
            <li>It is good for most all skin &amp;#34;problems&amp;#34; such as eczema, wrinkles, acne scars, dark spots and such.  </li>
            <li>This oil goes on great, soaks right in, only a small amount needed.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had to start using it on my other hand to keep them more consistent.</li>
            <li>This is very high quality Rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li>It is a very high quality product.  </li>
            <li>Oil is very high in Vit. C and also</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great and leaves the skin feeling great but what a nasty smell.</li>
            <li>my skins looks soft, young, smooth...</li>
            <li>Fast delivery, a personal email and a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>after using for a few days my skin is amazing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li>In the packaging there was also a card that had a link to a free e-book with different recipes on how to use the oil, which was an added bonus.  </li>
            <li>I have very &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; skin.  </li>
            <li>and I would say this is working very well for</li>
            <li>You really dont need much.</li>
            <li>This is very work for my skin.</li>
            <li>My face is much clearer now.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s the real deal</li>
            <li>Use it on my nails and cuticles- nails are growing and cuticles look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li>It does not just claim to be but is really certified with the USDA and ECOCERT logos.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I primarily use it on a burn scar on the back of my hand, but I also like to rub it into my cuticles and nails as well.</li>
            <li>rosehip is the real deal.</li>
            <li>This oil gives all day moisture without the need to apply much.  </li>
            <li>Helped with my acne-scarring so much.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t noticed any real benefits or change in eczema while using this.  </li>
            <li>They are very affordable and fast delivery.</li>
            <li>Oil is soothing and fast absorbing.</li>
            <li>I use the oil primarily on my forehead and around the creases of my eyes where &amp;#34;crow&#x27;s feet&amp;#34; are starting to com in.</li>
            <li>Not greasy at all - seems to absorb very well.  </li>
            <li>This oil absorbs very well</li>
            <li>I really like this and will repurchase.</li>
            <li>My skin has improved complexion, pinkish healthy color that make me look young, the skin is even tighter, again giving it a younger look.</li>
            <li>I looked at him and his skin complexion had changed from the more pale look to a light pink, healthy look, like young kids have.</li>
            <li>and I am excited to use this oil after a fresh haircut to hopefully avoid the whole dry and damaged ends all together!</li>
            <li>I love the fact that this isn&#x27;t a processed product with a bunch of other junk added, it&#x27;s just pure rosehip oil.</li>
            <li>This is important to help prevent the oil from going rancid quickly, it must be stored in dark places.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Some other reviewers described it as fishy but to me it smells more earthy like soil with a hint of fish.</li>
            <li>I make my own moisturizer and this is all martial and his a long way</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a dry oil, and if you have acne or scars then this oil can transform your face, because I saw pictures of a reviewer on makeup alley, and I could not believe what it did for her face, nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li>I love the dropper that comes with the bottle, it makes application much easier and you don&#x27;t get too much and waste it.  </li>
            <li>Today my work friend said that my skin looks more hydrated, less wrinkled.</li>
            <li>I have been told that my face has a healthy glow, and as a result, I find myself wearing less makeup.</li>
            <li>That&#x27;s important to me, because sometimes where I&#x27;m at, it so dry and arid.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s too soon to tell if my face is better off for using this, but I&#x27;ll report back later on that.</li>
            <li>The spots are not so much noticeable to others as I am just very self conscious of them.</li>
            <li>About 3-4 drops is enough to massage into my face and hands, and it absorbs quickly without my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li>I was lucky enough to get their coupon during a promotion</li>
            <li>The packaging is definitely high quality.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product as well as buying from this company.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>but I have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend getting this product</li>
            <li>I purchased this with a promotional coupon and highly recommend it to every one suffering the wrath of the sun and age.</li>
            <li>then I highly recommend you use this oil.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this company too...</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so pure and natural</li>
            <li>When I wake up in the morning my face is so soft!!</li>
            <li>Now - almost 2 weeks later my skin is soft, clear and FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li>Iâ€™ve also applied some of the oil to my face directly and it is gentle.  </li>
            <li>Really makes my face soft.</li>
            <li>Today morning, when I went to wash my face and get ready, it was the first time in a while, I looked at my face and saw the younger look</li>
            <li>So far it seems the area is having much less breakouts and those that I get are healing more</li>
            <li>I feel like I&#x27;m finally doing the right thing for my face.</li>
            <li>This being said, I only give it 1 star because the item came with the top loose and leaked all over my bag as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li>so you have plenty of ways to try your new products.</li>
            <li>but like all new skincare regimes, I wanted to give it two weeks for my skin to adjust.</li>
            <li>I tend to use it on &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; approaches - I live in the woods and get bit from time to time -</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s my new fave moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I have noticed my dark spots and fine line wrinkles are gone.</li>
            <li>Not only did I receive a free sample to try but also a personal email with a updated recipe book from the Owner.</li>
            <li>And I read that organic cold pressed is the only way to go, so this is a great brand!</li>
            <li>This makes skin soft and works some wrinkles away!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive, acne prone skin normally.</li>
            <li>I have fought adult acne for 20 years now and since using this product I have had not 1 breakout!</li>
            <li>First big surprise.</li>
            <li>At first I was planning to try a Cocoa butter facial oil with Rosehips but ending up trying this</li>
            <li>I have really sensitive skin during the winter and this baby made my face glow!</li>
            <li>I was anxious to use my promotional coupon and order the Organic Rosehip Seed Oil by Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li>The first thing I noticed when I received the package is that it comes in a brown envelope with a lot of info.in larger print on the envelope.</li>
            <li>When I first received it I opened it up and took a big inhale.</li>
            <li>I use this oil with Young Living essential oils to make a face serum that works better than any high end face products I have previously used.  .  </li>
            <li>I can see some light marks fading slightly, so I am hopeful with continued use.</li>
            <li>It actually smells exactly like a rosehip seed, and I know this because I&#x27;ve eaten wild rosehips out of the forest in the midwest</li>
            <li>This particular oil I like because it&#x27;s a lightweight oil with no other ingredients.</li>
            <li>My previous bottle was running low, so I needed to purchase some more.</li>
            <li>This oil is also perfect for those dry noses from cold season.</li>
            <li>There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and it absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li>Well my very favorite thing to use it on is my unruly (or not so unruly now that I have this oil) naturally curly hair, just a few drops on towel dried locks has done wonders for my split ends and overall dryness of my hair, it does not feel or look greasy at all, even on the rare occasion that I straighten it.  </li>
            <li>I was really curious if I could improve it a little more or maintain my healthy glow for a long long time.</li>
            <li>After a few weeks I have already noticed a huge change in my skin.  </li>
            <li>(18-20) and had to take medication to clear my face up.</li>
            <li>I am left with a very luxurious and soft skin.  </li>
            <li>but almost.. I like the natural looking protective packaging the oil came in .</li>
            <li>and this one has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li>and I have been looking for natural remedies.  </li>
            <li>My friend said that she has used her lotion on her sonâ€™s legs (he has sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>Most of the negative reviews are about the smell..</li>
            <li>but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel so youthful and soft.</li>
            <li>I put this directly on my face before bed.</li>
            <li>and I am still surprised to say</li>
            <li>makes skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s really given me an extra boost in my skincare routine.</li>
            <li>It leaves my hand feeling surprisingly soft and since it moisturizes, too,</li>
            <li>so I was eager to try and non invasive, no heavy chemical alternative to what my dermatologist had suggested.</li>
            <li>By the time I  got to my appointment,  the burn wasn&#x27;t sore anymore and the area had considerably lightened.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so natural, and doesn&#x27;t need any man made chemicals to make it work.  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily and I wake up and skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li>If you would like an all natural product to help with anti-aging, sun damaged skin and help with scars</li>
            <li>My skin felt so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li>Prior to purchasing this product, I tried the Whole Foods brand.</li>
            <li>and I could not believe how soft his skin felt when I got him out.</li>
            <li>I was hoping to take a natural approach to heal all the acne scars and my one brown spot.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m satisfied with the progress so far and hope to see continued improvement of the next few months.</li>
            <li>I mix a couple of drops with argan oil as my daily facial moisturizer and it absorbs right into the skin with no greasiness afterwards.  </li>
            <li>The smell doesn&#x27;t last long anyway, and it&#x27;s mild.  </li>
            <li>This company gives you a free e book for recipes on how to use this with other beauty regimes or simply alone.  </li>
            <li>I first started using the Rosehip Seed Oil mixed in with my daily moisturizer, I noticed the redness in my face would lighten up quicker when adding the Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li>A little bit goes a long way so this bottle last a good long time.  </li>
            <li>I have been putting a little bit on about every other night and noticing a nice difference, they are softer, not cracked and overall look</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully, sinks right in to my skins and leaves a healthy glow behind.</li>
            <li>I have used several rosehip oils from different manufactures in the past, and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new things on my face since I have such temperamental skin</li>
            <li>I pat my face dry and apply the RSO straight.</li>
            <li>My skin isn&#x27;t flaky and dry anymore, and is much brighter in the mornings.</li>
            <li>So i have dry skin, and I don&#x27;t think it helped moisturize much for me.</li>
            <li>It has really helped with my dry areas.  </li>
            <li>I am also using it to possibly clear some facial blemishes that I developed during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li>I usually wear some make up on top of it after it dries, but doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li>I mix it with a little coconut oil and do a hot oil treatment!</li>
            <li>Within the past year, I started using more essential oils in my daily life.</li>
            <li>I also use this on my super dry hands and cuticles during the dry winters and it&#x27;s been a life saver!</li>
            <li>I will only purchase this particular product in the future.</li>
            <li>The dropper is messy and I feel like it&#x27;s very easy to waste the product by accidentally dropping oil onto the counter or having it run off your fingers.</li>
            <li>I was looking forward to writing a review to inform others on this oil since I am a fan of rosehips in general.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only used it about 2 weeks so far.</li>
            <li>I have only applied it about 4 times so far.  </li>
            <li>While there is no visible change in it&#x27;s appearance, I have noticed that the pain has completely stopped, and it occasionally itches.  </li>
            <li>So far I have made the daily moisturizer with the oil.  </li>
            <li>I have been trying to change my beauty routine to as natural as possible.  </li>
            <li>After four months of applying this to their skin daily, their wrinkles and sunspots had almost completely disappeared, and their skin had a fresher healthier look.</li>
            <li>my skin feels smother and moist , one thing i dont like is the smell , i know its natural but is it supposed to smell like its very old like if it was produced a long time ago , will not try the same brand</li>
            <li>and I am about ready to throw all of those other things away.</li>
            <li>Also, I have really bad chapped lips (thanks to living in Michigan) and have been applying Better shea butter directly to my lips...</li>
            <li>so grateful and will be using it to stay young for as long as it works.</li>
            <li>Its smell is earthy but not overwhelming or rancid, which demonstrates that this oil is fresh.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this brand of Rosehip oil and their other products.</li>
            <li>It rubs in easily &amp; does not leave any greasiness behind.  </li>
            <li>Also, the bottle informs you to keep it in a cool dark place, it comes in a dark bottle as it should and there is an online book  about uses for their products.</li>
            <li>My main interest in Rosehip oil was due to the fact that I have some red marks on my skin from messing with blemishes</li>
            <li>I also like that its not a thin consistency, its a little thicker than an oil.</li>
            <li>again cuase didnt feel new , but i will try rosehip from other brands</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This was amazing.</li>
            <li> This stuff is said to do amazing things for wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, etc.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Rose Hip Oil for about a month</li>
            <li> It is so nice to just rub this oil into my skin and see the benefits.  </li>
            <li> Nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I was provided a sample product for an unbiased and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The product came in a nice brown paper packaging and in a amber color glass bottle.</li>
            <li> When I received a coupon for this item I was thrilled to try it.</li>
            <li> Two years after the baby was born and the spots haven&#x27;t gone away on their own.  </li>
            <li> I have never used any Rose hip oil before by itself.</li>
            <li> I just received my Rose hip Oil</li>
            <li> three days with this rose hip oil</li>
            <li> I received this as part of a promotion and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> put three drops in my palms, warm it up, and pat it over my face, neck, and chest.</li>
            <li> This is because rose hip seed oil is suppose to regenerate the skin from trans-retinoic acid found in the oil.</li>
            <li> Received at discount for honest review, and I can honestly recommend.</li>
            <li> This is the kind of product that feels like a great luxury, so when I received a promotional code for it, I was excited to order.</li>

            <li> I love how this was packaged.</li>
            <li> There are many uses for it.</li>
            <li> It is more of an earthy scent.</li>
            <li> but I think it will take more than 3 weeks of use to heal years of damage.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive a coupon for this product.  </li>
            <li> I was very excited to try this Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>

            <li> The break outs shrank, my skin tone is becoming more even</li>
            <li> so when I noticed a discount deal I was excited to get it!  </li>
            <li> Just based off a weeks use I am pleased with how easy it is to apply and soaks in without being greasy or not pleasing to my skin.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my dry frizzy hair and it works so awesome on my hair too!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much for this wonderful, fast shipping product.</li>
            <li> Thank you Better Shea Butter for providing such awesome, pure products!!</li>

            <li> I am happy with the product so far.  </li>

            <li> , it smell nice and fresh.</li>
            <li> Also, very friendly and attentive customer service.</li>
            <li> The smell is clean plus you know this is true unrefined rose hip oil by the color, unrefined rosehip oil is an orange color and this rosehip oil is orange.  </li>
            <li> It never leaves a greasy film and soaks in very quickly.  </li>
            <li> This product absorbs very very quickly and is not greasy.</li>
            <li> The oil absorbs very quickly and does not leave me feeling slimy.  </li>
            <li> It does have quite a strong smell but that soon disperses.</li>
            <li> Even in a warm area if one gets too much sun that can dry the skin out and the rose hip oil is great to help that too.</li>
            <li> just have to say that this is a pretty amazing company.</li>
            <li> so this suits me fine.  </li>
            <li> Already I am noticing my fine lines easing.</li>
            <li> This oil is light and easy absorbable.</li>
            <li> Wake up with skin feeling soft and pleasant to touch.</li>
            <li> The customer service is top notch and any question I have is quickly answered.</li>
            <li> Good oil, very little scent, good for Ayurveda~ :-)</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and impressed with this particular rosehip seed oil and use it everyday.  </li>
            <li> and they have great customer service and a great philosophy behind their products.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve notice a huge difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> Fantastic communication.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Everything I have ordered from this company has been fantastic quality.</li>
            <li> If you are looking for a great moisturizer for your skin - look no further!</li>
            <li> /&gt;This is such a great moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> I use a light dusting of face powder in the morning for my makeup now</li>
            <li> It has a light earthy oil smell that dissipates.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Goes on smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Makes precise use easier.</li>
            <li> I am blessed with almost flawless skin and few wrinkles</li>
            <li> Also, I wanted a light oil to put on my face before using my light mineral make-up to be a sort of seal for the make-up and protection for my face.  </li>
            <li> Feels great and after only a couple of weeks</li>
            <li> It also has made my acne scars start to fade and my skin tone has greatly improved overall.</li>
            <li> This brand is light, and does not make my skin feel greasy.</li>
            <li> So far, so good.</li>
            <li> so I wouldn&#x27;t use it on its own for heavy moisturizing, but it&#x27;d be a great add-in for recipes with shea butter.</li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> If you are very sensitive to odors you may not be able to use it because it is very strong.  </li>
            <li> And you see results right away :)</li>
            <li> My make up can go right on top for the day.</li>
            <li> It smells very clean and fresh.</li>
            <li> It is light and has a clean scent and when used alone, it soaks into my face with no oily shine.  </li>
            <li> Also, the owner of Better Shea Butter is fantastic and always answers emails quickly if ever any problems and is super sweet.</li>
            <li> Yes, it doesn&#x27;t really smell pleasant at all, but I just use it with a nice smelling facial cream.</li>
            <li> I bought this during a promotional period and found the rose hip oil AMAZING for helping with my dry hands.</li>
            <li> I recently starting using the Rosehip Seed Oil alone on the mornings and it is amazing!</li>
            <li> It has an earthy smell and rich yellow/orange color...</li>
            <li> First of all, I love this company.</li>
            <li> And the packaging is pretty cute too.</li>
            <li> and I am so excited about my results.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this Rosehip seed oil during a promotional period.  </li>
            <li> Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this with a promotional coupon.</li>
            <li> then you know it must be kept cool and out of the light</li>
            <li> I use the Rosehip Oil on my nails and on my face, and I have noticed a significant difference.</li>
            <li> Opening the bottle, the oil smells sooo fresh!</li>
            <li> First of all I love this company.</li>
            <li> The resulting moisturizer feels great on my skin and I am looking forward to the long term benefits!</li>
            <li> Better Shea Butter is an amazing company and this rosehip seed oil is terrific.</li>
            <li> I was honestly worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like the smell of the oil because I am very sensitive to smells (they give me a headache).  </li>
            <li> The cute packaging makes this oil a nice gift for somebody interested in natural products.</li>
            <li> and the result is soft, healthy skin!</li>
            <li> It does absorb into the skin, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> My hands are much softer, my dark spots have lightened &amp; they feel great!  </li>
            <li> I need it as I age to help prevent more wrinkles ,help with &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; spots, and keep my skin healthy in general.  </li>
            <li> This product, as well as Shea Butter from Better Shea Butter comes with a recipe book- make the recipes, you will be amazed and most likely never purchase toxin filled store bought products again.  </li>
            <li> I personally like the smell of this rose hip oil, its just a good, natural scent, not flowery.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It gives my fingernails a nice, natural shine.</li>
            <li> This oil is made from the seeds of Rosa Canina, a wild climbing rose, found in South America.  </li>
            <li> Ethically sourced and consistently outstanding.  </li>
            <li> The fair scent is not overwhelming and makes it nice to use at night when I am resting.  </li>
            <li> I love the fact that is does not have a strong over powering smell and is not a heavy oil and does not leave a oil feeling after use.</li>
            <li> The smell is pretty strong</li>
            <li> I was lucky to try this Rosehip Seed Oil.</li>
            <li> Used in a face moisturizer it just absorbes quickly.</li>
            <li> I apply this out of the shower and it soaks into my skin quickly with no oily residue.  </li>
            <li> I have been applying organic rosehip seed oil on my face, neck, and body for awhile now and have tried many brands, so I was extremely glad to be asked to review this via a promotion and to provide my personal opinion.  </li>
            <li> They have never failed to get back to me if I tried to reach them and were always so nice!</li>
            <li> Now, I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant</li>
            <li> but I was pregnant 3 days ago and did not look like this.</li>
            <li> It was still discolored but was healing quickly.  </li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and packaged in a sealed brown envelope.</li>
            <li> I have been using it on my face, it absorbs quickly and leaves no oily or greasy feeling or residue.  </li>
            <li> It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy feeling.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend:)</li>
            <li> :) highly recommend</li>
            <li> I live in an incredibly hot and dry climate and am always searching for the perfect moisturizer that will hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy.  </li>
            <li> the e-book is a huge plus, very helpful!</li>
            <li> I also starting experimenting with using it in scars on my body and so far so good!</li>
            <li> Subtle but great smell, absorbs quickly, and is overall a great product.</li>
            <li> It does have a very distinct smell, and I can see how some people would associate it with fish oil, but that wasn&#x27;t my first instinct when I opened the bottle.</li>
            <li> The oil is a golden color &amp; does have a mild scent.</li>
            <li> First off for me is packaging, I am a sucker for a great package!</li>
            <li> The scent straight out of the bottle was a bit strong for me.</li>
            <li> love finding a natural alternative to two cosmetic issues that works!</li>
            <li> Just received several products and I am in love!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed skin esthetician and I cannot tell you enough how much I love this product!</li>
            <li> This oil absorbs nicely, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, and seemed to soften his rough skin.</li>
            <li> My skin loves it, the oil soaks in completely leaving my face and neck very smooth.  </li>
            <li> It is very light and absorbs quickly (it is not heavy or oily like coconut oil).</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have deep lines more like fine lines but am hoping this will help gradually with that.</li>
            <li> I made sure to buy cold-pressed and organic, so this particular RSO was exactly what I wanted.</li>
            <li> It is pure ( no additive) and genuine Rosehip Oil, with its distinct smell and color.</li>
            <li> The bottle is glass, as is the dropper and its was securely packaged in bubble tape, so no broken anything.  </li>
            <li> Better Shea Butter is the only shea butter I use in my own natural skin care line.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> It does have a distinct smell..</li>
            <li> The dropper is really handy as you only need the smallest amount.</li>
            <li> I use only organic natural products and my skin is in great condition.</li>
            <li> My skin that already has the a pink glow most times, got even more radiant.</li>
            <li> Love this oil so far.</li>
            <li> I received the Rosehip Seed Oil last week and was looking forward to trying one of the recipes in the free eBook that I was able to download.  </li>
            <li> As far as Rosehip oils go, I&#x27;m pleased with it.</li>
            <li> The company also sent out separate instructions on how to use/store product properly and it was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> It takes about 5 minutes to feel absorbed.</li>
            <li> but it would be fun to try some of the recipes out.</li>
            <li> This is a powerful oil that should have come out of the closet along time ago.  </li>
            <li> This helps keep the oil inside fresh.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, it makes my skin so soft.</li>
            <li> It has a really nice smell, but don&#x27;t expect it to smell like actual roses.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be a person that would start using oils for a more natural approach to healing-</li>
            <li> When I initially thought about using an oil of any kind, I automatically assumed it would be greasy.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this brand, I am planning on purchasing other essential oils from them also.</li>
            <li> By the way, the RSO is very lightweight on its own and does absorb into your skin nicely, with very little greasy residue.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using their shea butter for awhile now and it is superior to all other shea butters that I have tried.</li>
            <li> Now what to use the Rosehip oil on you are wondering right?  </li>
            <li> I was right.  </li>
            <li> My skin is super sensitive and this oil leaves my face feeling smooth.</li>
            <li> I kept reading such positive things about rose hip oil</li>
            <li> It only takes maybe 8 drops total for my entire face, it absorbs perfectly, hydrates well, feels silky on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a significant oily residue.</li>
            <li> It does have a unique smell that is true to 100% pure high quality Rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the scent and like the little dispenser at the top of the bottle.</li>
            <li> It is too strong to apply directly to skin-I tried.</li>
            <li> and she said itâ€™s very gentle and</li>
            <li> Ok seriously, this stuff is amazing.</li>
            <li> The oil comes out of the bottle super concentrated, pleasant smelling, and thick.</li>
            <li> The dispenser is also great for getting the small amount or large amount needed depending on what area of skin one is using it for.</li>
            <li> At first it made my face break out</li>
            <li> Your face may break out a bit for the first week</li>
            <li> this is exactly how rosehip oil should be.</li>
            <li> This worked great as it is not too thick.  </li>
            <li> rosehip seed oil actually has a certified organic label.&lt;br /&gt;There are too many cosmetic products on Amazon that claim to be organic, but without the proof of a certified label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon</li>
            <li> I mix it with their organic shea butter to make a night cream - very healing and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> First bottle smelled like rancid fish oil.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this type of product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> funny smell, but disappears soon sfter applying</li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I had a dental appointment today and was asked what I use on my face because I look a decade younger than I am :-)</li>
            <li> It does exactly what I want...</li>
            <li> My last favorite use for it is on my stretch marks after having three kids.</li>
            <li> Will be back for more of this oil once I run out.</li>
            <li> clears up acne if uses consistently.</li>
            <li> I took before pics and will be interested in checking every 2 weeks to see if there is a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I really wish I&#x27;d known about this blessing of an oil years ago!  </li>
            <li> The first two days I did have a break out or two which made me worry a tad</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.  </li>
            <li> After my skin is back to being healthy,  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> My favorite facial oil.</li>
            <li> and I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> been using it in him religiously and his eczema is so much better.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very hopeful!</li>
            <li> and my foundation goes on smoother when I use this first.  </li>
            <li> Nice and dry, soaks in fast without being overly greasy.  </li>
            <li> Very moisturizing and just seems to drop right into the skin.</li>
            <li> We did not read how much is needed yet, so he applied 4 more drops to his face and left.</li>
            <li> The last one I used had a much stronger scent &amp; a darkish orange color, so I like this better.</li>
            <li> From what was left in my bottle, this is definitely the superior of the two options.</li>
            <li> Very ;)) customer.</li>
            <li> Anyways, I recommend this organic cold-pressed RSO to anyone and everyone, even those who have super sensitive and acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil in several different recipes for skin care products and I am very pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> The vendor is terrfic with following up and product arrived very quickly.  </li>
            <li> My skin went from being dry to being really healthy in about a week or so</li>
            <li> You can try this if you have dry skin and it will give you a more glowy complexion</li>
            <li> I will have confidence applying this to my skin knowing that this is pure rosehip seed oil and made with quality.  </li>
            <li> Pure and healthful moisturizer</li>
            <li> I tried it on dry hands and it worked great because it sinks in and isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually more conservative about my reviews, but I feel strongly that people should at least TRY this product.</li>
            <li> It is good for most all skin &amp;#34;problems&amp;#34; such as eczema, wrinkles, acne scars, dark spots and such.  </li>
            <li> This oil goes on great, soaks right in, only a small amount needed.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had to start using it on my other hand to keep them more consistent.</li>
            <li> This is very high quality Rosehip seed oil.</li>
            <li> It is a very high quality product.  </li>
            <li> Oil is very high in Vit. C and also</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great and leaves the skin feeling great but what a nasty smell.</li>
            <li> my skins looks soft, young, smooth...</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, a personal email and a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> after using for a few days my skin is amazing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend trying it!</li>
            <li> In the packaging there was also a card that had a link to a free e-book with different recipes on how to use the oil, which was an added bonus.  </li>
            <li> I have very &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; skin.  </li>
            <li> and I would say this is working very well for</li>
            <li> You really dont need much.</li>
            <li> This is very work for my skin.</li>
            <li> My face is much clearer now.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s the real deal</li>
            <li> Use it on my nails and cuticles- nails are growing and cuticles look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
            <li> It does not just claim to be but is really certified with the USDA and ECOCERT logos.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I primarily use it on a burn scar on the back of my hand, but I also like to rub it into my cuticles and nails as well.</li>
            <li> rosehip is the real deal.</li>
            <li> This oil gives all day moisture without the need to apply much.  </li>
            <li> Helped with my acne-scarring so much.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any real benefits or change in eczema while using this.  </li>
            <li> They are very affordable and fast delivery.</li>
            <li> Oil is soothing and fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> I use the oil primarily on my forehead and around the creases of my eyes where &amp;#34;crow&#x27;s feet&amp;#34; are starting to com in.</li>
            <li> Not greasy at all - seems to absorb very well.  </li>
            <li> This oil absorbs very well</li>
            <li> I really like this and will repurchase.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved complexion, pinkish healthy color that make me look young, the skin is even tighter, again giving it a younger look.</li>
            <li> I looked at him and his skin complexion had changed from the more pale look to a light pink, healthy look, like young kids have.</li>
            <li> and I am excited to use this oil after a fresh haircut to hopefully avoid the whole dry and damaged ends all together!</li>
            <li> I love the fact that this isn&#x27;t a processed product with a bunch of other junk added, it&#x27;s just pure rosehip oil.</li>
            <li> This is important to help prevent the oil from going rancid quickly, it must be stored in dark places.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Some other reviewers described it as fishy but to me it smells more earthy like soil with a hint of fish.</li>
            <li> I make my own moisturizer and this is all martial and his a long way</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a dry oil, and if you have acne or scars then this oil can transform your face, because I saw pictures of a reviewer on makeup alley, and I could not believe what it did for her face, nothing short of amazing.</li>
            <li> I love the dropper that comes with the bottle, it makes application much easier and you don&#x27;t get too much and waste it.  </li>
            <li> Today my work friend said that my skin looks more hydrated, less wrinkled.</li>
            <li> I have been told that my face has a healthy glow, and as a result, I find myself wearing less makeup.</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s important to me, because sometimes where I&#x27;m at, it so dry and arid.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s too soon to tell if my face is better off for using this, but I&#x27;ll report back later on that.</li>
            <li> The spots are not so much noticeable to others as I am just very self conscious of them.</li>
            <li> About 3-4 drops is enough to massage into my face and hands, and it absorbs quickly without my skin feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I was lucky enough to get their coupon during a promotion</li>
            <li> The packaging is definitely high quality.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product as well as buying from this company.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> but I have high hopes for this product.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend getting this product</li>
            <li> I purchased this with a promotional coupon and highly recommend it to every one suffering the wrath of the sun and age.</li>
            <li> then I highly recommend you use this oil.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this company too...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so pure and natural</li>
            <li> When I wake up in the morning my face is so soft!!</li>
            <li> Now - almost 2 weeks later my skin is soft, clear and FABULOUS.  </li>
            <li> Iâ€™ve also applied some of the oil to my face directly and it is gentle.  </li>
            <li> Really makes my face soft.</li>
            <li> Today morning, when I went to wash my face and get ready, it was the first time in a while, I looked at my face and saw the younger look</li>
            <li> So far it seems the area is having much less breakouts and those that I get are healing more</li>
            <li> I feel like I&#x27;m finally doing the right thing for my face.</li>
            <li> This being said, I only give it 1 star because the item came with the top loose and leaked all over my bag as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li> so you have plenty of ways to try your new products.</li>
            <li> but like all new skincare regimes, I wanted to give it two weeks for my skin to adjust.</li>
            <li> I tend to use it on &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; approaches - I live in the woods and get bit from time to time -</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s my new fave moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have noticed my dark spots and fine line wrinkles are gone.</li>
            <li> Not only did I receive a free sample to try but also a personal email with a updated recipe book from the Owner.</li>
            <li> And I read that organic cold pressed is the only way to go, so this is a great brand!</li>
            <li> This makes skin soft and works some wrinkles away!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive, acne prone skin normally.</li>
            <li> I have fought adult acne for 20 years now and since using this product I have had not 1 breakout!</li>
            <li> First big surprise.</li>
            <li> At first I was planning to try a Cocoa butter facial oil with Rosehips but ending up trying this</li>
            <li> I have really sensitive skin during the winter and this baby made my face glow!</li>
            <li> I was anxious to use my promotional coupon and order the Organic Rosehip Seed Oil by Better Shea Butter.</li>
            <li> The first thing I noticed when I received the package is that it comes in a brown envelope with a lot of info.in larger print on the envelope.</li>
            <li> When I first received it I opened it up and took a big inhale.</li>
            <li> I use this oil with Young Living essential oils to make a face serum that works better than any high end face products I have previously used.  .  </li>
            <li> I can see some light marks fading slightly, so I am hopeful with continued use.</li>
            <li> It actually smells exactly like a rosehip seed, and I know this because I&#x27;ve eaten wild rosehips out of the forest in the midwest</li>
            <li> This particular oil I like because it&#x27;s a lightweight oil with no other ingredients.</li>
            <li> My previous bottle was running low, so I needed to purchase some more.</li>
            <li> This oil is also perfect for those dry noses from cold season.</li>
            <li> There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and it absorbs easily into the skin.</li>
            <li> Well my very favorite thing to use it on is my unruly (or not so unruly now that I have this oil) naturally curly hair, just a few drops on towel dried locks has done wonders for my split ends and overall dryness of my hair, it does not feel or look greasy at all, even on the rare occasion that I straighten it.  </li>
            <li> I was really curious if I could improve it a little more or maintain my healthy glow for a long long time.</li>
            <li> After a few weeks I have already noticed a huge change in my skin.  </li>
            <li> (18-20) and had to take medication to clear my face up.</li>
            <li> I am left with a very luxurious and soft skin.  </li>
            <li> but almost.. I like the natural looking protective packaging the oil came in .</li>
            <li> and this one has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> and I have been looking for natural remedies.  </li>
            <li> My friend said that she has used her lotion on her sonâ€™s legs (he has sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> Most of the negative reviews are about the smell..</li>
            <li> but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it&#x27;s not.</li>
            <li> It makes my skin feel so youthful and soft.</li>
            <li> I put this directly on my face before bed.</li>
            <li> and I am still surprised to say</li>
            <li> makes skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s really given me an extra boost in my skincare routine.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hand feeling surprisingly soft and since it moisturizes, too,</li>
            <li> so I was eager to try and non invasive, no heavy chemical alternative to what my dermatologist had suggested.</li>
            <li> By the time I  got to my appointment,  the burn wasn&#x27;t sore anymore and the area had considerably lightened.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s so natural, and doesn&#x27;t need any man made chemicals to make it work.  </li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily and I wake up and skin feels so soft.</li>
            <li> If you would like an all natural product to help with anti-aging, sun damaged skin and help with scars</li>
            <li> My skin felt so soft in the morning.</li>
            <li> Prior to purchasing this product, I tried the Whole Foods brand.</li>
            <li> and I could not believe how soft his skin felt when I got him out.</li>
            <li> I was hoping to take a natural approach to heal all the acne scars and my one brown spot.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with the progress so far and hope to see continued improvement of the next few months.</li>
            <li> I mix a couple of drops with argan oil as my daily facial moisturizer and it absorbs right into the skin with no greasiness afterwards.  </li>
            <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last long anyway, and it&#x27;s mild.  </li>
            <li> This company gives you a free e book for recipes on how to use this with other beauty regimes or simply alone.  </li>
            <li> I first started using the Rosehip Seed Oil mixed in with my daily moisturizer, I noticed the redness in my face would lighten up quicker when adding the Rosehip Oil.</li>
            <li> A little bit goes a long way so this bottle last a good long time.  </li>
            <li> I have been putting a little bit on about every other night and noticing a nice difference, they are softer, not cracked and overall look</li>
            <li> It works wonderfully, sinks right in to my skins and leaves a healthy glow behind.</li>
            <li> I have used several rosehip oils from different manufactures in the past, and this is by far my favorite.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new things on my face since I have such temperamental skin</li>
            <li> I pat my face dry and apply the RSO straight.</li>
            <li> My skin isn&#x27;t flaky and dry anymore, and is much brighter in the mornings.</li>
            <li> So i have dry skin, and I don&#x27;t think it helped moisturize much for me.</li>
            <li> It has really helped with my dry areas.  </li>
            <li> I am also using it to possibly clear some facial blemishes that I developed during pregnancy.  </li>
            <li> I usually wear some make up on top of it after it dries, but doesn&#x27;t take long.</li>
            <li> I mix it with a little coconut oil and do a hot oil treatment!</li>
            <li> Within the past year, I started using more essential oils in my daily life.</li>
            <li> I also use this on my super dry hands and cuticles during the dry winters and it&#x27;s been a life saver!</li>
            <li> I will only purchase this particular product in the future.</li>
            <li> The dropper is messy and I feel like it&#x27;s very easy to waste the product by accidentally dropping oil onto the counter or having it run off your fingers.</li>
            <li> I was looking forward to writing a review to inform others on this oil since I am a fan of rosehips in general.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only used it about 2 weeks so far.</li>
            <li> I have only applied it about 4 times so far.  </li>
            <li> While there is no visible change in it&#x27;s appearance, I have noticed that the pain has completely stopped, and it occasionally itches.  </li>
            <li> So far I have made the daily moisturizer with the oil.  </li>
            <li> I have been trying to change my beauty routine to as natural as possible.  </li>
            <li> After four months of applying this to their skin daily, their wrinkles and sunspots had almost completely disappeared, and their skin had a fresher healthier look.</li>
            <li> my skin feels smother and moist , one thing i dont like is the smell , i know its natural but is it supposed to smell like its very old like if it was produced a long time ago , will not try the same brand</li>
            <li> and I am about ready to throw all of those other things away.</li>
            <li> Also, I have really bad chapped lips (thanks to living in Michigan) and have been applying Better shea butter directly to my lips...</li>
            <li> so grateful and will be using it to stay young for as long as it works.</li>
            <li> Its smell is earthy but not overwhelming or rancid, which demonstrates that this oil is fresh.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this brand of Rosehip oil and their other products.</li>
            <li> It rubs in easily &amp; does not leave any greasiness behind.  </li>
            <li> Also, the bottle informs you to keep it in a cool dark place, it comes in a dark bottle as it should and there is an online book  about uses for their products.</li>
            <li> My main interest in Rosehip oil was due to the fact that I have some red marks on my skin from messing with blemishes</li>
            <li> I also like that its not a thin consistency, its a little thicker than an oil.</li>
            <li> again cuase didnt feel new , but i will try rosehip from other brands</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 36 and slowly melting (aging) which means more wrinkles and small skin imperfections, bumps, etc, with each passing year.</li>
            <li> I am bi-racial, black and irish, and have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as part of a promotion and was interested in rosehip oil to help fade some dark spots/pigments I have from previous scarring on my face.</li>
            <li> and I notice that my skin is softer and even the creases that were above my lips are not completely gone</li>
            <li> Have not used this long enough to see a difference.</li>
            <li> would have given it 5 starts except that I have only started to use it, and the long term benefits have not yet been manifested.  </li>
            <li> I have not used this long enough to see if this will help the crows feet that are around my eyes.</li>
            <li> It is going to last a long time.</li>
            <li> The only complaint is the smell, but after having it for some time i don&#x27;t notice the smell as much.</li>
            <li> constantly feel dry.  </li>
            <li> I have had no new breakouts, and some older scars and a few melasma spots appear to be fading as well.</li>
            <li> I use my whipped shea butter every single day on my face and look forward to adding rosehip seed oil to my next batch!</li>
            <li> I feel like I have the secret to younger, glowing skin right in my medicine cabinet</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve received complements from several other people in this very short time.</li>
            <li> It has a faint, familiar scent to me, probably from mountain biking in different parts of the country.  </li>
            <li> I havenâ€™t had it for that long, so</li>
            <li> I started applying a tiny bit of the Rosehip seed oil to my hair after a shower when it is still wet.  </li>
            <li> and I can tell that My skin still feels hydrated long after that.  </li>
            <li> I decided to try it even though the idea of putting &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my face when I was breaking out seemed strange.</li>
            <li> If I use the oil regularly on my nails, I notice that it looks like I just had a manicure minus the nail polish.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also been using it on my hands and they are so soft and definitely look less \\&quot;old\\&quot; !!</li>
            <li> I plan to add this oil to my everyday body lotion to help with my sensitive, dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few weeks, specifically on my hands which are very weathered, show dark spots, &amp; tend to be quite rough.  </li>
            <li> (so I&#x27;m not using multiple oil droppers) and will add a little essential oil to that.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this to persons with dull and spotted skin.</li>
            <li> You have wrinkles and or dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have been applying this neat to both my hands and face (focusing on my winter dry lip line and forehead)</li>
            <li> They have been cracked and dry all winter.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> (if you have dry skin you will know what I am talking about).</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and using the oil before I go to bed works wonders.</li>
            <li> and I started using it as well for dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is no longer dry, has started tightening and</li>
            <li> Helped with dry skin, age spots and acne.</li>
            <li> I also use it for dry elbows, and dry lips.</li>
            <li> You only need a few drops at a time, so the bottle will last quite a while.</li>
            <li> Am with deep dark skin (around Kelly Rowland and Lupita Nyong&#x27;o complexion).</li>
            <li> But I mixed drops of it in my daily moisturizer and the raw shea butter</li>
            <li> I have very dry sensitive skin with severe hyperpigmentation on my face from years of  skin allergies, eczema, and scars from late onset acne and improperly removing facial hair due to hirsutism</li>
            <li> I bought this because coming out of this winter my skin was dry and flaky, rough texture, and had bumps cropping up everywhere.</li>
            <li> Those rough dry patches started softening up after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> My skin also feels very soft from use in my moisturizer which is much needed in this dry cold winter.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have much hope that this oil will help with my hyperpigmentation but at least my skin is not as painfully tight and dry as before.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer very dry skin</li>
            <li> The dark spots that I have from years of poor skin protection are becoming a thing of the past.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always been able to tolerate bad tastes or smells if there is a valuable benefit.  </li>
            <li> In the morning, I&#x27;ll wash with the same cleanser, but just add a few drops of the RSO to my lightweight moisturizer, so my skin doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy under my makeup.</li>
            <li> Only a few drops needed by itself.</li>
            <li> With an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; I expected it to be greasy/oily</li>
            <li> I use Rosehip Oil everyday, and I have used different brands over time.</li>
            <li> Sinks it well and no greasy after feel</li>
            <li> (you only need a few drops).  </li>
            <li> I only have to use a few drops.  </li>
            <li> Vit. E and A, Beta Carotene and Essential Fatty Acids.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy or greasy feel on your skin, and after using it twice daily since I&#x27;ve gotten it, I am seeing a difference in the skin around my eyes.</li>
            <li> My skin is acne prone, very dry after washing and proceeds to be extremely oily a few hours later.</li>
            <li> a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I love that this is Cold pressed and 100% Organic!  </li>
            <li> receiving this item, I noticed the packaging was extremely well done.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m extremely acne prone and this oil hasn&#x27;t caused any problems.</li>
            <li> I have used this for the past months as a daily routine after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t get past the smell of this oil.</li>
            <li> The uses for this product are endless.</li>
            <li> My skin actually began looking brighter and fuller a few minutes after application!</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> This helps to tone down my skin and neutralize the pink in my cheeks.  </li>
            <li> I had a few dry patches on my face, so I decided to just dab the oil on as soon as it arrived, without adding anything to it.  </li>
            <li> Plus I&#x27;m eight months and exhausted, any glow left me about 4 weeks earlier.</li>
            <li> I have a dark spot that has developed on my leg, and has seemingly caused random shooting pains from the area on a daily basis for months.  </li>
            <li> I originally planned to use this a base for a beauty serum I make with essential oils.  </li>
            <li> rosehip oil is inside a dark glass bottle.</li>
            <li> so I can keep the bottle in there, in the fridge, so it doesn&#x27;t spill and keeps it in a dark place.  </li>
            <li> I was getting depressed with dark marks and pimples on my face.</li>
            <li> The dark marks have faded out.</li>
            <li> It is a bit inconvenient to keep it in the fridge (to keep it fresh) when I need it in my room, so</li>
            <li> I researched that rosehip oil ingredients can help in the gradual fading and reduction of the dark pigments</li>
            <li> but lately I had been doing battles with different products and nothing was stopping the breakouts.</li>
            <li> I also put it on my forearms and hands for the dark spots.</li>
            <li> C provides antioxidants, anti-aging  properties, and decreases the pigment producing ability of the skin  hence helping reduce and lighten dark spots.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still not perfect, but my skin isn&#x27;t greasing up as much during the day anymore since I started using this.</li>
            <li> The only slightly negative thing I have to say is I wish they would put it in a bottle with a pump.</li>
            <li> within minutes it calmed down the need to scratch and the redness has been going away.</li>
            <li> Instead of wearing blush, I have to wear a concealer to help tone down the pinkness in my face.  </li>
            <li> I would like to take down the redness in my complexion, but its still there.  </li>
            <li> when I knocked it over and spilled a lot down the drain and that&#x27;s when I knew the</li>
            <li> so i use a very small amount once or twice daily before bed</li>
            <li> My Hands are also silky soft after feeling dry and rough with these cold temperatures.</li>
            <li> I have started wearing it day and night, just using less during the day.</li>
            <li> My nails are stronger, my cuticles have shrunk and my nails have a slight sheen even without using polish.</li>
            <li> The wrinkles are not gone, but seem to be less visible.</li>
            <li> I have less cuticles and my nail beds</li>
            <li> i have noticed a slight difference</li>
            <li> It takes just a little bit of oil and my hair looks less frizzy.  </li>
            <li> The smell is a little woody.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous that my have would feel oily</li>
            <li> Smells a little fishy but it works.</li>
            <li> correct the dark areas on my face!</li>
            <li> A little thicker than what I used to,</li>
            <li> This little bottle comes inside this little reusable zipable bag.</li>
            <li> I have also used the oil for putting on random dry spots like my elbows and any other dry skin I have.</li>
            <li> I like that it is organic, cold pressed and 100% pure.</li>
            <li> This oil is 100% pure, organic, cold pressed USDA certified, and also certified by Eco Cert.  </li>
            <li> Nowadays, I still get occasional small pimples, usually around my &amp;#34;time of the month&amp;#34;, however my skin has been looking splotchy, dull, and a bit scarred.</li>
            <li> I do not like heavy lotions or anything on my skin.  </li>
            <li> At night I apply this to my feet with a pair of fluffy socks.</li>
            <li> and I have used it a few times.  </li>
            <li> I like to add a few drops to my cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> For my hair I put just a few drops in my hands, rub my hands together and then evenly distribute it to ends of my hair.</li>
            <li> I use it on my face and don&#x27;t smell it anymore after a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to put some in my face wash, and add a few drops to my sunscreen and moisture cream.  </li>
            <li> The oil does have a very odd smell.</li>
            <li> My makeup goes on a lot smoother and my face isn&#x27;t an oily mess within an hour!</li>
            <li> Let me just start out by saying I have been ordering products from Better Shea Butter for over a year now and have never been disappointed!</li>
            <li> My son has pretty bad eczema</li>
            <li> In the past week, this has evened out tone, reduced redness, AND I see noticeably less blackheads!</li>
            <li> As for the product effectiveness... I&#x27;m not sure yet.</li>
            <li> I use the oil on my face everyday and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> when I applied it as a moisturizer, the smell of the oil was not overwhelming at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just put a small amount on my face</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m no doctor, but in my experience itching usually means healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure why though but after the layer of skin peeled off</li>
            <li> cap itself is hard plastic</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed my face has become a bit dull and blotchy since I&#x27;ve entered my 30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> people have complained about the smell of the oil.  </li>
            <li> I use a drop or two on my scar at least 2 or 3 times a day.</li>
            <li> About the smell - a lot of the negative reviews</li>
            <li> The bottle is made of tinted and thick glass.</li>
            <li> and I was so worried that just like every other thing I tried that seemed to work for everyone except for me, the RSO would fail me.</li>
            <li> You simply cannot go wrong with any item from this company!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my face nightly for the past 3 nights and can already see improvements!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this oil on my eczema (seriously itchy) patches for a week</li>
            <li> I had really bad acne when I was younger</li>
            <li> his skin hasnâ€™t broken out in a rash or anything.  </li>
            <li> but it absorbs within minutes and leaves no scent behind.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for approximately 3 weeks, once in the morning and at night, and I&#x27;m liking the results.  </li>
            <li> I use it on my face and some troubled areas I have on my legs.</li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis so during the winter it is especially bad being so dry.</li>
            <li> Id recommend this for anyone that lives in a cold area.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but I use rosehip oil on my face.</li>
            <li> I was very wrong.</li>
            <li> People are misled by the word &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; in the title, but the oil is not made from a flower, it&#x27;s made from a seed and you shouldn&#x27;t think you have a bad batch when it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses.  </li>
            <li> Replacement smelled like smoked fish. :-(</li>
            <li> say that it smells awful and like fish oil.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> This is very high quality Rosehip seed oil. Best I&#x27;ve tried so far. I will only purchase this particular product in the future.</li>
            <li> The packaging is definitely high quality. The bottle is made of tinted and thick glass. The dropper is also made of glass. As for the product effectiveness... I&#x27;m not sure yet. I&#x27;ve just been using it for ~2 weeks. So far, so good. It&#x27;s a good moisturizer and my face hasn&#x27;t had any issues with it, so I&#x27;ll keep using it. : )</li>
            <li> Lovely pure oil, wonderful on the face and hands.</li>
            <li> I just want to describe my skin before going into my review, since every person is different. I had really bad acne when I was younger (18-20) and had to take medication to clear my face up. Nowadays, I still get occasional small pimples, usually around my &amp;#34;time of the month&amp;#34;, however my skin has been looking splotchy, dull, and a bit scarred. Now, I started using the rosehip seed oil at the beginning of this month. At first it made my face break out and I was so worried that just like every other thing I tried that seemed to work for everyone except for me, the RSO would fail me. After a week to 10 days of some pimples, everything changed. The zits disappeared, my skin tone evened out, and my face looked brighter. I used to wear makeup just to cover my face, now I feel like I see my skin GLOWING through my foundation.  I&#x27;m so so happy with the RSO. I made sure to buy cold-pressed and organic, so this particular RSO was exactly what I wanted. I store mine in the refrigerator. I apply it nightly after washing my face with my organic vitamin c cleanser. I pat my face dry and apply the RSO straight. In the morning, I&#x27;ll wash with the same cleanser, but just add a few drops of the RSO to my lightweight moisturizer, so my skin doesn&#x27;t look or feel greasy under my makeup. By the way, the RSO is very lightweight on its own and does absorb into your skin nicely, with very little greasy residue. Anyways, I recommend this organic cold-pressed RSO to anyone and everyone, even those who have super sensitive and acne prone skin. Your face may break out a bit for the first week but it&#x27;s completely worth it.</li>
            <li> leaves the skin hydrated, without leaving an oily residue. Does not break me out at all. The only complaint is the smell, but after having it for some time i don&#x27;t notice the smell as much.</li>
            <li> This product combined with others from this seller along with the eBook of skincare recipes they provided, have transformed my skin. Amazing!</li>
            <li> OMG! This is great for the skin, face n body I don&#x27;t like the smell but hey! Who care when it work. Will buy again n again. Good n fast delivery. TKs. Very ;)) customer.</li>
            <li> Great rose hip oil, not too oily and penetrates very well in my skin, no smell, Great results!</li>
            <li> I am using this oil twice a day on my face and I&#x27;m so happy. My skin is super sensitive and this oil leaves my face feeling smooth. Great under sunscreen, absorbs really well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Rose Hip Oil for about a month and I notice that my skin is softer and even the creases that were above my lips are not completely gone but almost.. I like the natural looking protective packaging the oil came in . I appreciate when I called the Better Shea Butter company with a question that the girl  told me how she adds a couple drops of lavender oil to the Rose Hip Oil when she applies it to her face to make it smell awesome.</li>
            <li> I was lucky to try this Rosehip Seed Oil. It smells very clean and fresh. Feels amazing on your skin yet doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.. I used it for eczema today, mixed with a bit of their Shea Butter and essential oils, within minutes it calmed down the need to scratch and the redness has been going away. My Hands are also silky soft after feeling dry and rough with these cold temperatures. I will be adding it to my daily facial routine next and can&#x27;t wait to see what it does for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;This company is top notch. They are truly customer oriented and go out of their way to insure their customers are happy and receive quality products. Not only did I receive a free sample to try but also a personal email with a updated recipe book from the Owner. She is amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;I started using their Shea Butter months ago and it is the BEST you can find. Their Cocoa Butter is also amazing and smells delicious. I will only be buying from this Company and will be ordering again soon!</li>
            <li> I love this Rosehip Seed Oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a lighter oil so I wouldn&#x27;t use it on its own for heavy moisturizing, but it&#x27;d be a great add-in for recipes with shea butter. I tried it on dry hands and it worked great because it sinks in and isn&#x27;t greasy. At night I may slather on something stronger and greasier, but for during the day when I need to use my hands, this is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, I love Better Shea Butter as a company! I&#x27;ve been using their shea butter for awhile now and it is superior to all other shea butters that I have tried. Their products come with an amazing recipe eBook so you have plenty of ways to try your new products. I use my whipped shea butter every single day on my face and look forward to adding rosehip seed oil to my next batch!</li>
            <li> The Rosehip Oil is wonderful. Used in a face moisturizer it just absorbes quickly.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent rosehip seed oil. It has an earthy smell and rich yellow/orange color...this is exactly how rosehip oil should be. I highly recommend trying it! I use the oil on my face everyday and will continue to use it!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I could try this Rosehip oil through a promotion.  I have used several rosehip oils from different manufactures in the past, and this is by far my favorite.  I loved the packaging that it came in, it makes it easy for me to store it without the fear of a glass bottle falling and breaking as I store it in my fridge for freshness.  In the packaging there was also a card that had a link to a free e-book with different recipes on how to use the oil, which was an added bonus.  Now what to use the Rosehip oil on you are wondering right?  Well my very favorite thing to use it on is my unruly (or not so unruly now that I have this oil) naturally curly hair, just a few drops on towel dried locks has done wonders for my split ends and overall dryness of my hair, it does not feel or look greasy at all, even on the rare occasion that I straighten it.  I also use the oil for my skin instead of lotion after showers and yes that includes my face.  It never leaves a greasy film and soaks in very quickly.  I love love love Rosehip oil and this one has far exceeded my expectations.</li>
            <li> I love that this is Cold pressed and 100% Organic!  I will have confidence applying this to my skin knowing that this is pure rosehip seed oil and made with quality.  I apply this out of the shower and it soaks into my skin quickly with no oily residue.  I am left with a very luxurious and soft skin.  The fair scent is not overwhelming and makes it nice to use at night when I am resting.  This company gives you a free e book for recipes on how to use this with other beauty regimes or simply alone.  I highly recommend this product to anyone who would like to add a wonderful oil to your skin that will help with vitality and anti-aging.  I received this oil as part of a promotion.</li>
            <li> I was recently told by me Dermatologist that I have eczema and I have been looking for natural remedies.  When I saw a promotion for this Organic Rosehip Oil I decided to give it a try on my eczema patches.  I was honestly worried that I wouldn&#x27;t like the smell of the oil because I am very sensitive to smells (they give me a headache).  This oil does have a very light smell, but it is refreshing.  I&#x27;ve used this oil on my eczema (seriously itchy) patches for a week and they are almost gone!  I have gone from waking up itchy during the night to not scratching my skin.  It is amazing!  It is so nice to just rub this oil into my skin and see the benefits.  I will be making a body lotion with this oil to prevent future eczema patches.</li>
            <li> I have used this oil in several different recipes for skin care products and I am very pleased with the results. I would definitely recommend this as a nourishing addition to any skin care formula and plan to use it again. Also, very friendly and attentive customer service.</li>
            <li> I have very &amp;#34;pink&amp;#34; skin.  Instead of wearing blush, I have to wear a concealer to help tone down the pinkness in my face.  When I saw this Rosehip Oil on a discount, I thought this would be great to help with my skin.  I was right.  I do not like heavy lotions or anything on my skin.  This worked great as it is not too thick.  I put it on my cheeks at night and around my eyes for the spots that are starting to sneak up.  This helps to tone down my skin and neutralize the pink in my cheeks.  Nice and lightweight.</li>
            <li> I was very excited to receive a coupon for this product.  I have been using this for a few weeks, specifically on my hands which are very weathered, show dark spots, &amp; tend to be quite rough.  This product has made a great difference in them!  My hands are much softer, my dark spots have lightened &amp; they feel great!  I&#x27;m quite pleased!</li>
            <li> This is some awesome, therapeutic oil for skin problems. You can mix this with lanolin, olive, apricot or coconut oil to apply to your face hands or chest. At night I apply this to my feet with a pair of fluffy socks. This makes skin soft and works some wrinkles away! This came with some recipes which is an added bonus!  You have wrinkles and or dry skin. Give this a try! I got mine with a coupon but so glad I got it!</li>
            <li> I was provided a sample product for an unbiased and honest review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rosehip seed oil actually has a certified organic label.&lt;br /&gt;There are too many cosmetic products on Amazon that claim to be organic, but without the proof of a certified label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upon receiving this item, I noticed the packaging was extremely well done. I am impressed by the bubble-wrap lined paper bag that houses the glass bottle safely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosehip oil is inside a dark glass bottle. This is important to help prevent the oil from going rancid quickly, it must be stored in dark places.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap itself is hard plastic but it does not touch the oil.&lt;br /&gt;The dropper is glass. I am loving the more aesthetic and healthier option of using glass rather than plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the name is has &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; in it, do not expect it to smell like a rose.&lt;br /&gt;In my experience, I would say it smells more like tea tree; but without the minty-ness. The smell is a little woody.&lt;br /&gt;It does not get noticeable, when I applied it as a moisturizer, the smell of the oil was not overwhelming at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good moisturizer for fading acne scars or freckles.&lt;br /&gt;As with all cosmetic products, I would not say this works for everyone, please do a patch test first.&lt;br /&gt;I personally have a combination skin type and I would say this is working very well for me.&lt;br /&gt;I am getting reduced acne on the places I apply it on, and my freckles are fading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the certainty of being a organic product, this is a very good price.</li>
            <li> This is fabulous stuff!!  I mix about 3-4 drops of the Rosehip oil with 3-4 drops of organic jojoba oil and put this on my face each night before I go to bed.  After only 3 days I could already see an improvement in my complexion.  Now - almost 2 weeks later my skin is soft, clear and FABULOUS.  Cannot speak highly enough about this product.</li>
            <li> I got my sample of rosehip seed oil back in mid-December and I have used it a few times.  I&#x27;ve used it in my homemade hand lotions (with Shea Butter I bought from Better Shea Butter) and it seems to be working well!  My friend said that she has used her lotion on her sonâ€™s legs (he has sensitive skin) and she said itâ€™s very gentle and his skin hasnâ€™t broken out in a rash or anything.  Iâ€™ve also applied some of the oil to my face directly and it is gentle.  I havenâ€™t had it for that long, so my uses of it havenâ€™t been many, but I think it will turn out to be a quality product!  I know the Shea Butter is!</li>
            <li> So far so good; No skin problems using this product --- Organic Rosehip oil. Very moisturizing and just seems to drop right into the skin. I will be purchasing more and telling my friends about this.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing and the benefits to your skin are quickly and easily seen.  This product, as well as Shea Butter from Better Shea Butter comes with a recipe book- make the recipes, you will be amazed and most likely never purchase toxin filled store bought products again.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this and Shea butter.</li>
            <li> You simply cannot go wrong with any item from this company! I have been applying this neat to both my hands and face (focusing on my winter dry lip line and forehead) every day for a week and the result is soft, healthy skin! You really dont need much. I put two drops on the back of my hand and massage in. This product absorbs very very quickly and is not greasy. I personally like the smell of this rose hip oil, its just a good, natural scent, not flowery.&lt;br /&gt;I just have to say that this is a pretty amazing company. I buy my shea butter from them and honestly, I think they are the best sellers on Amazon. Fantastic communication. You can tell that they truly care about their customers and want you to have the best experience possible. Shipping? Packaging? Also top notch! You can count on any item from Better Butter to be the best!</li>
            <li> Another great product from this wonderful company. I mix it with their organic shea butter to make a night cream - very healing and moisturizing!</li>
            <li> Wonderful oil! And you see results right away :)</li>
            <li> This stuff is AMAZING! I just put a small amount on my face and I can instantly feel the moisturizing effects. Best company ever....responds to all my emails. Better Shea Butter is my new favorite brand!!!</li>
            <li> This stuff is legit. It&#x27;s the Orange toned / Amber hue oil</li>
            <li> Love this product ,love this company !!!!</li>
            <li> This is very work for my skin. I love it.</li>
            <li> This is definitely good quality rosehip oil. My oil did not smell rancid. It has helped heal some acne hyper pigmentation I had without clogging my pores. I have started wearing it day and night, just using less during the day. I&#x27;m extremely acne prone and this oil hasn&#x27;t caused any problems. I&#x27;m thankful for that and hope to see more improvement with continued use. I&#x27;ve only used it about 2 weeks so far.</li>
            <li> I have just started using this in 2 different face serums.  The quaility seems good and I&#x27;ve not had any skin issues.  The vendor is terrfic with following up and product arrived very quickly.  It&#x27;s too soon to tell if my face is better off for using this, but I&#x27;ll report back later on that.</li>
            <li> Ordered this reading all the raving reviews.. I apply the Rosehip oil during the day and Argan oil during night.. My acne scars are faded and my skin feels hydrated and supple!! So happy i made this purchase.. Most of the negative reviews are about the smell.. It does have a distinct smell.. However once you apply it to your skin its not noticeable.. To me it smells woodsy..&lt;br /&gt;Also this is truly a customer oriented company, who go out of their way to make their customers happy!! I have used their Shea butter, Cocoa butter and now the Rosehip oil.. Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the quality of the products..</li>
            <li> I love this, the packaging is great, I like that the bag is resealable so I can keep the bottle in there, in the fridge, so it doesn&#x27;t spill and keeps it in a dark place.  I had been considering trying rosehip oil so when I noticed a discount deal I was excited to get it!  I am glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[/I have been using it on two problem areas0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. My cuticles.  They have been cracked and dry all winter. I have been putting a little bit on about every other night and noticing a nice difference, they are softer, not cracked and overall look healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I have an &amp;#34;acne&amp;#34; area on my chin line and have been applying a bit there when I do my cuticles.  So far it seems the area is having much less breakouts and those that I get are healing more quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love finding a natural alternative to two cosmetic issues that works!</li>
            <li> I love this product! It leaves my face moisturized and glowing without being oily and greasy.</li>
            <li> First bottle smelled like rancid fish oil. Replacement smelled like smoked fish. :-(</li>
            <li> The Rosehip Seed Oil is very nice. Only a few drops needed by itself. I like to add a few drops to my cleanser and moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The Rose Hip oil is excellent.  I was getting depressed with dark marks and pimples on my face. I&#x27;m so blessed that I tried it. My face is much clearer now. The dark marks have faded out. They are practically gone!  I have used this for the past months as a daily routine after washing my face.</li>
            <li> I am very pleased and impressed with this particular rosehip seed oil and use it everyday.  Also, since I only use organic oils its organic certification is a big deal to me.  I have been applying organic rosehip seed oil on my face, neck, and body for awhile now and have tried many brands, so I was extremely glad to be asked to review this via a promotion and to provide my personal opinion.  I feel this is a top rate oil, its appearance and smell definitely attest to its purity.  My skin loves it, the oil soaks in completely leaving my face and neck very smooth.  I have dry skin and thus I have always been able to tell whether my skin is truly absorbing and with this oil my face feels so refreshed and happy (if you have dry skin you will know what I am talking about).</li>
            <li> I put this every night, its great on pigmentation, works to make skin even.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely buy this againðŸ˜€</li>
            <li> I simply can&#x27;t get past the smell of this oil. It&#x27;s great and leaves the skin feeling great but what a nasty smell.</li>
            <li> Been using this for a couple of weeks - 6 drops at night over some of my nightly moisturiser. Works beautifully. Wake up with skin feeling soft and pleasant to touch. The smell is nutty, not like roses FYI. Great inexpensive beauty product.</li>
            <li> Love it... works great on scars</li>
            <li> I have only used the oil for about a week. I use it on my face and some troubled areas I have on my legs. I look forward to seeing many improvements and love the holistic approach in taking care of my skin.</li>
            <li> This is my first time trying this type of product. I picked it up during a promotional period &amp; thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I am impressed so far. With an &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; I expected it to be greasy/oily but I was pleasantly surprised to find out that it&#x27;s not. I tried this because it says it helps eczema &amp; acne scars. It feels so good on my skin, so smooth &amp; absorbs easily. I have only been using for about a week so will need to report back on whether it improves the scarring. I am able to go ahead and say that this product does sooth my eczema - I have a spot on my finger that makes it uncomfortable to wear my wedding ring but since using this product it is improving. I have immediate relief from the itching when I apply this rosehip oil.  I would def recommend this product to a friend.</li>
            <li> LOVE!!! I use this on my face daily. My face feels amazing!! Highly recommend!!</li>
            <li> Have not used this long enough to see a difference. ..funny smell, but disappears soon sfter applying</li>
            <li> I have had no problems with breakouts with this oil.  It is a bit inconvenient to keep it in the fridge (to keep it fresh) when I need it in my room, so sometimes I forget to use it.  It moisturizes and I combine it with a couple drops of argan oil from Beauty By Earth which is affordable and versatile!  I would like to take down the redness in my complexion, but its still there.  It&#x27;s smoother though.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly like the smell, but it&#x27;s incredibly moisturizing and makes my skin glow.</li>
            <li> The oil is great. Thanks. Will definitely order again.</li>
            <li> This Rosehip Seed Oil is great quality!  It is very moisurizing without being greasy and is a great addition to whipped shea butter lotion recipe.  It is also great alone as a serum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything I have ordered from this company has been fantastic quality.</li>
            <li> First of all, I love this company. Their customer service is outstanding! I&#x27;ve worked in customer service and know what it takes to make customers happy. They have never failed to get back to me if I tried to reach them and were always so nice! Second of all, this rosehip seed oil is great!!! The smell is pretty strong but I don&#x27;t mind at all!! It goes away when it&#x27;s applied and only reassures me it&#x27;s the real deal ;) Literally, an hour after I put it on, I noticed a difference in the evenness of my skin. I highly recommend this product as well as buying from this company. They will not disappoint.!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been very impressed so far. I have been using this rosehip oil morning and evening for about 2 weeks. I have sensitive, acne prone skin normally. I use 5 drops in the morning and have no problems applying my makeup, or any excess oiliness. In the evenings I use about 10 drops. I have had no new breakouts, and some older scars and a few melasma spots appear to be fading as well. I&#x27;m very happy with this oil and will be sure to keep a supply of it always.</li>
            <li> Love love love this stuff! Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  Nice and dry, soaks in fast without being overly greasy.  And the packaging is pretty cute too.</li>
            <li> Many thanks for a great oil!!!  It works well on my skin!</li>
            <li> im using it for almost 2 months now , i have oily skin so i use a very small amount once or twice daily before bed or after i remove my makeup, result: my skin feels smother and moist , one thing i dont like is the smell , i know its natural but is it supposed to smell like its very old like if it was produced a long time ago , will not try the same brand again cuase didnt feel new , but i will try rosehip from other brands</li>
            <li> Skin feels silky, not oily. Gives radiant quality</li>
            <li> I was a little nervous that my have would feel oily but it doesn&#x27;t! This is a great product!</li>
            <li> The best rose hip seed oil ever!! I&#x27;m ordering more soon!</li>
            <li> I love the oil! It makes my skin feel so youthful and soft. I mix it with pomegranate seed oil &amp; essential oils at night. When I wake up in the morning my face is so soft!! I&#x27;ll keep using it on my face.</li>
            <li> Lovely and great quality. Wonderful price point</li>
            <li> I love this oil! I use it in my night time face cream. Perfect amount of moisturizing goodness!</li>
            <li> Just received several products and I am in love! I put this directly on my face before bed. Also, I have really bad chapped lips (thanks to living in Michigan) and have been applying Better shea butter directly to my lips...amazing! UPDATE: I&#x27;ve been using Organic Rosehip Oil by Better Shea Butter now for about 1 month. I have fought adult acne for 20 years now and since using this product I have had not 1 breakout! I couldn&#x27;t be happier to be 41 and have skin this beautiful! Thank you Better Shea Butter for providing such awesome, pure products!!</li>
            <li> Love it! Use it on my nails and cuticles- nails are growing and cuticles look so much better.&lt;br /&gt;Also using on my face-great moisturizer! Highly recommend:)</li>
            <li> I use Rosehip Oil everyday, and I have used different brands over time. This &amp;#34;Better Shea Butter&amp;#34; oil is very nice. It is pure ( no additive) and genuine Rosehip Oil, with its distinct smell and color. Its smell is earthy but not overwhelming or rancid, which demonstrates that this oil is fresh. Also, this oil is certified organic. It does not just claim to be but is really certified with the USDA and ECOCERT logos. The product came in a nice brown paper packaging and in a amber color glass bottle. The cute packaging makes this oil a nice gift for somebody interested in natural products.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t clog pores or break me out. Use it as a moisturer, doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling greasy.</li>
            <li> I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Been using Rosehip Seed Oil and I am so excited about my results. I like using this oil on my nails, hair and skin. My nails were brittle so I started massaging the cuticles with just a couple drops of Rosehip oil every night before going to bed. What a difference I have noticed. My nails are stronger, my cuticles have shrunk and my nails have a slight sheen even without using polish. For my hair I put just a few drops in my hands, rub my hands together and then evenly distribute it to ends of my hair. It takes just a little bit of oil and my hair looks less frizzy.  For my face I apply it after washing.  I love how it absorbs into my skin.  My face is starting to look healthier and show improvement.  I am glad I had the opportunity to get this during a promotional offer. I highly recommend this product. I like that it is organic, cold pressed and 100% pure.</li>
            <li> I love this Rosehip oil. I use it every evening,  there are no greasy film left on my skin after using rosehip. I like that it&#x27;s all organic, it smell nice and fresh. I do need to tell you I did receive this product with a discount. I will keep my bathroom stocked. Even without the discount this is still a very good price. I have noticed my dark spots and fine line wrinkles are gone. It&#x27;s not only affordable, it works.</li>
            <li> When I received a coupon for this item I was thrilled to try it. This is probably the best rosehip seed oil I&#x27;ve found. It has an amazing consistency. The dropper is really handy as you only need the smallest amount. I use this oil on my face and cuticles mostly. I&#x27;ve seen great results and it absorbs quickly. I love the fact that this isn&#x27;t a processed product with a bunch of other junk added, it&#x27;s just pure rosehip oil. If you are looking for a great moisturizer for your skin - look no further!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this oil for about a week. I&#x27;ve noticed my face has become a bit dull and blotchy since I&#x27;ve entered my 30&#x27;s. I wanted to try it to even out and brighten my skin tone. I mix 4-6 drops into my nightly wrinkle prevention cream. I had a dental appointment today and was asked what I use on my face because I look a decade younger than I am :-) I&#x27;ve received complements from several other people in this very short time. I am bi-racial, black and irish, and have sensitive skin. Hope this review influences anyone reading it to try this out! I can&#x27;t imagine you&#x27;l be anything but very happy.</li>
            <li> My skin loves this rosehip oil. I have dry skin and using the oil before I go to bed works wonders. :) highly recommend</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite oils. I struggle with acne and have lots of scarring. This oil is fading the scars and healing my acne! Great product, thank you Better Shea Butter!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to receive this Rosehip seed oil during a promotional period.  I live in an incredibly hot and dry climate and am always searching for the perfect moisturizer that will hydrate my skin without leaving it greasy.  This oil is awesome!! It does exactly what I want...no greasy after feeling but my skin is feeling great.  I am also using it to possibly clear some facial blemishes that I developed during pregnancy.  Two years after the baby was born and the spots haven&#x27;t gone away on their own.  It is too soon to tell if this oil is working in that department but I&#x27;ll try to update once the oil has had enough time to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to my skin, I&#x27;m also using this oil on my hair.  I have curly (frizzy) hair and the ends constantly feel dry.  I started applying a tiny bit of the Rosehip seed oil to my hair after a shower when it is still wet.  I can already tell a difference and I am excited to use this oil after a fresh haircut to hopefully avoid the whole dry and damaged ends all together!</li>
            <li> This is the highest quality Rosehip Oil you can buy! The oil comes out of the bottle super concentrated, pleasant smelling, and thick. The uses for this product are endless. I, personally, use this on my hair to prevent drying and split ends. I mix it with a little coconut oil and do a hot oil treatment! I also use this on my super dry hands and cuticles during the dry winters and it&#x27;s been a life saver! My last favorite use for it is on my stretch marks after having three kids. I notice my skin not only looks healthier, but it looks like it&#x27;s starting to tighten up. Thank you so much for this wonderful, fast shipping product. I received this product as a promotion, this is my review. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> very nice moisturizing oil. Really makes my face soft.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil for over a month now and very pleased with it. It does have a unique smell that is true to 100% pure high quality Rosehip oil. I mostly have been adding 5-6 drops of this Rosehip oil to argan oil and using on my face at night after washing. It works wonderfully, sinks right in to my skins and leaves a healthy glow behind. I also starting experimenting with using it in scars on my body and so far so good! I highly recommend this brand of Rosehip oil and their other products. I&#x27;ve already repeatedly bought their shea butter. Will be back for more of this oil once I run out.</li>
            <li> I bought this oil because it boasts skin regenerating properties of omega oils,  Vit A and Vit C, which as I understand, helps to turn over skin cells and improves collagen production.  I have a dark spot that has developed on my leg, and has seemingly caused random shooting pains from the area on a daily basis for months.  So I started applying this oil to it.  I have only applied it about 4 times so far.  While there is no visible change in it&#x27;s appearance, I have noticed that the pain has completely stopped, and it occasionally itches.  The itch goes away after I scratch it.  I&#x27;m no doctor, but in my experience itching usually means healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have complained about the smell of the oil.  It does not smell that great, but it&#x27;s not a problem for me.  I&#x27;ve always been able to tolerate bad tastes or smells if there is a valuable benefit.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last long anyway, and it&#x27;s mild.  I only notice it if I stick my nose in it. The oil absorbs very quickly and does not leave me feeling slimy.  I am also using it on my face, and the back of my hands.  I received the product promptly and the packaging is very nice.  I am happy with the product so far.  I would order again from this company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have given it 5 starts except that I have only started to use it, and the long term benefits have not yet been manifested.  Time will tell. It may deserve 5 stars but I cannot yet tell.</li>
            <li> I use only organic natural products and my skin is in great condition. I was really curious if I could improve it a little more or maintain my healthy glow for a long long time. I have never used any Rose hip oil before by itself. As soon as I received it my husband was putting it on HIS face. He looked in the mirror then turned around to me and said: I do not see anything different yet. I said, well, maybe you did not use enough. We did not read how much is needed yet, so he applied 4 more drops to his face and left. I continued working and about 15 min later my husband come back to show me his face. He said, it is doing something, I can feel it on my skin. I looked at him and his skin complexion had changed from the more pale look to a light pink, healthy look, like young kids have. First big surprise. I used it before bed and I am still surprised to say, the product improved my skin instantly, well, it actually took about 20 min. for visible results. My skin that already has the a pink glow most times, got even more radiant. I have only used it for about 3 days by now and every day I see improvements. My skin has improved complexion, pinkish healthy color that make me look young, the skin is even tighter, again giving it a younger look. I do not use make up on my face, but I do use some make up on my eyes every day. Today morning, when I went to wash my face and get ready, it was the first time in a while, I looked at my face and saw the younger look and I thought to myself, I do not want to do or add anything to this, it looks so beautiful already, did not even want to put make up on my eyes, I was so much enjoying the young, refreshed look. And by the way, it needs just about 2 drops of oil. :) It works great for us, we love it. Seems my skin needed it and is thanking me by looking so GOOD.</li>
            <li> clears up acne if uses consistently. makes skin incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> I will definitely purchase this again.  I have noticed improvement in wrinkles and the texture of my skin.</li>
            <li> Excellent product and service</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a good month now. a little goes a long way. seems to help with any irritations and I had a hive break out and it seemed to  relieve it. I use a drop nightly with my Vitamin C serum and seems to be working well..</li>
            <li> Love this oil so far. I&#x27;ve been mixing it with essential oils and using jojoba as a carrier. I think it&#x27;s really given me an extra boost in my skincare routine. Very satisfied so far.</li>
            <li> Love this rose hip seed oil! Beautifully packaged and great seller, thank you very much!</li>
            <li> Good oil, very little scent, good for Ayurveda~ :-)</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t get the ebook, please send link. Thank you</li>
            <li> I just received my Rose hip Oil and I love it.  The smell is clean plus you know this is true unrefined rose hip oil by the color, unrefined rosehip oil is an orange color and this rosehip oil is orange.  I love it, very light on my skin and makes my face feel nourished :)  Thank you</li>
            <li> I originally planned to use this a base for a beauty serum I make with essential oils.  I had a few dry patches on my face, so I decided to just dab the oil on as soon as it arrived, without adding anything to it.  Within 3 days of using the oil at night only, the patches had cleared.  Sinks it well and no greasy after feel (you only need a few drops).  I&#x27;ve been using this oil for well over a month now and I LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> This oil goes on great, soaks right in, only a small amount needed. My skin feels nourished and healthy after application. My make up can go right on top for the day. Smells similar to a vitamin e oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to edit this review: it&#x27;s been 3 days and my skin looks so good. I feel like I&#x27;m finally doing the right thing for my face. I&#x27;m 36 and slowly melting (aging) which means more wrinkles and small skin imperfections, bumps, etc, with each passing year. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In three days with this rose hip oil my skins looks soft, young, smooth...I feel like it&#x27;s glowing with youth. Now, I&#x27;m 8 months pregnant but I was pregnant 3 days ago and did not look like this. Plus I&#x27;m eight months and exhausted, any glow left me about 4 weeks earlier. Today my work friend said that my skin looks more hydrated, less wrinkled. Music to my ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m  so grateful and will be using it to stay young for as long as it works. (After that I&#x27;ll get a face lift). I recommend trying this if you&#x27;re looking for results similar to mine. I&#x27;m usually more conservative about my reviews, but I feel strongly that people should at least TRY this product.</li>
            <li> Subtle but great smell, absorbs quickly, and is overall a great product. Also, the owner of Better Shea Butter is fantastic and always answers emails quickly if ever any problems and is super sweet.</li>
            <li> I received the Rosehip Seed Oil last week and was looking forward to trying one of the recipes in the free eBook that I was able to download.  So far I have made the daily moisturizer with the oil.  The resulting moisturizer feels great on my skin and I am looking forward to the long term benefits!</li>
            <li> I have been using this every night on my face about 4-5 drops for and it is great!! I love the fact that is does not have a strong over powering smell and is not a heavy oil and does not leave a oil feeling after use. I have also used it has a carrier oil for my son&#x27;s adhd and sleepy time oils!! Very pleased to try this oil out!!</li>
            <li> Rosehip Oil has been part of my daily beauty routine for several months now. I primarily use it on a burn scar on the back of my hand, but I also like to rub it into my cuticles and nails as well. My previous bottle was running low, so I needed to purchase some more. I came across a coupon for this one, so I decided to give the Better Shea Butter brand a try. The oil is a golden color &amp; does have a mild scent. It reminds me of olive oil.  As far as Rosehip oils go, I&#x27;m pleased with it. The last one I used had a much stronger scent &amp; a darkish orange color, so I like this better. I use a drop or two on my scar at least 2 or 3 times a day. It rubs in easily &amp; does not leave any greasiness behind.  It leaves my hand feeling surprisingly soft and since it moisturizes, too, the skin on the back of my hand is looking younger. I&#x27;ve had to start using it on my other hand to keep them more consistent. It gives my fingernails a nice, natural shine. Over the course of several months, my burn scar has diminished. It&#x27;s still visible, but has definitely lightened up quite a bit.</li>
            <li> I ordered this product as part of a promotion and was interested in rosehip oil to help fade some dark spots/pigments I have from previous scarring on my face. The spots are not so much noticeable to others as I am just very self conscious of them. I researched that rosehip oil ingredients can help in the gradual fading and reduction of the dark pigments so I was eager to try and non invasive, no heavy chemical alternative to what my dermatologist had suggested. Just based off a weeks use I am pleased with how easy it is to apply and soaks in without being greasy or not pleasing to my skin. I took before pics and will be interested in checking every 2 weeks to see if there is a noticeable difference.</li>
            <li> I really wish I&#x27;d known about this blessing of an oil years ago!  Man...knowledge is power!</li>
            <li> I bought this during a promotional period and found the rose hip oil AMAZING for helping with my dry hands. I put it on at night with my moisturizing gloves and by morning my hands are well taken care of. I have also used the oil for putting on random dry spots like my elbows and any other dry skin I have. Id recommend this for anyone that lives in a cold area. Even in a warm area if one gets too much sun that can dry the skin out and the rose hip oil is great to help that too. The dispenser is also great for getting the small amount or large amount needed depending on what area of skin one is using it for.</li>
            <li> Summer definitely changed my skin and this was the best medicine. Goes on great and doesn&#x27;t apply too oily. I usually wear some make up on top of it after it dries, but doesn&#x27;t take long. My skin went from being dry to being really healthy in about a week or so</li>
            <li> Smells a little fishy but it works.</li>
            <li> This Rosehip Oil is wonderful! At first I was planning to try a Cocoa butter facial oil with Rosehips but ending up trying this and I&#x27;m very glad I did! I&#x27;ve used this on my face nightly for the past 3 nights and can already see improvements! My skin actually began looking brighter and fuller a few minutes after application! It only takes maybe 8 drops total for my entire face, it absorbs perfectly, hydrates well, feels silky on the skin and doesn&#x27;t leave a significant oily residue. I also like that its not a thin consistency, its a little thicker than an oil. I&#x27;m still prone to acne but it doesn&#x27;t seem to cause me any breakouts, in fact I think its helping to heal the acne I have as well as correct the dark areas on my face! I was so excited to receive this with a promotional coupon.</li>
            <li> I have been trying to change my beauty routine to as natural as possible.  I have done a lot of research about facial oils.  I came across an article about rosehip oil, and I am so glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such a great moisturizer.  I only have to use a few drops.  After a few weeks I have already noticed a huge change in my skin.  My fine lines are almost gone, my breakouts are clearing, and my skin is glowing!  This is truly my beauty miracle that I have been searching for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This rosehip is the real deal. It is a very high quality product.  After all my research on what to look for in a great oil, I found the perfect one.  I will definitely be purchasing again.</li>
            <li> This oil gives all day moisture without the need to apply much.  I use this after I shower in the morning and I can tell that My skin still feels hydrated long after that.  A little bit goes a long way so this bottle last a good long time.  I love the dropper that comes with the bottle, it makes application much easier and you don&#x27;t get too much and waste it.  I received this as part of a promotion and all opinions are my own.</li>
            <li> I recently began using this product in hopes of it helping with my combination skin on my face. I have yet to find a moisturizer that will hydrate my skin and not leave it greasy. I first started using the Rosehip Seed Oil mixed in with my daily moisturizer, I noticed the redness in my face would lighten up quicker when adding the Rosehip Oil. I recently starting using the Rosehip Seed Oil alone on the mornings and it is amazing! My makeup goes on a lot smoother and my face isn&#x27;t an oily mess within an hour! I plan to add this oil to my everyday body lotion to help with my sensitive, dry skin. The smell is not my favorite, but I noticed it does not linger. I use it on my face and don&#x27;t smell it anymore after a few minutes. I am very happy that I was able to receive this Rosehip oil as part of a promotion, the company has great communication, I will be a repeat customer for sure!</li>
            <li> I add this to a cream I make for my daughter with eczema. It has been great for her and I started using it as well for dry skin. Wonderful products from this vendor.</li>
            <li> I am so happy I purchased this. I love how my skin looks and feels.  I almost cried (what?) when I knocked it over and spilled a lot down the drain and that&#x27;s when I knew the I loved it.  :)  The company also sent out separate instructions on how to use/store product properly and it was a nice touch.</li>
            <li> Love the Rosehip oil. Great seller!</li>
            <li> I LOVE ROSEHIP SEED OIL.  My skin feels awesome.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m always hesitant to try new things on my face since I have such temperamental skin but lately I had been doing battles with different products and nothing was stopping the breakouts. I kept reading such positive things about rose hip oil I decided to try it even though the idea of putting &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; on my face when I was breaking out seemed strange. SO STOKED. I only use this at night as my nighttime moisturizer mixed with a drop of essential oil. The first two days I did have a break out or two which made me worry a tad but like all new skincare regimes, I wanted to give it two weeks for my skin to adjust. Well I didn&#x27;t need two weeks, just 3 days. The break outs shrank, my skin tone is becoming more even and I feel like my face glows. I use a light dusting of face powder in the morning for my makeup now and that&#x27;s it. Love this stuff. And I read that organic cold pressed is the only way to go, so this is a great brand!</li>
            <li> I bought this because coming out of this winter my skin was dry and flaky, rough texture, and had bumps cropping up everywhere. I&#x27;ve been using this every night for almost two weeks, and can see visible changes in my skin. My skin isn&#x27;t flaky and dry anymore, and is much brighter in the mornings. The texture is more even, and I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts as a result of using this. I had some hyperpigmentation from acne scars, and this seems to be speeding up recovery. I&#x27;ve even added some to my body lotion, hoping that it may help with the nicks and ingrown hair bumps I&#x27;ve got on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put three drops in my palms, warm it up, and pat it over my face, neck, and chest. It takes about 5 minutes to feel absorbed. I will definitely be purchasing when this bottle runs out. Thanks!</li>
            <li> Great company and great product! I have very dry sensitive skin with severe hyperpigmentation on my face from years of  skin allergies, eczema, and scars from late onset acne and improperly removing facial hair due to hirsutism (I hit the genetic lottery lol). I&#x27;m allergic to roses but take vitamin C with rosehips daily, so I decided to give this a try.  The oil does have a very odd smell. Some other reviewers described it as fishy but to me it smells more earthy like soil with a hint of fish. If you are very sensitive to odors you may not be able to use it because it is very strong.  I&#x27;ve only had it for a couple of weeks but I have high hopes for this product. I&#x27;m Af. Am with deep dark skin (around Kelly Rowland and Lupita Nyong&#x27;o complexion). I experienced some peeling... I&#x27;m not entirely sure why though but after the layer of skin peeled off I noticed that my skin looked brighter and felt moisturized. I don&#x27;t have much hope that this oil will help with my hyperpigmentation but at least my skin is not as painfully tight and dry as before.  I may update this review at a later date.</li>
            <li> This is my first time using this product.  I&#x27;d burnt my face using glycolic exfoliating pads I bought from cvs.  Made an appointment with the dermatologist and of course it was weeks away, so I looked up some essential oils that could help.  Rosehip seed oil seemed to be what I needed, and the reviews were excellent.  I actually had my appointment moved up but before I did,  I started using this product mixed with a bit of shea butter. The difference a week made was amazing to me!  The area I damaged made me look like I had five o clock shadow,  I wouldn&#x27;t leave the house without makeup.  It was still discolored but was healing quickly.  By the time I  got to my appointment,  the burn wasn&#x27;t sore anymore and the area had considerably lightened.  After my skin is back to being healthy,  I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> My main interest in Rosehip oil was due to the fact that I have some red marks on my skin from messing with blemishes and I had read that Rosehip oil helped with those marks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has definitely made a noticeable difference in the marks in a short period of time, along with healing and moisturizing my skin.  A little goes a long way! About 3-4 drops is enough to massage into my face and hands, and it absorbs quickly without my skin feeling greasy. The last Rosehip oil I used actually seemed to make my skin flake, but I haven&#x27;t had any issues at all with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very impressed with this oil and will continue to use this brand. I definitely recommend it!</li>
            <li> So i have dry skin, and I don&#x27;t think it helped moisturize much for me. I bought it for the vitamin A content to just help my skin tone over all.  It&#x27;s a dry oil, and if you have acne or scars then this oil can transform your face, because I saw pictures of a reviewer on makeup alley, and I could not believe what it did for her face, nothing short of amazing. You can try this if you have dry skin and it will give you a more glowy complexion but I have to use a moisturizer with it for sure.  There was a study on this oil in 1988 on twenty women between the ages of 25 and 35 with extensive premature aging to their skin. Their skin was wrinkled, and had sunspots from overexposure to the sun. After four months of applying this to their skin daily, their wrinkles and sunspots had almost completely disappeared, and their skin had a fresher healthier look. This is because rose hip seed oil is suppose to regenerate the skin from trans-retinoic acid found in the oil. I have not used this long enough to see if this will help the crows feet that are around my eyes. I don&#x27;t have deep lines more like fine lines but am hoping this will help gradually with that.</li>
            <li> This makes my skin softer than you could ever imagine. My favorite facial oil. Helped with my acne-scarring so much. I&#x27;m re-buying it today :)</li>
            <li> I made some anti-aging face cream using this a couple weeks ago and I&#x27;ve been using it on my face every day. I can see a noticeable difference around my eyes. The wrinkles are not gone, but seem to be less visible. I&#x27;ve also been using it on my hands and they are so soft and definitely look less \\&quot;old\\&quot; !!</li>
            <li> Love it! Already want to order more!</li>
            <li> Works great.  Feels good on my skin.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed any real benefits or change in eczema while using this.  Works just like grapeseed or almond oil. It does absorb into the skin, but nothing special.</li>
            <li> It arrived quickly and packaged in a sealed brown envelope. If you know anything about this oil then you know it must be kept cool and out of the light otherwise it will turn rancid. It also does not smell like roses but like oil. If you want it to smell good you have to add your own fragrance. It is very good quality and I will definitely be purchasing more.</li>
            <li> A little thicker than what I used to, but my face loves it!</li>
            <li> Love it! My skin improved within a week.</li>
            <li> Works well for my acne scars. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Organic Rosehip Seed Oil on my face for about a week now and I&#x27;ve got to tell you I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suffer very dry skin and I have the beginnings of wrinkles at the corners of my eyes. Since I started putting this on my face I&#x27;ve noticed my skin is no longer dry, has started tightening and improving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use 4 to 6 drops of the Rosehip Seed Oil on my face daily. It is very light and absorbs quickly (it is not heavy or oily like coconut oil). It has a light earthy oil smell that dissipates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with an ebook of recipes. I haven&#x27;t looked through this yet but it would be fun to try some of the recipes out.</li>
            <li> I am really in love with this organic rosehip seed oil.  I mix a couple of drops with argan oil as my daily facial moisturizer and it absorbs right into the skin with no greasiness afterwards.  It has an earthy scent that I quite like.  It&#x27;s so pure and natural and I don&#x27;t care for scented products so this suits me fine.  I plan to make a mix of a couple of oils for a facial oil (so I&#x27;m not using multiple oil droppers) and will add a little essential oil to that.  I highly recommend getting this product - I know I&#x27;ll be using it for years and years.</li>
            <li> Let me just start out by saying I have been ordering products from Better Shea Butter for over a year now and have never been disappointed! All of the products are the best quality out there. This organic cold-pressed rosehip oil is truly remarkable, I have been having some eczema on my hands and arms this winter and after using rosehip oil even just once it has dramatically cleared up! I also put it on my face after washing but before using my night shea cream, it made my face look smoother and feel softer! I plan to add into my next batch of shea cream. I feel like I have the secret to younger, glowing skin right in my medicine cabinet and it&#x27;s because of Isabella&#x27;s products!  They are very affordable and fast delivery. I love this company!!!</li>
            <li> Better Shea Butter is an amazing company and this rosehip seed oil is terrific. I use it with the Shea Butter and my skin has never been happier. It is light and has a clean scent and when used alone, it soaks into my face with no oily shine.  LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> Product is as described.  Excellent seller.  Goes on smooth and not greasy.</li>
            <li> Has a smell thay I dont care for bit it soothess my scalp.</li>
            <li> This was amazing. Helped with dry skin, age spots and acne. This will be a staple in my home!</li>
            <li> This is a powerful oil that should have come out of the closet along time ago.  It&#x27;s so natural, and doesn&#x27;t need any man made chemicals to make it work.  Too many products these days have so many chemicals that the skin doesn&#x27;t need.  Am doing a lot more investigating as to how many more ways to use this oil.  Just Fabulous!</li>
            <li> So excited I got my oil today!! So glad I got in on this promo.  I use it as a carrier oil for my essential oils. I love that it came with a dropper!!  Makes precise use easier. I also am in love with the packaging. CUTE!!!  Oil is soothing and fast absorbing.</li>
            <li> Rosehip seed oil is the best product I have used on my skin. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t really smell pleasant at all, but I just use it with a nice smelling facial cream.</li>
            <li> Within the past year, I started using more essential oils in my daily life. I use oils in diffusers in my house and in my classroom. I dilute some and use as perfume. I may use them for remedies such as canker sores. And now, with Rosehip Seed Oil I am able to extend my oil use to skincare. I use the Rosehip Oil on my nails and on my face, and I have noticed a significant difference. If I use the oil regularly on my nails, I notice that it looks like I just had a manicure minus the nail polish. I have less cuticles and my nail beds look incredibly healthy. I use the oil primarily on my forehead and around the creases of my eyes where &amp;#34;crow&#x27;s feet&amp;#34; are starting to com in. I have been told that my face has a healthy glow, and as a result, I find myself wearing less makeup. (Purchased with a coupon)</li>
            <li> Nice feeling, nice smell, smooth skin - what&#x27;s not to like?  I love that it&#x27;s organic.  Not greasy at all - seems to absorb very well.  Beginning to get some wrinkles around the eyes and hope it helps alleviate or otherwise diminish.  I tend to use it on &amp;#34;spot&amp;#34; approaches - I live in the woods and get bit from time to time - seems to actually work as a healing agent as well.  I love that!  Received at discount for honest review, and I can honestly recommend.</li>
            <li> awesome product.. does lighten darks marks and acne scars, with persistent use your scars will fade</li>
            <li> First off for me is packaging, I am a sucker for a great package! This little bottle comes inside this little reusable zipable bag. This helps keep the oil inside fresh. Opening the bottle, the oil smells sooo fresh! I love the smell, it makes my skin so soft. It has really helped with my dry areas.  I have been using it on my face, it absorbs quickly and leaves no oily or greasy feeling or residue.  I am very impressed with this brand, I am planning on purchasing other essential oils from them also. Organic is also a plus in my book! Purchased during a promotional period. Thanks!</li>
            <li> This Rose Hip Oil is fantastic! As soon as I got it I started applying it around my eyes. Already I am noticing my fine lines easing. I am so happy I grabbed this during a sale.  I have also been using this in my sons eczema. Those rough dry patches started softening up after 2 uses. I have sense been using it in him religiously and his eczema is so much better. This oil is also perfect for those dry noses from cold season. Thank you for this great versatile product, we are in love!</li>
            <li> This is a must in every woman&#x27;s facial care kit. A little goes a long way. It is going to last a long time. Not only do I put it on by it self. But I also added it to my favorite face cream. The dark spots that I have from years of poor skin protection are becoming a thing of the past. Which is where it belongs. I also put it on my forearms and hands for the dark spots. It absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy feeling. I purchased this with a promotional coupon and highly recommend it to every one suffering the wrath of the sun and age.</li>
            <li> A beautiful addition to my home made face ad body cream - Love it.</li>
            <li> Ok seriously, this stuff is amazing. I have really sensitive skin during the winter and this baby made my face glow! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months and it&#x27;s my new fave moisturizer. It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling oily and I wake up and skin feels so soft. I&#x27;ll never use anything else again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a licensed skin esthetician and I cannot tell you enough how much I love this product! I&#x27;ve known for many years how beneficial rosehip seed oil is and I am always recommending this to all my friends. I was lucky enough to get their coupon during a promotion so I jumped at the chance to buy it. Rosehip seed oil has been used for centuries by the Indians of the Chilean Andes to treat burned and damaged skin. The benefits of this oil are really great and can be used on almost all skin conditions to help balance and restore the skin&#x27;s acid mantle. This particular oil I like because it&#x27;s a lightweight oil with no other ingredients. There&#x27;s no strong fragrance and it absorbs easily into the skin. I also use it on my dry frizzy hair and it works so awesome on my hair too! If you would like an all natural product to help with anti-aging, sun damaged skin and help with scars then I highly recommend you use this oil. Your skin will thank you!</li>
            <li> I was anxious to use my promotional coupon and order the Organic Rosehip Seed Oil by Better Shea Butter. I was looking forward to writing a review to inform others on this oil since I am a fan of rosehips in general.  I drink rosehip tea a lot.  This oil is made from the seeds of Rosa Canina, a wild climbing rose, found in South America.  The first thing I noticed when I received the package is that it comes in a brown envelope with a lot of info.in larger print on the envelope. I could read the information I needed to know without getting a magnifying glass to read the bottle.  This oil is 100% pure, organic, cold pressed USDA certified, and also certified by Eco Cert.  It&#x27;s as good as it gets.  This is what I look for  in something going on my skin.  It is good for most all skin &amp;#34;problems&amp;#34; such as eczema, wrinkles, acne scars, dark spots and such.  I am blessed with almost flawless skin and few wrinkles and I&#x27;d like to keep it that way.  Rosehip Seed  Oil is very high in Vit. C and also Vit. E and A, Beta Carotene and Essential Fatty Acids. The Vit. C provides antioxidants, anti-aging  properties, and decreases the pigment producing ability of the skin  hence helping reduce and lighten dark spots. This oil is light and easy absorbable. I need it as I age to help prevent more wrinkles ,help with &amp;#34;age&amp;#34; spots, and keep my skin healthy in general.  It has been doing a good job.  Also, I wanted a light oil to put on my face before using my light mineral make-up to be a sort of seal for the make-up and protection for my face.  This Rosehip Seed Oil by Better Shea Butter works well.  For these reasons I gave it 5 stars and I would buy it again.  Also, the bottle informs you to keep it in a cool dark place, it comes in a dark bottle as it should and there is an online book  about uses for their products.</li>
            <li> I received this rose hip oil as a part of a promotion, and I can say I am glad I purchased! This stuff is said to do amazing things for wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, etc. I am using in hopes to reduce marks on my face and some sun spots. I can see some light marks fading slightly, so I am hopeful with continued use. What I notice most is the smooth supple feeling this oil gives my skin. I love the texture it provides and plan to continue use!</li>
            <li> Your skin will literally drink this oil....I use it as a serum overnight and my skin is oily....great product although I don&#x27;t like the packaging....</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, a personal email and a fantastic product. Thank you!</li>
            <li> great quality products and superb customer service... highly recommend...</li>
            <li> This is a really great oil. It is too strong to apply directly to skin-I tried. I add a couple of drops to my normal moisturizer and it is great. My skin felt so soft in the morning. Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I love love love this oil......after using for a few days my skin is amazing. I used it on my hands  and I can&#x27;t believe the difference. It does have quite a strong smell but that soon disperses. I highly recommend this oil it is a great addition to my oil regime. I would highly recommend this company too...my oil was well packaged and arrived promptly.</li>
            <li> I received this oil during a promotional period. I am so glad that I did - I&#x27;ve been hunting for a solution to my son&#x27;s eczema that doesn&#x27;t involve steroids and chemicals. This oil absorbs nicely, doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent, and seemed to soften his rough skin. I will continue using this with him to see if it totally clears up his skin! I&#x27;m very hopeful!</li>
            <li> Love this on my face. Pure and healthful moisturizer</li>
            <li> This has been amazing for my face! In the past week, this has evened out tone, reduced redness, AND I see noticeably less blackheads! It is shiny and doesn&#x27;t smell very nice at first but it absorbs within minutes and leaves no scent behind. LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
            <li> Aside from the odor, which I&#x27;m getting used to, I love this oil! Feels great and after only a couple of weeks my skin looks smoother.</li>
            <li> it does not make my face greasy. the e-book is a huge plus, very helpful!</li>
            <li> I bought this on a whim even though I have a million beauty products I still need to use up and I am about ready to throw all of those other things away. I use this as a daily moisturizer and it works wonders.  My skin is acne prone, very dry after washing and proceeds to be extremely oily a few hours later. This oil absorbs very well so I don&#x27;t look like I have a layer of oil sitting on my face the way it does if I use almond or coconut oil on my face, so I can use it when I&#x27;ll be going out in public. It&#x27;s still not perfect, but my skin isn&#x27;t greasing up as much during the day anymore since I started using this. It also has made my acne scars start to fade and my skin tone has greatly improved overall. As a bonus - it works a lot like a primer and my foundation goes on smoother when I use this first.  About the smell - a lot of the negative reviews say that it smells awful and like fish oil. It does have a very distinct smell, and I can see how some people would associate it with fish oil, but that wasn&#x27;t my first instinct when I opened the bottle. It actually smells exactly like a rosehip seed, and I know this because I&#x27;ve eaten wild rosehips out of the forest in the midwest (I wouldn&#x27;t recommend doing this - rosehips don&#x27;t taste very good). People are misled by the word &amp;#34;rose&amp;#34; in the title, but the oil is not made from a flower, it&#x27;s made from a seed and you shouldn&#x27;t think you have a bad batch when it doesn&#x27;t smell like roses.  I&#x27;ve ordered from Better Shea Butter before and they have great customer service and a great philosophy behind their products. I will continue to order from them again and again.  The only slightly negative thing I have to say is I wish they would put it in a bottle with a pump. The dropper is messy and I feel like it&#x27;s very easy to waste the product by accidentally dropping oil onto the counter or having it run off your fingers.</li>
            <li> I really enjoyed the scent and like the little dispenser at the top of the bottle. Prior to purchasing this product, I tried the Whole Foods brand. I was unimpressed. From what was left in my bottle, this is definitely the superior of the two options. This being said, I only give it 1 star because the item came with the top loose and leaked all over my bag as soon as it arrived.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product now for approximately 3 weeks, once in the morning and at night, and I&#x27;m liking the results.  It has a faint, familiar scent to me, probably from mountain biking in different parts of the country.  I bought this because it supposedly lessens red marks from scars and evens out skin tone, and deeply moisturizes.  That&#x27;s important to me, because sometimes where I&#x27;m at, it so dry and arid.  I&#x27;ve dispatched some of this to a tiny (dram) glass bottle that I can fit in my camelbak while riding, which is perfect for that use, and great for my lips.  I find it extremely pleasant to use, as it soaks in very quickly, and is very moisturizing and even when I apply it on my face, no breakouts.  The bottle is glass, as is the dropper and its was securely packaged in bubble tape, so no broken anything.  I&#x27;m going to put some in my face wash, and add a few drops to my sunscreen and moisture cream.  I really like this and will repurchase.</li>
            <li> Great natural product for skin.  I make my own moisturizer and this is all martial and his a long way</li>
            <li> First of all I love this company. The customer service is top notch and any question I have is quickly answered. I was very excited to try this Rosehip Seed Oil. When I first received it I opened it up and took a big inhale. The scent straight out of the bottle was a bit strong for me. But I mixed drops of it in my daily moisturizer and the raw shea butter I also purchase from this company and the scent was perfect. My son has pretty bad eczema and I put a couple drops into his bath and I could not believe how soft his skin felt when I got him out. My skin also feels very soft from use in my moisturizer which is much needed in this dry cold winter. Looking forward to what continue use will do for both myself and my sons skin.</li>
            <li> Better Shea Butter is the only shea butter I use in my own natural skin care line.  Ethically sourced and consistently outstanding.  I can&#x27;t wait to try this Rosehip seed oil.. If it&#x27;s BSB it MUST be good!</li>
            <li> I love this oil, in just two week I&#x27;ve notice a huge difference in my skin. Hyperpigmentation I&#x27;ve had for years is finally starting to fade! I will continue using this oil twice daily, I add four to six drops in to my moisturizer in the morning and night. I highly recommend this to persons with dull and spotted skin.</li>
            <li> I know it sounds crazy, but I use rosehip oil on my face. I seem to need a lot of extra moisture, and this does it for me. I love how this was packaged. There are many uses for it. I also use it for dry elbows, and dry lips. This brand is light, and does not make my skin feel greasy. I use it under my moisturizer, like a serum. I am very happy to have been able to buy this on a promotional deal. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> First of all, the packaging of this oil is great. If this is the type of thing you would like to give as a gift, this would be perfect. The bottle arrived in a cute paper bag-like package that I was actually almost sad to open. The oil itself is wonderful. It has a really nice smell, but don&#x27;t expect it to smell like actual roses. It is more of an earthy scent. You only need a few drops at a time, so the bottle will last quite a while. It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy or greasy feel on your skin, and after using it twice daily since I&#x27;ve gotten it, I am seeing a difference in the skin around my eyes. This is the kind of product that feels like a great luxury, so when I received a promotional code for it, I was excited to order. Once this bottle is gone, I will happily purchase at full price, it is worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I never thought I would be a person that would start using oils for a more natural approach to healing- but I have and this organic rosehip oil works!  I have been using it at night after my face toner of apple cider vinegar and water.  I was hoping to take a natural approach to heal all the acne scars and my one brown spot.  i have noticed a slight difference but I think it will take more than 3 weeks of use to heal years of damage.  I&#x27;m satisfied with the progress so far and hope to see continued improvement of the next few months. The price was great too and without any of  harmful chemicals.</li>
            <li> I suffer from psoriasis so during the winter it is especially bad being so dry. After having received this product with a promotional code, I am very very impressed. When I initially thought about using an oil of any kind, I automatically assumed it would be greasy. I was very wrong. This is a very light weight but extremely impressive oil. This will be a must have for me going forward.</li>
            <li> I use this oil with Young Living essential oils to make a face serum that works better than any high end face products I have previously used.  .  Works great already seeing results</li>
