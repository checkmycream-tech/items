            <li>and I was pleased with the price, as well.</li>
            <li>but it wasn&#x27;t the most luxurious product.  </li>
            <li>I love anything scented with Mangoes, it&#x27;s my favorite.</li>
            <li>Love the rich feel!  </li>
            <li>Decided to try something new and thought this sounded good.  </li>

            <li>My mom, who is the primary caregiver to my father, loves this product.  </li>
            <li>I love this product , I try to stock up when I find it on sale, which is rare in my areas.</li>
            <li>you smell good and soft as I have used all the tones and one w</li>
            <li>I normally get this in the stores and I love it!</li>
            <li>The fragrance is light, tropical, fresh and clean.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it suds very well.</li>
            <li>this body wash is thick and smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>It smells good and leaves my skin soft and not dried out.</li>
            <li>It is a nice alternative to the men&#x27;s &amp;#34;sport&amp;#34; body wash that seems to suck very bit of natural oil out of my skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very subjective w/ body wash, making my decision based on smell, and open to paying more for better smell</li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>I definitely use this more in the fall and winter.</li>
            <li>Love it and will definitely order again!  </li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ll stick to my first choice (Dove).</li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing!</li>
            <li>This is a very large bottle which you can&#x27;t really tell from the picture.</li>
            <li>Just as good as any of the more expensive brands.</li>
            <li>I love the way the Moisturizing body wash smells, which is why I gave it two stars, but my skin was really, really dry after I used this</li>
            <li>I really dont understand why Tone has not recieved the applause</li>
            <li>really I don&#x27;t think they know what they have.</li>
            <li>quality product  fast delivery</li>
            <li>AMAZON is much cheaper.</li>
            <li>Yummy for skin so moisturizing and smells nice without being too heavily scented.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d like to give it 5 stars, but the high cost is almost prohibitive.</li>
            <li>She recommends this product highly.</li>
            <li>Its very moisturizing and my skin feels so soft after my shower.</li>
            <li>So soft!</li>
            <li>Not sure which I like better.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t understand how something that&#x27;s moisturizing can dry out my skin so quickly, O_o</li>
            <li>the modest price</li>
            <li>way better -clearly outsmelling similarly priced products.&lt;br /&gt;Moisturizing properties proved enough to protect my fairly-dry skin through the harsh winter without the use of body lotion.</li>
            <li>There is really no other</li>
            <li>I send a care package (subscribe &amp; save) to them every two months with special items that they are not able to run around and shop for.  </li>
            <li>&quot; (aka the white tone you get from dry skin) shows up really well on my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;Normally I don&#x27;t have to put lotion on right after a shower; I can usually wait until the next morning or so.</li>
