            <li>BEST SOAP EVER...</li>
            <li>I tried this brand Dudu Osun and although it smells awesome, it did not have the impact on my skin like Nubian Heritage</li>
            <li>My hubs and I absolutely LOVE this soap!!!  </li>
            <li>I love it!!!</li>
            <li>This soap works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever seen, heard off, or tried!!!</li>
            <li>I LOVE THIS STUFF!!!</li>
            <li>AMAZING!!</li>

            <li>The smell is amazing!!</li>
            <li>very good</li>
            <li>so that&#x27;s very good since I didn&#x27;t notice the fragrance thing until</li>
            <li>However, Dudu Osun is a VERY good soap.</li>
            <li>Basically you should make a very good lather with you hands, and then work the soap in without the use of a loofah or anything too abrasive.</li>
            <li>This soap is very good</li>
            <li>very good for my skin</li>
            <li>Definately very good for people with acne.</li>

            <li>Very good soap.</li>
            <li>Very good soap.</li>
            <li>Just beware that you&#x27;ll need a very good body moisturizer after using it.</li>

            <li>It lathers great and has been wonderful for skin.  </li>
            <li>It smells great and moisturizes my skin wonderfully.</li>
            <li>This is the best product I have ever purchased for my problematic skin, a great addition to my skincare routine</li>
            <li>This soap is incredibly drying though.</li>
            <li>Fragrance may not be for everyone but the lather is incredible.</li>
            <li>Real nice drying effect for greasy skin.</li>
            <li>I bought the 6 pack of this soap and loved it!</li>

            <li>It is very strongly scented.</li>
            <li>The smell is very strong and fruity</li>
            <li>This soap will melt away very easily so you have to keep it out of the shower stream or water when you aren&#x27;t using it.  </li>
            <li>I also scar very easy.  </li>
            <li>I also love the earthy scent and love to just sniff the boxes when they arrive in the mail!</li>

            <li>It lathers up very nice and the scent is mild and pleasing.</li>

            <li>It is almost to good to be true.</li>
            <li>but tingly in a good way, not bad.  </li>
            <li>While your skin will feel clean with Dudu-Osun, you won&#x27;t have the refreshing quality that a good exfoliant produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>I look forward to trying it on other cleaning tasks, it&#x27;s probably a great multi-use product!</li>
            <li>It is, however, more consumer friendly.  </li>

            <li>/&gt;Thank you to Amazon and to the seller of this product for making it easy to order and</li>
            <li>I personally think it&#x27;s a wonderful fresh woodsy smell.</li>
            <li>If you love a clean shower tub - be forewarned - this will leave a brownish residue on the tub....</li>

            <li>initially, I thought this was great for the face, but I think my face adapted, so now I switch between this and shae butter.</li>
            <li>Also, i noticed it was great for overall body soap, espcially if you mix it with sugar and make a scrub out of that.</li>

            <li>second order was because it&#x27;s great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Dudu</li>
            <li>tried proactiv, acne free, wexler, cetaphil, tea tree oil, Neutrogena,</li>
            <li>This time I experienced immense itching.</li>
            <li>The lather is a light brown, but does not stain light colored washcloths.</li>
            <li>It is great for my problematic skin (my Momma LIED when she told me, as a teen, that my acne would go away before I got wrinkles!)</li>
            <li>It has a nice gentle scent, and lathers generously.  </li>

            <li>Thank you, Dud-Osun for a fantastic product.</li>
            <li>I started using this product primarily on my face for acne and the scars they leave.</li>
            <li>Great value, will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li>However, I would prefer a FRAGRANCE FREE VERSION.  </li>
            <li>I wash my face and body with this product because it&#x27;s both gentle and effective.</li>
            <li>fantastic.</li>
            <li>My entire family uses this soap with great results.</li>
            <li>I think it&#x27;s a great value too because my entire family uses one soap for washing and shampoo.</li>

            <li>Great soap, in the desert environment,  my face as taken a beating along with daily shaving.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall..... great product the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it does leave brown residue all over the shower</li>
            <li>I know that because when alcohol free witch hazel is applied as a toner, there is no residue that is visible from doing this.</li>
            <li>My boyfriend has commented on how smooth my skin feels.</li>
            <li>or it&#x27;s made with good quality natural fragrances--</li>

            <li>I need soap that&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It is a good soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Would not be good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Good price, natural product.</li>
            <li>My underarms would actually smell really good, just like the soap :)</li>
            <li>Acid also has an anti-bacterial action as well as being good for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Acid also has an anti-bacterial action as well as being good for exfoliation.</li>
            <li>Amazon offers a good savings as some stores are selling at up to $5 a bar.</li>
            <li>I immediately loved the natural smell when I opened the box.</li>
            <li>I will have to order more soon because I love these soo much.</li>
            <li>from hot bath or showers, trying using cool or luke warm water</li>
            <li>Best thing is you can get a good lather, I mean really soap up your wash cloth even when the bar is almost gone.</li>
            <li>With it&#x27;s rich aroma, silky smooth creamy lather, and pumice like scrub, this is the best of all worlds for just a few bucks.</li>
            <li>If this product doesnt work right away for you, please give it some time and you will love the results.</li>
            <li>Just make sure to lotion up right after the shower.</li>
            <li>Oh thank you very much the price was good and great quality the delivery was fast took last than one week.</li>
            <li>Lathers wonderfully, great fresh scent, leaves skin squeaky clean yet still soft.</li>
            <li>I recommend this all-natural soap to clean your face and body over any benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid-containing product that probably does more harm than good with all the extra junk they put in it.</li>
            <li>This is my first product review i have ever done, this product is just soooo ahhh-mazing!!</li>
            <li>I have never seen a product work so fast!!!</li>

            <li>After using it my body and face feels amazingly clean and baby soft, I do follow up with coconut oil as my moisturizer for my face and body because this soap can be drying if you don&#x27;t use a good moisturizer</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d also like to add that the soap has a unique scent that I really enjoy.</li>

            <li>I have no idea how this item received so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li>First of all Black Soap is EXCELLENT for your skin!!!  </li>
            <li>I also give her husband left a use, he also liked that very clean wash</li>
            <li>I did some extensive research before I bought ABS(african black soap) and learned a great deal of this great soap that is doing WONDERS for my skin.  </li>
            <li>This is the purest and most effective black soap I have been able to find.  </li>
            <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product :)</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything special to my excema</li>
            <li>I also bought a large chunk of this type soap that is unscented and I use it and love it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that it does anything special...</li>
            <li>I saw results right away!</li>
            <li>you wanna use, Dudu is convenient and you can use right out the box!</li>
            <li>It does not leave any residue... actually leaves you feeling incredibly clean and rubbery (in a good way).</li>
            <li>Many scented bubbles that clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Price is reasonable, I like to come.&lt;br /&gt;Available</li>
            <li>I have somewhat fair skin that gets irritated easily and if used too often this soap can cause dry spots</li>
            <li>Such a great product, and at $2/bar, very reasonable compared to some over-priced luxury soaps on the market.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin radiant and soft, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li>It smells amazing and helped clear up some &amp;#34;sunspots&amp;#34; I had close to my nose.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m trying to use all organic and natural products and also eat organic and for this price its amazing.</li>
            <li>The soap smells great, develops into a rich lather, is extremely long-lasting, and has worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li>This soap smells amazing, makes you feel clean, and helped illuminate most of my dry skin.</li>
            <li>but it leaves my skin smelling amazing and soft.</li>
            <li>I had been using a different kind of soap similar to this because a lot of people were saying it&#x27;s great for your skin.</li>
            <li>Too many of my African sisters come to the States with beautiful, smooth skin then start using Western products because they believe these products are somehow \\&quot;better\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>For all you over 40 moms (like me) out there, use this and coconut oil for a moisturizer and be ready for the compliments on your youthful appearance to start flooding in.  :)</li>
            <li>, WETHER I NOTICE ANY BIG DIFFERENCES, GOOD OR</li>
            <li>I wash my hair, body, face and even the most intimate areas-</li>
            <li>This soap is good to use every day for the body only not the face.</li>
            <li>Okay Guys, Read much of the reviews before attempting to put in my two cents.</li>
            <li>It smell well and give full measure.</li>
            <li>The soap itself is solid and good for the skin.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it instantly.  </li>
            <li>She wants to walk into all of the Top Dermatologist</li>
            <li>but everyone is swearing on this like its actually something that good.</li>
            <li>This product is the ONLY thing that has helped me retain a good complexion.</li>
            <li>Really good for skin problems will definitely buy again</li>
            <li>, that&#x27;s the only good thing about</li>
            <li>mixed with my cologne, it did a good job with scent as well.</li>
            <li>good purhase overall</li>
            <li>I wash with this soap and put on a  Versace Dreamer or Polo Big pony number 1 cologne and get stopped by women all the time telling me how good i smell</li>
            <li>I really really like them and will probably order more soon.</li>
            <li>finally a good friend of mine from Nigeria went to visit &amp; brought me back about 2 bars and told me to try it.</li>
            <li>, he&#x27;s a machinest and one side of his arm gets full of oil and grease</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also nice to know that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>- I have not had a breakout since and it has been a full</li>
            <li>My skin is soft and has a nice even tone.</li>
            <li>My skin feels super clean after use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m really impressed since more commercial cleansers never really stopped my bumps from appearing.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it for a while because someone gave me something else that they loved, but now that I am back to this soap</li>
            <li>Not any face soaps or make up remover can clean so well in one quick wash.  </li>
            <li>Will be ordering more of it real soon.</li>
            <li>I love the smell, but it is very earthy which some people may not like.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not going to say it has completely cleared my acne because i want to be honest</li>
            <li>I honestly think It does help clear up imperfections on one&#x27;s skin as well as evening its tone.  </li>
            <li>This is not a bad soap</li>
            <li>] is my last choice since it&#x27;s VERY mild and doesn&#x27;t have a very powerful fragrance but is great for people who are sensitive</li>
            <li>] is my last choice since it&#x27;s VERY mild and doesn&#x27;t have a very powerful fragrance but is great for people who are sensitive</li>
            <li>make sure you get your whole face because the parts you don&#x27;t rub will absorb the soap quick.</li>
            <li>This soap has a really great smell, as well as leaving me feel super clean due to the granuales exfoliating my skin as i shower.</li>
            <li>Although the smell at first is kinda  strong it goes away.</li>
            <li>I will warn you that if you keep it in the shower, it can dissolve pretty easily.</li>
            <li>I asked her what she used because her skin was so beautiful, she told me black soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s strong when you first use it -</li>
            <li>SOOO EASY TO MAKE &amp; COST PENNY&#x27;S A BOTTLE!! ) , &amp; STARTED ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE SOAP USE, SO IM</li>
            <li>I believe that it can even tone and fight acne very well as long as you make sure you are using a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other than that it has a great scent that lasts all day and my skin seems softer.</li>
            <li>It lathers nicely, smells great, and between the 2 of us showering each once per day, a bar can last up to a week (as long as we keep it from sitting in a puddle of water...</li>
            <li>I was so excited to try the \\&quot;real thing\\&quot;, but the soap is too strong for me and began to sting and burn.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t know why people are saying that they felt so fresh and clean, because I did not.</li>
            <li>Has a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li>i love this soap made my skin clear up and super smooth</li>
            <li>After having used Clinique for 3 years and consistent break outs of fine bumps on my cheeks</li>
            <li>I have acne and mild dermititis</li>
            <li>I will most definitely purchase more of this soap and will use it as a bath soap as well.</li>
            <li>ISO far so good,  I really like this product</li>
            <li>&quot; My husband said he felt mild tingling.</li>
            <li>If your a man with a gf, wife, or daughter (ect), snatch some up and give them in a gift basket with some lotions &amp; act super savvy.</li>
            <li>If your a man with a gf, wife, or daughter (ect), snatch some up and give them in a gift basket with some lotions &amp; act super savvy.</li>
            <li>IF THE QUICK DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li>EVEN AS IS, WITHOUT ANY SUPER BENEFITS!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>EVEN AS IS, WITHOUT ANY SUPER BENEFITS!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I use it on face and body, and now my skin is more smooth and even and clear than it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Soap dissolves rather quickly</li>
            <li>My skin is super picky with soap and shaving products.  </li>
            <li>My skin is oily, and is super prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li>Lucky to even give ONE star.</li>
            <li>but it seems to be getting better and these seem to be more related to hormonal issues than oiliness.</li>
            <li>For example: I got super glue ALL over my fingertips during a project.</li>
            <li>Ask your derma about accutane or an oral antibiotic, its helped me and my brother tremendously</li>
            <li>A quick rinse and</li>
            <li>Smells great, all natural, eliminates eczema and keeps skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li>I experienced this at first when I made the mistake of leaving it on my face too long.</li>
            <li>Just wash it off quickly if you&#x27;re going to wash your face with it</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t stains my showers or sponge, it does drip brown but rinse off quickly.  </li>
            <li>well but doesn&#x27;t dissolve too quickly.</li>
            <li>My older kids use it on their face as well and they love it.</li>
            <li>Came quick.</li>
            <li>Arrived quickly and without issues.</li>
            <li>It lathers great and it feels like it&#x27;s really giving my hair a deep cleanse without drying it out.</li>
            <li>break outs quickly</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and makes you feel soooooooo clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li>ALL SKIN TYPES, PUT ALL COMPLAINTS TO THE TEST, ENJOY YOUR COMPLIMENTS.ou love, have an extra soap under the cabinet for when you run out, and ENJOY.</li>
            <li>The very first entry in my baby book was \\&quot;she has a rash - to the doctor\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I am no way affiliated with the makers of this product, just a review junkie dependent upon other people&#x27;s experience as well as my own :)</li>
            <li>really helps reduce my oily skin and leaves me smelling smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li>The dark spots took about 6 weeks to notice a difference, but looks great.</li>
            <li>It is great for fading dark spots.</li>
            <li>love this on my skin - it is rich and soft.</li>
            <li>package arrived very fast and the soap smells VERY fresh, even the boxes look brighter than I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li>I notice my fine lines, acne scars &amp; sun spots become a lot more apparent.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s natural (no foreign words lol).</li>
            <li>I am not sure it&#x27;s the best black soap quality wise</li>
            <li>Love this soap, whole family uses this and every family member likes this soap very much.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s quite pleasant actually, but its just too strong and powerful for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a cure for eczema (still needs his prescription creams), but it does help his skin stay healthy, and the eczema has not popped up in any new places.</li>
            <li>but I am glad I don&#x27;t get new ones.</li>
            <li>This is our family&#x27;s new favorite soap.</li>
            <li>My favorite soap, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>Dudu Osun to clean and pure shea butter as a moisturizer!</li>
            <li>the soap smells great, but it runs all over your shower&#x27;s floor, like black mud.</li>
            <li>and it gets my whole family nice and clean without stripping away our natural oils.  </li>
            <li>Many of my battle wounds on my arms from people swiping at the basketball as I drive to the lane have pretty much disapeared.  </li>
            <li>It lathers really well too &amp; the brownish color washes away really easily in the tub.</li>
            <li>despite the dark brown appearance, it smells good and washes smooth.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty good, doesn&#x27;t last long per bar, and I&#x27;ve used more costly brands that seem to help better with acne</li>
            <li>I find this is a good quality soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out  my skin.</li>
            <li>(if you have acne it will dry your acne, which my friends loved).</li>
            <li>The smells is really mild and fresh.  </li>
            <li>I love the smell of the soap in the shower, though it is strong up front, it does not leave a heavy scent at all, it was very light and almost nonexistant.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 weeks and the difference is huge!!</li>
            <li>But other than that it washes off shower and leaves my skin feeling so nice!</li>
            <li>Really??!!</li>
            <li>I first discovered it after visiting a friend in Florida and the bars cost $4 each!</li>
            <li>After my first use, I was amazed!</li>
            <li>and it helps fight it off pretty well!</li>
            <li>The most important thing is that since using for about 2 months, not a single break out.  </li>
            <li>Black soap is effective at so many things.  </li>
            <li>the name is hard to pronounce, but very good soap.</li>
            <li>The soap came and the first thing I noticed was how clean it smelled.  </li>
            <li>I will most likely try this for about a month and see how it goes, but I&#x27;m loving the results so far!</li>
            <li>I also really like that it is available with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li>The soap really does leave your skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and free.</li>
            <li>This soap is an awsome exfoliant that is great for getting rid of dead skin and cleansing pores.</li>
            <li>and she called me a week later to say it is &#x27;amazing&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking around for a great soap for quite a few years now.</li>
            <li>So far, I am pleased with the result.</li>
            <li>and I hope that it will be more soothing for my sensitive face.</li>
            <li>I gave a bar to my friend and her mom, who are hatian, with sensitive, oily skin; and they love it as well.</li>
            <li>I love this soap because its all natural.</li>
            <li>The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to stay, but skin does smell \\&quot;fresh &amp; clean\\&quot; after.</li>
            <li>the soap, cover your body in a lotion you love, have an extra soap under the cabinet for when you run out, and ENJOY.</li>
            <li>I love the soap and makes my skin soft</li>
            <li>so it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li>I AM ALREADY NOTICING ARE WORTH IT</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s intended use, but far better than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li>There dont seem to be many checks and balances as far as anything goes in that country.</li>
            <li>Even better- after a couple of uses my skin is feeling touchably soft and silky.</li>
            <li>I am hoping my skin will clear up to reveal lovely results</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve noticed it cleans so deep that I use less moisturizer, wrinkle cream and sunblock because your skin is able to absorb more effectively when deeply clean.  </li>
            <li>Definitely worth the price of $5 or so.</li>
            <li>This soap is great for me especially with my adult acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of days now and can already see an astounding difference in my skin.</li>
            <li>BUT WHEN I USE THIS SOAP EVERDAY AND APPLY SHEA BUTTER, I HAVE CLEAR AND HEALTHY SKIN.  </li>
            <li>Fresh soap.</li>
            <li>I love the scent, the exfoliation and the all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>so it does double duty as a really nice body deodorant.</li>
            <li>and I have thicker skin and most products are not too sensitive for my skin.</li>
            <li>I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li>This soap combined with the OCM, Moroccan rose water and spirolactone have finally cleared my cystic acne.</li>
            <li>I also love the fact that it is all natural</li>
            <li>though you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s a much better value if you purchase the larger cakes and break it apart; however, if you want something that &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; good in the soap dish, then probably worth paying the extra.</li>
            <li>rarely need body lotion on my body or face, but I do use 50-50 water and vegatable glycerine after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My dermatologist even told me my skin was one of the most sensitive types she&#x27;s ever seen,</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve also heared of people using it to wash their hair and I plan on giving that a try as well since I&#x27;m going natural :)</li>
            <li>As far as my complexion and break outs go, I think I need to give it more than 2 uses before I can judge on that.</li>
            <li>It has a fresh, tropical scent, doesn&#x27;t overdry the skin &amp; leaves</li>
            <li>This soap leaves no residue whatsoever and makes your skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li>Here is my own analysis, based on chemistry and personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the fact that it is all natural, &amp;</li>
            <li>it was worth a shot</li>
            <li>I also love how my skin is not overly stripped of oils and feels quite natural after I use some avocado oil as moisturizer.</li>
            <li>And worth their weight in gold, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I have more mature skin</li>
            <li>worth it imo.</li>
            <li>I also used it on my face which had a fresh look to it after washing.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s so worth trying</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be completely gone.</li>
            <li>Many of us with sensitive skin have no use for added fragrances in soaps.  </li>
            <li>It has lovely natural ingredients, cleanses my skin without stripping all of its moisture and smells of limes and citrus fruits.</li>
            <li>so far I love this soap</li>
            <li>It came in earlier than I expected, which is great!</li>
            <li>I love natural and affordable and this product hits both out of the ballpark.</li>
            <li>Fragrance too powerful pungent.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>Love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I found a million reasons to use a different kind of soap in its stead.</li>
            <li>But the quality of the product and the way it makes my skin feels is totally worth</li>
            <li>Great soap, all natural, enough said.</li>
            <li>Love this product as it is helping to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li>awesome soap for cleaning the whole body, not too much the face all the time but lightly a few times a week</li>
            <li>has become my simple, effective and natural skin care regimen :)</li>
            <li>price is good, i can live with it but hoping it could go down more</li>
            <li>Also you need to get some kind of soap holder (super cheap at Wal-Mart), because if you don&#x27;t it runs brown drips down your walls.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say for my hair overall the lather is great with no worries of sulfates or other chemicals found in most shampoos.</li>
            <li>If I could have this particular item on auto order and the 6pk, my family love this soap and now this is the only soap that we used for shampoo, facial and body its does a GREAT with multi purpose use.</li>
            <li>Great smelling natural soap, what could be better, it leaves your skin feeling a little sticky at first</li>
            <li>Other than that I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff!!!</li>
            <li>and i love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;i originally got for my teenage sons eczema</li>
            <li>LOVE the rich lather it makes, along with my &amp;#34;Cure Series Japanese Exfoliating Bath Towel.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>It leaves me feeling clean and pure after every shower, and my skin shows the difference.</li>
            <li>I love it because its natural, it last longer than body wash (which is true of most soap bars) and because its non-drying.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s still a great product and can help you with acne, psoriasis, dry skin, oily skin, razor bumps, and is also antibacterial WITHOUT the use of chemicals (it creates an environment that bacteria can&#x27;t live in, basically).  </li>
            <li>Smells very nice (like flowers) and is certainly a cheaper option in comparison to other soaps (i.e., Dr. Bronners)</li>
            <li>I love the clean feeling i get after using this soap, my only issue is the brown staining of my wash cloths</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin clean, fresh, works very well on eczema and rashes.</li>
            <li>I absolutely love the smell of this soap; and, I actually like how clean it makes me feel.  </li>
            <li>The soap is very clean smelling, all natural</li>
            <li>Good for Dandruff(guy uses it every other day).</li>
            <li>Even after the first use I was highly pleased by the way it left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li>This soap looks so strange, but you will be so glad if you try it!  </li>
            <li>Dudu is the best on the market as far as pure black soaps go.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s even much better than any special facial cleansers I used before.</li>
            <li>Dries the zits right up without drying my face out.</li>
            <li>It has cleared my face right up.</li>
            <li>(but hey you should be doing that anyway right?)  </li>
            <li>Nothing gets this stuff off, right?</li>
            <li>Right off the bat, I have to pose a question:  </li>
            <li>so I had to use oils right after to lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li>Well, you drew the right conclusion...</li>
            <li>I used it right away</li>
            <li>and I attribute this to using the right soap.</li>
            <li>He still keep using it right now, and see what will happen.</li>
            <li>and I think that I have achieved the right concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Dudu-Osun creates a highly alkaline environment which has a more highly disinfectant action than most soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This six count is amazing because the bars are pretty big</li>
            <li>It lathers very well and rinses of clean, no soap residue.</li>
            <li>Well, it does make my face feel clean, but I really don&#x27;t see any change in my eczema or acne.</li>
            <li>My daughter who has had eczema her whole life also uses this product with wonderful results - we are Northern European by heritage with extremely dry itchy skin</li>
            <li>This toilet soap lathers so nicely.</li>
            <li>It can clean my face very well and owning to this, my acne start to disappear.</li>
            <li>this one leaves me feeling clean and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li>The smell is clean fragrance and lathers really well.</li>
            <li>I am pretty sure that if i keep using it my acne will be completely gone.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I noticed the pungent smell first (which is not bad)</li>
            <li>and I also notice that this soap whitens lol, must be from the lemon; nothing a little bronzer can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very easy to wash away, but if you&#x27;re the type of person who freaks out when their bathroom isn&#x27;t 100% white this may put you off.</li>
            <li>will be ordering the 12 bars very soon lol down to 1 bar.&lt;br /&gt;wish</li>
            <li>No other soap that I&#x27;ve used has had this effect (and mostly, I don&#x27;t use organic or all-natural</li>
            <li>After many wasted soaps, facial washes and scrubs, I found this to be the best match with my acne-proned, oily/dry combination, sun sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I love how it left my skin squeaky clean the first use.</li>
            <li>Leaves your skin feeling so clear &amp; clean!</li>
            <li>This soap lathers incredibly, so if you keep it away from water when you are not using it, it will last for a very very long time.</li>
            <li>Great lather with very little effort</li>
            <li>Because this soap seems to be concentrated  using  less works best for me especially when using it for my face.</li>
            <li>I had tried many soaps that are designed to put moisture into you skin like dove, which leaves a oily feeling, and the black soap works much better.</li>
            <li>Great for acne or just feeling clear and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li>my acne scars have lighten up; which i am very happy about because i have been using these expensive brands and nothing has work or showed my quick results.</li>
            <li>Although drying, I like that it takes the deodorant off much more quickly than regular soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends who laugh at the name, but find it intriguing enough to try after hearing what I say about it.</li>
            <li>As soon as I can better figure my family&#x27;s usage rates, and the shelf life (natural products have shorter lives - as they should), I&#x27;ll be back to buy more.    </li>
            <li>it smells great; it cleans better than any other body soaps without too much drying or leaving a film; and it has cut down/control my facial acne.  </li>
            <li>and I noticed I didn&#x27;t get acne as much after using the full bar.</li>
            <li>I sometimes have a bit of eczema during certain seasons and this will knock it out quickly.</li>
            <li>This is good stuff, recommend this hands down...........</li>
            <li>I also use it on my face once a week mixed with a little coconut oil and my skin looks wonderful.</li>
            <li>I am very impressed with this soap because after only using this soap for a little over a month and almost all my acne cleared up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great bargain deal for such a small price for a mainly natural soap which also has a good fragrance.  </li>
            <li>I so badly wanted to love this soap because I heard wonderful things about it.  </li>
            <li>I love this soap, you really get a soft feeling on your skin, and it also gives you a clearer complextion.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s really good for Black people&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping which is super.</li>
            <li>close to #1 having soft texture, great fragrance, triple milled made in the french way, mainly moisturizing olive oil</li>
            <li>close to #1 having soft texture, great fragrance, triple milled made in the french way, mainly moisturizing olive oil</li>
            <li>I have oily, acne-prone skin and while researching, I read that black soap is really good for my skin type.</li>
            <li>I would strongly recommend that people with sensitive skin avoid this soap.</li>
            <li>Only been using soap a week now, after more time; maybe results will be better &amp; far more lasting.</li>
            <li>I started a routine of washing with Dudu-Osun black soap and washing with Bioelements Foam Cleanser (Good product also).</li>
            <li>It has a fresh smell and it actually makes my skin look fabulous!</li>
            <li>but the con are; it dries your face so get a good facial moisturizer, and keep on dry surfaces because it melts easily.</li>
            <li>It cleans very well, though so far no noticeable difference on the acne, but I hope with more patience it will work.</li>
            <li>It really has helped me clear up my face :)</li>
            <li>The scent is a bit strong, but not overpowering, and I have not had any adverse reactions even with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>and I am very happy that it has only a few ingredients in it.</li>
            <li>soap is super gentle and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li>In a way the smell reminds me of the classic Dial Gold; it doesn&#x27;t smell like it, per say, it just has that clean smell that works for men or women.</li>
            <li>The scent of this soap is amazing and makes my skin so clear and soft.</li>
            <li>We found this soap a few months ago from a vendor in a shopping center, and we loved it so much we had to find where we could order several bars at once and were very happy to have found them here.  </li>
            <li>The smell is really sweet and good, I use it every day and it seems work well for people who usually get allergic</li>
            <li>My skin is so clear and so moisturized and best of all, NO MORE ITCHING!</li>
            <li>This may be the processed commercialized version of African black soap but it is still pretty darn good and more reasonable to acquire than the softer raw stuff that you often have to cut off your own bars from a 1 LB brick and pay more for or deal with shipping charges.</li>
            <li>(not the kind you would want to luxuriously rub or love yourself down for 20 mins under the shower without walking around with sensitive skin.....</li>
            <li>(it has that generic, strong cheap soap smell, the kind you&#x27;d find at the dollar store - no hint of honey or shea butter or any of the other ingredients listed), but more importantly, I find that it is harsher than other soaps I&#x27;ve used -</li>
            <li>and I like it very much.</li>
            <li>I like this soap very much.  </li>
            <li>This most recent pack I ordered was in a sealed back and the individual boxes were in great shape.  </li>
            <li>This black soap is very good for the skin, does not dry it out and reportedly has some healing benefits.</li>
            <li>I brought it because; I was looking for something that would help clear up my oily skin and fine acne.</li>
            <li>I loved this soap, I really really love African black soap.</li>
            <li>Buying in bulk will help save a little money, i just hope it is as good of quality.</li>
            <li>Something original and new.    </li>
            <li>The smell is like a fresh, natural, clean smell.  </li>
            <li>This soap will help your skin exfoliate always making it look fresh, clean and soft.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s messy and did not seem to deliver any kind of special cleansing/moisturizng benefits for me.</li>
            <li>so much lather!</li>
            <li>When she came back with this soap, she said that so many people said this was better for skin ailments such as acne</li>
            <li>i first tried the soap in the beginning of the year and have been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin smooth and soft, and tightens my pores.</li>
            <li>Du-Du soap is the first soap we have used with no irritation.</li>
            <li>Du-Du soap is the first soap we have used with no irritation.</li>
            <li>I love this soap, it&#x27;s the only one I use on my face.</li>
            <li>Before buying a multi pack, buy one to test on your skin first.</li>
            <li>At first I thought it was the lotion I was using</li>
            <li>Talk about smooth and soft as a newborns bottom.</li>
            <li>Although I have only been using the two products for two days, my face has become softer, more moisturized and my blemishes are healing.</li>
            <li>I tried the soap first on my face</li>
            <li>First off let me say that I am a skeptic when it comes to cosmetic products.</li>
            <li>I tried it on my son first.</li>
            <li>First week I had it I looked forward to washing my face because I just felt like it was clearing me up.  </li>
            <li>This product arrived in a timely manner, but the boxes that the bars came in were pretty worn.  </li>
            <li>Works really well for acne, but use a luffa!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s cleared my skin pretty well.</li>
            <li>If the price remains the same I am sure this will be my bar soap.</li>
            <li>Another important note for the sensitive folks, DO NOT rub your skin with your towel- blot your skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s funny.</li>
            <li>I have read reviews that some users experience a tingly (or itchy) feeling at first</li>
            <li>1 week &amp; ppl were commenting on my skin &amp; much finer lines!</li>
            <li>All ingredients you either have, or can be bought on here &amp; very inexpensive too!</li>
            <li>;)&lt;br</li>

            <li>For 2 weeks to be exact.</li>
            <li>I use it daily and generates a lovely lather.  </li>
            <li>The first time, i bought the four pack...</li>
            <li>The first time I could tell it was like no soap I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  </li>
            <li>My face peeled and burned for the first 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li>After using it for a couple weeks, my love has only grown.  </li>
            <li>My problem is an abundance of riches with all the different types of luxurious organic and non-organic soaps I have which give me a better pampering bathing experience compared to this soap.  </li>
            <li>This soap is inexpensive and will last longer then most soap.</li>
            <li>but I love it all the same for its clarifying and skin smoothing properties.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s 5 star quality, but I deducted a star because if you have light color wash cloths, then it will leave a dark residue that is challenging to remove.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Be warned though, it may make your skin feel irritated the first time you use it, it did that to me.</li>
            <li>I love the smell and it&#x27;s starting to do some wondrous work on my skin.</li>
            <li>This soap really irritated my skin!</li>
            <li>I have only used this product for a month and my skin looks better.</li>
            <li>but they were the only truthful ones.</li>
            <li>suggestion to anyone who is considering buying this for the first time is to get one bar and see how you like it first.</li>
            <li>This is my second purchase of this soap, I just love the scent.</li>
            <li>First time tryer</li>
            <li>love the smell and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li>I have learned to keep it at a higher height in shower, as not to be affected by water when not using.  </li>
            <li>Always aware it is in delivery box because the smell resonates through the box.</li>
            <li>For the first couple of weeks my skin purged.</li>
            <li>smooth, even toned and it was baby soft.</li>
            <li>It leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap and have usd it for years!!</li>
            <li>I looked up cream or soap for eczema and this soap was the first to come up.</li>
            <li>I also use it on my body, which saves having to buy many different products.</li>
            <li>This worked pretty well on face and blemishes.  </li>
            <li>I have given bars away to family and friends of different races who love using it too .</li>
            <li>, so it&#x27;s no big problem for me. :-)  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d suggest trying out just one soap first before you buy a whole six pack like me!</li>
            <li>My skin is really soft and smooth now, like silk.  </li>
            <li>My back acne was getting better at first week of using it.</li>
            <li>This is my favorite facial soap ever.</li>
            <li>I have finally built my perfect skin care routine and it is going very well even during this harsh winter.</li>
            <li>After the first time I used the soap my skin felt softer and tighter.</li>
            <li>Hope that got their attention to make sure my order of 6 come on time, just like the last time.</li>
            <li>My face has cleared up SO MUCH!</li>
            <li>and you will be back for more.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I have been seeking.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s feels better on it then regular</li>
            <li>My children love this soap and claim it works on acne, so I purchase the soap regularly.</li>
            <li>Yes, my face tingled when I first began using this product, but it goes away.</li>
            <li>all kinds of generic brands and more.</li>
            <li>I tried many products but this one is the only one that I feel</li>
            <li>I first found this soap at a flower how in Boston, Ma.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m planning on ordering more of these in the future!</li>
            <li>It burns when you first start using it..</li>
            <li>I really love this soap and blue soaps for my face and underarms.</li>
            <li>This work very well on my skin!</li>
            <li>The package arrived on time and was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li>My first six bars are almost all gone.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s my first time purchasing</li>
            <li>So glad I only bought one bar.</li>
            <li>My patches looked so much lighter!</li>
            <li>I always wet my hands and lathered the soap in my hands, and then I massage it on my face for a bit before rinsing it off with warm water.</li>
            <li>Now, that is the first thing that I ask the vendor.     </li>
            <li>REALLY?!</li>
            <li>Fast delivery!</li>
            <li>I rubbed it on and left it for a minute or two and the first time i did most of the blackhead came out.</li>
            <li>soap comes exactly as pictured in 6 separate boxes bound together by plastic wrap.</li>
            <li>It looks a bit funny, smells divine, cleans well and moisturizes your body so there is no need of additional moisturizes.</li>
            <li>but this really helps!</li>
            <li>I would recommend that first time users try it out on their hands before using it anywhere else on their body lest they have a reaction to any of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>really glad i got it and will likely use it from here on.</li>
            <li>hahahahaha!</li>
            <li>it has permanently replaced my facial cleanser, and i have tried soo many products out there.</li>
            <li>I would definitely recommend and will for sure continue to use.</li>
            <li>I found that pretty weird.&lt;br</li>
            <li>and he&#x27;s using it as shampoo and body wash, he said it really cleans!  </li>
            <li>I tried this soap for the first time not having tried any products like it</li>
            <li>I love this product and I use it daily.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Black soap is the only soap I can use on me and my kids that smells great and leaves our skin clean and nourished afterward.  </li>
            <li>Now I use it morning and night on most days and have noticed a definite improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li>Last long and great scent.</li>
            <li>I am fair skinned, blond hair, green eyes</li>
            <li>Helps reduce redness, reduces scars, gives skin a good cleanse without being too harsh.</li>
            <li>Lather it really good and soap up your face, leave on for a few minutes (while you wash your hair..)</li>
            <li>This is easily as good as any dead sea mud soap out there.</li>
            <li>The next day I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;scrub\\&quot;, just gently lathered and only had a very mild sensation of \\&quot;warm</li>
            <li>Love you using black soap and this is a really good at a fair price as it can be expensive to buy at a store.</li>
            <li>Although the soap has a slight smell of motor oil, it works great and my skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li>I even use it to clean my hair, but only if I have a lot of product build-up as it can make you hair feel too clean.</li>
            <li>main thing that is appreciated about this soap is that my skin is really clean after using this product.</li>
            <li>I love black soap, and this is a fantastic brand.</li>
            <li>: )these dogs are known for having very sensitive coats... even too sensitive for dog shampoos and baby shampoos.</li>
            <li>Bought a lot of times DUDU OSUN black soap, and family and friends are in use, the effect is very very satisfied</li>
            <li>I got pregnant and alot of the stuff I normally used was off limits.</li>
            <li>The smell is pleasent and not too strong, my pet peeve with this soap is that it dirties the tub easily because of the dark tint.</li>
            <li>Works amazingly for acne or other skin conditions.</li>
            <li>Facial cleansing oil, the effect is very good, a total of six loaded, sent a few friends, said effect is good, the next time you run out will then consider buying.</li>
            <li>My mom was about 45 at the time, and has always been very very low maintenance, and never really had any kind of skin care routine, but her skin looked beautiful, radiant, tight and she had a visible reduction in the lines around her eyes and between her eyebrows.</li>
            <li>this may sound weird, but it works great on my dog too.</li>
            <li>It felt less oily and so much more clean.  </li>
            <li>but we are all so used to the chemicals in our soaps that we don&#x27;t realize what natural clean is like.  </li>
            <li>It leaves skin clean without stripping all the natural oils and rinses off well.  </li>
            <li>leaves my skin squeaky clean and soft.</li>
            <li>and my hair is really clean soft and shiny after using it.</li>
            <li>it leaves your skin feeling soft and soooooo clean.</li>
            <li>My skin felt, moisturized, soft and clean.</li>
            <li>Its natural and my skin feels so clean afterwords.</li>
            <li>STARS, ONLY BECAUSE IM WAITING TO SEE IF I GET SOME OF THE GREATER BENEFITS FROM IT, BUT REALLY, I WAS CLOSE TO GIVING IT 5 STARS</li>
            <li>STARS, ONLY BECAUSE IM WAITING TO SEE IF I GET SOME OF THE GREATER BENEFITS FROM IT, BUT REALLY, I WAS CLOSE TO GIVING IT 5 STARS</li>
            <li>It started out with more breakouts but eventually it started to clear up and slowly clear my blemishes.</li>
            <li>It clears up skin problems, leaves your skin moisturized or at least, more able to benefit from your moisturizer.</li>
            <li>It works like the washing powder too, very slippery when touching water, as same as when you washing your clothes by hand without rubber gloves on, and I feel it burns on my skin and peel.</li>
            <li>My skin has always been my biggest insecurity and it feels so good to have finally found something that actually works!!</li>
            <li>I have psoriasis all over my face and spots of it pretty well on a large portion on my body..</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;Which is a bummer because I ordered a large package of it, and ended up throwing the rest away after using the first bar.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It won&#x27;t clear  up your skin or do anything else special.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know why, but it takes my hair longer to dry afterward; however, the results are nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li>After all the positive reviews I decided I had to try this out to see if it would help with my oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>And also beware of all the positive reviews...</li>
            <li>but amazon.com has a ton of positive reviews about it?</li>
            <li>I started noticing positive changes in my skin immediately.</li>
            <li>At first it was really tingly</li>
            <li>I can tell you that I will be buying more and making this my bar soap for a long time.</li>
            <li>I spent $4.99(1 bar), and can say honestly that every penny was worth wild.</li>
            <li>At first it seemed to be really drying</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not sensitive to fragrance and it manages to choke me up a bit, so I would imagine it could bother others even more.</li>
            <li>The soap pretty much just brought out the acne I had under my skin to the surface.</li>
            <li>It can be too drying to use daily, but great if when a pimple is starting or in early stages.</li>
            <li>The scent isn&#x27;t one that I really like too much, but overall I am ok with my soap.</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I buffed my face with this soap and a gentle washcloth.</li>
            <li>Thanks so much!</li>
            <li>I have PCOS which means I pretty much always have skin issues.</li>
            <li>Cheap, lathers very well, gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Beautiful American woman of African decent 24 yrs old.</li>
            <li>It left my skin feeling so fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li>This soap really exfoliates your skin leaving it soft and clean</li>
            <li>Initially i thought the product was too drying as it began to tighten my skin particularly on the face, however i just layered the product more sparingly after a couple uses</li>
            <li>Seems to strike a good balance between being all natural, but not so much that you find pieces of bark in the soap, which I read can happen in some other brands.</li>
            <li>Lathers up really well with a nice thick rich lather.  </li>
            <li>Like a fresh new start.  </li>
            <li>Leaves skin with a nice glow, has a mild scent that&#x27;s not overwhelming, only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that the soap stains my light colored wash cloths</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin/hair dry like most soaps do.    </li>
            <li>Once I used the black soap I really liked it.</li>
            <li>It makes it super soft and easier for lotion/body butter to sink in.</li>
            <li>I have a history of dry skin and eczema for many years now.</li>
            <li>Easy to cut into smaller pieces for travel.</li>
            <li>It dissolves in water, which means you can create your own liquid black soap if you choose to do it.</li>
            <li>Just be sure you place it in a dry soap dish after using it because it will dissolve a lot faster.</li>
            <li>Most of the soaps will make skin dry ...</li>
            <li>I PERSONALLY LIKE STRONG SMELLS, LAUNDRY, AIR FRESHENER</li>
            <li>be prepared for ultra strong smell--to the extend that i need to double zip lock the rest of un-used unopened soap to avoid the smell getting everywhere; but the soap itself is buttery and i will buy again</li>
            <li>It has a really good scent and last long.</li>
            <li>The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the strong acidity in it, don&#x27;t let it get in your privates or it would burn.</li>
            <li>Strong initial scent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m single ladies :-)</li>
            <li>-Pure</li>
            <li>Its also is pure..</li>
            <li>100% pure Shea butter(Ghana),</li>
            <li>A mask/misting of organic pure rosewater(sans alcohol) and 100% pure aloe(not</li>
            <li>A mask/misting of organic pure rosewater(sans alcohol) and 100% pure aloe(not</li>
            <li>I USED THIS SOAP &amp; PURE UNREFINED SHEA BUTTER.  </li>
            <li>It is a large soap so the loss is negligible.</li>
            <li>I am now using natural 100% Castill soap and prefer that a lot better as it does not dry my skin, but keeps it moisturized!</li>
            <li>Smells good, lasts pretty long as long as you don&#x27;t let it sit in a puddle after your shower.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super gentle on my son&#x27;s ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>it made my skin super clean even though it made my skin dry afterwards but keep using it.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin and this soap works very well with my skin.</li>
            <li>Came nicely and tightly packaged.</li>
            <li>My skin is very sensitive  and reacts immediately to most facial products.  </li>
            <li>The smell is less than ideal for me (26 year old male).  </li>
            <li>but overall it was fine.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty decent</li>
            <li>Very high quality soap.</li>
            <li>Be sure to moisturize after using it because it can leave your skin very dry.</li>
            <li>My personal experience has been great, no tight dry skin afterwards and I haven&#x27;t had any eczema breakouts in months.</li>
            <li>We apply our own favorite lotions right after we dry and our skin sucks up the lotion and it \\&quot;fluffs\\</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using the same bar for a month -- they&#x27;re HUGE.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s VERY sudsy.</li>
            <li>very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li>But I&#x27;m still ordering it again because I like it so much.</li>
            <li>Thanks for prompt delivery.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s gentle on my skin, non fragrant</li>
            <li>I am a white female, and this soap makes my skin smooth and blemish free.</li>
            <li>Didnt see much of a difference</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>it didn&#x27;t really work as a hand soap in our guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li>It was very drying to my face even with  immediately applying moisturizer(raw shea butter).  </li>
            <li>I really like the scent and quality of this soap.</li>
            <li>I tried this one today and it&#x27;s very fragrant.</li>
            <li>All through my school years I was scorned and ridiculed which made me defensive and very aggresive.</li>
            <li>It has made my skin so much softer than it used to be.</li>
            <li>and it really exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have to use as much lotion or moisturizers when I use it.</li>
            <li>If I am not going to fast</li>
            <li>I AM SOLD THANKS TO MY DAUGHTER.  </li>
            <li>really well             Helps even skintone a bit    </li>
            <li>I think we are using it up fast.</li>
            <li>It was much cheaper buying this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li>, THE WHOLE BOX HAD A SMELL.</li>
            <li>BUT I REALLY LIKE THE SOAP</li>
            <li>REALLY LIKE THIS SOAP &amp; HOPE</li>
            <li>, I REALLY LIKE IT</li>
            <li>, HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING THIS!  </li>
            <li>, HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING THIS!  </li>
            <li>thanks.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never gotten this much attention before.</li>
            <li>I admit, that isnt really a problem for me, but my girlfriend has some skin issues from time to time, and she absolutely loves this soap as well.</li>
            <li>After a week or so, I noticed my skin was much softer.  </li>
            <li>and this really soothes the skin.</li>
            <li>and it is very affordable</li>
            <li>I will get straight to the point.  </li>
            <li>It does not take much water to lather up.</li>
            <li>I have KP and nothing has really helped much over the years.</li>
            <li>very close to floor cleaner smell.</li>
            <li>i just recently bought the soap so my review is not as detailed.</li>
            <li>and I saw no redness, there was no itching or swelling, and I haven&#x27;t really felt that sensation since then unless I accidentally get it on my lips.</li>
            <li>highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of people used the whole bar of soap on their face.</li>
            <li>so i began with rubbing the soap in the palm of my hands; you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li>I like this soap because it really did help my skin.</li>
            <li>The expiration date on my soaps were 2013..more than enough time for me to enjoy the benefits of the six pack ordered.  </li>
            <li>When I started use dudu soap my skin was rough and dry,now my skin is better.</li>
            <li>However, to my surprise it really improved my skin tone by fading away blemishes.</li>
            <li>Fast delivery.</li>
            <li>not so much of a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li>a whole body soap for family</li>
            <li>He uses it for his face and I for my whole body.</li>
            <li>I really really like this soap.</li>
            <li>My hair both looks and feels much thicker and it styles</li>
            <li>this soap is the real deal.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a whole box</li>
            <li>Those over the counter soaps really irritated my skin.</li>
            <li>Also my whole body during the winter and no itchy skin.</li>
            <li>yet I always had a breakout no matter how much I paid for products.  </li>
            <li>I do recomend getting some organic jojoba oil to add to your moisturizer to help replinish your skin even if you have really oily skin already.  </li>
            <li>I feel like it really gets all the dirt and oil out</li>
            <li>have very acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>Now i really try not to touch my face at all</li>
            <li>that I had much but its been a year</li>
            <li>I can use it very well.</li>
            <li>and I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>but this one really surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li>the ash acts as a sponge with its porous surface area for absorbing toxins and dirt from the skin</li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Warning: If you use this, then you really need a separate soap dish for it.  </li>
            <li>It really is a miracle bar for the complexion, not drying.</li>
            <li>Cleans very well.</li>
            <li>hahaha</li>
            <li>but i don&#x27;t really mind the rash</li>
            <li>I use this soap on my whole body and face two times a day and my skin has never been clearer or smoother.</li>
            <li>Smells very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>really like this</li>
            <li>I really like this soap.</li>
            <li>I really like the soap.</li>
            <li>I also really don&#x27;t like the way it smells.</li>
            <li>That combined with Audrey Organics Vitamin C toner and then raw/pure Cocoa Butter or Shea Butter afterwards has really done wonders and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my acne.</li>
            <li>and he doesn&#x27;t have as much itching with this soap..</li>
            <li>and it was too gentle.</li>
            <li>The women in my life that I VERY OFTEN discuss beauty products with have also noticed a difference.</li>
            <li>We would spend so much money on acne products and now I just stock up on the soap.y husband works with oil and grease</li>
            <li>I use this soap for my whole body and also for my son who has eczema.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>It really cleans.</li>
            <li>I have very oily skin</li>
            <li>but none that I can really think of since I&#x27;ve been using this soap.</li>
            <li>I use it for my face and it works very well.  </li>
            <li>This soap cleanses really well and got rid of my acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>I now use it for my whole body as well as my face.  </li>
            <li>My skin is extremely sensitive so finding soap that does not make me itch is quite rare.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve never bought soap in bulk, but I saved so much money by doing so.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>so i could gift this more widely among relatives and friends.</li>
            <li>It does its job well on your whole body and</li>
            <li>I today I ordered through another vendor, at a much much cheaper  price.</li>
            <li>I use it on my whole body.</li>
            <li>this has made my face soooooo much smoother</li>
            <li>Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li>The price is extremely reasonable, too.  </li>
            <li>The seller was very informative.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even wear makeup anymore because It&#x27;s helped so much.</li>
            <li>It really did make my skin appear smoother.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t matter how much makeup I put on</li>
            <li>but the whole family is using it now.</li>
            <li>you really want to use this soap, just know that when you use it, it will also turn your skin brown until you thoroughly wash it off...</li>
            <li>Has a tropical smell and works very well with a loufa.</li>
            <li>lathers up really well.</li>
            <li>Some reviews state that is very drying to skin</li>
            <li>It smells fresh and natural, but is not over powering.</li>
            <li>This soap really cleans.  </li>
            <li>It is very drying</li>
            <li>Do not use with light or white rags!</li>
            <li>really it is squeaking when I&#x27;m done!&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really like it as my hair soap.</li>
            <li>but I can really tell the difference on my sisters skin.</li>
            <li>so you really have to keep it in a soap dish.</li>
            <li>some others said that the size of my pores seems to have decreased which also helps with the clearing of acne and not to mention it just makes your skin look great.</li>
            <li>So how much could be said about soap?  </li>
            <li>I have really oily skin and hair.</li>
            <li>but this really help my skin brighten up.</li>
            <li>My hair gets really oily</li>
            <li>Very luxurious and moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li>A whole winter went by without dandruff.</li>
            <li>I really like the soap.</li>
            <li>then you really ought to try this soap.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a great soap if your skin is not too sensitive and can stand a firm natural soup.</li>
            <li>But wow, my skin is looking better all over in the last month than it ever has.</li>
            <li>Will be ordering more in the near future!</li>
            <li>I have been making a conscious effort to use more natural products, and I doubt this fragrance is natural.</li>
            <li>I honestly purchased this soap for childish reasons.</li>
            <li>It will dwindle fast if you leave it wet so make sure to put it in a drainable soap dish.</li>
            <li>So glad I did because I have a clear face for the first time in who knows how long.</li>
            <li>Great African black soap!</li>
            <li>Smell good for a natural black soap!</li>
            <li>The alkalinity of it is very potent because often times when i leave it on my face for a few minutes, I can feel my skin tightening and slightly burning (which feels lovely).  </li>
            <li>comments on this specific brand:  I first tried Nubian Heritage Black soap and loved it.  </li>
            <li>&amp; IT DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER HER SENSITIVE SKIN!!! :</li>
            <li>&amp; IT DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER HER SENSITIVE SKIN!!! :</li>
            <li>My skin feels very fresh after a day working outside is washed away and a night cream is applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most store bought bars are not really black soap, and the color comes from dyes they add to a regular soap.</li>
            <li>I recommend you buy a supply that can last you for awhile, since the soap can dissolve pretty quickly.</li>
            <li>As a seller of many other products I can say that is product is of very high quality.</li>
            <li>I noticed that i was not getting any new break outs after the first 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>soap is super drying compared to better shea butter soaps, I can hardly believe how drying this soap is for all the positive reviews on it.</li>
            <li>Dudu Osun is quickly my personal favorite Black Soap to use because the skin conditions people have like Psoriasis, Eczema, and others could benefit from an easy to use soap like this that is already shaped for you to use.</li>
            <li>Real authentic black soap is not black, it&#x27;s brown, and soft.</li>
            <li>I purshased the Dudu Osun Black soap, because I saw the reviews and live in an apt.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also great in conjunction with raw shea butter which can be found from some of the same seller.</li>
            <li>I read that it can bother people with more sensitive skin, but if that&#x27;s not a major concern to you</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s great for razor burn and sensitive skin, and I like the subtle scent.</li>
            <li>The soap clean very well, I would say this is one of the only bar soaps that could be classified as a a &amp;#34;all in one soap&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li>Better than any other soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Other than that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to find any other soap or product that can do what this soap does.</li>
            <li>Okay, I can vouch for all the other reviewers&#x27; praise for this soap.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad other people like it</li>
            <li>All jokes aside from using soap with a name akin to washing yourself with a turd, I am very pleased with this product&#x27;s performance as someone who has suffered from skin conditions related to stress and constant aggravation from sensitive skin to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This soap works well for them - better than any other acne soap or lotions we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li>Better than the other &amp;#34;RAW&amp;#34; one on Amazon</li>
            <li>Cleans me better than any other soap on the market I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li>My husband has been able to calm his break outs down considerably, and my son&#x27;s skin is doing great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling clean not filmy like the regular soaps.</li>
            <li>I feel so extra clean after using it.</li>
            <li>The coloring of soap effects body cloths but, as long as you rinse thoroughly you will be fine.</li>
            <li>I used the clinique bar for years, and it left my skin feeling clean, but there&#x27;s no discernible difference in the health/appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li>I have long fine hair and with this soap their is no need for conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Clean well low fragrance ,for some I thought it would eliminate lotion</li>
            <li>and I really deep clean my body.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that the soap tends to crumble and doesn&#x27;t hold a clean, compact shape like big-brand soaps.</li>
            <li>It looks really gross but you feel clean.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m seriously thinking about throwing out my body soap and just using this one for everything, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li>Some people argue it makes their skin too dry, it&#x27;s not overboard for me, in fact I believe this is one of the reasons why it&#x27;s effective for acne given that many people with acne have excessively oily skin.</li>
            <li>Had high hopes, but found the soap to be very drying.  </li>
            <li>The soap has a very refreshing fragrance and lathers so well that I have a hard time getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li>I bought this for my son who has facial dandruff and required special cream.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and leaves your skin feeling smooth not dry.</li>
            <li>This soap is all natural, and what I love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li>I first started using it to help clear up my face.</li>

            <li>This soap does make your face glow and also treats your acne and dark and all that, if you read so many reviews.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap to wash my face for the past 3 months, and it&#x27;s been a nice surprise.</li>
            <li>This stuff gets pretty soft and will &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; itself out if kept in standing water.</li>
            <li>My skin has improved so much that I am sure by the middle of next year</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not generally a negative reviewer, but I really did not like this soap...</li>
            <li>I will continue to buy for such a great price and the natural quality of this black soap!</li>
            <li>Dry skin is quenched quickly when using this soap on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li>Now my other co-workers want to try a bar too! :)</li>
            <li>Also be sure to use little product and gentle hands.</li>
            <li>I passed this soap onto my sister whom is experiencing a three year battle with hives and other assorted problems, her first reaction was incredibly positive, I&#x27;ll keep you informed of her longer term use (and be back to buy more if she continues to like it).    </li>
            <li>This stuff makes your skin feel like new!</li>
            <li>I am a hardcore buyer and trier of new products to better my skin (anti-aging, blemishes, spot correcting), along with other products like cosmetics, hair products, and body moisturizers.</li>
            <li>I already live in a desert climate, and lotions tend to irritate my skin, so I really can&#x27;t use this soap anymore.</li>
            <li>BUT it&#x27;s wonderfully perfume fragrant with decent lather and after washing with it, I can tell it&#x27;s a natural soap because I don&#x27;t feel my skin get tight and itchy as is usual with mainstream soaps which have chemicals in them.  </li>
            <li>Your skin will seem dry even though it is so smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li>It bleeds black quite a bit, however, I think all soaps bleed, just this one is more noticeable.</li>
            <li>Additionally, I enjoyed laughing at the name Dudu because it litterly looks like you are scrubbing yourself with a oddly shaped turd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li>I was finally able to get rid of a stubborn black head I had for years...</li>
            <li>Love black soap.</li>
            <li>Love this black soap.</li>
            <li>To make it even less believable...</li>
            <li>Love this black soap.</li>
            <li>Love this Black soap..</li>
            <li>I love this Black Soap.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure that it never had that listed on the box in the past</li>
            <li>It irritated my face leaving it red and itching , a burning feeling , also my skin gotten super oily after using this .</li>
            <li>I use it mainly on my face and it exfoliates and cleanses well.</li>
            <li>I get them on my buttocks, chest, arms but mainly on my legs which made me quite embrassed to wear skirt and dress that werent ankle length.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Order up a decent stock, it&#x27;s so addicting</li>
            <li>But i have a feeling i finally found the best kept secret!   </li>
            <li>I purchased this particular brand and use this once per day</li>
            <li>It mainly helps reduce the redness and the flakiness I experience.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m getting older and my skin is changing...</li>
            <li>Better off with a handmade soap with real essential oils and maybe even bought locally.</li>
            <li>This soap has a great smell and a good skin feel, but it dries out my skin terribly.</li>
            <li>Overall, I would say the product was okay but will not continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li>My skin feels refreshed with a healthy glow, even clearing up my occasional problematic skin irritations, such as acne and any rashes caused by the outdoors or stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This takes off makeup, especially eye makeup, faster, better and cleaner than the priciest facial cleanser.</li>
            <li>It is mild and deep cleanses.</li>
            <li>i went to the dermatologist where i had the doctors stumped..after about $200 in medicine and co pays and 2 biopsys to see what it is, the bumps did not go away and the biopsys came back as perfect nothing wrong with them.  </li>
            <li>and I loved it, but it was quite strange to watch the dark brown water coming off me from using this.</li>
            <li>I have always had very sensitive skin and absolutely nothing worked for my acne</li>
            <li>will buy again it clear your skin up well good for acne dark spots and deep cleans your skin</li>
            <li>Bought it on a whim after reading about African black soap, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this brand.</li>
            <li>RAW African Black Soap is perfect too, BUT when you buy it, you have to cut it to however much</li>
            <li>Highly recommended-</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product and this vendor to everyone.</li>
            <li>I WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IN HIGH SCHOOL</li>
            <li>If you are on the fence about buying this soap, I would highly recommend you give it a try.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend</li>
            <li>Anyways,  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it for those with acne or complexion issues.</li>
            <li>Both are alkaline (high pH level).</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li>It was highly recommended to me, and I have not used &amp;#34;bar soap&amp;#34; in years,&lt;br</li>
            <li>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li>This is the best African Black soap I have tried and my family and I have tried quite a few.  </li>
            <li>honestly prefer black soap over castile soap, I also use it in my locs, my sons wavy hair, and my husband&#x27;s short straight hair.</li>
            <li>honestly prefer black soap over castile soap, I also use it in my locs, my sons wavy hair, and my husband&#x27;s short straight hair.</li>
            <li>I bought because the box says pure natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I think the formula was tweaked a bit, as the issues I had with the first batch (strong smell when using, irritation where the skin is sensitive) are no longer present in the current batch.</li>
            <li>Even tried the dermatologist and still could not get 100% clear, and I tried it all!!  </li>
            <li>It can be a little drying, though, so make sure you moisturize.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean without feeling dried out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s all natural and the charcoal in it helps soften hair and skin and leaves you feeling extra clean.</li>
            <li>I am light skin african american and scar very easily and have had little to no luck finding a solution.</li>
            <li>However, I love using this soap all over my body, especially before I work out because I found out that if I use this bar and sweat a bunch and I can&#x27;t clean up after I won&#x27;t break out at all, usually I&#x27;ll have a couple pimples here and there because of the sweat and stuff</li>
            <li>My scars are fading significantly after just one week, No new pimples</li>
            <li>My wife hasn&#x27;t complained about it yet, and that fact alone makes it amazing.</li>
            <li>My face skin is always clear and I attribute much of that to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li>, b/c in my experience you can&#x27;t really trust any company when they say something is natural.  </li>
            <li>The soap is all natural and contains lime juice which is why my skin got so much lighter, and why the acne goes away.</li>
            <li>When you first use it, your skin will feel \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean and that may be a bit odd for some</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle product, so it doesn&#x27;t clear up your skin overnight, but it really conditions the skin well without over-drying it</li>
            <li>It is all natural, cleanses very well and I will continue to order.  </li>
            <li>My face so far is responding to it VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li>i felt clean after wash, and never felt dry.  </li>
            <li>And after having years of clear skin, this bothered me so much.</li>
            <li>I feel clean with no residue and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li>Also, it&#x27;s gentle on the sensitive skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li>natural ingreidients straight from Nigeria.</li>
            <li>I have extremely sensitive skin on my hands but not so much on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li>It really stung my eyes, which makes me think, if this item is natural, what makes the eyes sting?  </li>
            <li>It took a week or two for my face to return to normal.  </li>
            <li>it works really well for my moderate acne to reduce and prevent it when i use it consistently.</li>
            <li>this Dudu-Osun is pretty much the same thing.</li>
            <li>I did pass along a few bars of soap to friend and they also love it for their skin.</li>
            <li>Do not keep this thing on your face for more then a few minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li>We went through 5 bars in 2 months with 4 people using daily which is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>The only thing is that it sort of melts, pretty fast.</li>
            <li>the normal noxema and petroleum jelly have run their course.</li>
            <li>This especially was true near my nose, where the skin started peeling.</li>
            <li>Also, I read a review where it helped with body acne and although my days of battling body acne are pretty much over, I still break out on my back and face sometimes.</li>
            <li>A few more weeks</li>
            <li>these will forever be our everyday staples for healthy skin care.</li>
            <li>It made ME smell like it, too, and not in a normal, soapy way.</li>
            <li>but I did lots a research that stated this was normal and the dryness &amp; &amp;#34;sensation&amp;#34</li>
            <li>I had lotion too but did not use it yet.this soap rocks and brought back my smile..</li>
            <li>I normally cannot use anything on my face, but I kid you not</li>
            <li>This is pure unadulterated black soap.  </li>
            <li>Dudu Osun Black Soap is a good soap to use if you have very sensitive skin or dry skin problems.</li>
            <li>Healthy soap, I&#x27;ve been repurchasing this soap since I started switching to more natural ingredient soaps, the down side is that the bar doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>So far, my skin feels less dry compared to the other soap so that&#x27;s a great start!</li>
            <li>I love this soap...will be using black soap from this seller always!</li>
            <li>Its natural ingredients are great for my skin (I&#x27;m black) and I&#x27;ve noticed that the dark marks on my skin are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li>Love this black soap!</li>
            <li>I feel silly saying I love a soap, however, it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li>We love &amp;#34;our&amp;#34; black soap!  </li>
            <li>It did initially leave my skin very dry after the first two times of using it but after that it was fine.</li>
            <li>so this is the part where some times my face feels very clean but just a little sting</li>
            <li>My only issue is that it easily melts (fades away) when left in the soap dish in the shower as the water hits it</li>
            <li>The soap is a luxurious experience right when you open the package.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve finally found the right combination.</li>
            <li>Makes your skin feel so clean; helps if you have acne &amp; helps if your skin is too dry!</li>
            <li>First soap I&#x27;ve ever used that did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li>I can finally see my shoulder with no blemishes for the first time since I was a little girl, and I love how it smells.</li>
            <li>the soap makes you really dry after using the soap though, so really recommend that you put on lotion right after wards.&lt;br</li>
            <li>As studies show other races that are not ethnic have thinner sensitive skin so there is no way all of these positive reviews are true.</li>
            <li>I got a little more to clear up</li>
            <li>At first, my face felt really dry after washing it, but as long as you moisturize your face, you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li>I noticed that ever since I switched to organic and natural products, it takes a little but of time but results are better and healthier for your skin.</li>
            <li>The only drawback is that it is extremely soft, so it melted away pretty quickly when left on my sink.</li>
            <li>All of the new reviews except mine rated a 5 stars.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t figure out why the polish on my newly manicured nails would not stay on until I stopped using this soap.</li>
            <li>I live by this soap and when I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t get new ones.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t care how &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; it is- nothing could convince me to live with that stench.</li>
            <li>but I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s his new soap as well.  </li>
            <li>but I can live that verses the benefits</li>
            <li>I had dinner at my sister&#x27;s on New Years Day</li>
            <li>I live by this soap.</li>
            <li>I live in a hard water area and have tried many soaps that claim to be gentle</li>
            <li>This soap does not dry my skin out any more than any other soap</li>
            <li>I love trying new soaps and will stick with this for a long, long time.</li>
            <li>Not to be overly dramatic, but this soap gets you a different kind of clean.</li>
            <li>It actually left them with very shiny coats.... and the rubbery feeling was a bonus because it really helped the dog brush grip the shedding fur.</li>
            <li>It actually left them with very shiny coats.... and the rubbery feeling was a bonus because it really helped the dog brush grip the shedding fur.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell of this soap, but it does leave your skin soft.  </li>
            <li>and super dry.....</li>
            <li>I saw some where people thought that the good reviews were actually fake reviews,  and that really worried me.....</li>
            <li>But Im definately going back to raw because I feel like it cleans soooo much better!</li>
            <li>I just washed my face with it about 3 minutes ago and haven&#x27;t used any moisturizer and my skin feels soft an smooth and not tight and dry.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have keratosis polaris and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it to clear up any blemishes.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and have found this soap to be helpful in eliminating the itching and skin rash.  </li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>now I use it just about everywhere except my very sensitive areas.</li>
            <li>My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This soap pulls all impurities out of skin and leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li>It has a very natural, kinda grassy scent that does not linger on he skin.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and eczema</li>
            <li>In April 2011 (exactly one year later) I was moving from my apartment into my new house and was packing up the cabinet and discovered it.</li>
            <li>( my face is usually clear)!</li>
            <li>It controls acne very well apparently.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>update after more time has past...</li>
            <li>I first bought and used this soap when suggested by my African hair braider.  </li>
            <li>I was currently using the Goats Milk Soap - I like it, but it has a funny smell.  </li>
            <li>I have now used it for 3 day &amp; all i can say is wow!</li>
            <li>First it made my face tingle for a couple of days, then it turned my face red!</li>
            <li>At first use it made my skin tingle,but that only lasted a couple of days of use.</li>
            <li>My first concern with this soap is that they don&#x27;t disclose all of the ingredients, they only list the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients in bullets on the box.</li>
            <li>so I was pleasantly surprised on the lather that this soap creates!</li>
            <li>I actually keep the unopened boxes in a plastic bag, since the smell is pretty strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I at first used it for my face only, and it felt radiant.</li>
            <li>The next year I was able to get more and after that I was unable to locate anymore.</li>
            <li>The only thing I would advise anyone who uses it, is that because it is such an all-natural product, make sure to not leave it anywhere in the shower where it gets the constant flow of the showerhead, because it will literally rinse-away over time.  </li>
            <li>I first found this soap at an outside market in Washington D.C.</li>
            <li>I have tried this soap before in the past and love the results.  </li>
            <li>You almost feel like you don&#x27;t have to put lotion on after - and I am 57 years old!  </li>
            <li>and i can see a big difference.the first week</li>
            <li>It has an herbal citrus-y smell that is a little strong at first, but does not last on your skin.</li>
            <li>I had read of the many benefits of using African Black Soap and along with the the high reviews I chose this brand.  </li>
            <li>But this time my intention is to get a deep deep clean</li>
            <li>but, if youve used this product and had the same reaction or have hypersensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to risk more breakouts, there are other available no fragrance containing black soaps on amazon.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t let it get near your eyes or other more fragile</li>
            <li>Smells great too, but the only thing is it does leave a bit mess because the soap is dark</li>
            <li>which honestly sensitive or not u should take baby steps with new products.</li>
            <li>It took me a long time to find the right soap.  </li>
            <li>[...]  check out this website they have a way better product line of black soap...it was really dry didn&#x27;t lather very well I used it for about one week</li>
            <li>Yes, it is messy and will leave stains on your sink, but they are easily rinsed off, so</li>
            <li>It works very well for people of color and does not dry out the skin or leave residue.</li>
            <li>I have pretty sensitive skin and was terrified from the reviews with people talking about their skin getting irritated and red after use.</li>
            <li>I have a Weimaraner and these dogs are known for having very sensitive coats... even too sensitive for dog shampoos and baby shampoos.</li>
            <li>The soap is very powerful and I decided to by the all natural raw Shea butter to help me out with moisture, these two products combined will absolutely transform your skin.</li>
            <li>I LIKED THE FEELING , AS IF IT WAS GETTING INTO MY SKIN&amp; PORES, DOING &amp;#34;SOMETHING&amp;#34; ( at least!</li>
            <li>this soap has helped me to not only dry up acne/oil from my face, but to visibly soften acne marks and smooth my skin all over.  </li>
            <li>make sure you use a moisturizer with this product because it can dry out your skin if you arn&#x27;t too careful.</li>
            <li>This soap leaves your skin soft and because I have very oily skin, I do not use any moisturizer after and this soap and my skin is never dry.</li>
            <li>I love African black soap and this soap works well.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s fine after a few uses.  </li>
            <li>About a month ago I started using this soap on my entire body and love the way my skin feels although it does leave a mess in the shower.</li>
            <li>, I&#x27;d pick this soap which gives you 6 large soapbars, albeit ugly-looking &amp; feeling, for a lowly bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a middle-aged white dude with large pores and somewhat oily skin.  </li>
            <li>It make your face feel fresh, and wont feel very dry after washing face.</li>
            <li>It will clean really well but dried my skin out alittle!</li>
            <li>skin is combination with a little more than occasional large cystic acne in the aforementioned area.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a light skinned African American that bought this soap for softer skin, fading of dark spots (mainly on my legs), and stretch marks (in combo with pure shea butter).</li>
            <li>After I finished showering I used a little coconut oil on my face and it feels baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>My husband posted a photo of this soap on the floor of our shower on Facebook, and I had a hard time convincing people</li>
            <li>It helps me clear up my acne, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most other body soaps.</li>
            <li>But my cheeks are pretty raw right now (and I have never considered myself to have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried raw black soap before, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li>We saw immediately results with clear skin showing through.  </li>
            <li>This soap has helped clear up my acne.  </li>
            <li>This soap will also clear scars.</li>
            <li>and when I saw my way clear to do</li>
            <li>I have always had clear skin.</li>
            <li>This is helping to clear up my son&#x27;s chronic acne break outs and oily skin.</li>
            <li>Started to use this soap to help clear my skin.</li>
            <li>-I am very self conscious about taking pictures unless i have make up on, which further aggravates my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but now my face is always clear.</li>
            <li>but it did not help to clear blemishes either.  </li>
            <li>Keeps skin clear and moisturized</li>
            <li>My skin is clear and glows.</li>
            <li>It causes a burning uncomfortable sensation in private areas lol</li>
            <li>This soap has helped to lighten the areas in my face and leaves me with a clear complexion.  </li>
            <li>This is an all natural soap.</li>
            <li>I have every used so far.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li>I just ordered this product, and I was surprised when I went to my mailbox, and it just reeked of a flowery/sweet scent.  </li>
            <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the tropical smell.</li>
            <li>I ordered the \\&quot;natural shea</li>
            <li>I tried this soap as a body wash for a week before I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the itchy rash I developed while using it.      </li>
            <li>and I like how soft it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li>My skin was so soft without even applying lotion.</li>
            <li>I would recommend unscented Dove for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference from regular bar soap though.  </li>
            <li>but I haven&#x27;t yet seen any changes and it&#x27;s been nearly 3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Tried it because I heard it was a natural, result producing product</li>
            <li>and OMG, I swear its close to a miracle to my skin, those yearssss of old scars, 95% of them are gone.</li>
            <li>Now people come up to by and tell me I have beatuiful skin (which has never happened to me in my young years).  </li>
            <li>My husband always comments how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li>and so far I am sold.</li>
            <li>I do not need to reapply and it will last the whole while.</li>
            <li>CAREFULLY on sensitive skin, it will feel like it&#x27;s burning.</li>
            <li>I have been looking for a natural soap that was affordable and this is it.  </li>
            <li>and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li>IT RINSED OFF MY WASHCLOTH COMPLETELY, JUST FYI</li>
            <li>( unless your REALLY SENSITIVE to smells, then maybe, but I&#x27;d still try it!)&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>EVEN MY 11 yr OLD DAUGHTER LIKES IT</li>
            <li>EVEN MY 11 yr OLD DAUGHTER LIKES IT</li>
            <li>Then I used this on my face on a frequent basis.</li>
            <li>I have slightly sensitive skin, but not overly so.</li>
            <li>I use this on my daughters sensitive skin</li>
            <li>Throw in the natural ingredients without added chemicals and the like</li>
            <li>Plus my skin feels, in the words of my sister, \\&quot;as soft as a baby&#x27;s bum.\\&quot;  Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li>I read so much about this soap that I finally decided to order some and give it a try.</li>
            <li>I like things that have a natural, organic fragrance and this does.</li>
            <li>If you have sensitive skin  avoid this product.</li>
            <li>Leaves skin so soft, and tight.&lt;br /&gt;6th.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this soap leaves my skin soft, even without a moisturizer after use.  </li>
            <li>Helps my 74 year old mother&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how it would work on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>Still, if I had to pick a natural soap while saving my $$&#x27;s</li>
            <li>(Yes it lightens a shade meaning very subtle-not enough to change my race)&lt;br</li>
            <li>It seem to be natural ingredients and  no stimulation.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve found that my scars have faded over time and my skin feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>I AM NOW 56 YEARS OLD.  </li>
            <li>, I now use all of my old wash cloths and keep the soap in a plastic soap dish in the shower.</li>
            <li>I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>my pores have become smaller, very moisturizing, works well with my oily skin.</li>
            <li>My 15 year old son loves it as well.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for about 8 months now, and it keeps my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li>My skin is too sensitive to use it.</li>
            <li>you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li>I have problems with eczema on my scalp but this soap has reduced it by 80% so far.</li>
            <li>and she didn&#x27;t need lotion afterwards and that is completely a lie.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li>Just beware if you are sensitive to smell you may not want to order this product.</li>
            <li>This affects the amount of time soap has to be purchased, so be conscious.</li>
            <li>and now Im 25 with adult acne.</li>
            <li>I started experimenting with natural products to heal my scarred skin from acne.</li>
            <li>directly because the skin is tougher.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been to several dermatologist and all they did was prescribe me a cream that didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li>I always love to read all the reviews (I can be a sucker sometimes)</li>
            <li>simply lather and apply to face by rubbing gently in circular motion.  </li>
            <li>Frequently get acne &amp; ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li>This soap is all natural and I recommend it to anyone who is struggling with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li>I use it on my hair instead of shampoo because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li>My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients</li>
            <li>I took the reviews claiming it completely clears your skin and fades stretch marks with a grain of salt, but even so the soap exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li>But i think the odor is because of its natural material.  </li>
            <li>so one can only hope that it is ethically sourced and that the ingredients are what they claim to be.</li>
            <li>its a natural product, just not working for me.</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>Some of the reviews had me worried as I have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>My husband has itchy, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>I have medium sensitive skin in areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li>but I moisturize well directly after I apply my astringent.</li>
            <li>This has not stained my tub or towels and the only way I would see this happening is if people are using too much soap and not rinsing thoroughly.</li>
            <li>a loooong way!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing more of this soap in the future (in greater bulk), and I&#x27;m sorry I haven&#x27;t found it sooner.</li>
            <li>I am an adult who still gets occassional acne.  </li>
            <li>Completely amazed.</li>
            <li>Let me start this off by saying that I have tried nearly everything.</li>
            <li>It was caused by hormones, since I had been on hormone replacement therapy for nearly 5 months at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>how much moisturizer, I was literally starting to look like a zombie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I developed a rash on my face</li>
            <li>purchased this on a reccomendation from someone else, made my skin and face feel really soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>Im a real fan of african product.</li>
            <li>My 7 year old uses it as well.  </li>
            <li>I use this soap along with a toner and Lush cosmetics moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I work early in the morning</li>
            <li>and I rub it directly on my body</li>
            <li>To a point where I thought that my eczema was spreading throughout my entire body at that very moment.</li>
            <li>And, it keeps my skin soft and moisturized as well.</li>
            <li>I can not stop telling people about how it completely cleared my teenager&#x27;s dandruff after 1 use.</li>
            <li>Anti-bacterial action.</li>
            <li>they were to come back and also because i have very oily skin</li>
            <li>My daughter csn use this without her sensitive skin getting irritated.  </li>
            <li>This soap is made in Africa and is all natural.  </li>
            <li>use this daily on my face because my skin is very oily and prone to acne, and this soap helps with that nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li>I have combination skin that has some leftover spots from old pimples.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve started using it on my body as well; any form of dryness can be easily fixed.</li>
            <li>my skin was really itchy and red</li>
            <li>I have eczema and get frequent flare-ups.  </li>
            <li>This soap keeps it on check and keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li>I have ordered this three times thus far.</li>
            <li>The dudu osun soaps shipping time was expeditious, and the product itself far exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li>only real downside is that it does leave an unsightly and somewhat suspicious looking brown trail wherever you place it, but even then it doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li>Even as an adult my skin always had problems with breakouts, not anymore.</li>
            <li>I used it on my face and it completely changed everything.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m all about using products with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li>and WOW what a difference it had made.</li>
            <li>my skin is radiant and feels so soft and silky...</li>
            <li>I have used this soap occasionally and really like it.  </li>
            <li>my skin is sensitive, and I gave it a try</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t believe it,it also make ur hair feel.so silky,that I Dnt have to use conditioner anymore my hair is soft as a baby</li>
            <li>theres a natural glow that i get</li>
            <li>Natural and not too pungent.  </li>
            <li>It is very moisturizing and cleansing at the same time.</li>
            <li>Works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>This soap does have a expiration date since it is all natural.  </li>
            <li>I ordered six bars and it had a far off expiration date.</li>
            <li>I actually only use the soap when I know I won&#x27;t be running into anyone for a while, because of how much people dislike the smell.    </li>
            <li>and I have naturally oily skin...and acne (even cystic)</li>
            <li>It also helped me get rid of some keratosis pilaris I had near my knees and on my elbows.</li>
            <li>I have heard of Dudu-Osun but hadn&#x27;t seen it in any of the shops locally for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Leaves my skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li>My daughter has sensitive skin and severe acne.  </li>
            <li>All natural.  </li>
            <li>No chemicals, just natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this soap daily, sometimes even twice a day, for about 3 weeks, and it&#x27;s really helped reduce oiliness and acne.</li>
            <li>Locally I cannot find authentic black soap, but I have found a few brands that although they are not authentic they are made out of the good stuff</li>
            <li>the Aloe Vera Gel will cool the irritation down.</li>
            <li>Makes your face feel tight, soft, and refreshingly clean.</li>
            <li>Began sloughing off dead skin after the first use!!</li>
            <li>long as you don&#x27;t really care how your soap looks or feels, I would recommend it as fine for aromatherapy and everyday use, but not as a gift to a friend since the packaging and product form leaves a lot to be desired unless it&#x27;s a friend with sensitive skin or who likes dabbling with natural and/or organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is mild on my face and as long as I continue with my daily twice a day regimen</li>
            <li>However you can find other similar cleansers like this in drug stores with cheap price as well.</li>
            <li>At first, the soap seemed to work, leaving my face feeling refreshed, but as the weeks went on, I started having dry skin.</li>
            <li>I would also suggest picking up a exfoliating cream that you can use 2 times a week and a moisturizer because the soap will dry your skin when you first use it.</li>
            <li>It quickly lessened any dark spots on my face and hands also.  </li>
            <li>It smells nice, and lasts a while if you only use it as a face soap since a little goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li>I am 43, incredibly pale (Northern European heritage) and have overly sensitive, extremely dry skin, and I love this soap!</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the added fragrance, it is overwhelming...smells like a car air freshener, very strong.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little much the first times around.</li>
            <li>I love a deep clean, so I lather my face and rub in small circles for a few minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought this many times in the past before, from all different sellers.</li>
            <li>Not a typical baby rash, either.</li>
            <li>This soap is brown and not black.</li>
            <li>I quickly washed off and began to use Dr. Woods black soap that I also purchased from Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Be careful washing any sensitive areas at first.</li>
            <li>at first I only used it on my back (because of acne)</li>
            <li>well, some black soaps start to crumble quickly</li>
            <li>The other reviewers were right.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone with similar issues.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used all kinds of organic, high end creams and soaps, but this one actually works..</li>
            <li>/&gt;Dudu-Osun soap contains different forms of wood ash, which in turn has a high percentage of calcium carbonate (used in agricultural lime) and potash (used in lye).</li>
            <li>High quality soap - not only for Africans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li>With all of the high priced designer French milled soaps, muds, and skin tonics</li>
            <li>Shipment was very fast and it arrived before the expected date.</li>
            <li>In the winter time it can seem a little drying to my face in particular so I just use a little extra rose hip seed oil or witch hazel</li>
            <li>Takes away acne like no other products!</li>
            <li>and I was curious to try some authentic black soap from Africa.</li>
            <li>Using similar black soaps doesn&#x27;t do the job, this product leaves my face feeling cleansed and oil free.</li>
            <li>but due to my sensitive skin i quick apply honey oatmeal naturally facial scrub.</li>
            <li>In the past year I started getting huge cystic pimples all over my cheeks and along my jawline.</li>
            <li>I agree with another reviewer that their ingredients don&#x27;t seem to be accurate as only a few natural items are listed.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s priced reasonably and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>I am of Asian descent, over 50, and have clear skin that I have always taken care of, so I can&#x27;t speak for clearing up skin conditions, but for whole body, including face, this is the only soap you will</li>
            <li>Price is also reasonable and each bar lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li>Also, be careful with sensitive areas such as eyes, freshly shaved armpits and legs, and the nether-regions.</li>
            <li>Delivery was on time and the product is exactly what I expected</li>
            <li>Last but not least</li>
            <li>IDK if this is normal, and I&#x27;ve only been using this for almost two weeks but</li>
            <li>Makes you skin soft and smooth help to remove dead skin especially from arm pits.</li>
            <li>The soap makes me feel dry and it burned certain areas of my body.</li>
            <li>It leaves you clean and does not leave the normal soap scum in your tub.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i had gotten a large tattoo on my arm back in March and started to develop red bumps alllllll over my tattoo (before you say allergic to the ink</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used other black soaps and they seem to help my daughters eczema better than this one.</li>
            <li>Not to mention the goodness of the original black soap mixed with honey (my fav).</li>
            <li>Somehow I think it is more processed than other black soaps that I have tried buuuut...</li>
            <li>This is d only soap that works for me, I haven&#x27;t had any new break out</li>
            <li>This soap really helped me with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s easy to use and smells great, it won&#x27;t sit in your soap dish and melt like organic base black soap can.</li>
            <li>It really took a toll on my face, leaving it ridiculously dry even after applying moisturizers.</li>
            <li>Dark brown that does NOT stain at all (my white washcloths are just fine and stay white when rinsed out or washed).</li>
            <li>I have only been using it for about two months and my skin has honestly never looked better.</li>
            <li>(pretty much every scent) for the past 4 years.  </li>
            <li>With shea butter and natural herbs and scents]] which is always #1 on my list triple milled with soft texture imported from France - try their different fragrances</li>
            <li>I smile and say Dudu osun black soap</li>
            <li>so 6 bars should last you a pretty long time (depending on your household size of course)</li>
            <li>/&gt;It lasts pretty long and the bars are big.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li>The more sensitive your skin, the worse this will be.</li>
            <li>The acne becoming worse possibly was what most would consider the purging stage, to where it&#x27;s worse before it&#x27;s better, but I&#x27;m too impatient for that.</li>
            <li>the soap cleans my skin very well w/o leaving it dry or irritatedly cracked, it left my face clean and tight (just watch out for prolonging skin contact.</li>
            <li>I have eczema and since I have used it I barely use my cream that my dermatologist prescribed for me!</li>
            <li>but you will definitely feel cleaner and naturally refreshed!</li>
            <li>the major brands.</li>
            <li>I am so disappointed especially since there were such great reviews!</li>
            <li>Besides the cleaning power, there is no other benefits like some of the reviews posted that it helps with eczema and lighten the skin.  </li>
            <li>We were so excited to use since we both have a SMALL problem with breakouts.</li>
            <li>My only problem is that it was easily flushed down the toilet by my children</li>
            <li>The first time I used it my skin kinda felt dry but that resolved by third use.</li>
            <li>We have a family of sensitive skin, I have dry eczema prone skin on my body and a normal to oily skin on my face that is prone to breakouts and has plenty of acne scarring.</li>
            <li>I slowly drifted from the commercial American junk to more natural products.</li>
            <li>Dudu Osun Black Soap, 6-Count review right now.</li>
            <li>Shea Moisture&#x27;s soap is very gentle and helps control oily skin as well as help with ingrown hair irritation, sure its more expensive, but at this moment i rather just have two bars of gentle soap than 8 of this irritating product, ugh 12 dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li>Other soaps make his skin break out but not this one :)  A little messy, but worth it...</li>
            <li>very messy but worth it!</li>
            <li>Some black soaps cause a burning irritation if left on the skin while showering for too long, but this specific product is more tolerable.</li>
            <li>The dry skin on my hands was smooth in less than 3 days.</li>
            <li>We are African American decent and she asked me one day,</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend for teens or adults with acne, not young children or the elderly.</li>
            <li>It may make your skin feel just a bit tight right after using it, but I don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend this item the only thing is don&#x27;t use it with white wash cloths!</li>
            <li>which generally keeps my acne under control, but never gets rid of it, and dries out my skin.  </li>
            <li>In general, I have oily skin as well.</li>
            <li>General effectiveness.</li>
            <li>General effectiveness.</li>
            <li>This soap has helped to clear up my body and facial acne.</li>
            <li>my husband did the first day, but now both of us are clear 99% of the time, despite our heavy workout routines &amp; sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li>i noticed that my acne is starting to clear up.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s starting to clear up my skin&#x27;s acne blemishes/scars</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m in to using a lot of natural products these day and this is one I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li>I used it for 2 days without any problems (in fact, I noticed that my blemishes are clearing up), but when I had to wash my face 2 times in a time frame of about 4 hours, this caused my skin to become extremely sensitive and red.    </li>
            <li>but once I used this soap on his ultra sensitive skin his excema cleared up almost instantly.</li>
            <li>It calmed me instantly, leaving my skin soft and brighter.</li>
            <li>I RECOMMEND THIS SOAP TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY TO ALL SKIN TYPE AND ALL PEOPLE.    </li>
            <li>You can barely see them</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve gone threw countless prescriptions, microdermabrasions, chemical peels, all natural remedies, but nothing would work.  </li>
            <li>which is #1 on my list with soft texture, triple milled made in the french way but made in the US&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li>I wash my sensitive areas with the second</li>
            <li>I also developed tiny bumps on my face, but that could be because of the shea butter.</li>
            <li>Your face will also feel soft at the same time.</li>
            <li>Visible difference after usuage- only directly after using though.</li>
            <li>Once I received it, the last ingredient is &#x27;fragrance&#x27; which there is nothing natural about.</li>
            <li>My skin still breaks out, but not as frequently, though when they do appear they tend to be big</li>
            <li>It cleared up his skin without irritation and went back to natural tone.</li>
            <li>So far, I don&#x27;t see any big changes.</li>
            <li>And it&#x27;s all natural - which is a giant upside to what you might find n</li>
            <li>My Bare Minerals foundation just barely covered it.</li>
            <li>They were still there of course, but even my mother was surprised by the instant difference.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a fair-skinned blonde with extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li>As a 44 year old female I find it can be a bit drying</li>
            <li>like natural fragrance but similar to the chemical essence.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am not ashame anymore to wear my bare legs.</li>
            <li>I stopped using it so frequently and cut back to one every 2 days.</li>
            <li>My husband has really sensitive skin that will crack, swell, and break out when he uses some products, he&#x27;s also a fire fighter and is constantly training and exercising</li>
            <li>I wish dudu osun sold an all natural version without fragrance but currently to my knowledge, they don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li>When I first applied the later on my wet face, my skin started to itch and prickle, but I dismissed it as its healing properties taking into effect.  </li>
            <li>I have normal, not sensitive skin</li>
            <li>If left on the skin for even a minute, I can feel the burning for up to six hours later, and my skin sensitivity level is normal.</li>
            <li>Dudu Osun has been my best-kept secret for many years now.</li>
            <li>I tried everything you could think of and honestly I think I was making my face angry because the acne seemed to look like a rash; almost like I had the measles.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m just thrilled with the results, was going to the dermatologist which prescribed expensive creams but nothing worked like this soap</li>
            <li>I would have given 5 stars except I thought that the black soap w/aloe and shea butter worked a little better for my skin.</li>
            <li>It quickly dissolves when sitting on a wet surface (even a slightly wet one).</li>
            <li>One thing that seems to be true that other reviewers said was that my face is having some minor breakouts although it also is starting to feel softer and is looking</li>
            <li>tried this because it seemed odd and had a funny name.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li>This was my first time buying black soap.  </li>
            <li>my hyperpigmentation seems to be less noticeable after the first use.</li>
            <li>It dries my skin out a lot more than other things in the past that i used have.</li>
            <li>though - it gets used up quick and is messy!     </li>
            <li>Other than that, not bad just be careful.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Smell [personal preference, it&#x27;s not strong or lingering, I just prefer the Nubian &amp; Shea Moisture brand smells better]&lt;br /&gt;Melts quickly in the shower</li>
            <li>I also live in the desert and genetically have dry skin.</li>
            <li>I only got to use it once so far, but it is reaaaaly different</li>
            <li>with any soap, if you want to have it last longer, keep it away from water and get a soapholder with holes on the bottom so the water doesn&#x27;t stay to liquefy the soap.iple milled with soft texture imported from France - try their different fragrances</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even know how many hours I&#x27;ve wasted researching and experimenting with different products until I found this black soap which uses a formula that&#x27;s been around for hundreds of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Another note: I do try to eat healthy, but no more than the average person</li>
            <li>I have been back and forth with different types of natural soaps.</li>
            <li>My face and upper body ( chest and back )are covered with old acne spots and marks.  </li>
            <li>This is such a disappointment because everything else about the soap is absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li>Used on my face and body, feels good.clean but not dry.</li>
            <li>This one there is no residue, my skin is not dry</li>
            <li>I did not dry my face out</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t use no dry skin.</li>
            <li>I used it also and after showering my skin was not dry</li>
            <li>and it does not dry it out at all.  </li>
            <li>I plan, personally, to stick to French triple-milled soaps and pay a bit more for less mess.</li>
            <li>First off let me give you a little background...</li>
            <li>and then the 2 week all the pimples were dead and my face looks good, the dark spot were too black for the 1st week but on my second week you only see them if you close to me.</li>
            <li>Dudu-Osun is the age-long African black soap made the traditional way by hand from PURE NATURAL INGREDIENTS AND HERBS from the tropical rainforest and savannah regions.  </li>
            <li>i looked up natural remedies to cure his dry skin and black soap was the first item to pop up on the majority of the reveiws.</li>
            <li>The strong rule, the weak suffer.</li>
            <li>ONCE IT&#x27;S WET &amp; YOU USE IT , THE SMELL IS LESS STRONG &amp; IT&#x27;S FROM NATURAL CITRUS , &amp;OTHER INGREDIENTS...</li>
            <li>We got the first bar at a local health foods store and found it for less here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li>Great product, especially in the cold dry air of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula.</li>
            <li>I then ordered the raw African black soap which works 10X more.</li>
            <li>It tends to leave ugly soap smudges (looks like dirt), but easy enough to clean up.</li>
            <li>My husband is constantly making fun of my natural &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; soaps, but lately he has abandoned his Dove bars in favor of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works well for facial use as well as general cleansing.  </li>
            <li>Seems to lather very well and the bars are much bigger than other brands of soaps, which seemed to have reduced their bar sizes over the years.</li>
            <li>Remember not to leave it too long on sensitive area of your skin because the stuff BURNS.</li>
            <li>Also, don&#x27;t leave it on the face too long and do I would not recommend applying the soap directly to your face.</li>
            <li>A) Its a soap made out of natural ingredients and herbs that does the job.&lt;br /&gt;B) It can make your skin burn if you keep it on your skin for too long for some reason</li>
            <li>It also does wonders for my feet, keeps them soft all day long</li>
            <li>My 15 year old daughter who breaks out occasionally on her face and her back is now starting to use it.  </li>
            <li>Clearly not a product for sensitive flowers.</li>
            <li>It will permeate the bathroom for the first few days, but the smell dissolves.  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if they made different colors because it does look odd when I set it down in my shower and the water runs down kinda brown looking.</li>
            <li>Any bumps that I do get dry up quickly and dont leave a very dark mark.</li>
            <li>I also have some hyperpigmentation issues (freckles), dark circles, and a few fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li>If you have normal skin, slightly dry like my daughter, you will only want to use this maybe 3x per week (and only once per day then)</li>
            <li>The bar is large and does make a mess in the tub, not a deal breaker though.  </li>
            <li>That seems almost unbelievable, but when I stopped using it for awhile and then resumed I could tell the difference right away in how my skin looked.  </li>
            <li>I have recommended this product to other family members and would highly recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>my most in depth review, when i first saw this product I  checked out the reviews and the bad ones</li>
            <li>When I bought this product, I was trying to find something to clear up the dry rash that has been on my face for months.</li>
            <li>It does have a prominent herbal, vaguely medicinal smell which I enjoy, but after rinsing the soap off, the lingering scent on my skin is subtle.</li>
            <li>but if you have dry skin I still prefer natural glycerin soap</li>
            <li>The soap doesNOT dry out your skin and leaves it soft and moist.</li>
            <li>My skin is relatively dry and flakey and the soap exfoliates my skin and makes it soft and glowy.</li>
            <li>I like the way this soap smells, and it softens my sensitive, dry  skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m around Gabrielle Union&#x27;s shade and decided to purchase this because I found out the Ambi black soap I was using wasn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li>My whole family uses Dudu-Osaun Black Soap.</li>
            <li>Even the ones that claim to be for sensitive skin with no fragrance don&#x27;t cleanse and still leave me dry and itchy for days.  </li>
            <li>Would not use this as makeup remover because of the delicate skin around my eyes.(usually the first to become sensitive if used too long)&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would not use this as makeup remover because of the delicate skin around my eyes.(usually the first to become sensitive if used too long)&lt;br</li>
            <li>every where, it&#x27;s not scary like some of the posting here, at least not for me, no burning, no skin cuts when applying it direct to the body.  </li>
            <li>MY FACE HAD A SLIGHT, VERY SLIGHT TINGLE TO IT, NOTHING TOO STRONG OR BOTHERSOME- , IT SUBSIDED WITHIN 30 secs.</li>
            <li>I found the soap is effective when showering under hard water, but is VERY MESSY.</li>
            <li>Every couple days I will use an all natural sea sponge to exfoliate, and after every single wash I put on organic coconut oil.</li>
            <li>I started using this because my skin is super sensitive and had become rough, dry, and uneven in appearance.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I am a European American with long thick, but fine, hair.</li>
            <li>My usual face cleansing routine included washing with Aveeno Clear Complexion soap or Basis Sensitive Skin Bar soap followed by Retin-A micro...which kept my skin somewhat clear but still oily.</li>
            <li>makes a mess in the tub and really didnt help with acne</li>
            <li>This soap is nowhere near the product that it is supposed to be, it is very misleading when trying to buy real black soap that actually helps the appearance of your skin.</li>
            <li>the dark marks on my cheeks from picking at old blemishes have lightened considerably in this short period of time.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t care about smell as much as how your skin looks go with standard black soap.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t notice anything different, except it really messes up bathtub or sink with black marks.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve never experienced such a strong burning sensation from a soap before.</li>
            <li>In fact, after the first few days of using this soap, I developed a harsh reaction that caused my skin to &#x27;bleed&#x27; clear liquid out.</li>
            <li>Because of my skin&#x27;s dryness from the extreme temperatures this winter, my skin would burn a little for a week or so when I used the  soap, but after patting my skin dry and applying coconut oil, I felt fine and now that it&#x27;s healed there isn&#x27;t any burning.</li>
            <li>I use a little extra virgin olive oil on my face after I wash it...and pure Shea butter on my skin...</li>
            <li>It could be a bit harsh for certain skin types.  </li>
            <li>The  only thing I do not like is the way the residue from the black soap shows up on our white porcelain bathroom sinks, but it is nonetheless well worth buying.</li>
            <li>It lathers up fast and with little effort.</li>
            <li>My whole face broke out in a rash and you could feel little bumps all over my cheeks, temples, and jawline.  </li>
            <li>I had a very hard time using facial products with any success, even the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; ones would irritate me.</li>
            <li>Initially, you fill feel very dry as the soap washes away the chemicals from your old soap, but the feeling disappears within a month, if not within two weeks.</li>
            <li>I really like this soap, but I rated it only 4 stars because it makes my face burn a little when I use it.</li>
            <li>Also, the smell of this soap was a little unusual and bothered me after using the 2nd bar.</li>
            <li>It can be a little drying, but overall I really like it.</li>
            <li>My skin looked raw, bright pink and shiny but after a few hours, the redness went down and my skin felt cleaner and smoother than it ever did in my life, and after that I never had the sensitivity when using the soap.</li>
            <li>/&gt;the soap isnt bad or good.</li>
            <li>Great for those of us who have reactions to the nasty chemicals put into modern hygiene products.</li>

            <li> However, Dudu Osun is a VERY good soap.</li>

            <li> Best Soap ever smells hella good only soap I use...  </li>
            <li> I felt I needed to write a quick review because this is great soap...</li>
            <li> The fragrance used on this soap is very strong, it smells a bit like pine tree/ Christmas tree sap</li>
            <li> It is very strongly scented.</li>
            <li> The smell is very strong and fruity</li>
            <li> This soap will melt away very easily so you have to keep it out of the shower stream or water when you aren&#x27;t using it.  </li>
            <li> I also scar very easy.  </li>
            <li> I also love the earthy scent and love to just sniff the boxes when they arrive in the mail!</li>
            <li> so i say its all good and fine.</li>
            <li> It lathers up very nice and the scent is mild and pleasing.</li>
            <li> (it isn&#x27;t pleasant) as it is potent; each time I walked into my bathroom, I could smell it sooooo strongly, and it never went away.</li>

            <li> Incidentally, I&#x27;ve discovered it also keep natural bristle brushes in wonderfully supple condition - probably not</li>
            <li> especially great knowing that the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> The lather is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever seen with any soap.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is by far one of the best soaps that I have ever used!  </li>
            <li> This is a non drying soap and has a pleasant clean smell.  </li>
            <li> The best soap ever for my face,my face looks clear although i have blemish.</li>
            <li> It is also more inexpensive to buy in bulk, so we are loving this offer of a 6-pack.</li>
            <li> And it smells nice and is cheap!</li>
            <li> Leave my skin soft and smell so good!!!</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin so soft and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of soap and this has been, by far, the best!</li>
            <li> To be honest I feel MUCH better using this soap.  </li>
            <li> (I LOVE LOVE LOVE to use those exfoliating gloves in the shower, and lather &#x27;em up good with my Dudu Osun, and scrub my legs...</li>
            <li> This soap is also very drying, so make sure you have an excellent moisturizer :)</li>
            <li> It smells great and is price right.  </li>
            <li> I received it very quickly as well!</li>
            <li> Was the second time just bought, very good quality, very suitable for oily skin and acne skin.</li>
            <li> It also has a pleasant smell, not too sweet.</li>
            <li> Took off 1 star because it burned the hoo ha, so it&#x27;s too strong for me bathing with it!</li>
            <li> This soap has a very nice fresh smell.  </li>
            <li> Like I said it does clean and does lather well and smells good</li>

            <li> I love what it is doing for my skin</li>
            <li> However, after reading all the reviews, i decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the name Dudu-osun (but specifically the Dudu part) was a hilarious way to tease my kids.</li>
            <li> it is luxuriously silky and foamy and smells lovely too.</li>
            <li> more radiant-</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my own fault for straying from nasabb, but the amazon reviews make it sound like</li>
            <li> : I&#x27;m sure there are some, but I was so put off by the dye that I don&#x27;t use the soap.    </li>
            <li> I will gladly send them to you, no charge.</li>
            <li> Not worst than Ivory soap</li>
            <li> but my skin does have a much more even complexion.</li>
            <li> This soap is the reason my face has had excellent skin for the last 15 years.</li>
            <li> I used to like that one more, but now I have gotten used to the newer tropical version.</li>
            <li> time to order more. :)</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m glad it work for me to stop itchy ..</li>

            <li> I have been getting so many comments on how I look since I started using this product.</li>
            <li> therefor more acne.</li>

            <li> /&gt;Thank you to Amazon and to the seller of this product for making it easy to order and</li>
            <li> I personally think it&#x27;s a wonderful fresh woodsy smell.</li>
            <li> If you love a clean shower tub - be forewarned - this will leave a brownish residue on the tub....</li>

            <li> : the smell could get too strong on my skin but soon faded 15 mins after shower.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend using a moisturizer in order to combat dryness.</li>
            <li> I strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> but it doesnt stay strong on the skin.</li>

            <li> I did some research and found out that the so called best black soap came from Nigeria</li>

            <li> This keeps my pimple free while toning my skin</li>
            <li> We&#x27;re the kind of folk that shop at Trader Joe&#x27;s and Whole Foods</li>
            <li> and I experienced no itching or burning, even on my private parts.  </li>
            <li> initially, I thought this was great for the face, but I think my face adapted, so now I switch between this and shae butter.</li>
            <li> Also, i noticed it was great for overall body soap, espcially if you mix it with sugar and make a scrub out of that.</li>
            <li> Watch out it may leave soap stains on the Tiles , theses are washable but they will be visible on light surfaces</li>
            <li> It is fit for my face as well.</li>

            <li> One of the ingredients is labeled fragrance which basically means cheap chemical smell.</li>
            <li> sometimes I wonder if they are truly genuine.    </li>
            <li> left my skin feeling and looking great....</li>
            <li> second order was because it&#x27;s great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Dudu</li>
            <li> tried proactiv, acne free, wexler, cetaphil, tea tree oil, Neutrogena,</li>
            <li> This time I experienced immense itching.</li>
            <li> The lather is a light brown, but does not stain light colored washcloths.</li>
            <li> It is great for my problematic skin (my Momma LIED when she told me, as a teen, that my acne would go away before I got wrinkles!)</li>
            <li> It has a nice gentle scent, and lathers generously.  </li>
            <li> I enjoy the aroma it leaves in my bathroom as well.</li>
            <li> I purchased a six-pack of the Dodu-Osun soap and after two weeks of daily (morning and night) use, I can attest to all of the great reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perplexed at the reviews mentioning race.</li>
            <li> The soap smells amazing and has a very earthy scent.</li>

            <li> Great for back acne, but you must give it time to work.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Dud-Osun for a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> I started using this product primarily on my face for acne and the scars they leave.</li>
            <li> Great value, will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> However, I would prefer a FRAGRANCE FREE VERSION.  </li>
            <li> I wash my face and body with this product because it&#x27;s both gentle and effective.</li>
            <li> fantastic.</li>
            <li> My entire family uses this soap with great results.</li>
            <li> I think it&#x27;s a great value too because my entire family uses one soap for washing and shampoo.</li>

            <li> but it does make me my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> Great soap, in the desert environment,  my face as taken a beating along with daily shaving.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall..... great product the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it does leave brown residue all over the shower</li>
            <li> I know that because when alcohol free witch hazel is applied as a toner, there is no residue that is visible from doing this.</li>

            <li> or it&#x27;s made with good quality natural fragrances--</li>
            <li> I read reviews on how it is good for sensitive skin and thought I&#x27;d give it a try.</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soooo clear and it smells so good.  </li>
            <li> So far so good</li>
            <li> I really like the original better wish I could find it !&lt;</li>
            <li> I need soap that&#x27;s good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is a good soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Would not be good for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Good price, natural product.</li>
            <li> My underarms would actually smell really good, just like the soap :)</li>
            <li> Acid also has an anti-bacterial action as well as being good for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Acid also has an anti-bacterial action as well as being good for exfoliation.</li>
            <li> Amazon offers a good savings as some stores are selling at up to $5 a bar.</li>
            <li> I immediately loved the natural smell when I opened the box.</li>
            <li> I will have to order more soon because I love these soo much.</li>
            <li> from hot bath or showers, trying using cool or luke warm water</li>
            <li> Best thing is you can get a good lather, I mean really soap up your wash cloth even when the bar is almost gone.</li>
            <li> With it&#x27;s rich aroma, silky smooth creamy lather, and pumice like scrub, this is the best of all worlds for just a few bucks.</li>
            <li> If this product doesnt work right away for you, please give it some time and you will love the results.</li>
            <li> Just make sure to lotion up right after the shower.</li>
            <li> Oh thank you very much the price was good and great quality the delivery was fast took last than one week.</li>
            <li> Lathers wonderfully, great fresh scent, leaves skin squeaky clean yet still soft.</li>
            <li> I recommend this all-natural soap to clean your face and body over any benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid-containing product that probably does more harm than good with all the extra junk they put in it.</li>
            <li> This is my first product review i have ever done, this product is just soooo ahhh-mazing!!</li>
            <li> I have never seen a product work so fast!!!</li>
            <li> but I noticed a difference after the first time I used it!!</li>
            <li> and now I very rarely have any acne.  </li>
            <li> Feel very fresh using it.  </li>

            <li> It was great on my face, and left it feeling squeaky clean with no residue.</li>
            <li> After using it my body and face feels amazingly clean and baby soft, I do follow up with coconut oil as my moisturizer for my face and body because this soap can be drying if you don&#x27;t use a good moisturizer</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d also like to add that the soap has a unique scent that I really enjoy.</li>
            <li> and I learned one very important lesson after my first order....</li>

            <li> I have no idea how this item received so many positive reviews.  </li>
            <li> First of all Black Soap is EXCELLENT for your skin!!!  </li>
            <li> I also give her husband left a use, he also liked that very clean wash</li>
            <li> I did some extensive research before I bought ABS(african black soap) and learned a great deal of this great soap that is doing WONDERS for my skin.  </li>
            <li> This is the purest and most effective black soap I have been able to find.  </li>
            <li> Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything special to my excema</li>
            <li> I also bought a large chunk of this type soap that is unscented and I use it and love it.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say that it does anything special...</li>
            <li> I saw results right away!</li>
            <li> you wanna use, Dudu is convenient and you can use right out the box!</li>
            <li> It does not leave any residue... actually leaves you feeling incredibly clean and rubbery (in a good way).</li>
            <li> Many scented bubbles that clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Price is reasonable, I like to come.&lt;br /&gt;Available</li>
            <li> I have somewhat fair skin that gets irritated easily and if used too often this soap can cause dry spots</li>
            <li> Such a great product, and at $2/bar, very reasonable compared to some over-priced luxury soaps on the market.</li>
            <li> It keeps my skin radiant and soft, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> It smells amazing and helped clear up some &amp;#34;sunspots&amp;#34; I had close to my nose.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m trying to use all organic and natural products and also eat organic and for this price its amazing.</li>
            <li> The soap smells great, develops into a rich lather, is extremely long-lasting, and has worked wonders on my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap smells amazing, makes you feel clean, and helped illuminate most of my dry skin.</li>
            <li> but it leaves my skin smelling amazing and soft.</li>
            <li> I had been using a different kind of soap similar to this because a lot of people were saying it&#x27;s great for your skin.</li>
            <li> Too many of my African sisters come to the States with beautiful, smooth skin then start using Western products because they believe these products are somehow \\&quot;better\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> For all you over 40 moms (like me) out there, use this and coconut oil for a moisturizer and be ready for the compliments on your youthful appearance to start flooding in.  :)</li>
            <li> , WETHER I NOTICE ANY BIG DIFFERENCES, GOOD OR</li>
            <li> I wash my hair, body, face and even the most intimate areas-</li>
            <li> This soap is good to use every day for the body only not the face.</li>
            <li> Okay Guys, Read much of the reviews before attempting to put in my two cents.</li>
            <li> It smell well and give full measure.</li>
            <li> The soap itself is solid and good for the skin.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it instantly.  </li>
            <li> She wants to walk into all of the Top Dermatologist</li>
            <li> but everyone is swearing on this like its actually something that good.</li>
            <li> This product is the ONLY thing that has helped me retain a good complexion.</li>
            <li> Really good for skin problems will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> , that&#x27;s the only good thing about</li>
            <li> mixed with my cologne, it did a good job with scent as well.</li>
            <li> good purhase overall</li>
            <li> I wash with this soap and put on a  Versace Dreamer or Polo Big pony number 1 cologne and get stopped by women all the time telling me how good i smell</li>
            <li> I really really like them and will probably order more soon.</li>
            <li> finally a good friend of mine from Nigeria went to visit &amp; brought me back about 2 bars and told me to try it.</li>
            <li> , he&#x27;s a machinest and one side of his arm gets full of oil and grease</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also nice to know that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> - I have not had a breakout since and it has been a full</li>
            <li> My skin is soft and has a nice even tone.</li>
            <li> My skin feels super clean after use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m really impressed since more commercial cleansers never really stopped my bumps from appearing.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it for a while because someone gave me something else that they loved, but now that I am back to this soap</li>
            <li> Not any face soaps or make up remover can clean so well in one quick wash.  </li>
            <li> Will be ordering more of it real soon.</li>
            <li> I love the smell, but it is very earthy which some people may not like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not going to say it has completely cleared my acne because i want to be honest</li>
            <li> I honestly think It does help clear up imperfections on one&#x27;s skin as well as evening its tone.  </li>
            <li> This is not a bad soap</li>
            <li> ] is my last choice since it&#x27;s VERY mild and doesn&#x27;t have a very powerful fragrance but is great for people who are sensitive</li>
            <li> ] is my last choice since it&#x27;s VERY mild and doesn&#x27;t have a very powerful fragrance but is great for people who are sensitive</li>
            <li> make sure you get your whole face because the parts you don&#x27;t rub will absorb the soap quick.</li>
            <li> This soap has a really great smell, as well as leaving me feel super clean due to the granuales exfoliating my skin as i shower.</li>
            <li> Although the smell at first is kinda  strong it goes away.</li>
            <li> I will warn you that if you keep it in the shower, it can dissolve pretty easily.</li>
            <li> I asked her what she used because her skin was so beautiful, she told me black soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s strong when you first use it -</li>
            <li> SOOO EASY TO MAKE &amp; COST PENNY&#x27;S A BOTTLE!! ) , &amp; STARTED ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE SOAP USE, SO IM</li>
            <li> I believe that it can even tone and fight acne very well as long as you make sure you are using a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Other than that it has a great scent that lasts all day and my skin seems softer.</li>
            <li> It lathers nicely, smells great, and between the 2 of us showering each once per day, a bar can last up to a week (as long as we keep it from sitting in a puddle of water...</li>
            <li> I was so excited to try the \\&quot;real thing\\&quot;, but the soap is too strong for me and began to sting and burn.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know why people are saying that they felt so fresh and clean, because I did not.</li>
            <li> Has a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> i love this soap made my skin clear up and super smooth</li>
            <li> After having used Clinique for 3 years and consistent break outs of fine bumps on my cheeks</li>
            <li> I have acne and mild dermititis</li>
            <li> I will most definitely purchase more of this soap and will use it as a bath soap as well.</li>
            <li> ISO far so good,  I really like this product</li>
            <li> &quot; My husband said he felt mild tingling.</li>
            <li> If your a man with a gf, wife, or daughter (ect), snatch some up and give them in a gift basket with some lotions &amp; act super savvy.</li>
            <li> If your a man with a gf, wife, or daughter (ect), snatch some up and give them in a gift basket with some lotions &amp; act super savvy.</li>
            <li> IF THE QUICK DIFFERENCE</li>
            <li> EVEN AS IS, WITHOUT ANY SUPER BENEFITS!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> EVEN AS IS, WITHOUT ANY SUPER BENEFITS!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I use it on face and body, and now my skin is more smooth and even and clear than it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Soap dissolves rather quickly</li>
            <li> My skin is super picky with soap and shaving products.  </li>
            <li> My skin is oily, and is super prone to breakouts.  </li>
            <li> Lucky to even give ONE star.</li>
            <li> but it seems to be getting better and these seem to be more related to hormonal issues than oiliness.</li>
            <li> For example: I got super glue ALL over my fingertips during a project.</li>
            <li> Ask your derma about accutane or an oral antibiotic, its helped me and my brother tremendously</li>
            <li> A quick rinse and</li>
            <li> Smells great, all natural, eliminates eczema and keeps skin soft and supple.</li>
            <li> I experienced this at first when I made the mistake of leaving it on my face too long.</li>
            <li> Just wash it off quickly if you&#x27;re going to wash your face with it</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t stains my showers or sponge, it does drip brown but rinse off quickly.  </li>
            <li> well but doesn&#x27;t dissolve too quickly.</li>
            <li> My older kids use it on their face as well and they love it.</li>
            <li> Came quick.</li>
            <li> Arrived quickly and without issues.</li>
            <li> It lathers great and it feels like it&#x27;s really giving my hair a deep cleanse without drying it out.</li>
            <li> break outs quickly</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and makes you feel soooooooo clean and refreshed!</li>
            <li> ALL SKIN TYPES, PUT ALL COMPLAINTS TO THE TEST, ENJOY YOUR COMPLIMENTS.ou love, have an extra soap under the cabinet for when you run out, and ENJOY.</li>
            <li> The very first entry in my baby book was \\&quot;she has a rash - to the doctor\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I am no way affiliated with the makers of this product, just a review junkie dependent upon other people&#x27;s experience as well as my own :)</li>
            <li> really helps reduce my oily skin and leaves me smelling smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li> The dark spots took about 6 weeks to notice a difference, but looks great.</li>
            <li> It is great for fading dark spots.</li>
            <li> love this on my skin - it is rich and soft.</li>
            <li> package arrived very fast and the soap smells VERY fresh, even the boxes look brighter than I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not unpleasant at all.</li>
            <li> I notice my fine lines, acne scars &amp; sun spots become a lot more apparent.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s natural (no foreign words lol).</li>
            <li> I am not sure it&#x27;s the best black soap quality wise</li>
            <li> Love this soap, whole family uses this and every family member likes this soap very much.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s quite pleasant actually, but its just too strong and powerful for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a cure for eczema (still needs his prescription creams), but it does help his skin stay healthy, and the eczema has not popped up in any new places.</li>
            <li> but I am glad I don&#x27;t get new ones.</li>
            <li> This is our family&#x27;s new favorite soap.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap, can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li> Dudu Osun to clean and pure shea butter as a moisturizer!</li>
            <li> the soap smells great, but it runs all over your shower&#x27;s floor, like black mud.</li>
            <li> and it gets my whole family nice and clean without stripping away our natural oils.  </li>
            <li> Many of my battle wounds on my arms from people swiping at the basketball as I drive to the lane have pretty much disapeared.  </li>
            <li> It lathers really well too &amp; the brownish color washes away really easily in the tub.</li>
            <li> despite the dark brown appearance, it smells good and washes smooth.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, doesn&#x27;t last long per bar, and I&#x27;ve used more costly brands that seem to help better with acne</li>
            <li> I find this is a good quality soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out  my skin.</li>
            <li> (if you have acne it will dry your acne, which my friends loved).</li>
            <li> The smells is really mild and fresh.  </li>
            <li> I love the smell of the soap in the shower, though it is strong up front, it does not leave a heavy scent at all, it was very light and almost nonexistant.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 weeks and the difference is huge!!</li>
            <li> But other than that it washes off shower and leaves my skin feeling so nice!</li>
            <li> Really??!!</li>
            <li> I first discovered it after visiting a friend in Florida and the bars cost $4 each!</li>
            <li> After my first use, I was amazed!</li>
            <li> and it helps fight it off pretty well!</li>
            <li> The most important thing is that since using for about 2 months, not a single break out.  </li>
            <li> Black soap is effective at so many things.  </li>
            <li> the name is hard to pronounce, but very good soap.</li>
            <li> The soap came and the first thing I noticed was how clean it smelled.  </li>
            <li> I will most likely try this for about a month and see how it goes, but I&#x27;m loving the results so far!</li>
            <li> I also really like that it is available with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> The soap really does leave your skin smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast and free.</li>
            <li> This soap is an awsome exfoliant that is great for getting rid of dead skin and cleansing pores.</li>
            <li> and she called me a week later to say it is &#x27;amazing&#x27;.  </li>
            <li> I have been looking around for a great soap for quite a few years now.</li>
            <li> So far, I am pleased with the result.</li>
            <li> and I hope that it will be more soothing for my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> I gave a bar to my friend and her mom, who are hatian, with sensitive, oily skin; and they love it as well.</li>
            <li> I love this soap because its all natural.</li>
            <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to stay, but skin does smell \\&quot;fresh &amp; clean\\&quot; after.</li>
            <li> the soap, cover your body in a lotion you love, have an extra soap under the cabinet for when you run out, and ENJOY.</li>
            <li> I love the soap and makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> so it was worth a try.  </li>
            <li> I AM ALREADY NOTICING ARE WORTH IT</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s intended use, but far better than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li> There dont seem to be many checks and balances as far as anything goes in that country.</li>
            <li> Even better- after a couple of uses my skin is feeling touchably soft and silky.</li>
            <li> I am hoping my skin will clear up to reveal lovely results</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve noticed it cleans so deep that I use less moisturizer, wrinkle cream and sunblock because your skin is able to absorb more effectively when deeply clean.  </li>
            <li> Definitely worth the price of $5 or so.</li>
            <li> This soap is great for me especially with my adult acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of days now and can already see an astounding difference in my skin.</li>
            <li> BUT WHEN I USE THIS SOAP EVERDAY AND APPLY SHEA BUTTER, I HAVE CLEAR AND HEALTHY SKIN.  </li>
            <li> Fresh soap.</li>
            <li> I love the scent, the exfoliation and the all natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> so it does double duty as a really nice body deodorant.</li>
            <li> and I have thicker skin and most products are not too sensitive for my skin.</li>
            <li> I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> This soap combined with the OCM, Moroccan rose water and spirolactone have finally cleared my cystic acne.</li>
            <li> I also love the fact that it is all natural</li>
            <li> though you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s a much better value if you purchase the larger cakes and break it apart; however, if you want something that &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; good in the soap dish, then probably worth paying the extra.</li>
            <li> rarely need body lotion on my body or face, but I do use 50-50 water and vegatable glycerine after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My dermatologist even told me my skin was one of the most sensitive types she&#x27;s ever seen,</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve also heared of people using it to wash their hair and I plan on giving that a try as well since I&#x27;m going natural :)</li>
            <li> As far as my complexion and break outs go, I think I need to give it more than 2 uses before I can judge on that.</li>
            <li> It has a fresh, tropical scent, doesn&#x27;t overdry the skin &amp; leaves</li>
            <li> This soap leaves no residue whatsoever and makes your skin feel fresh.</li>
            <li> Here is my own analysis, based on chemistry and personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the fact that it is all natural, &amp;</li>
            <li> it was worth a shot</li>
            <li> I also love how my skin is not overly stripped of oils and feels quite natural after I use some avocado oil as moisturizer.</li>
            <li> And worth their weight in gold, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> I have more mature skin</li>
            <li> worth it imo.</li>
            <li> I also used it on my face which had a fresh look to it after washing.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s so worth trying</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be completely gone.</li>
            <li> Many of us with sensitive skin have no use for added fragrances in soaps.  </li>
            <li> It has lovely natural ingredients, cleanses my skin without stripping all of its moisture and smells of limes and citrus fruits.</li>
            <li> so far I love this soap</li>
            <li> It came in earlier than I expected, which is great!</li>
            <li> I love natural and affordable and this product hits both out of the ballpark.</li>
            <li> Fragrance too powerful pungent.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> Love the natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I found a million reasons to use a different kind of soap in its stead.</li>
            <li> But the quality of the product and the way it makes my skin feels is totally worth</li>
            <li> Great soap, all natural, enough said.</li>
            <li> Love this product as it is helping to keep my skin clear.</li>
            <li> awesome soap for cleaning the whole body, not too much the face all the time but lightly a few times a week</li>
            <li> has become my simple, effective and natural skin care regimen :)</li>
            <li> price is good, i can live with it but hoping it could go down more</li>
            <li> Also you need to get some kind of soap holder (super cheap at Wal-Mart), because if you don&#x27;t it runs brown drips down your walls.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say for my hair overall the lather is great with no worries of sulfates or other chemicals found in most shampoos.</li>
            <li> If I could have this particular item on auto order and the 6pk, my family love this soap and now this is the only soap that we used for shampoo, facial and body its does a GREAT with multi purpose use.</li>
            <li> Great smelling natural soap, what could be better, it leaves your skin feeling a little sticky at first</li>
            <li> Other than that I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> and i love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;i originally got for my teenage sons eczema</li>
            <li> LOVE the rich lather it makes, along with my &amp;#34;Cure Series Japanese Exfoliating Bath Towel.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li> It leaves me feeling clean and pure after every shower, and my skin shows the difference.</li>
            <li> I love it because its natural, it last longer than body wash (which is true of most soap bars) and because its non-drying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s still a great product and can help you with acne, psoriasis, dry skin, oily skin, razor bumps, and is also antibacterial WITHOUT the use of chemicals (it creates an environment that bacteria can&#x27;t live in, basically).  </li>
            <li> Smells very nice (like flowers) and is certainly a cheaper option in comparison to other soaps (i.e., Dr. Bronners)</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling i get after using this soap, my only issue is the brown staining of my wash cloths</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin clean, fresh, works very well on eczema and rashes.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this soap; and, I actually like how clean it makes me feel.  </li>
            <li> The soap is very clean smelling, all natural</li>
            <li> Good for Dandruff(guy uses it every other day).</li>
            <li> Even after the first use I was highly pleased by the way it left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed.</li>
            <li> This soap looks so strange, but you will be so glad if you try it!  </li>
            <li> Dudu is the best on the market as far as pure black soaps go.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s even much better than any special facial cleansers I used before.</li>
            <li> Dries the zits right up without drying my face out.</li>
            <li> It has cleared my face right up.</li>
            <li> (but hey you should be doing that anyway right?)  </li>
            <li> Nothing gets this stuff off, right?</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, I have to pose a question:  </li>
            <li> so I had to use oils right after to lock in the moisture.</li>
            <li> Well, you drew the right conclusion...</li>
            <li> I used it right away</li>
            <li> and I attribute this to using the right soap.</li>
            <li> He still keep using it right now, and see what will happen.</li>
            <li> and I think that I have achieved the right concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun creates a highly alkaline environment which has a more highly disinfectant action than most soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This six count is amazing because the bars are pretty big</li>
            <li> It lathers very well and rinses of clean, no soap residue.</li>
            <li> Well, it does make my face feel clean, but I really don&#x27;t see any change in my eczema or acne.</li>
            <li> My daughter who has had eczema her whole life also uses this product with wonderful results - we are Northern European by heritage with extremely dry itchy skin</li>
            <li> This toilet soap lathers so nicely.</li>
            <li> It can clean my face very well and owning to this, my acne start to disappear.</li>
            <li> this one leaves me feeling clean and the price was reasonable.</li>
            <li> The smell is clean fragrance and lathers really well.</li>
            <li> I am pretty sure that if i keep using it my acne will be completely gone.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I noticed the pungent smell first (which is not bad)</li>
            <li> and I also notice that this soap whitens lol, must be from the lemon; nothing a little bronzer can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very easy to wash away, but if you&#x27;re the type of person who freaks out when their bathroom isn&#x27;t 100% white this may put you off.</li>
            <li> will be ordering the 12 bars very soon lol down to 1 bar.&lt;br /&gt;wish</li>
            <li> No other soap that I&#x27;ve used has had this effect (and mostly, I don&#x27;t use organic or all-natural</li>
            <li> After many wasted soaps, facial washes and scrubs, I found this to be the best match with my acne-proned, oily/dry combination, sun sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I love how it left my skin squeaky clean the first use.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin feeling so clear &amp; clean!</li>
            <li> This soap lathers incredibly, so if you keep it away from water when you are not using it, it will last for a very very long time.</li>
            <li> Great lather with very little effort</li>
            <li> Because this soap seems to be concentrated  using  less works best for me especially when using it for my face.</li>
            <li> I had tried many soaps that are designed to put moisture into you skin like dove, which leaves a oily feeling, and the black soap works much better.</li>
            <li> Great for acne or just feeling clear and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
            <li> my acne scars have lighten up; which i am very happy about because i have been using these expensive brands and nothing has work or showed my quick results.</li>
            <li> Although drying, I like that it takes the deodorant off much more quickly than regular soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends who laugh at the name, but find it intriguing enough to try after hearing what I say about it.</li>
            <li> As soon as I can better figure my family&#x27;s usage rates, and the shelf life (natural products have shorter lives - as they should), I&#x27;ll be back to buy more.    </li>
            <li> it smells great; it cleans better than any other body soaps without too much drying or leaving a film; and it has cut down/control my facial acne.  </li>
            <li> and I noticed I didn&#x27;t get acne as much after using the full bar.</li>
            <li> I sometimes have a bit of eczema during certain seasons and this will knock it out quickly.</li>
            <li> This is good stuff, recommend this hands down...........</li>
            <li> I also use it on my face once a week mixed with a little coconut oil and my skin looks wonderful.</li>
            <li> I am very impressed with this soap because after only using this soap for a little over a month and almost all my acne cleared up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great bargain deal for such a small price for a mainly natural soap which also has a good fragrance.  </li>
            <li> I so badly wanted to love this soap because I heard wonderful things about it.  </li>
            <li> I love this soap, you really get a soft feeling on your skin, and it also gives you a clearer complextion.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s really good for Black people&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping which is super.</li>
            <li> close to #1 having soft texture, great fragrance, triple milled made in the french way, mainly moisturizing olive oil</li>
            <li> close to #1 having soft texture, great fragrance, triple milled made in the french way, mainly moisturizing olive oil</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin and while researching, I read that black soap is really good for my skin type.</li>
            <li> I would strongly recommend that people with sensitive skin avoid this soap.</li>
            <li> Only been using soap a week now, after more time; maybe results will be better &amp; far more lasting.</li>
            <li> I started a routine of washing with Dudu-Osun black soap and washing with Bioelements Foam Cleanser (Good product also).</li>
            <li> It has a fresh smell and it actually makes my skin look fabulous!</li>
            <li> but the con are; it dries your face so get a good facial moisturizer, and keep on dry surfaces because it melts easily.</li>
            <li> It cleans very well, though so far no noticeable difference on the acne, but I hope with more patience it will work.</li>
            <li> It really has helped me clear up my face :)</li>
            <li> The scent is a bit strong, but not overpowering, and I have not had any adverse reactions even with my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> and I am very happy that it has only a few ingredients in it.</li>
            <li> soap is super gentle and moisturizing.  </li>
            <li> In a way the smell reminds me of the classic Dial Gold; it doesn&#x27;t smell like it, per say, it just has that clean smell that works for men or women.</li>
            <li> The scent of this soap is amazing and makes my skin so clear and soft.</li>
            <li> We found this soap a few months ago from a vendor in a shopping center, and we loved it so much we had to find where we could order several bars at once and were very happy to have found them here.  </li>
            <li> The smell is really sweet and good, I use it every day and it seems work well for people who usually get allergic</li>
            <li> My skin is so clear and so moisturized and best of all, NO MORE ITCHING!</li>
            <li> This may be the processed commercialized version of African black soap but it is still pretty darn good and more reasonable to acquire than the softer raw stuff that you often have to cut off your own bars from a 1 LB brick and pay more for or deal with shipping charges.</li>
            <li> (not the kind you would want to luxuriously rub or love yourself down for 20 mins under the shower without walking around with sensitive skin.....</li>
            <li> (it has that generic, strong cheap soap smell, the kind you&#x27;d find at the dollar store - no hint of honey or shea butter or any of the other ingredients listed), but more importantly, I find that it is harsher than other soaps I&#x27;ve used -</li>
            <li> and I like it very much.</li>
            <li> I like this soap very much.  </li>
            <li> This most recent pack I ordered was in a sealed back and the individual boxes were in great shape.  </li>
            <li> This black soap is very good for the skin, does not dry it out and reportedly has some healing benefits.</li>
            <li> I brought it because; I was looking for something that would help clear up my oily skin and fine acne.</li>
            <li> I loved this soap, I really really love African black soap.</li>
            <li> Buying in bulk will help save a little money, i just hope it is as good of quality.</li>
            <li> Something original and new.    </li>
            <li> The smell is like a fresh, natural, clean smell.  </li>
            <li> This soap will help your skin exfoliate always making it look fresh, clean and soft.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s messy and did not seem to deliver any kind of special cleansing/moisturizng benefits for me.</li>
            <li> so much lather!</li>
            <li> When she came back with this soap, she said that so many people said this was better for skin ailments such as acne</li>
            <li> i first tried the soap in the beginning of the year and have been hooked ever since.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin smooth and soft, and tightens my pores.</li>
            <li> Du-Du soap is the first soap we have used with no irritation.</li>
            <li> Du-Du soap is the first soap we have used with no irritation.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it&#x27;s the only one I use on my face.</li>
            <li> Before buying a multi pack, buy one to test on your skin first.</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was the lotion I was using</li>
            <li> Talk about smooth and soft as a newborns bottom.</li>
            <li> Although I have only been using the two products for two days, my face has become softer, more moisturized and my blemishes are healing.</li>
            <li> I tried the soap first on my face</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I am a skeptic when it comes to cosmetic products.</li>
            <li> I tried it on my son first.</li>
            <li> First week I had it I looked forward to washing my face because I just felt like it was clearing me up.  </li>
            <li> This product arrived in a timely manner, but the boxes that the bars came in were pretty worn.  </li>
            <li> Works really well for acne, but use a luffa!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s cleared my skin pretty well.</li>
            <li> If the price remains the same I am sure this will be my bar soap.</li>
            <li> Another important note for the sensitive folks, DO NOT rub your skin with your towel- blot your skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s funny.</li>
            <li> I have read reviews that some users experience a tingly (or itchy) feeling at first</li>
            <li> 1 week &amp; ppl were commenting on my skin &amp; much finer lines!</li>
            <li> All ingredients you either have, or can be bought on here &amp; very inexpensive too!</li>
            <li> ;)&lt;br</li>

            <li> ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li> For 2 weeks to be exact.</li>
            <li> I use it daily and generates a lovely lather.  </li>
            <li> The first time, i bought the four pack...</li>
            <li> The first time I could tell it was like no soap I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  </li>
            <li> My face peeled and burned for the first 2 weeks.  </li>
            <li> After using it for a couple weeks, my love has only grown.  </li>
            <li> My problem is an abundance of riches with all the different types of luxurious organic and non-organic soaps I have which give me a better pampering bathing experience compared to this soap.  </li>
            <li> This soap is inexpensive and will last longer then most soap.</li>
            <li> but I love it all the same for its clarifying and skin smoothing properties.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s 5 star quality, but I deducted a star because if you have light color wash cloths, then it will leave a dark residue that is challenging to remove.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Be warned though, it may make your skin feel irritated the first time you use it, it did that to me.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it&#x27;s starting to do some wondrous work on my skin.</li>
            <li> This soap really irritated my skin!</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a month and my skin looks better.</li>
            <li> but they were the only truthful ones.</li>
            <li> suggestion to anyone who is considering buying this for the first time is to get one bar and see how you like it first.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this soap, I just love the scent.</li>
            <li> First time tryer</li>
            <li> love the smell and used it for the first time last night.</li>
            <li> I have learned to keep it at a higher height in shower, as not to be affected by water when not using.  </li>
            <li> Always aware it is in delivery box because the smell resonates through the box.</li>
            <li> For the first couple of weeks my skin purged.</li>
            <li> smooth, even toned and it was baby soft.</li>
            <li> It leaves your skin smooth and soft.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap and have usd it for years!!</li>
            <li> I looked up cream or soap for eczema and this soap was the first to come up.</li>
            <li> I also use it on my body, which saves having to buy many different products.</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well on face and blemishes.  </li>
            <li> I have given bars away to family and friends of different races who love using it too .</li>
            <li> , so it&#x27;s no big problem for me. :-)  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d suggest trying out just one soap first before you buy a whole six pack like me!</li>
            <li> My skin is really soft and smooth now, like silk.  </li>
            <li> My back acne was getting better at first week of using it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial soap ever.</li>
            <li> I have finally built my perfect skin care routine and it is going very well even during this harsh winter.</li>
            <li> After the first time I used the soap my skin felt softer and tighter.</li>
            <li> Hope that got their attention to make sure my order of 6 come on time, just like the last time.</li>
            <li> My face has cleared up SO MUCH!</li>
            <li> and you will be back for more.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I have been seeking.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s feels better on it then regular</li>
            <li> My children love this soap and claim it works on acne, so I purchase the soap regularly.</li>
            <li> Yes, my face tingled when I first began using this product, but it goes away.</li>
            <li> all kinds of generic brands and more.</li>
            <li> I tried many products but this one is the only one that I feel</li>
            <li> I first found this soap at a flower how in Boston, Ma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m planning on ordering more of these in the future!</li>
            <li> It burns when you first start using it..</li>
            <li> I really love this soap and blue soaps for my face and underarms.</li>
            <li> This work very well on my skin!</li>
            <li> The package arrived on time and was exactly as pictured.</li>
            <li> My first six bars are almost all gone.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s my first time purchasing</li>
            <li> So glad I only bought one bar.</li>
            <li> My patches looked so much lighter!</li>
            <li> I always wet my hands and lathered the soap in my hands, and then I massage it on my face for a bit before rinsing it off with warm water.</li>
            <li> Now, that is the first thing that I ask the vendor.     </li>
            <li> REALLY?!</li>
            <li> Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I rubbed it on and left it for a minute or two and the first time i did most of the blackhead came out.</li>
            <li> soap comes exactly as pictured in 6 separate boxes bound together by plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> It looks a bit funny, smells divine, cleans well and moisturizes your body so there is no need of additional moisturizes.</li>
            <li> but this really helps!</li>
            <li> I would recommend that first time users try it out on their hands before using it anywhere else on their body lest they have a reaction to any of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> really glad i got it and will likely use it from here on.</li>
            <li> hahahahaha!</li>
            <li> it has permanently replaced my facial cleanser, and i have tried soo many products out there.</li>
            <li> I would definitely recommend and will for sure continue to use.</li>
            <li> I found that pretty weird.&lt;br</li>
            <li> and he&#x27;s using it as shampoo and body wash, he said it really cleans!  </li>
            <li> I tried this soap for the first time not having tried any products like it</li>
            <li> I love this product and I use it daily.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Black soap is the only soap I can use on me and my kids that smells great and leaves our skin clean and nourished afterward.  </li>
            <li> Now I use it morning and night on most days and have noticed a definite improvement in my skin.</li>
            <li> Last long and great scent.</li>
            <li> I am fair skinned, blond hair, green eyes</li>
            <li> Helps reduce redness, reduces scars, gives skin a good cleanse without being too harsh.</li>
            <li> Lather it really good and soap up your face, leave on for a few minutes (while you wash your hair..)</li>
            <li> This is easily as good as any dead sea mud soap out there.</li>
            <li> The next day I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;scrub\\&quot;, just gently lathered and only had a very mild sensation of \\&quot;warm</li>
            <li> Love you using black soap and this is a really good at a fair price as it can be expensive to buy at a store.</li>
            <li> Although the soap has a slight smell of motor oil, it works great and my skin is so soft.  </li>
            <li> I even use it to clean my hair, but only if I have a lot of product build-up as it can make you hair feel too clean.</li>
            <li> main thing that is appreciated about this soap is that my skin is really clean after using this product.</li>
            <li> I love black soap, and this is a fantastic brand.</li>
            <li> : )these dogs are known for having very sensitive coats... even too sensitive for dog shampoos and baby shampoos.</li>
            <li> Bought a lot of times DUDU OSUN black soap, and family and friends are in use, the effect is very very satisfied</li>
            <li> I got pregnant and alot of the stuff I normally used was off limits.</li>
            <li> The smell is pleasent and not too strong, my pet peeve with this soap is that it dirties the tub easily because of the dark tint.</li>
            <li> Works amazingly for acne or other skin conditions.</li>
            <li> Facial cleansing oil, the effect is very good, a total of six loaded, sent a few friends, said effect is good, the next time you run out will then consider buying.</li>
            <li> My mom was about 45 at the time, and has always been very very low maintenance, and never really had any kind of skin care routine, but her skin looked beautiful, radiant, tight and she had a visible reduction in the lines around her eyes and between her eyebrows.</li>
            <li> this may sound weird, but it works great on my dog too.</li>
            <li> It felt less oily and so much more clean.  </li>
            <li> but we are all so used to the chemicals in our soaps that we don&#x27;t realize what natural clean is like.  </li>
            <li> It leaves skin clean without stripping all the natural oils and rinses off well.  </li>
            <li> leaves my skin squeaky clean and soft.</li>
            <li> and my hair is really clean soft and shiny after using it.</li>
            <li> it leaves your skin feeling soft and soooooo clean.</li>
            <li> My skin felt, moisturized, soft and clean.</li>
            <li> Its natural and my skin feels so clean afterwords.</li>
            <li> STARS, ONLY BECAUSE IM WAITING TO SEE IF I GET SOME OF THE GREATER BENEFITS FROM IT, BUT REALLY, I WAS CLOSE TO GIVING IT 5 STARS</li>
            <li> STARS, ONLY BECAUSE IM WAITING TO SEE IF I GET SOME OF THE GREATER BENEFITS FROM IT, BUT REALLY, I WAS CLOSE TO GIVING IT 5 STARS</li>
            <li> It started out with more breakouts but eventually it started to clear up and slowly clear my blemishes.</li>
            <li> It clears up skin problems, leaves your skin moisturized or at least, more able to benefit from your moisturizer.</li>
            <li> It works like the washing powder too, very slippery when touching water, as same as when you washing your clothes by hand without rubber gloves on, and I feel it burns on my skin and peel.</li>
            <li> My skin has always been my biggest insecurity and it feels so good to have finally found something that actually works!!</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis all over my face and spots of it pretty well on a large portion on my body..</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;Which is a bummer because I ordered a large package of it, and ended up throwing the rest away after using the first bar.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It won&#x27;t clear  up your skin or do anything else special.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why, but it takes my hair longer to dry afterward; however, the results are nothing short of amazing!</li>
            <li> After all the positive reviews I decided I had to try this out to see if it would help with my oily acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> And also beware of all the positive reviews...</li>
            <li> but amazon.com has a ton of positive reviews about it?</li>
            <li> I started noticing positive changes in my skin immediately.</li>
            <li> At first it was really tingly</li>
            <li> I can tell you that I will be buying more and making this my bar soap for a long time.</li>
            <li> I spent $4.99(1 bar), and can say honestly that every penny was worth wild.</li>
            <li> At first it seemed to be really drying</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sensitive to fragrance and it manages to choke me up a bit, so I would imagine it could bother others even more.</li>
            <li> The soap pretty much just brought out the acne I had under my skin to the surface.</li>
            <li> It can be too drying to use daily, but great if when a pimple is starting or in early stages.</li>
            <li> The scent isn&#x27;t one that I really like too much, but overall I am ok with my soap.</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I buffed my face with this soap and a gentle washcloth.</li>
            <li> Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> I have PCOS which means I pretty much always have skin issues.</li>
            <li> Cheap, lathers very well, gentle on sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful American woman of African decent 24 yrs old.</li>
            <li> It left my skin feeling so fresh &amp; clean.</li>
            <li> This soap really exfoliates your skin leaving it soft and clean</li>
            <li> Initially i thought the product was too drying as it began to tighten my skin particularly on the face, however i just layered the product more sparingly after a couple uses</li>
            <li> Seems to strike a good balance between being all natural, but not so much that you find pieces of bark in the soap, which I read can happen in some other brands.</li>
            <li> Lathers up really well with a nice thick rich lather.  </li>
            <li> Like a fresh new start.  </li>
            <li> Leaves skin with a nice glow, has a mild scent that&#x27;s not overwhelming, only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that the soap stains my light colored wash cloths</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin/hair dry like most soaps do.    </li>
            <li> Once I used the black soap I really liked it.</li>
            <li> It makes it super soft and easier for lotion/body butter to sink in.</li>
            <li> I have a history of dry skin and eczema for many years now.</li>
            <li> Easy to cut into smaller pieces for travel.</li>
            <li> It dissolves in water, which means you can create your own liquid black soap if you choose to do it.</li>
            <li> Just be sure you place it in a dry soap dish after using it because it will dissolve a lot faster.</li>
            <li> Most of the soaps will make skin dry ...</li>
            <li> I PERSONALLY LIKE STRONG SMELLS, LAUNDRY, AIR FRESHENER</li>
            <li> be prepared for ultra strong smell--to the extend that i need to double zip lock the rest of un-used unopened soap to avoid the smell getting everywhere; but the soap itself is buttery and i will buy again</li>
            <li> It has a really good scent and last long.</li>
            <li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the strong acidity in it, don&#x27;t let it get in your privates or it would burn.</li>
            <li> Strong initial scent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m single ladies :-)</li>
            <li> -Pure</li>
            <li> Its also is pure..</li>
            <li> 100% pure Shea butter(Ghana),</li>
            <li> A mask/misting of organic pure rosewater(sans alcohol) and 100% pure aloe(not</li>
            <li> A mask/misting of organic pure rosewater(sans alcohol) and 100% pure aloe(not</li>
            <li> I USED THIS SOAP &amp; PURE UNREFINED SHEA BUTTER.  </li>
            <li> It is a large soap so the loss is negligible.</li>
            <li> I am now using natural 100% Castill soap and prefer that a lot better as it does not dry my skin, but keeps it moisturized!</li>
            <li> Smells good, lasts pretty long as long as you don&#x27;t let it sit in a puddle after your shower.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super gentle on my son&#x27;s ultra sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> it made my skin super clean even though it made my skin dry afterwards but keep using it.</li>
            <li> I have super sensitive skin and this soap works very well with my skin.</li>
            <li> Came nicely and tightly packaged.</li>
            <li> My skin is very sensitive  and reacts immediately to most facial products.  </li>
            <li> The smell is less than ideal for me (26 year old male).  </li>
            <li> but overall it was fine.</li>
            <li> Smells pretty decent</li>
            <li> Very high quality soap.</li>
            <li> Be sure to moisturize after using it because it can leave your skin very dry.</li>
            <li> My personal experience has been great, no tight dry skin afterwards and I haven&#x27;t had any eczema breakouts in months.</li>
            <li> We apply our own favorite lotions right after we dry and our skin sucks up the lotion and it \\&quot;fluffs\\</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using the same bar for a month -- they&#x27;re HUGE.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s VERY sudsy.</li>
            <li> very clean.&lt;br</li>
            <li> But I&#x27;m still ordering it again because I like it so much.</li>
            <li> Thanks for prompt delivery.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s gentle on my skin, non fragrant</li>
            <li> I am a white female, and this soap makes my skin smooth and blemish free.</li>
            <li> Didnt see much of a difference</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t really work as a hand soap in our guest bathroom.  </li>
            <li> It was very drying to my face even with  immediately applying moisturizer(raw shea butter).  </li>
            <li> I really like the scent and quality of this soap.</li>
            <li> I tried this one today and it&#x27;s very fragrant.</li>
            <li> All through my school years I was scorned and ridiculed which made me defensive and very aggresive.</li>
            <li> It has made my skin so much softer than it used to be.</li>
            <li> and it really exfoliates my skin.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have to use as much lotion or moisturizers when I use it.</li>
            <li> If I am not going to fast</li>
            <li> I AM SOLD THANKS TO MY DAUGHTER.  </li>
            <li> really well             Helps even skintone a bit    </li>
            <li> I think we are using it up fast.</li>
            <li> It was much cheaper buying this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> , THE WHOLE BOX HAD A SMELL.</li>
            <li> BUT I REALLY LIKE THE SOAP</li>
            <li> REALLY LIKE THIS SOAP &amp; HOPE</li>
            <li> , I REALLY LIKE IT</li>
            <li> , HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING THIS!  </li>
            <li> , HIGHLY RECOMMEND TRYING THIS!  </li>
            <li> thanks.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never gotten this much attention before.</li>
            <li> I admit, that isnt really a problem for me, but my girlfriend has some skin issues from time to time, and she absolutely loves this soap as well.</li>
            <li> After a week or so, I noticed my skin was much softer.  </li>
            <li> and this really soothes the skin.</li>
            <li> and it is very affordable</li>
            <li> I will get straight to the point.  </li>
            <li> It does not take much water to lather up.</li>
            <li> I have KP and nothing has really helped much over the years.</li>
            <li> very close to floor cleaner smell.</li>
            <li> i just recently bought the soap so my review is not as detailed.</li>
            <li> and I saw no redness, there was no itching or swelling, and I haven&#x27;t really felt that sensation since then unless I accidentally get it on my lips.</li>
            <li> highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> i&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of people used the whole bar of soap on their face.</li>
            <li> so i began with rubbing the soap in the palm of my hands; you don&#x27;t need that much.</li>
            <li> I like this soap because it really did help my skin.</li>
            <li> The expiration date on my soaps were 2013..more than enough time for me to enjoy the benefits of the six pack ordered.  </li>
            <li> When I started use dudu soap my skin was rough and dry,now my skin is better.</li>
            <li> However, to my surprise it really improved my skin tone by fading away blemishes.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery.</li>
            <li> not so much of a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> a whole body soap for family</li>
            <li> He uses it for his face and I for my whole body.</li>
            <li> I really really like this soap.</li>
            <li> My hair both looks and feels much thicker and it styles</li>
            <li> this soap is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a whole box</li>
            <li> Those over the counter soaps really irritated my skin.</li>
            <li> Also my whole body during the winter and no itchy skin.</li>
            <li> yet I always had a breakout no matter how much I paid for products.  </li>
            <li> I do recomend getting some organic jojoba oil to add to your moisturizer to help replinish your skin even if you have really oily skin already.  </li>
            <li> I feel like it really gets all the dirt and oil out</li>
            <li> have very acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> Now i really try not to touch my face at all</li>
            <li> that I had much but its been a year</li>
            <li> I can use it very well.</li>
            <li> and I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> but this one really surpassed my expectations.</li>
            <li> the ash acts as a sponge with its porous surface area for absorbing toxins and dirt from the skin</li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Warning: If you use this, then you really need a separate soap dish for it.  </li>
            <li> It really is a miracle bar for the complexion, not drying.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well.</li>
            <li> hahaha</li>
            <li> but i don&#x27;t really mind the rash</li>
            <li> I use this soap on my whole body and face two times a day and my skin has never been clearer or smoother.</li>
            <li> Smells very good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> really like this</li>
            <li> I really like this soap.</li>
            <li> I really like the soap.</li>
            <li> I also really don&#x27;t like the way it smells.</li>
            <li> That combined with Audrey Organics Vitamin C toner and then raw/pure Cocoa Butter or Shea Butter afterwards has really done wonders and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my skin.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my acne.</li>
            <li> and he doesn&#x27;t have as much itching with this soap..</li>
            <li> and it was too gentle.</li>
            <li> The women in my life that I VERY OFTEN discuss beauty products with have also noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> We would spend so much money on acne products and now I just stock up on the soap.y husband works with oil and grease</li>
            <li> I use this soap for my whole body and also for my son who has eczema.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> It really cleans.</li>
            <li> I have very oily skin</li>
            <li> but none that I can really think of since I&#x27;ve been using this soap.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face and it works very well.  </li>
            <li> This soap cleanses really well and got rid of my acne and acne scars.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I now use it for my whole body as well as my face.  </li>
            <li> My skin is extremely sensitive so finding soap that does not make me itch is quite rare.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never bought soap in bulk, but I saved so much money by doing so.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> so i could gift this more widely among relatives and friends.</li>
            <li> It does its job well on your whole body and</li>
            <li> I today I ordered through another vendor, at a much much cheaper  price.</li>
            <li> I use it on my whole body.</li>
            <li> this has made my face soooooo much smoother</li>
            <li> Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> The price is extremely reasonable, too.  </li>
            <li> The seller was very informative.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even wear makeup anymore because It&#x27;s helped so much.</li>
            <li> It really did make my skin appear smoother.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t matter how much makeup I put on</li>
            <li> but the whole family is using it now.</li>
            <li> you really want to use this soap, just know that when you use it, it will also turn your skin brown until you thoroughly wash it off...</li>
            <li> Has a tropical smell and works very well with a loufa.</li>
            <li> lathers up really well.</li>
            <li> Some reviews state that is very drying to skin</li>
            <li> It smells fresh and natural, but is not over powering.</li>
            <li> This soap really cleans.  </li>
            <li> It is very drying</li>
            <li> Do not use with light or white rags!</li>
            <li> really it is squeaking when I&#x27;m done!&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really like it as my hair soap.</li>
            <li> but I can really tell the difference on my sisters skin.</li>
            <li> so you really have to keep it in a soap dish.</li>
            <li> some others said that the size of my pores seems to have decreased which also helps with the clearing of acne and not to mention it just makes your skin look great.</li>
            <li> So how much could be said about soap?  </li>
            <li> I have really oily skin and hair.</li>
            <li> but this really help my skin brighten up.</li>
            <li> My hair gets really oily</li>
            <li> Very luxurious and moisturizing soap.</li>
            <li> A whole winter went by without dandruff.</li>
            <li> I really like the soap.</li>
            <li> then you really ought to try this soap.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great soap if your skin is not too sensitive and can stand a firm natural soup.</li>
            <li> But wow, my skin is looking better all over in the last month than it ever has.</li>
            <li> Will be ordering more in the near future!</li>
            <li> I have been making a conscious effort to use more natural products, and I doubt this fragrance is natural.</li>
            <li> I honestly purchased this soap for childish reasons.</li>
            <li> It will dwindle fast if you leave it wet so make sure to put it in a drainable soap dish.</li>
            <li> So glad I did because I have a clear face for the first time in who knows how long.</li>
            <li> Great African black soap!</li>
            <li> Smell good for a natural black soap!</li>
            <li> The alkalinity of it is very potent because often times when i leave it on my face for a few minutes, I can feel my skin tightening and slightly burning (which feels lovely).  </li>
            <li> comments on this specific brand:  I first tried Nubian Heritage Black soap and loved it.  </li>
            <li> &amp; IT DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER HER SENSITIVE SKIN!!! :</li>
            <li> &amp; IT DOESN&#x27;T BOTHER HER SENSITIVE SKIN!!! :</li>
            <li> My skin feels very fresh after a day working outside is washed away and a night cream is applied.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Most store bought bars are not really black soap, and the color comes from dyes they add to a regular soap.</li>
            <li> I recommend you buy a supply that can last you for awhile, since the soap can dissolve pretty quickly.</li>
            <li> As a seller of many other products I can say that is product is of very high quality.</li>
            <li> I noticed that i was not getting any new break outs after the first 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> soap is super drying compared to better shea butter soaps, I can hardly believe how drying this soap is for all the positive reviews on it.</li>
            <li> Dudu Osun is quickly my personal favorite Black Soap to use because the skin conditions people have like Psoriasis, Eczema, and others could benefit from an easy to use soap like this that is already shaped for you to use.</li>
            <li> Real authentic black soap is not black, it&#x27;s brown, and soft.</li>
            <li> I purshased the Dudu Osun Black soap, because I saw the reviews and live in an apt.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also great in conjunction with raw shea butter which can be found from some of the same seller.</li>
            <li> I read that it can bother people with more sensitive skin, but if that&#x27;s not a major concern to you</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s great for razor burn and sensitive skin, and I like the subtle scent.</li>
            <li> The soap clean very well, I would say this is one of the only bar soaps that could be classified as a a &amp;#34;all in one soap&amp;#34; .</li>
            <li> Better than any other soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Other than that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to find any other soap or product that can do what this soap does.</li>
            <li> Okay, I can vouch for all the other reviewers&#x27; praise for this soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad other people like it</li>
            <li> All jokes aside from using soap with a name akin to washing yourself with a turd, I am very pleased with this product&#x27;s performance as someone who has suffered from skin conditions related to stress and constant aggravation from sensitive skin to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This soap works well for them - better than any other acne soap or lotions we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
            <li> Better than the other &amp;#34;RAW&amp;#34; one on Amazon</li>
            <li> Cleans me better than any other soap on the market I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
            <li> My husband has been able to calm his break outs down considerably, and my son&#x27;s skin is doing great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling clean not filmy like the regular soaps.</li>
            <li> I feel so extra clean after using it.</li>
            <li> The coloring of soap effects body cloths but, as long as you rinse thoroughly you will be fine.</li>
            <li> I used the clinique bar for years, and it left my skin feeling clean, but there&#x27;s no discernible difference in the health/appearance of my skin.</li>
            <li> I have long fine hair and with this soap their is no need for conditioner.  </li>
            <li> Clean well low fragrance ,for some I thought it would eliminate lotion</li>
            <li> and I really deep clean my body.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that the soap tends to crumble and doesn&#x27;t hold a clean, compact shape like big-brand soaps.</li>
            <li> It looks really gross but you feel clean.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m seriously thinking about throwing out my body soap and just using this one for everything, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> Some people argue it makes their skin too dry, it&#x27;s not overboard for me, in fact I believe this is one of the reasons why it&#x27;s effective for acne given that many people with acne have excessively oily skin.</li>
            <li> Had high hopes, but found the soap to be very drying.  </li>
            <li> The soap has a very refreshing fragrance and lathers so well that I have a hard time getting out of the shower.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has facial dandruff and required special cream.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and leaves your skin feeling smooth not dry.</li>
            <li> This soap is all natural, and what I love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin.</li>
            <li> I first started using it to help clear up my face.</li>
            <li> B00355GLSW One Natural Body Soap, Peace, 5 oz]] is #3 which has a fragrant peaceful forest fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> B00355GLSW One Natural Body Soap, Peace, 5 oz]] is #3 which has a fragrant peaceful forest fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> This soap does make your face glow and also treats your acne and dark and all that, if you read so many reviews.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap to wash my face for the past 3 months, and it&#x27;s been a nice surprise.</li>
            <li> This stuff gets pretty soft and will &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; itself out if kept in standing water.</li>
            <li> My skin has improved so much that I am sure by the middle of next year</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally a negative reviewer, but I really did not like this soap...</li>
            <li> I will continue to buy for such a great price and the natural quality of this black soap!</li>
            <li> Dry skin is quenched quickly when using this soap on a consistent basis.  </li>
            <li> Now my other co-workers want to try a bar too! :)</li>
            <li> Also be sure to use little product and gentle hands.</li>
            <li> I passed this soap onto my sister whom is experiencing a three year battle with hives and other assorted problems, her first reaction was incredibly positive, I&#x27;ll keep you informed of her longer term use (and be back to buy more if she continues to like it).    </li>
            <li> This stuff makes your skin feel like new!</li>
            <li> I am a hardcore buyer and trier of new products to better my skin (anti-aging, blemishes, spot correcting), along with other products like cosmetics, hair products, and body moisturizers.</li>
            <li> I already live in a desert climate, and lotions tend to irritate my skin, so I really can&#x27;t use this soap anymore.</li>
            <li> BUT it&#x27;s wonderfully perfume fragrant with decent lather and after washing with it, I can tell it&#x27;s a natural soap because I don&#x27;t feel my skin get tight and itchy as is usual with mainstream soaps which have chemicals in them.  </li>
            <li> Your skin will seem dry even though it is so smooth and glowing.</li>
            <li> It bleeds black quite a bit, however, I think all soaps bleed, just this one is more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Additionally, I enjoyed laughing at the name Dudu because it litterly looks like you are scrubbing yourself with a oddly shaped turd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save</li>
            <li> I was finally able to get rid of a stubborn black head I had for years...</li>
            <li> Love black soap.</li>
            <li> Love this black soap.</li>
            <li> To make it even less believable...</li>
            <li> Love this black soap.</li>
            <li> Love this Black soap..</li>
            <li> I love this Black Soap.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure that it never had that listed on the box in the past</li>
            <li> It irritated my face leaving it red and itching , a burning feeling , also my skin gotten super oily after using this .</li>
            <li> I use it mainly on my face and it exfoliates and cleanses well.</li>
            <li> I get them on my buttocks, chest, arms but mainly on my legs which made me quite embrassed to wear skirt and dress that werent ankle length.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Order up a decent stock, it&#x27;s so addicting</li>
            <li> But i have a feeling i finally found the best kept secret!   </li>
            <li> I purchased this particular brand and use this once per day</li>
            <li> It mainly helps reduce the redness and the flakiness I experience.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older and my skin is changing...</li>
            <li> Better off with a handmade soap with real essential oils and maybe even bought locally.</li>
            <li> This soap has a great smell and a good skin feel, but it dries out my skin terribly.</li>
            <li> Overall, I would say the product was okay but will not continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li> My skin feels refreshed with a healthy glow, even clearing up my occasional problematic skin irritations, such as acne and any rashes caused by the outdoors or stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This takes off makeup, especially eye makeup, faster, better and cleaner than the priciest facial cleanser.</li>
            <li> It is mild and deep cleanses.</li>
            <li> i went to the dermatologist where i had the doctors stumped..after about $200 in medicine and co pays and 2 biopsys to see what it is, the bumps did not go away and the biopsys came back as perfect nothing wrong with them.  </li>
            <li> and I loved it, but it was quite strange to watch the dark brown water coming off me from using this.</li>
            <li> I have always had very sensitive skin and absolutely nothing worked for my acne</li>
            <li> will buy again it clear your skin up well good for acne dark spots and deep cleans your skin</li>
            <li> Bought it on a whim after reading about African black soap, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this brand.</li>
            <li> RAW African Black Soap is perfect too, BUT when you buy it, you have to cut it to however much</li>
            <li> Highly recommended-</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product and this vendor to everyone.</li>
            <li> I WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IN HIGH SCHOOL</li>
            <li> If you are on the fence about buying this soap, I would highly recommend you give it a try.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend</li>
            <li> Anyways,  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it for those with acne or complexion issues.</li>
            <li> Both are alkaline (high pH level).</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
            <li> It was highly recommended to me, and I have not used &amp;#34;bar soap&amp;#34; in years,&lt;br</li>
            <li> HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> This is the best African Black soap I have tried and my family and I have tried quite a few.  </li>
            <li> honestly prefer black soap over castile soap, I also use it in my locs, my sons wavy hair, and my husband&#x27;s short straight hair.</li>
            <li> honestly prefer black soap over castile soap, I also use it in my locs, my sons wavy hair, and my husband&#x27;s short straight hair.</li>
            <li> I bought because the box says pure natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I think the formula was tweaked a bit, as the issues I had with the first batch (strong smell when using, irritation where the skin is sensitive) are no longer present in the current batch.</li>
            <li> Even tried the dermatologist and still could not get 100% clear, and I tried it all!!  </li>
            <li> It can be a little drying, though, so make sure you moisturize.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean without feeling dried out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s all natural and the charcoal in it helps soften hair and skin and leaves you feeling extra clean.</li>
            <li> I am light skin african american and scar very easily and have had little to no luck finding a solution.</li>
            <li> However, I love using this soap all over my body, especially before I work out because I found out that if I use this bar and sweat a bunch and I can&#x27;t clean up after I won&#x27;t break out at all, usually I&#x27;ll have a couple pimples here and there because of the sweat and stuff</li>
            <li> My scars are fading significantly after just one week, No new pimples</li>
            <li> My wife hasn&#x27;t complained about it yet, and that fact alone makes it amazing.</li>
            <li> My face skin is always clear and I attribute much of that to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> , b/c in my experience you can&#x27;t really trust any company when they say something is natural.  </li>
            <li> The soap is all natural and contains lime juice which is why my skin got so much lighter, and why the acne goes away.</li>
            <li> When you first use it, your skin will feel \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean and that may be a bit odd for some</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a miracle product, so it doesn&#x27;t clear up your skin overnight, but it really conditions the skin well without over-drying it</li>
            <li> It is all natural, cleanses very well and I will continue to order.  </li>
            <li> My face so far is responding to it VERY WELL.  </li>
            <li> i felt clean after wash, and never felt dry.  </li>
            <li> And after having years of clear skin, this bothered me so much.</li>
            <li> I feel clean with no residue and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s gentle on the sensitive skin around the eyes.</li>
            <li> natural ingreidients straight from Nigeria.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin on my hands but not so much on the rest of my body.</li>
            <li> It really stung my eyes, which makes me think, if this item is natural, what makes the eyes sting?  </li>
            <li> It took a week or two for my face to return to normal.  </li>
            <li> it works really well for my moderate acne to reduce and prevent it when i use it consistently.</li>
            <li> this Dudu-Osun is pretty much the same thing.</li>
            <li> I did pass along a few bars of soap to friend and they also love it for their skin.</li>
            <li> Do not keep this thing on your face for more then a few minutes.&lt;br</li>
            <li> We went through 5 bars in 2 months with 4 people using daily which is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> The only thing is that it sort of melts, pretty fast.</li>
            <li> the normal noxema and petroleum jelly have run their course.</li>
            <li> This especially was true near my nose, where the skin started peeling.</li>
            <li> Also, I read a review where it helped with body acne and although my days of battling body acne are pretty much over, I still break out on my back and face sometimes.</li>
            <li> A few more weeks</li>
            <li> these will forever be our everyday staples for healthy skin care.</li>
            <li> It made ME smell like it, too, and not in a normal, soapy way.</li>
            <li> but I did lots a research that stated this was normal and the dryness &amp; &amp;#34;sensation&amp;#34</li>
            <li> I had lotion too but did not use it yet.this soap rocks and brought back my smile..</li>
            <li> I normally cannot use anything on my face, but I kid you not</li>
            <li> This is pure unadulterated black soap.  </li>
            <li> Dudu Osun Black Soap is a good soap to use if you have very sensitive skin or dry skin problems.</li>
            <li> Healthy soap, I&#x27;ve been repurchasing this soap since I started switching to more natural ingredient soaps, the down side is that the bar doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> So far, my skin feels less dry compared to the other soap so that&#x27;s a great start!</li>
            <li> I love this soap...will be using black soap from this seller always!</li>
            <li> Its natural ingredients are great for my skin (I&#x27;m black) and I&#x27;ve noticed that the dark marks on my skin are beginning to fade.</li>
            <li> Love this black soap!</li>
            <li> I feel silly saying I love a soap, however, it&#x27;s true!</li>
            <li> We love &amp;#34;our&amp;#34; black soap!  </li>
            <li> It did initially leave my skin very dry after the first two times of using it but after that it was fine.</li>
            <li> so this is the part where some times my face feels very clean but just a little sting</li>
            <li> My only issue is that it easily melts (fades away) when left in the soap dish in the shower as the water hits it</li>
            <li> The soap is a luxurious experience right when you open the package.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve finally found the right combination.</li>
            <li> Makes your skin feel so clean; helps if you have acne &amp; helps if your skin is too dry!</li>
            <li> First soap I&#x27;ve ever used that did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> I can finally see my shoulder with no blemishes for the first time since I was a little girl, and I love how it smells.</li>
            <li> the soap makes you really dry after using the soap though, so really recommend that you put on lotion right after wards.&lt;br</li>
            <li> As studies show other races that are not ethnic have thinner sensitive skin so there is no way all of these positive reviews are true.</li>
            <li> I got a little more to clear up</li>
            <li> At first, my face felt really dry after washing it, but as long as you moisturize your face, you&#x27;re fine.</li>
            <li> I noticed that ever since I switched to organic and natural products, it takes a little but of time but results are better and healthier for your skin.</li>
            <li> The only drawback is that it is extremely soft, so it melted away pretty quickly when left on my sink.</li>
            <li> All of the new reviews except mine rated a 5 stars.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t figure out why the polish on my newly manicured nails would not stay on until I stopped using this soap.</li>
            <li> I live by this soap and when I don&#x27;t use it</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t get new ones.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t care how &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; it is- nothing could convince me to live with that stench.</li>
            <li> but I decided to try something new.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s his new soap as well.  </li>
            <li> but I can live that verses the benefits</li>
            <li> I had dinner at my sister&#x27;s on New Years Day</li>
            <li> I live by this soap.</li>
            <li> I live in a hard water area and have tried many soaps that claim to be gentle</li>
            <li> This soap does not dry my skin out any more than any other soap</li>
            <li> I love trying new soaps and will stick with this for a long, long time.</li>
            <li> Not to be overly dramatic, but this soap gets you a different kind of clean.</li>
            <li> It actually left them with very shiny coats.... and the rubbery feeling was a bonus because it really helped the dog brush grip the shedding fur.</li>
            <li> It actually left them with very shiny coats.... and the rubbery feeling was a bonus because it really helped the dog brush grip the shedding fur.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell of this soap, but it does leave your skin soft.  </li>
            <li> and super dry.....</li>
            <li> I saw some where people thought that the good reviews were actually fake reviews,  and that really worried me.....</li>
            <li> But Im definately going back to raw because I feel like it cleans soooo much better!</li>
            <li> I just washed my face with it about 3 minutes ago and haven&#x27;t used any moisturizer and my skin feels soft an smooth and not tight and dry.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have keratosis polaris and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it to clear up any blemishes.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and have found this soap to be helpful in eliminating the itching and skin rash.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> now I use it just about everywhere except my very sensitive areas.</li>
            <li> My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This soap pulls all impurities out of skin and leaves your skin very soft.</li>
            <li> It has a very natural, kinda grassy scent that does not linger on he skin.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and eczema</li>
            <li> In April 2011 (exactly one year later) I was moving from my apartment into my new house and was packing up the cabinet and discovered it.</li>
            <li> ( my face is usually clear)!</li>
            <li> It controls acne very well apparently.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> update after more time has past...</li>
            <li> I first bought and used this soap when suggested by my African hair braider.  </li>
            <li> I was currently using the Goats Milk Soap - I like it, but it has a funny smell.  </li>
            <li> I have now used it for 3 day &amp; all i can say is wow!</li>
            <li> First it made my face tingle for a couple of days, then it turned my face red!</li>
            <li> At first use it made my skin tingle,but that only lasted a couple of days of use.</li>
            <li> My first concern with this soap is that they don&#x27;t disclose all of the ingredients, they only list the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients in bullets on the box.</li>
            <li> so I was pleasantly surprised on the lather that this soap creates!</li>
            <li> I actually keep the unopened boxes in a plastic bag, since the smell is pretty strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I at first used it for my face only, and it felt radiant.</li>
            <li> The next year I was able to get more and after that I was unable to locate anymore.</li>
            <li> The only thing I would advise anyone who uses it, is that because it is such an all-natural product, make sure to not leave it anywhere in the shower where it gets the constant flow of the showerhead, because it will literally rinse-away over time.  </li>
            <li> I first found this soap at an outside market in Washington D.C.</li>
            <li> I have tried this soap before in the past and love the results.  </li>
            <li> You almost feel like you don&#x27;t have to put lotion on after - and I am 57 years old!  </li>
            <li> and i can see a big difference.the first week</li>
            <li> It has an herbal citrus-y smell that is a little strong at first, but does not last on your skin.</li>
            <li> I had read of the many benefits of using African Black Soap and along with the the high reviews I chose this brand.  </li>
            <li> But this time my intention is to get a deep deep clean</li>
            <li> but, if youve used this product and had the same reaction or have hypersensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to risk more breakouts, there are other available no fragrance containing black soaps on amazon.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t let it get near your eyes or other more fragile</li>
            <li> Smells great too, but the only thing is it does leave a bit mess because the soap is dark</li>
            <li> which honestly sensitive or not u should take baby steps with new products.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to find the right soap.  </li>
            <li> [...]  check out this website they have a way better product line of black soap...it was really dry didn&#x27;t lather very well I used it for about one week</li>
            <li> Yes, it is messy and will leave stains on your sink, but they are easily rinsed off, so</li>
            <li> It works very well for people of color and does not dry out the skin or leave residue.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and was terrified from the reviews with people talking about their skin getting irritated and red after use.</li>
            <li> I have a Weimaraner and these dogs are known for having very sensitive coats... even too sensitive for dog shampoos and baby shampoos.</li>
            <li> The soap is very powerful and I decided to by the all natural raw Shea butter to help me out with moisture, these two products combined will absolutely transform your skin.</li>
            <li> I LIKED THE FEELING , AS IF IT WAS GETTING INTO MY SKIN&amp; PORES, DOING &amp;#34;SOMETHING&amp;#34; ( at least!</li>
            <li> this soap has helped me to not only dry up acne/oil from my face, but to visibly soften acne marks and smooth my skin all over.  </li>
            <li> make sure you use a moisturizer with this product because it can dry out your skin if you arn&#x27;t too careful.</li>
            <li> This soap leaves your skin soft and because I have very oily skin, I do not use any moisturizer after and this soap and my skin is never dry.</li>
            <li> I love African black soap and this soap works well.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s fine after a few uses.  </li>
            <li> About a month ago I started using this soap on my entire body and love the way my skin feels although it does leave a mess in the shower.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;d pick this soap which gives you 6 large soapbars, albeit ugly-looking &amp; feeling, for a lowly bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle-aged white dude with large pores and somewhat oily skin.  </li>
            <li> It make your face feel fresh, and wont feel very dry after washing face.</li>
            <li> It will clean really well but dried my skin out alittle!</li>
            <li> skin is combination with a little more than occasional large cystic acne in the aforementioned area.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light skinned African American that bought this soap for softer skin, fading of dark spots (mainly on my legs), and stretch marks (in combo with pure shea butter).</li>
            <li> After I finished showering I used a little coconut oil on my face and it feels baby soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband posted a photo of this soap on the floor of our shower on Facebook, and I had a hard time convincing people</li>
            <li> It helps me clear up my acne, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most other body soaps.</li>
            <li> But my cheeks are pretty raw right now (and I have never considered myself to have sensitive skin)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried raw black soap before, and I loved it.  </li>
            <li> We saw immediately results with clear skin showing through.  </li>
            <li> This soap has helped clear up my acne.  </li>
            <li> This soap will also clear scars.</li>
            <li> and when I saw my way clear to do</li>
            <li> I have always had clear skin.</li>
            <li> This is helping to clear up my son&#x27;s chronic acne break outs and oily skin.</li>
            <li> Started to use this soap to help clear my skin.</li>
            <li> -I am very self conscious about taking pictures unless i have make up on, which further aggravates my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but now my face is always clear.</li>
            <li> but it did not help to clear blemishes either.  </li>
            <li> Keeps skin clear and moisturized</li>
            <li> My skin is clear and glows.</li>
            <li> It causes a burning uncomfortable sensation in private areas lol</li>
            <li> This soap has helped to lighten the areas in my face and leaves me with a clear complexion.  </li>
            <li> This is an all natural soap.</li>
            <li> I have every used so far.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product, and I was surprised when I went to my mailbox, and it just reeked of a flowery/sweet scent.  </li>
            <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the tropical smell.</li>
            <li> I ordered the \\&quot;natural shea</li>
            <li> I tried this soap as a body wash for a week before I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the itchy rash I developed while using it.      </li>
            <li> and I like how soft it leaves my skin.</li>
            <li> My skin was so soft without even applying lotion.</li>
            <li> I would recommend unscented Dove for sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference from regular bar soap though.  </li>
            <li> but I haven&#x27;t yet seen any changes and it&#x27;s been nearly 3 weeks.</li>
            <li> Tried it because I heard it was a natural, result producing product</li>
            <li> and OMG, I swear its close to a miracle to my skin, those yearssss of old scars, 95% of them are gone.</li>
            <li> Now people come up to by and tell me I have beatuiful skin (which has never happened to me in my young years).  </li>
            <li> My husband always comments how soft my skin is.</li>
            <li> and so far I am sold.</li>
            <li> I do not need to reapply and it will last the whole while.</li>
            <li> CAREFULLY on sensitive skin, it will feel like it&#x27;s burning.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a natural soap that was affordable and this is it.  </li>
            <li> and I have sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.&lt;br</li>
            <li> IT RINSED OFF MY WASHCLOTH COMPLETELY, JUST FYI</li>
            <li> ( unless your REALLY SENSITIVE to smells, then maybe, but I&#x27;d still try it!)&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li> EVEN MY 11 yr OLD DAUGHTER LIKES IT</li>
            <li> EVEN MY 11 yr OLD DAUGHTER LIKES IT</li>
            <li> Then I used this on my face on a frequent basis.</li>
            <li> I have slightly sensitive skin, but not overly so.</li>
            <li> I use this on my daughters sensitive skin</li>
            <li> Throw in the natural ingredients without added chemicals and the like</li>
            <li> Plus my skin feels, in the words of my sister, \\&quot;as soft as a baby&#x27;s bum.\\&quot;  Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> I read so much about this soap that I finally decided to order some and give it a try.</li>
            <li> I like things that have a natural, organic fragrance and this does.</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin  avoid this product.</li>
            <li> Leaves skin so soft, and tight.&lt;br /&gt;6th.</li>
            <li> and I have to say this soap leaves my skin soft, even without a moisturizer after use.  </li>
            <li> Helps my 74 year old mother&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t know how it would work on sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Still, if I had to pick a natural soap while saving my $$&#x27;s</li>
            <li> (Yes it lightens a shade meaning very subtle-not enough to change my race)&lt;br</li>
            <li> It seem to be natural ingredients and  no stimulation.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve found that my scars have faded over time and my skin feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I AM NOW 56 YEARS OLD.  </li>
            <li> , I now use all of my old wash cloths and keep the soap in a plastic soap dish in the shower.</li>
            <li> I do have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> my pores have become smaller, very moisturizing, works well with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> My 15 year old son loves it as well.  </li>
            <li> I have been using it for about 8 months now, and it keeps my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> My skin is too sensitive to use it.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin</li>
            <li> I have problems with eczema on my scalp but this soap has reduced it by 80% so far.</li>
            <li> and she didn&#x27;t need lotion afterwards and that is completely a lie.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin...</li>
            <li> Just beware if you are sensitive to smell you may not want to order this product.</li>
            <li> This affects the amount of time soap has to be purchased, so be conscious.</li>
            <li> and now Im 25 with adult acne.</li>
            <li> I started experimenting with natural products to heal my scarred skin from acne.</li>
            <li> directly because the skin is tougher.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been to several dermatologist and all they did was prescribe me a cream that didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
            <li> I always love to read all the reviews (I can be a sucker sometimes)</li>
            <li> simply lather and apply to face by rubbing gently in circular motion.  </li>
            <li> Frequently get acne &amp; ingrown hairs.</li>
            <li> This soap is all natural and I recommend it to anyone who is struggling with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I use it on my hair instead of shampoo because it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients</li>
            <li> I took the reviews claiming it completely clears your skin and fades stretch marks with a grain of salt, but even so the soap exceeded my expectations.  </li>
            <li> But i think the odor is because of its natural material.  </li>
            <li> so one can only hope that it is ethically sourced and that the ingredients are what they claim to be.</li>
            <li> its a natural product, just not working for me.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews had me worried as I have a sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> My husband has itchy, sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> I have medium sensitive skin in areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> but I moisturize well directly after I apply my astringent.</li>
            <li> This has not stained my tub or towels and the only way I would see this happening is if people are using too much soap and not rinsing thoroughly.</li>
            <li> a loooong way!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing more of this soap in the future (in greater bulk), and I&#x27;m sorry I haven&#x27;t found it sooner.</li>
            <li> I am an adult who still gets occassional acne.  </li>
            <li> Completely amazed.</li>
            <li> Let me start this off by saying that I have tried nearly everything.</li>
            <li> It was caused by hormones, since I had been on hormone replacement therapy for nearly 5 months at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> how much moisturizer, I was literally starting to look like a zombie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I developed a rash on my face</li>
            <li> purchased this on a reccomendation from someone else, made my skin and face feel really soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> Im a real fan of african product.</li>
            <li> My 7 year old uses it as well.  </li>
            <li> I use this soap along with a toner and Lush cosmetics moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I work early in the morning</li>
            <li> and I rub it directly on my body</li>
            <li> To a point where I thought that my eczema was spreading throughout my entire body at that very moment.</li>
            <li> And, it keeps my skin soft and moisturized as well.</li>
            <li> I can not stop telling people about how it completely cleared my teenager&#x27;s dandruff after 1 use.</li>
            <li> Anti-bacterial action.</li>
            <li> they were to come back and also because i have very oily skin</li>
            <li> My daughter csn use this without her sensitive skin getting irritated.  </li>
            <li> This soap is made in Africa and is all natural.  </li>
            <li> use this daily on my face because my skin is very oily and prone to acne, and this soap helps with that nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that has some leftover spots from old pimples.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve started using it on my body as well; any form of dryness can be easily fixed.</li>
            <li> my skin was really itchy and red</li>
            <li> I have eczema and get frequent flare-ups.  </li>
            <li> This soap keeps it on check and keeps my skin soft.  </li>
            <li> I have ordered this three times thus far.</li>
            <li> The dudu osun soaps shipping time was expeditious, and the product itself far exceeds my expectations.</li>
            <li> only real downside is that it does leave an unsightly and somewhat suspicious looking brown trail wherever you place it, but even then it doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> Even as an adult my skin always had problems with breakouts, not anymore.</li>
            <li> I used it on my face and it completely changed everything.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m all about using products with natural ingredients.  </li>
            <li> and WOW what a difference it had made.</li>
            <li> my skin is radiant and feels so soft and silky...</li>
            <li> I have used this soap occasionally and really like it.  </li>
            <li> my skin is sensitive, and I gave it a try</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe it,it also make ur hair feel.so silky,that I Dnt have to use conditioner anymore my hair is soft as a baby</li>
            <li> theres a natural glow that i get</li>
            <li> Natural and not too pungent.  </li>
            <li> It is very moisturizing and cleansing at the same time.</li>
            <li> Works well on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> This soap does have a expiration date since it is all natural.  </li>
            <li> I ordered six bars and it had a far off expiration date.</li>
            <li> I actually only use the soap when I know I won&#x27;t be running into anyone for a while, because of how much people dislike the smell.    </li>
            <li> and I have naturally oily skin...and acne (even cystic)</li>
            <li> It also helped me get rid of some keratosis pilaris I had near my knees and on my elbows.</li>
            <li> I have heard of Dudu-Osun but hadn&#x27;t seen it in any of the shops locally for a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Leaves my skin soft and refreshed.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and severe acne.  </li>
            <li> All natural.  </li>
            <li> No chemicals, just natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap daily, sometimes even twice a day, for about 3 weeks, and it&#x27;s really helped reduce oiliness and acne.</li>
            <li> Locally I cannot find authentic black soap, but I have found a few brands that although they are not authentic they are made out of the good stuff</li>
            <li> the Aloe Vera Gel will cool the irritation down.</li>
            <li> Makes your face feel tight, soft, and refreshingly clean.</li>
            <li> Began sloughing off dead skin after the first use!!</li>
            <li> long as you don&#x27;t really care how your soap looks or feels, I would recommend it as fine for aromatherapy and everyday use, but not as a gift to a friend since the packaging and product form leaves a lot to be desired unless it&#x27;s a friend with sensitive skin or who likes dabbling with natural and/or organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is mild on my face and as long as I continue with my daily twice a day regimen</li>
            <li> However you can find other similar cleansers like this in drug stores with cheap price as well.</li>
            <li> At first, the soap seemed to work, leaving my face feeling refreshed, but as the weeks went on, I started having dry skin.</li>
            <li> I would also suggest picking up a exfoliating cream that you can use 2 times a week and a moisturizer because the soap will dry your skin when you first use it.</li>
            <li> It quickly lessened any dark spots on my face and hands also.  </li>
            <li> It smells nice, and lasts a while if you only use it as a face soap since a little goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li> I am 43, incredibly pale (Northern European heritage) and have overly sensitive, extremely dry skin, and I love this soap!</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the added fragrance, it is overwhelming...smells like a car air freshener, very strong.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little much the first times around.</li>
            <li> I love a deep clean, so I lather my face and rub in small circles for a few minutes before rinsing.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this many times in the past before, from all different sellers.</li>
            <li> Not a typical baby rash, either.</li>
            <li> This soap is brown and not black.</li>
            <li> I quickly washed off and began to use Dr. Woods black soap that I also purchased from Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Be careful washing any sensitive areas at first.</li>
            <li> at first I only used it on my back (because of acne)</li>
            <li> well, some black soaps start to crumble quickly</li>
            <li> The other reviewers were right.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone with similar issues.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used all kinds of organic, high end creams and soaps, but this one actually works..</li>
            <li> /&gt;Dudu-Osun soap contains different forms of wood ash, which in turn has a high percentage of calcium carbonate (used in agricultural lime) and potash (used in lye).</li>
            <li> High quality soap - not only for Africans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros</li>
            <li> With all of the high priced designer French milled soaps, muds, and skin tonics</li>
            <li> Shipment was very fast and it arrived before the expected date.</li>
            <li> In the winter time it can seem a little drying to my face in particular so I just use a little extra rose hip seed oil or witch hazel</li>
            <li> Takes away acne like no other products!</li>
            <li> and I was curious to try some authentic black soap from Africa.</li>
            <li> Using similar black soaps doesn&#x27;t do the job, this product leaves my face feeling cleansed and oil free.</li>
            <li> but due to my sensitive skin i quick apply honey oatmeal naturally facial scrub.</li>
            <li> In the past year I started getting huge cystic pimples all over my cheeks and along my jawline.</li>
            <li> I agree with another reviewer that their ingredients don&#x27;t seem to be accurate as only a few natural items are listed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s priced reasonably and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I am of Asian descent, over 50, and have clear skin that I have always taken care of, so I can&#x27;t speak for clearing up skin conditions, but for whole body, including face, this is the only soap you will</li>
            <li> Price is also reasonable and each bar lasts quite a long time.</li>
            <li> Also, be careful with sensitive areas such as eyes, freshly shaved armpits and legs, and the nether-regions.</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time and the product is exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Last but not least</li>
            <li> IDK if this is normal, and I&#x27;ve only been using this for almost two weeks but</li>
            <li> Makes you skin soft and smooth help to remove dead skin especially from arm pits.</li>
            <li> The soap makes me feel dry and it burned certain areas of my body.</li>
            <li> It leaves you clean and does not leave the normal soap scum in your tub.</li>
            <li> /&gt;i had gotten a large tattoo on my arm back in March and started to develop red bumps alllllll over my tattoo (before you say allergic to the ink</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other black soaps and they seem to help my daughters eczema better than this one.</li>
            <li> Not to mention the goodness of the original black soap mixed with honey (my fav).</li>
            <li> Somehow I think it is more processed than other black soaps that I have tried buuuut...</li>
            <li> This is d only soap that works for me, I haven&#x27;t had any new break out</li>
            <li> This soap really helped me with my dry skin.  </li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s easy to use and smells great, it won&#x27;t sit in your soap dish and melt like organic base black soap can.</li>
            <li> It really took a toll on my face, leaving it ridiculously dry even after applying moisturizers.</li>
            <li> Dark brown that does NOT stain at all (my white washcloths are just fine and stay white when rinsed out or washed).</li>
            <li> I have only been using it for about two months and my skin has honestly never looked better.</li>
            <li> (pretty much every scent) for the past 4 years.  </li>
            <li> With shea butter and natural herbs and scents]] which is always #1 on my list triple milled with soft texture imported from France - try their different fragrances</li>
            <li> I smile and say Dudu osun black soap</li>
            <li> so 6 bars should last you a pretty long time (depending on your household size of course)</li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts pretty long and the bars are big.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t buy more.</li>
            <li> The more sensitive your skin, the worse this will be.</li>
            <li> The acne becoming worse possibly was what most would consider the purging stage, to where it&#x27;s worse before it&#x27;s better, but I&#x27;m too impatient for that.</li>
            <li> the soap cleans my skin very well w/o leaving it dry or irritatedly cracked, it left my face clean and tight (just watch out for prolonging skin contact.</li>
            <li> I have eczema and since I have used it I barely use my cream that my dermatologist prescribed for me!</li>
            <li> but you will definitely feel cleaner and naturally refreshed!</li>
            <li> the major brands.</li>
            <li> I am so disappointed especially since there were such great reviews!</li>
            <li> Besides the cleaning power, there is no other benefits like some of the reviews posted that it helps with eczema and lighten the skin.  </li>
            <li> We were so excited to use since we both have a SMALL problem with breakouts.</li>
            <li> My only problem is that it was easily flushed down the toilet by my children</li>
            <li> The first time I used it my skin kinda felt dry but that resolved by third use.</li>
            <li> We have a family of sensitive skin, I have dry eczema prone skin on my body and a normal to oily skin on my face that is prone to breakouts and has plenty of acne scarring.</li>
            <li> I slowly drifted from the commercial American junk to more natural products.</li>
            <li> Dudu Osun Black Soap, 6-Count review right now.</li>
            <li> Shea Moisture&#x27;s soap is very gentle and helps control oily skin as well as help with ingrown hair irritation, sure its more expensive, but at this moment i rather just have two bars of gentle soap than 8 of this irritating product, ugh 12 dollars down the drain.</li>
            <li> Other soaps make his skin break out but not this one :)  A little messy, but worth it...</li>
            <li> very messy but worth it!</li>
            <li> Some black soaps cause a burning irritation if left on the skin while showering for too long, but this specific product is more tolerable.</li>
            <li> The dry skin on my hands was smooth in less than 3 days.</li>
            <li> We are African American decent and she asked me one day,</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend for teens or adults with acne, not young children or the elderly.</li>
            <li> It may make your skin feel just a bit tight right after using it, but I don&#x27;t mind.  </li>
            <li> I highly recommend this item the only thing is don&#x27;t use it with white wash cloths!</li>
            <li> which generally keeps my acne under control, but never gets rid of it, and dries out my skin.  </li>
            <li> In general, I have oily skin as well.</li>
            <li> General effectiveness.</li>
            <li> General effectiveness.</li>
            <li> This soap has helped to clear up my body and facial acne.</li>
            <li> my husband did the first day, but now both of us are clear 99% of the time, despite our heavy workout routines &amp; sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use</li>
            <li> i noticed that my acne is starting to clear up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s starting to clear up my skin&#x27;s acne blemishes/scars</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m in to using a lot of natural products these day and this is one I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> I used it for 2 days without any problems (in fact, I noticed that my blemishes are clearing up), but when I had to wash my face 2 times in a time frame of about 4 hours, this caused my skin to become extremely sensitive and red.    </li>
            <li> but once I used this soap on his ultra sensitive skin his excema cleared up almost instantly.</li>
            <li> It calmed me instantly, leaving my skin soft and brighter.</li>
            <li> I RECOMMEND THIS SOAP TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY TO ALL SKIN TYPE AND ALL PEOPLE.    </li>
            <li> You can barely see them</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve gone threw countless prescriptions, microdermabrasions, chemical peels, all natural remedies, but nothing would work.  </li>
            <li> which is #1 on my list with soft texture, triple milled made in the french way but made in the US&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN</li>
            <li> I wash my sensitive areas with the second</li>
            <li> I also developed tiny bumps on my face, but that could be because of the shea butter.</li>
            <li> Your face will also feel soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> Visible difference after usuage- only directly after using though.</li>
            <li> Once I received it, the last ingredient is &#x27;fragrance&#x27; which there is nothing natural about.</li>
            <li> My skin still breaks out, but not as frequently, though when they do appear they tend to be big</li>
            <li> It cleared up his skin without irritation and went back to natural tone.</li>
            <li> So far, I don&#x27;t see any big changes.</li>
            <li> And it&#x27;s all natural - which is a giant upside to what you might find n</li>
            <li> My Bare Minerals foundation just barely covered it.</li>
            <li> They were still there of course, but even my mother was surprised by the instant difference.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair-skinned blonde with extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> As a 44 year old female I find it can be a bit drying</li>
            <li> like natural fragrance but similar to the chemical essence.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am not ashame anymore to wear my bare legs.</li>
            <li> I stopped using it so frequently and cut back to one every 2 days.</li>
            <li> My husband has really sensitive skin that will crack, swell, and break out when he uses some products, he&#x27;s also a fire fighter and is constantly training and exercising</li>
            <li> I wish dudu osun sold an all natural version without fragrance but currently to my knowledge, they don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
            <li> When I first applied the later on my wet face, my skin started to itch and prickle, but I dismissed it as its healing properties taking into effect.  </li>
            <li> I have normal, not sensitive skin</li>
            <li> If left on the skin for even a minute, I can feel the burning for up to six hours later, and my skin sensitivity level is normal.</li>
            <li> Dudu Osun has been my best-kept secret for many years now.</li>
            <li> I tried everything you could think of and honestly I think I was making my face angry because the acne seemed to look like a rash; almost like I had the measles.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m just thrilled with the results, was going to the dermatologist which prescribed expensive creams but nothing worked like this soap</li>
            <li> I would have given 5 stars except I thought that the black soap w/aloe and shea butter worked a little better for my skin.</li>
            <li> It quickly dissolves when sitting on a wet surface (even a slightly wet one).</li>
            <li> One thing that seems to be true that other reviewers said was that my face is having some minor breakouts although it also is starting to feel softer and is looking</li>
            <li> tried this because it seemed odd and had a funny name.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying black soap.  </li>
            <li> my hyperpigmentation seems to be less noticeable after the first use.</li>
            <li> It dries my skin out a lot more than other things in the past that i used have.</li>
            <li> though - it gets used up quick and is messy!     </li>
            <li> Other than that, not bad just be careful.</li>
            <li> &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Smell [personal preference, it&#x27;s not strong or lingering, I just prefer the Nubian &amp; Shea Moisture brand smells better]&lt;br /&gt;Melts quickly in the shower</li>
            <li> I also live in the desert and genetically have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I only got to use it once so far, but it is reaaaaly different</li>
            <li> with any soap, if you want to have it last longer, keep it away from water and get a soapholder with holes on the bottom so the water doesn&#x27;t stay to liquefy the soap.iple milled with soft texture imported from France - try their different fragrances</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even know how many hours I&#x27;ve wasted researching and experimenting with different products until I found this black soap which uses a formula that&#x27;s been around for hundreds of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Another note: I do try to eat healthy, but no more than the average person</li>
            <li> I have been back and forth with different types of natural soaps.</li>
            <li> My face and upper body ( chest and back )are covered with old acne spots and marks.  </li>
            <li> This is such a disappointment because everything else about the soap is absolutely gorgeous.</li>
            <li> Used on my face and body, feels good.clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> This one there is no residue, my skin is not dry</li>
            <li> I did not dry my face out</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t use no dry skin.</li>
            <li> I used it also and after showering my skin was not dry</li>
            <li> and it does not dry it out at all.  </li>
            <li> I plan, personally, to stick to French triple-milled soaps and pay a bit more for less mess.</li>
            <li> First off let me give you a little background...</li>
            <li> and then the 2 week all the pimples were dead and my face looks good, the dark spot were too black for the 1st week but on my second week you only see them if you close to me.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun is the age-long African black soap made the traditional way by hand from PURE NATURAL INGREDIENTS AND HERBS from the tropical rainforest and savannah regions.  </li>
            <li> i looked up natural remedies to cure his dry skin and black soap was the first item to pop up on the majority of the reveiws.</li>
            <li> The strong rule, the weak suffer.</li>
            <li> ONCE IT&#x27;S WET &amp; YOU USE IT , THE SMELL IS LESS STRONG &amp; IT&#x27;S FROM NATURAL CITRUS , &amp;OTHER INGREDIENTS...</li>
            <li> We got the first bar at a local health foods store and found it for less here on Amazon.  </li>
            <li> Great product, especially in the cold dry air of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula.</li>
            <li> I then ordered the raw African black soap which works 10X more.</li>
            <li> It tends to leave ugly soap smudges (looks like dirt), but easy enough to clean up.</li>
            <li> My husband is constantly making fun of my natural &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; soaps, but lately he has abandoned his Dove bars in favor of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Works well for facial use as well as general cleansing.  </li>
            <li> Seems to lather very well and the bars are much bigger than other brands of soaps, which seemed to have reduced their bar sizes over the years.</li>
            <li> Remember not to leave it too long on sensitive area of your skin because the stuff BURNS.</li>
            <li> Also, don&#x27;t leave it on the face too long and do I would not recommend applying the soap directly to your face.</li>
            <li> A) Its a soap made out of natural ingredients and herbs that does the job.&lt;br /&gt;B) It can make your skin burn if you keep it on your skin for too long for some reason</li>
            <li> It also does wonders for my feet, keeps them soft all day long</li>
            <li> My 15 year old daughter who breaks out occasionally on her face and her back is now starting to use it.  </li>
            <li> Clearly not a product for sensitive flowers.</li>
            <li> It will permeate the bathroom for the first few days, but the smell dissolves.  </li>
            <li> It would be nice if they made different colors because it does look odd when I set it down in my shower and the water runs down kinda brown looking.</li>
            <li> Any bumps that I do get dry up quickly and dont leave a very dark mark.</li>
            <li> I also have some hyperpigmentation issues (freckles), dark circles, and a few fine lines around my eyes.</li>
            <li> If you have normal skin, slightly dry like my daughter, you will only want to use this maybe 3x per week (and only once per day then)</li>
            <li> The bar is large and does make a mess in the tub, not a deal breaker though.  </li>
            <li> That seems almost unbelievable, but when I stopped using it for awhile and then resumed I could tell the difference right away in how my skin looked.  </li>
            <li> I have recommended this product to other family members and would highly recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> my most in depth review, when i first saw this product I  checked out the reviews and the bad ones</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was trying to find something to clear up the dry rash that has been on my face for months.</li>
            <li> It does have a prominent herbal, vaguely medicinal smell which I enjoy, but after rinsing the soap off, the lingering scent on my skin is subtle.</li>
            <li> but if you have dry skin I still prefer natural glycerin soap</li>
            <li> The soap doesNOT dry out your skin and leaves it soft and moist.</li>
            <li> My skin is relatively dry and flakey and the soap exfoliates my skin and makes it soft and glowy.</li>
            <li> I like the way this soap smells, and it softens my sensitive, dry  skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m around Gabrielle Union&#x27;s shade and decided to purchase this because I found out the Ambi black soap I was using wasn&#x27;t real.</li>
            <li> My whole family uses Dudu-Osaun Black Soap.</li>
            <li> Even the ones that claim to be for sensitive skin with no fragrance don&#x27;t cleanse and still leave me dry and itchy for days.  </li>
            <li> Would not use this as makeup remover because of the delicate skin around my eyes.(usually the first to become sensitive if used too long)&lt;br</li>
            <li> Would not use this as makeup remover because of the delicate skin around my eyes.(usually the first to become sensitive if used too long)&lt;br</li>
            <li> every where, it&#x27;s not scary like some of the posting here, at least not for me, no burning, no skin cuts when applying it direct to the body.  </li>
            <li> MY FACE HAD A SLIGHT, VERY SLIGHT TINGLE TO IT, NOTHING TOO STRONG OR BOTHERSOME- , IT SUBSIDED WITHIN 30 secs.</li>
            <li> I found the soap is effective when showering under hard water, but is VERY MESSY.</li>
            <li> Every couple days I will use an all natural sea sponge to exfoliate, and after every single wash I put on organic coconut oil.</li>
            <li> I started using this because my skin is super sensitive and had become rough, dry, and uneven in appearance.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I am a European American with long thick, but fine, hair.</li>
            <li> My usual face cleansing routine included washing with Aveeno Clear Complexion soap or Basis Sensitive Skin Bar soap followed by Retin-A micro...which kept my skin somewhat clear but still oily.</li>
            <li> makes a mess in the tub and really didnt help with acne</li>
            <li> This soap is nowhere near the product that it is supposed to be, it is very misleading when trying to buy real black soap that actually helps the appearance of your skin.</li>
            <li> the dark marks on my cheeks from picking at old blemishes have lightened considerably in this short period of time.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t care about smell as much as how your skin looks go with standard black soap.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything different, except it really messes up bathtub or sink with black marks.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve never experienced such a strong burning sensation from a soap before.</li>
            <li> In fact, after the first few days of using this soap, I developed a harsh reaction that caused my skin to &#x27;bleed&#x27; clear liquid out.</li>
            <li> Because of my skin&#x27;s dryness from the extreme temperatures this winter, my skin would burn a little for a week or so when I used the  soap, but after patting my skin dry and applying coconut oil, I felt fine and now that it&#x27;s healed there isn&#x27;t any burning.</li>
            <li> I use a little extra virgin olive oil on my face after I wash it...and pure Shea butter on my skin...</li>
            <li> It could be a bit harsh for certain skin types.  </li>
            <li> The  only thing I do not like is the way the residue from the black soap shows up on our white porcelain bathroom sinks, but it is nonetheless well worth buying.</li>
            <li> It lathers up fast and with little effort.</li>
            <li> My whole face broke out in a rash and you could feel little bumps all over my cheeks, temples, and jawline.  </li>
            <li> I had a very hard time using facial products with any success, even the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; ones would irritate me.</li>
            <li> Initially, you fill feel very dry as the soap washes away the chemicals from your old soap, but the feeling disappears within a month, if not within two weeks.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, but I rated it only 4 stars because it makes my face burn a little when I use it.</li>
            <li> Also, the smell of this soap was a little unusual and bothered me after using the 2nd bar.</li>
            <li> It can be a little drying, but overall I really like it.</li>
            <li> My skin looked raw, bright pink and shiny but after a few hours, the redness went down and my skin felt cleaner and smoother than it ever did in my life, and after that I never had the sensitivity when using the soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;the soap isnt bad or good.</li>
            <li> Great for those of us who have reactions to the nasty chemicals put into modern hygiene products.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does give you a bit of dryness and can have a &amp;#34;sensation&amp;#34; (don&#x27;t know how to describe it: not bad but not good either)</li>
            <li> Presentation-wise, it&#x27;s not like other soaps which keep their form since it&#x27;s packed like a very large muddy ill-formed soapbar from the start and while bathing, it breaks down in brown/black muddy pieces.  </li>
            <li> Im a high maintenance girl and love to use expensive creams and products, but black soap is my go to cleanser.</li>
            <li> As months continued, I noticed that my skin was becoming less dull looking.</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s hard to find the right shampoo.</li>
            <li> It immediately calm down the soap I was using before and the inflammation went down as well.</li>
            <li> Messy, but true African Black soap is.</li>
            <li> I was convinced after using it the first few times that I&#x27;d get out of the shower, dry off, and look like a tomato.</li>
            <li> I rarely, I mean rarely leave reviews for products.</li>
            <li> Even after sweating, you stink less than you would normally.  </li>
            <li> Makes my skin mad soft too, my stretch marks are a lot better as well.</li>
            <li> It has lightened up the dark scarring and made my skin very soft.</li>
            <li> I felt a bit of stinging at first, but then with some other black soap I felt the same thing.</li>
            <li> i cant really say if its making my skin any better since i dont check every single day and keep record of if its doing good or bad, but it hasnt gotten bad either.</li>
            <li> I have clear skin now due to habits and this soap helped.</li>
            <li> My 3 yr old son has extreme excema.</li>
            <li> If washing directly with the bar scrapes, and cuts will occur              Melts faster than an other bar soap I had</li>
            <li> WE HAVE OTHER NATURAL SOAPS</li>
            <li> definitely not pretty soap but wanted to try something natural.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not supporting those companies anymore and decided to use an all natural soap that is also not tested on animals or made from animals.</li>
            <li> I have a lot of hyperpigmentation from adult acne (possibly due to hormones) and they are fading away.  </li>
            <li> Initially i was using emu oil but decided to change to something less expensive, natural and more bang for your buck...</li>
            <li> I live in Montana where the winters can be brutal on one&#x27;s skin and this soap gives me hope that I won&#x27;t experience the extreme dryness that I have experienced without it.</li>
            <li> But I can&#x27;t bare to have dry skin!</li>
            <li> Quality and lasts for about a month with regular use..Be mindful not to leave the bar sitting in water or it will not last long at all..</li>
            <li> This is a natural product and my first order, which was non-refundable, was almost outdated when I received it.  </li>
            <li> I had a very weak moisturizer initially and noticed that it wasn&#x27;t strong hydrating my skin.</li>
            <li> No more cystic lesions, only fine pimples, no more scarring.</li>
            <li> The little bumps on my upper arms are virtually gone, a blemish above my lip that would not go away (even with prodding and an \\&quot;ultra-sonic\\&quot; face cleaner) has flattened, faded and is nearly gone.    </li>
            <li> I have been hearing about black soap to help with skin problems, so I finally purchased some for my son and it is doing wonders to clear his face.</li>
            <li> I now bathe with the soap daily but exfoliate only twice a week because I have dry skin.</li>
            <li> I stopped using regular store shops a while ago and find black soap to be an affordable and natural alternative.</li>
            <li> I have also used this on my face before to control mild acne, but it made it worse because It was overdrying my facial skin which caused an overproduction of oil.</li>
            <li> I have to say there is a little tingle I get sometimes on little sensitive areas on my face, so a little heads up for someone with sensitive skin, but overall I really like this soap</li>
            <li> The first pack I ordered through Amazon about 6 months ago was kinda icky.</li>
            <li> so it will leave a dark residue in your tub or shower when you are done so cleaning the tub or shower directly after every use is a must.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other black soaps and they stained my sponges and after I took a shower I would have to quickly wipe the bottom of the tub with my foot or the black streaks would stain and stay until I actually took the time to scrub it with a sponge.</li>
            <li> She has sensitive skin and can only use a few products and I&#x27;m the opposite.</li>
            <li> and I don&#x27;t know how long I will continue to use it on my face because of the problems outlined in the next paragraph.</li>
            <li> Also the soap itself it didn&#x27;t really last that long.</li>
            <li> The soap is long lasting.  </li>
            <li> The second bar lasted probably twice as long doing this.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t last so long</li>
            <li> Be warned it stings in some regions if left on for too long.</li>
            <li> /&gt;One bar will last a long time.  </li>
            <li> Long lasting, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not completely gotten rid of acne, but it&#x27;s definitely pulling its weight.</li>
            <li> My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this dried out since I stopped using normal store brand</li>
            <li> Since this soap clears up breakout, fades scars or blemishes, makes your skin glow, and creates an environment for softness- who wouldn&#x27;t be willing to invest in a thick greedy lotion and cover themselves!!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick and has a earthy smell, no fake perfume/imitation smell .</li>
            <li> : you must be careful to keep soap bar dry after using, since it gets mushy and melts if you leave it wet, and it also will dry your skin out too much if you over-use it.</li>
            <li> The little red bumps I used to get stopped appearing completely.  </li>
            <li> It actually made my face really dry.</li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin, give Shea Moisture Black Bar Soap a try, it worked for me.</li>
            <li> After thoroughly cleansing out my face, the irritation stopped, and it never left my skin dry to crack (</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin, this might not be the product for you because it has made my skin itch slightly, but after two coats of Dial 7 Day moisturizing lotion, the itch has faded.</li>
            <li> There are some black spots on my boyfriend&#x27;s face, he keeps using this soap for few month, those black spots turning light.</li>
            <li> I was ordering this soap from another source and was paying $5.00 per bar, so needless to say I&#x27;m totally happy that I found in on Amazon saving approximately $15 on each 6 pack I purchase.  </li>
            <li> &amp; I keep it out side the shower on the toilet.</li>
            <li> It is super irritating.  </li>
            <li> Buy back feels like has expired as very old and the packaging has been far from complete i‘m so sad</li>
            <li> When using as a total body wash it puts a major ring around he tub, but then again it is black soap.</li>
            <li> The smell is over powering at first, but once you use it a few times it dies down.</li>
            <li> which is #1 which really cleans, is fragrant with hard texture to last a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> which is #1 which really cleans, is fragrant with hard texture to last a long time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It is ready right out of the box and won&#x27;t require any tinkering, cutting, or solidifying.  </li>
            <li> Like my face would get too dry, but the key that I&#x27;ve found from my experience is not to leave it on my face too long.</li>
            <li> One bar will last you a very long time!</li>
            <li> and I have this soap on a hanging organizer, where the water has dripped from the soap it cleared a path through the soap scum, yet gentle enough to not leave my skin dry.</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s been prescribed steroid cream, antibiotics, topical creams and various other types of medicines.....</li>
            <li> On the other hand, I&#x27;ve been taking one of the white washcloths I use only for my face</li>
            <li> It did to me a little, but I think it was all those old clogged pores that needed to be cleaned anyway.  </li>
            <li> If you have sensitive skin stay clear of this stuff because it will seriously damage your skin.  </li>
            <li> In the end I went back to my old black soap as it really didn&#x27;t do anything other that leave really hard stains in my soap dish.</li>
            <li> Due to skin reactions to Commercial soaps I typically purchase soaps with Natural ingredients .My</li>
            <li> Leaves skin so soft compared to other black soaps and god forbid using dove or Irish spring.</li>
            <li> This soap is nice and creamy and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad</li>
            <li> Soap smells nice but my skin had a bad reaction to the fragrance in the soap</li>
            <li> I wanted something to help close my pores and I had tried all of the expensive stuff at the cosmetics counters and all of the cleansers, masks, toners, exfolliants and peels available at the drug store.</li>
            <li> It sucks cause it was really working for my acne.</li>
            <li> I have never had anything like this before and to say the least it made me very upset.</li>
            <li> came across this stuff and it didn&#x27;t work for me, didn&#x27;t clear up my acne and still dried out my skin.</li>
            <li> up well, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> It can go there, but don&#x27;t let it stay long because it will start to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> you don&#x27;t need to scrub your face that long.</li>
            <li> so you have to cover it up and not let water run on it too long</li>
            <li> but it lasts a really long time and</li>
            <li> this review was soo long</li>
            <li> The individual boxes of bars were stuck together and the cardboard appeared to have gotten wet or oily or something.</li>
            <li> and it takes a long time for my scars to go away.  </li>
            <li> Each bar lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> If you get a bump on your face, wet your finger, rub it on the soap and simple cover the pimple or bump.</li>
            <li> All of which nearly chemically burned my face or dried it out to the point where my skin would crack and bleed no matter</li>
            <li> My face hasn&#x27;t been this moisturized after washing in so long.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a really sensitive person, to anything.  </li>
            <li> LASTS A LONG TIME TOO</li>
            <li> I have three long scratch marks on my leg, which irritated me all day.</li>
            <li> I had something strange happen to my skin and was rather embarrassed, too embarrassed to go see a dermatologist.</li>
            <li> you won&#x27;t want to leave it on your skin for long</li>
            <li> Lasts fairly long - lathers</li>
            <li> Have been using it for years and it lasts long too.</li>
            <li> But then looking in the mirror I haven&#x27;t seen the results, and as more time past I&#x27;ve been getting worse breakouts.  </li>
            <li> it did not clear my acne at all....</li>
            <li> The first few times of using this sopa it can seem harsh and may seem drying but with continued use you will notice softer glowing skin.</li>
            <li> All natural black soap!  </li>
            <li> I used to live in a upper apartment and my drain began getting slow (1940&#x27;s house, sewer system, root issues).</li>
            <li> Since the soap is all natural and handmade, you do get a little variation in strength sometimes, One batch we got was a little stronger than the rest, but that is to be expected by all natural handmade items.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this soap via a vendor but my mom purchased this soap while she was overseas, since I asked for a generic African black soap.  </li>
            <li> Scracthing them when they itched made them take alomost forever to heal and well they did left literally big black marks that stood out from a distance.</li>
            <li> THE DERMATOLOGIST SAID IT WAS MELASMA &amp; WAS HERITITARY, MY HERITAGE IS BLACK, CHEROKEE, FRENCH &amp; IRISH.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s reminiscent of the smell of black soap (obviously) but fruity.  </li>
            <li> Helped a little but certainly removes oil from your skin need to lotion afterwards or else you in trouble</li>
            <li> That is SO unnecessary, and seems an affected authenticity--like, \\&quot;It&#x27;s called black soap, so make sure it looks black and turns water brown!\\&quot;    Pros</li>
            <li> I was hoping this soap would be gentle like a few other brands i have tried of African black</li>
            <li> My skin does not feel dry as long as a type of lotion is applied after shower.</li>
            <li> I am a burn survivor that has had a problem with dry skin for a long time.  </li>
            <li> I still have apparent melisma after a half year of using it...😞</li>
            <li> My only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t last long, it becomes a little slimy and melty, not like triple-milled soap.</li>
            <li> And based upon the other reviews, I&#x27;ve started using it for a facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> Since we started using this soap, we have not gone back to any other soap.</li>
            <li> I purchase regularly, about every other month.</li>
            <li> I gave up after using 2 bars and left the other 2 in my cabinet and forgot about it.</li>
            <li> I use the duduosun diluted gel in the shower over entire body (every other day)then chase it with coca butter soap then a bath oil during winter.</li>
            <li> Have gotten several other people to try it, and now they are hooked on it, too.</li>
            <li> This soap definitely seems like it will last me for a while and a little goes a long way!</li>
            <li> My son who is 15 and should be getting major pimples by now has little or none and his skin tone is even as is mine.</li>
            <li> The only downside is it smells a little different than I am used to, but there is no fragrance after I get out of the shower.</li>
            <li> This soap didn&#x27;t turn me red at all like other soaps do.</li>
            <li> Have recommended it to several other people.</li>
            <li> and I only put vaseline on my feet: with other soaps the vaseline never had this effect.</li>
            <li> I will be using this soap for a long time!</li>
            <li> Other reviewers have noted that this soap will stain white washcloths, so I use darker colored washcoths with this soap.  </li>
            <li> Perhaps this is a psychological attraction due to</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s the only soap I can use on my face that doesn&#x27;t break me out and actually stops any small blimishes that are starting.  </li>
            <li> At fist it burned a little an left red rashy areas on my face.</li>
            <li> Caustic alkaline soaps have a very high potential for skin irritation.</li>
            <li> It is a raw soap and there are pieces in the soap that can scratch your skin if you rub it directly onto yourself.</li>
            <li> and I no longer have problems with dry scalp.  </li>
            <li> and it leaves your skin squeaky clean...and it leaves your skin dry</li>
            <li> My daughter has severly dry skin</li>
            <li> My son had alot of dry patches.</li>
            <li> On the flip side, it does dry out my skin but lotion</li>
            <li> and my skin would be dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Does not leave skin feeling overly dry.</li>
            <li> My face is clearing up and isn&#x27;t dry at all you can fill the difference</li>
            <li> but they still dry my skin.</li>
            <li> Won&#x27;t over dry you.</li>
            <li> I bought 1 bar of this soap, hoping it would help with my acne and dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> I will say that it does dry out my sking.  </li>
            <li> I like to keep this soap dry after use as it leaves a brown stain.</li>
            <li> Well, my skin was smoother after a week but on my daughter, her skin tended to go a bit dry.</li>
            <li> I use when I shave my head, helps stop the razor bumbs , also bathe with it to help with dry skin itching.</li>
            <li> I like this soap even though it does dry your skin.</li>
            <li> Works on dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;5.</li>
            <li> pat your face dry</li>
            <li> and after I use this, the skin is dry and itchy</li>
            <li> My skin itched and felt dry and cracked.  </li>
            <li> my body was squeaky dry</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s oily, it&#x27;s about to break out in an itchy rash.  </li>
            <li> My skin tend to be dry and itchy during the winter.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave a filmy oily residue.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out after bathing</li>
            <li> Our skin can look ashy when dry and because Dudu Osun is not drying, it has reduced our lotion use.  </li>
            <li> It will dry your skin out</li>
            <li> Also, this soap should be kept in a dry soap dish after use because it does melt.</li>
            <li> even in dry, winter months.</li>
            <li> After 2 days of use, my skin was dry, scaly, and itchy as hell.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Storage is a MUST IN A DRY PLACE, I bought a soap box from target .99 .&lt;br</li>
            <li> So yes, it leaves my face a bit dry</li>
            <li> It will dry it up and get rid of the imperfection.</li>
            <li> you have a dry skin problem, give this soap a try.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;She was amazed when she saw the difference of my skin not being so dry and cracking.&lt;br</li>
            <li> The glue had been dry for a couple of hours</li>
            <li> I have dry skin</li>
            <li> My son uses it for his dry skin and it works so well.</li>
            <li> I do recommend using lotion after you wash if you have dry skin</li>
            <li> FOR YOUR SKIN, DOESN&#x27;T DRY IT OUT.  </li>
            <li> It helps with my dry eczema patches and I never feel itchy afterwards</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin</li>
            <li> and this helps dry it out.</li>
            <li> It helps your skin but can dry skin if you use it every day.  </li>
            <li> but this soap makes them dry up and virtually erase them.</li>
            <li> One drawback is the is disintegrates rapidly if not kept dry in a soap box.</li>
            <li> However, it leaves my skin horribly dry.</li>
            <li> It does dry out your skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend this to anyone from oily to dry skin types.</li>
            <li> Keep it in a dry soap dish..</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  </li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I wanted help with my dry skin and acne, and it has worked the way I thought it would.</li>
            <li> Before lotion couldn&#x27;t even help my dry skin.</li>
            <li> The only problem is That its messy and it can dry out ur skin, but just dont use it for 2 days an then go back</li>
            <li> My boyfriend said his face wasn&#x27;t dry like prior products he had tried  for his acne and was very similar to the dead sea mud soaps.  </li>
            <li> tea tree soap on his skin ESPECIALLY when he has active bed sores.</li>
            <li> i have also notice no new acne popping up</li>
            <li> Seriously, five days later she called me and said, \\&quot;I can not Thank You enough\\&quot; and her RASH is completely GONE!</li>
            <li> so I am limited to acne medication.</li>
            <li> It is a little messy, but well worth the trouble.</li>
            <li> *The only bad thing I can think of is Do Not use White or light colored wash cloths they will get stained.</li>
            <li> This soap lathers better for shampoo but stings as a body wash and has an unpleasant smell.</li>
            <li> Love the smell and confused about how dirty I really am with the rinse water.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s is not safe to use in sensitive areas as she said it balances pH etc.</li>
            <li> And since I can&#x27;t just let things be, I picked them and left dark marks on my skin.</li>
            <li> Exfoliants remove dead skin cells, which clears pores, allows hair follicles to grow, and generally promotes skin health.</li>
            <li> My acne stopped immediately, my skin feels healthier, and my dark spots are starting to fade</li>
            <li> I use this even for my face and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out AT ALL - and I have very dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Those were easily covered up by makeup, but I&#x27;m getting kinda sick of wearing makeup and having those marks in general.</li>
            <li> It gives a fantastic clean that means I can skip one day without a shower and not feel absolutely disgusting like I used to.</li>
            <li> I tried the Dudu Osun Black Soap as soon as it arrived [because I was recently having trouble with my unfortunate delicate skin breaking out] and all I can say is that I&#x27;m delighted that I made this discovery.</li>
            <li> After several other options Bingo!</li>
            <li> Also I&#x27;ve tried several other black soaps which have dried out my xtra oily African American skin.</li>
            <li> I normally buy the raw black soap</li>
            <li> I use AFB along with Shea Butter and the two work very well together, I especially love use them together it cold weather and the cold air really dries out my skin badly.</li>
            <li> The soap really is lovely, but I&#x27;m afraid people who are sensitive to fragrance would have serious issues with it.</li>
            <li> I recommend for anyone who has oily and dry skin and acne problems!</li>
            <li> I have ordered a pound of african black soap from Ghana which does not contain lemon juice</li>
            <li> I started using the black soap and it instantly cleared up my skin.</li>
            <li> I had to return to using Shea Moisture African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and did a bit of research on african black soap</li>
            <li> No lightening effect at all in black african skin</li>
            <li> I would recommend Shea Moisture African Black Soap instead.</li>
            <li> Not all black soaps are made equal.</li>
            <li> But I think that&#x27;s how African black soap is.</li>
            <li> The soap is also slightly drying, so I would suggest using a facial and body moisturizer with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This black soap has definitely helped fade my acne scarring.</li>
            <li> and it is not really for dry skin.</li>
            <li> So be careful if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Fortunately, I finally found Dudu Osun Black Soap.  </li>
            <li> The only downfall is that it IS black soap.</li>
            <li> Dudu Osun Black Soap is the only soap in my bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> African castor oil (or the Haitian one) , black soaps...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always had acne prone skin since I was a teenager, and it&#x27;s not until I started using various brands of black soap that it started clearing up.  </li>
            <li> &quot; And she told me she&#x27;d been using some black soap from the local farmers market.</li>
            <li> I have now stocked up on black soap for future breakouts and to maintain my skin.</li>
            <li> Is white soap for white people and black soap for black people?  </li>
            <li> Three years ago while on vacation and browsing in a store in that carried African products, we discovered Dudu-Osun Black soap.  </li>
            <li> I started using it all over my body, and it cleared up the small red bumps I got on my shoulders and back.  </li>
            <li> I buy Dudu Osun Black Soap from African grocery stores for $2-$2.50 per bar.</li>
            <li> Actually prefer it to my usual Dermalogica facial cleanser.  </li>
            <li> My face was getting pretty durn terrible and now it is doing a lot better.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap at a local black arts festival, in Denver, CO.</li>
            <li> I will no longer go back to the facial products I was using in the past.</li>
            <li> COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT!</li>
            <li> Also, I get very dry and itchy skin every winter because of the heated air.</li>
            <li> In just a week she know longer had very dry skin.</li>
            <li> Makes a brown drippy mess because of the color and can look gross if you don&#x27;t know where the residue is from.</li>
            <li> little gritty [personal preference, it&#x27;s not super noticeable and if you are looking for exfoliation this could be a pro]&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have oily clear skin on my face and slight acne on my shoulders with a few scratches/ scars here and there from playing basketball.  </li>
            <li> which does mean the bar doesn&#x27;t last as long as traditional soap does...</li>
            <li> I purchased initially for my face due to hormonal acne changes &amp; dark spots.</li>
            <li> That seems like common sense, but I had never heard of African Black Soap or properly researched it prior.</li>
            <li> The package looks a little different this time</li>
            <li> I have noticed my eczema not totally clearing up but fading a little.</li>
            <li> but I think it helped a little with my stretch marks, but that could be because it lightened my skin and my stretch marks are white</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve decided to give it a 3 star instead of a 2 star because maybe that is being a little too critical.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s been a little over 2 weeks, and I can see definite improvement in their skin.</li>
            <li> and it burns a little especially on my face.</li>
            <li> All i have is a couple of little red bumps that go away after a couple of days.</li>
            <li> Every other soap leaves a dry feeling but not this one.</li>
            <li> I breakout easily when I travel (I know, weird huh?!).</li>
            <li> but that is only due to the black color of the soap, All in all, I will be reordering.</li>
            <li> There are lots of other African black soaps out there.</li>
            <li> I am very dark skinned and - for those of you in the know - that means ash central after showering...</li>
            <li> This dried up my skin so bad my skin actually started to overcompensate by producing more oil-</li>
            <li> If you have sensitive or delicate skin it might be a bit too dehydrating or irritable for your skin.</li>
            <li> However, the wet bar of soap dripped brown liquid in my soap dish, which wiped off effortlessly.</li>
            <li> We started using the soap because my husband would have rough skin after shaving.</li>
            <li> I think this is partially my fault because I might have over exfoliated.</li>
            <li> (there&#x27;s some rough particles in this soap that can scratch you).</li>
            <li> so be careful.</li>
            <li> My husband doesn&#x27;t need to pat at all, but his skin will get red for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
            <li> it has rough pieces that help to exfoliate the skin.  </li>
            <li> I have used this product as an all-over body soap and in the art studio where I am constantly in contact with harsh paints, solvents, etc.</li>
            <li> have tried all the drug store lotions and body washes and spent tons of money.  </li>
            <li> Arrived promptly but not the quality I expected.</li>
            <li> I just get my hair wet and lather the bar into my head.</li>
            <li> It wasn&#x27;t a rough period that you just have to get over.</li>
            <li> ...im not really too sure.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I just have a few pimples around my chin that are getting smaller day by day.  </li>
            <li> Spent thousands on my son&#x27; acne.</li>
            <li> Only a few days into it</li>
            <li> It looks like poop and is called &amp;#34;dudu&amp;#34; so that&#x27;s either a plus or a minus</li>
            <li> and I wet it.</li>
            <li> I had expected my wash cloths to get stained but has not been the case.</li>
            <li> I suspect that I will have the skin I used to have (before quitting birth control) in the next few weeks.</li>
            <li> What the---??!\\&quot; There is no redness, no soreness- which makes sense because I did absolutely no scrubbing, but my goodness.</li>
            <li> It is a rough soap - meaning there is a grit like substance in it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not really an odorous person to begin with</li>
            <li> But when I wasn&#x27;t careful about flushing with water, it hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Sulfur soap with Dead Sea salts (such as what Jericho and Adovia offer) tends to be acidic when combined with water.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re careful about flushing with water and don&#x27;t mind getting a separate exfoliant, it should serve you well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li> I&#x27;m curious to see her review.</li>
            <li> absolutely NO &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34</li>
            <li> When I stopped using it my face became rough after a while.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I didnt learn of AFB as a teenager and young adult.  </li>
            <li> Going all natural slowly and this helps the process.</li>
            <li> and wow, after a week of using this soap on my arm, the bumps started to slowly go away..</li>
            <li> The only black soap I buy!</li>
            <li> but personally I will not purchase this black soap again!</li>
            <li> It will dry up minor acne after a few washes.</li>
            <li> she  still has flare ups but not large acne.</li>
            <li> but they are soo right when they say it leaves worse scarring when you touch your face!</li>
            <li> I am a victim of acne, so I was skeptical at first.</li>
            <li> This soap is very harsh on your skin not only does it severly dry your skin out to the point where it begins to itch</li>
            <li> Should black people say they are black when they review Ivory Soap and white people</li>
            <li> case worker as well took down the information on this soap and will be passing it along to other clients that have been severely burned and have to deal with severe dry skin</li>
            <li> My boyfriend has sun damaged skin and has noticed that his skin is less dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> Not only have I not experienced a single breakout while using this soap, my face is softer and noticeably less oily, and I find myself needing to powder my nose less frequently throughout the day.</li>
            <li> The only down side to the soap is that its a bit messy.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way</li>
            <li> , I like it, I may try some other brands of black soap to see if they last a little longer.</li>
            <li> recently they have been so bad, im pregnant</li>
            <li> The only downfall with it is you may want to keep it in a soap dish because it can be messy because of the black color.</li>
            <li> My skin feels tight and dry post-wash, so I moisturize immediately after.</li>
            <li> I am hoping this soap would lighten them up and the other scars on my face</li>
            <li> With other moisturizers I would get home from being out in the out</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t get that slimy feeling that other soaps leave.</li>
            <li> OTHER ITEMS-</li>
            <li> IT WAS NOT DRYING LIKE OTHER &amp;#34;BAR SOAPS&amp;#34;</li>
            <li> IT DOES SOME OTHER &amp;#34;CLAIMS&amp;#34</li>
            <li> SO PAY IT FORWARD TO OTHER</li>
            <li> SO PAY IT FORWARD TO OTHER</li>
            <li> When I finally bought a 4 pack and tested it, it was so harsh on my skin!</li>
            <li> I put a box in every other closet and the underwear/sock drawers.</li>
            <li> I use the dudu every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW:</li>
            <li> I use the dudu every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW:</li>
            <li> After I washed my face with it the first time I freaked because because it tingled uncomfortably, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting that, so I thought I might be allergic.</li>
            <li> but I find that even if I don&#x27;t, my skin doesn&#x27;t overproduce oil to compensate like it used to with other products.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I currently use this soap but I was usually paying $4-5 for each bar.</li>
            <li> (I didn&#x27;t realize that all the other soaps I&#x27;ve used leave residue until trying this), and it lasts longer than other</li>
            <li> that maybe they are not consistent with their batches</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had problems with other fragrances</li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t solve all of my life problems like the other reviews had me believe.</li>
            <li> Yes I wil tell other about the soap.</li>
            <li> , I was out with a friend the other night</li>
            <li> I am 30 and have acne prone skin due to PCOS.</li>
            <li> After using the soap all over my body I had an extreme burning feeling on my face and arms...</li>
            <li> so I know its due to the combo I described above.&lt;br /&gt;Just</li>
            <li> from other reviews they say that this soap has an almost instantaneous effect.</li>
            <li> Just as I expected!</li>
            <li> My husband and I won&#x27;t use any other soap now.</li>
            <li> hope that some of this helps to clarify the sometimes conflicting comments from other reviewers.enerally promotes skin health.</li>
            <li> hope that some of this helps to clarify the sometimes conflicting comments from other reviewers.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and experience hormonal breakouts quite often.</li>
            <li> I even began using it once every other day</li>
            <li> other&#x27;s claim to remove impurities from your skin</li>
            <li> wouldnt wash my body with any other soap...</li>
            <li> Other &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; soaps are not even close to this product.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t aggrevate my husband&#x27;s eczema like other soaps.</li>
            <li> A warning: This soap can cause embarrassing moments when you visit other peoples houses and use their showers, because it is a charcoal soap it leaves brown/black stuff in the shower</li>
            <li> I have given this soap to my 21 year old niece who suffers from facial and back acne</li>
            <li> I decided to try other products.</li>
            <li> I do not even purchase any other soap now.</li>
            <li> It replaced all other soaps I use, even shampoo.</li>
            <li> It can be drying at times, but I use a small amount of vitamin e oil (cococare 100% vitamin e oil) on my face after using this and it restores the moisture back into my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 23 and still get small breakouts sometimes on my back too</li>
            <li> But other than that, my skin is clearer than it has ever been.</li>
            <li> I will never use other soaps again.</li>
            <li> but I believe you have to continuously use it in other to see the changes.</li>
            <li> That tight feeling I usually feel after I shower and lotion is barely there.</li>
            <li> a little goes a very long way.</li>
            <li> My skin still feels a little dry, but a bit of lotion is all that is needed.</li>
            <li> i found out about this years ago eczema really scars the skin so far the breakouts are not severe and the itching is not as bad either.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s quite dry and has an uneven tone, with no acne.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products I can use on my face that doesn&#x27;t dry it out.</li>
            <li> I started using this because a lot of soaps have heavy scents which make me itch and dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> It rinses brown like you had covered yourself in dirt and rinsed it off and the soap just absolutely REEKS, my entire bathrooms stinks of the stuff.</li>
            <li> My goodness, when I woke up I noticed my face was not very oily (nor dry) as it usually is but also, the pimples had reduced in size and redness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other black soaps but this brand  doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of other ingredients and fragrance</li>
            <li> I have moderate/severe cystic acne and while I don&#x27;t think this soap has not cured my acne, I think it has helped fade the red marks and scars left behind by previous breakouts.</li>
            <li> The texture when wet is a little scratchy</li>
            <li> I have found that when used on my face to help with mild acne, it tends to dry my skin out BADLY.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s probably actually less drying than other soaps.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t seem to be like the other black soaps that melt after 1 weeks usage.</li>
            <li> to compare with other black soaps.</li>
            <li> I have tried other black soaps, and none have the quality of this brand.  </li>
            <li> As bad as the sound of its name or the ragged look of it.</li>
            <li> but I still get bad back acne, I used one bar of this so far and almost 90% of back acne is gone</li>
            <li> Also, despite the ash content (that gives it its dark color), it didn&#x27;t stain my bathtub nor washcloths.</li>
            <li> It has also gradually lightened the dark spots I had from acne.</li>
            <li> I have stretch marks from my son and dark spots on my face which this soap has also cleared up.</li>
            <li> it also evens out your skin tone, but it won&#x27;t fade dark acne scars.</li>
            <li> giving it it&#x27;s dark appearance.</li>
            <li> My skin is brighter, cleaner, and my dark spots has lightened after 2 uses.</li>
            <li> just hope it can help me with dark marks</li>
            <li> Imagine their shock at finding a dark brown bar of soap named \\&quot;Dudu\\&quot; in the shower.</li>
            <li> Dark spots have faded and my skin is just glowing from within.</li>
            <li> It has eliminated my dark spots and keeps bumps away.</li>
            <li> So I suggest using dark ones.</li>
            <li> * Encourages me to moisturize (This baby is not your average soap.</li>
            <li> You will look ashy if you&#x27;re dark.</li>
            <li> I STARTED GETTING DARK BROWN SPOTS</li>
            <li> There was only 2 negative reviews</li>
            <li> This soap is dark brown</li>
            <li> my skin tone is caramel and with the dark spots and breakouts i have had</li>
            <li> At least it convinced me to stay with my current soap.</li>
            <li> I even use it on my face which has been ridding me of dark spots and redness.</li>
            <li> Been using it for the past few days, and my stubborn acne is starting to vanish.</li>
            <li> I took one star off, as it does nothing for my dark marks.</li>
            <li> If you are suffering from body acne or dark spots, this soap is what you need.  </li>
            <li> addition, there was no noted improvement in my skin, so the negatives were not worth suffering for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It did improve my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Also this soap can leave a dark residue on your tiles so try to keep it contained in the shower.</li>
            <li> Only complaint is I don&#x27;t care for the scent--</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the color which can leave something looking stained when it is placed on them(my soapbox holder).</li>
            <li> Also may leave dark marks where you store it, so I would recommend a soap dish reserved for this product.  </li>
            <li> I have some dark spots on my face from pregnancy, and have noticed them fading.</li>
            <li> I have noticed dark acne spots getting lighter.</li>
            <li> I have problem with dark spots and blotches.  </li>
            <li> After using this soap for a week, I can&#x27;t say I LOVE this soap, but I can&#x27;t say I hate this soap, either.  </li>
            <li> , I don&#x27;t know product is good or not, but package was very awful and dissappointed.</li>
            <li> This soap splashes little gray dots on your shower wall and you stand in a puddle of what looks like dirty water while you use it but without even trying to clean it, by the end of the shower, every dark mark is gone!</li>
            <li> I have used the regular black soap and green alcohol in the past to atleast control my breakouts.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Beware of this product as it is very different from the typical stuff you find a health food stores (at least in San Francisco bay area).</li>
            <li> I do not want brown water streaming down my arms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s down to a state that I can tolerate and not feel self-concious about.</li>
            <li> After you use this, swipe your hand down your arm or leg to remove excess water and discover your hand does not slide down.</li>
            <li> and then everything went down hill</li>
            <li> So, I eventually came down to Dudu-Osun.</li>
            <li> and I was a little nervous about trying this soap after reading the other reviews.  </li>
            <li> But other than that, and it being a little pricy</li>
            <li> I use them for everrrryyything, shower related, not everything everything, I mean like face and body weirdos.</li>
            <li> However this may be because it is so moisturizing (I am no &amp;#34;soap-expert&amp;#34; but some other moisturizing soaps I have tried have been a little melty, too).</li>
            <li> For the past two weeks, my face has been dry and tender.  </li>
            <li> I believe they were melasma patches(thanks to birth control pills) that were dark gray and almost black patches along the sides of my mouth.</li>
            <li> Leaves a lot of dark mess on the sink.</li>
            <li> Also the little breakouts I would get on my shoulder and behind my triceps has started to clear up.  </li>
            <li> but I on the other hand did have a few breakouts.</li>
            <li> I also have some sparse, very small, clogged sebaceous glands in various areas on my face (forehead/chin).</li>
            <li> Not right away but a little after.  </li>
            <li> Kind of weird how it looks like dirty water and bubbles as you lather,</li>
            <li> but it does have a slight medicated smell.</li>
            <li> If you have a less reactive soap, I suggest you purchase some.  </li>
            <li> , I used this soap for less than a week .</li>
            <li> I also break out less often and less severely than before</li>
            <li> One reviewer said she was told that the black in the name refers to it being for black people....</li>
            <li> What, did they add black dye to the soap?    </li>
            <li> My used to be always oily skin that would get blackheads and breakouts became my dryish skin that only gets small ever-fading nose blackheads and a couple small zits.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it now for a month and a half</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about 3 months and have seen less Rosacea breakouts then before.</li>
            <li> I like this black soap a lot.  </li>
            <li> BUT NON CAN COMPARE TO THIS BLACK SOAP.  </li>
            <li> I was hoping this would be comparable to Alaffia&#x27;s black soap, which I use as body wash and shampoo.</li>
            <li> Try Nubian Heritage Black Soap instead.</li>
            <li> I did a lot of research on black soap before deciding on this one.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think I will ever stop using black soap now that I&#x27;ve tried it.</li>
            <li> I notice that my under arm odor is less smelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The existing soaps and body washes we have in the linen closet will be given to a shelter and replaced with the Black Soap.</li>
            <li> tried, and I ordered, recevied, gave my friends who are black and yello skin.  </li>
            <li> They all like Dudu Osun Black Soap.</li>
            <li> I noticed I use less foundation.</li>
            <li> He has less itching and scratching.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dudu-Osun black soap for years now</li>
            <li> It turns everything black</li>
            <li> I have been using DuDu Osun Black soap for about 5months now.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black soap...</li>
            <li> The smell is something you have to get used to and the black dye gets all over the place.  </li>
            <li> I recommend Nubian Heritage black soap over this.</li>
            <li> I used to have slight break outs</li>
            <li> Dudu Osun Black Soap</li>
            <li> I have small blackheads on my nose, small bumps in my t-zone area, and under my eyes called milia (possibly from concealer that contains oil).</li>
            <li> but I feel a slight tingle in the crevasses around my nostrils after sudsing up.</li>
            <li> and I noticed when I use this on my face in the morning, that day my face looks less shiny.</li>
            <li> this stuff can be smelled half a mile away.</li>
            <li> I even have my daughters and grandchildren using Black soap.</li>
            <li> Yes, the bar is black so it can turn things brown that it touches</li>
            <li> My mother put me on to \\&quot;black soap\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> or so I decided to purchase black soap</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s turning my skin black.</li>
            <li> of course it had a burning sensation as do all black folks</li>
            <li> Chemical exfoliants are typically acidic (e.g., alpha hydroxy acid).</li>
            <li> Chemical exfoliants are typically acidic (e.g., alpha hydroxy acid).</li>
            <li> a nurse friend of mine told me to try this black soap because her co worker who has psoriasis and the soap help get rid of them.  </li>
            <li> Is it because the soap is black or because it&#x27;s made in Nigeria?  </li>
            <li> and I can feel the slight burning).</li>
            <li> The soap turns everything in contact with black (body, shower, towels).  </li>
            <li> I recommended the black soap to her.</li>
            <li> I use Dudu Osun Black Soap as a bath soap.</li>
            <li> I tried liquid black soap but nothing compared to my bar.  </li>
            <li> I will be using this Black soap for life..</li>
            <li> I previously used Clinique 3 step system.</li>
            <li> After a few tries, I came to the conclusion that it was just too harsh for my face, and used it on my body instead.</li>
            <li> The black soap helped my friend&#x27;s boyfriend with his eczema.</li>
            <li> once you go black..</li>
            <li> :B000TAE0RK Dudu Osun Black Soap, 6-Count]]</li>
            <li> Maybe the black spots will go away hopefully.</li>
            <li> all black soaps leaves the shower looking</li>
            <li> all black soaps leaves the shower looking</li>
            <li> Clears face in less than a week.</li>
            <li> It depends on your skin type but for me I put a very small amount of it on my face, if not my face can get a little red and look like I got a face lift.</li>
            <li> It doesnt over dry my face if I dont push down too hard</li>
            <li> When it washes off your skin it looks a little brown when you see it go down the drain.</li>
            <li> and I have dark circles that are almost all gone after a few weeks of us.</li>
            <li> In order to get the maximum results, rinse your face with cold water, because if you rinse it with hot water it will burn.</li>
            <li> There was though about a month purging period where I broke out like crazy along my jaw line when first using this soap.</li>
            <li> The problem with this, is the mess.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product but was disappointed by the fact that 4 of them had damaged packaging and were practically opened.</li>
            <li> so he&#x27;s a pretty dirty guy.</li>
            <li> skin does feel a little dryer after use than typical soap.</li>
            <li> started using it a little less than a year ago.....</li>
            <li> or you are going to waste your money as the soap goes down the drain.</li>
            <li> I have learned that you do need a moisturizer when using it will leave your face tight.</li>
            <li> so I bought for her, she said, do not quit after washing the face tight.</li>
            <li> product itself is shipped tightly package in a sealed bag with box</li>
            <li> I was so terrified I had that tight filmy residue feeling to my skin.</li>
            <li> It was before I added lotion, my skin was no longer tight or had that residue feeling.</li>
            <li> These bleeding patches heeled after a week but left dark splotches behind.</li>
            <li> Smells to earthy, and not clean to me.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dudu Osun Black Soap everyday for six months now.</li>
            <li> It is a little weird to clean yourself with a soap that looks like dirty but not a big deal.</li>
            <li> The only down side would be the brown lather or residue it leaves behind in the shower or on the soap dish, it doesn&#x27;t stain or anything</li>
            <li> The way my skin feels after lathering up a wash rag and scrubbing down is inexplicable, you really have to feel it to understand it.    </li>
            <li> single complaint is that the soap contains \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;.</li>
            <li> I bought this, and Thayers Witch Hazel to use after it, and have been using both twice a day for a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> but just takes a little longer for me.</li>
            <li> I had a patch of little scabs on my nose.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for a little over a week</li>
            <li> I been using this product for 4 days now and my blemishes and dark spots are already fading!</li>
            <li> and if your face still feels a little stinging or irritated.</li>
            <li> my face has cleared up a little.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about a little over a month now and</li>
            <li> Also noticed that little marks on my legs from ingrown hairs were gone and my skin just looked glowy,</li>
            <li> so I decided to do just a little research.</li>
            <li> and it happened to me a little</li>
            <li> Whether soaps leave a little film on the tub or not, the bathtub NEEDS to be cleaned anyway</li>
            <li> I used this soap for a little over a month.  </li>
            <li> This soap is quite concentrated and a little goes</li>
            <li> Dries my skin a little, but it&#x27;s nothing some lotion can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> It helped out with my little acne breakouts.</li>
            <li> I had heard of &amp;#34;black soap&amp;#34; while in Florida and had tried it, but was a little pricey.  </li>
            <li> It is a little bit drying, but I think that is what does the trick to keep the breakouts at bay.  </li>
            <li> It dries my skin a little</li>
            <li> and I have seen a little improvement after the 5th use.</li>
            <li> but I didn&#x27;t a few times and after awhile that little tight feeling goes away if you don&#x27;t want</li>
            <li> I think I have found a replacement for the raw soap that I have to break down</li>
            <li> This soap can be a little drying  , I apply lotion after and would not recommend using this soap on children under 5yrs as it may be too harsh.  </li>
            <li> However, it&#x27;s a little harsh and I can feel my face tighten</li>
            <li> Also, it&#x27;s very dark</li>
            <li> family remarks that I smell like fresh baby powder after a shower, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing at all.</li>
            <li> This shipped crazy fast and expiration date</li>
            <li> My skin is in better condition than it has ever been and even though I didn&#x27;t have terrible skin issues, I had troubling rough areas and some stubborn whiteheads.</li>
            <li> Wasted of money.  </li>
            <li> I no longer go to the dermatologist b/c of this soap When I stop using this soap for a few weeks</li>
            <li> but it can be harsh and can scratch you</li>
            <li> It was chunky, had a smell I didn&#x27;t like as much, dried out my skin</li>
            <li> OILY UNEVEN COMPLEXTION,</li>
            <li> A BIT MESSY BUT</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s faded over a few days use because we are used to it &amp; use it how we need to.</li>
            <li> After a few days of use my skin or my nails couldn&#x27;t take anymore abuse.</li>
            <li> turned out to be a waste.</li>
            <li> I just wanted to get an all-natural soap for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I checked myself out after a few minutes</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few times and every time I do my skin</li>
            <li> I was tired of using all those synthetic soaps with all those chemicals and especially the ones used for animal testing.</li>
            <li> Then I rinse with a washcloth to get rid of dirt and dead skin</li>
            <li> Removes  the heavy underarm flim from deodorants,  husband</li>
            <li> It got a few chuckles.</li>
            <li> Note: I have eczema and this actually made it worse when I used it on my body</li>
            <li> and it wont be as harsh</li>
            <li> I bought the 3 pack to save a few bucks per bar figuring that I could always just use it as a shampoo or give it away if it somehow didn&#x27;t agree with my skin.</li>
            <li> It clears up every blemish and uneven tone within 24-48 hours.</li>
            <li> For couple of days it dried out my skin</li>
            <li> However, it really dried out my skin and caused some redness.  </li>
            <li> Around that time of the month,I still have a few spots pop up</li>
            <li> I have purchased this soap a few times.</li>
            <li> I would always follow up with a toner for you face though,especially if you use this everyday like I do.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a few Years now.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
            <li> You experience may vary, not cheap soap but</li>
            <li> Once I got out of the shower and dried off after about 2 minutes that feeling went away.</li>
            <li> Not even for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday for about 4 years now</li>
            <li> I literally cried tears of joys after having used this for a few days.</li>
            <li> With continued use, I had to wash my shower curtain every few days because this soap literally turned bottom of it</li>
            <li> ; went away a few days after using the soap.</li>
            <li> Use this everyday.</li>
            <li> I had a rash from some coconut oil body raps around my belly button and a few mosquito bites when i started using this</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ve turned quite a few people onto this.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t smell nice, it leaves nasty residues all over the shower, and it dried both mine and my boyfriend&#x27;s skin.</li>
            <li> she&#x27;s been seeing in Beverly Hills and show them that she&#x27;s been cured with just a few washes of this Black Soap!</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural soap (sick or buying 10 different product) &amp; saw this item along with reviews.</li>
            <li> I will specify I have cystic acne, scarring &amp; sun spots--this soap is initially harsh due to the lemon/lime oil (you have to desensitize yourself by using it for a few seconds &amp; washing it off every few days, then slowly increasing use, just like any acne product), but after you get used to it</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dudu-osun&#x27;s black soap for the past four months as a cleanser night and day.</li>
            <li> I told her you must try Black Soap by Dudu-Osun!</li>
            <li> Real black soap will not &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; a black dye into your water.</li>
            <li> Two less things to buy at the store!</li>
            <li> Because of this, the apples of my cheeks have turned a little raw with use.</li>
            <li> Other than the benzyl i use a turmeric mask at least 4 times a week which has drastically reduced the size of my acne and has helped to lighten the scars as well.</li>
            <li> other black soaps i use are like regular soaps - they leave a residue behind, which is why is used the green alcohol behind it.  </li>
            <li> The biggest thing you should know is that as dark soap, when it gets wet and then sits, it leaves behind a brown sticky goo.</li>
            <li> As such they can be caustic and corrosive although in small quantities this can be controlled.</li>
            <li> This soap is expensive and I saw no better performance on my manly skin compared to Dove or Old Spice.</li>
            <li> I am Asian, so whenever I have acne, it ALWAYS leaves an unattractive dark spot - so irritating!  </li>
            <li> This soap has a unique smell that is very hard to describe- not an unpleasant scent</li>
            <li> While walking down the street, a gentleman who looked similar to me approached me at random and said, \\&quot;Damn, I&#x27;m jealous,</li>
            <li> NOT TRUE!</li>
            <li> It is way to harsh on the skin even if you use very little.  </li>
            <li> I get pretty bad acne</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t feel like your covered with slick lotions and heavy perfumes.  </li>
            <li> I have been using this soap on my face AND body for the past few days.  </li>
            <li> This soap is lightening up my dark marks slowly drying up the bumps</li>
            <li> The brown suds a little scary but my bacne (back acne) is diminished.</li>
            <li> I usually follow it up with just a little bit of my ordinary bar soap and everything works itself out.</li>
            <li> I use this soap before I apply raw, unrefined shea butter to my face.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never in my life used a product and my skin burned and became raw until now.</li>
            <li> my face became raw.</li>
            <li> I always follow up with raw shea butter to moisturize my skin when I am done.  </li>
            <li> so I use this combo with raw shea butter</li>
            <li> This paired with Raw Ivory Shea Butter on my body and rosehip oil on my face</li>
            <li> even if u touched my face, the spot where you touched would turn red and stay red for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had bad acne.</li>
            <li> I am biracial and suffered from random breakouts below my cheek bones over the last few years.</li>
            <li> After abandoning the medical profession&#x27;s expensive prescription remedies, I started using a combination of sulfur soap with Dead Sea salts, vitamin B-5.</li>
            <li> , yea it leaves a little brown water/soap in soap dish, no biggie ppl!</li>
            <li> I am extremely allergic to artificial fragrance, which is why I can&#x27;t use any commercial acne products, even prescriptions have masking fragrances &amp; dyes also.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have bad acne or dark spots on your face!  </li>
            <li> I use it for her skin and hair and she have very little itching and redness.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s dull, uneven tone.</li>
            <li> I was a little skeptical because the soap was a dark color (foams dark brown too.)  </li>
            <li> This soap really smells bad.  </li>
            <li> I much rather use this than to use hydroquinone which is bad for your liver after period of use.</li>
            <li> but i guess it&#x27;s a small price to pay</li>
            <li> &amp; I notice it says &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; on the listed ingredients, but doesn&#x27;t specify natural or artificial.  </li>
            <li> either the amount is so small</li>
            <li> Almost no more skin issues.</li>
            <li> It is REAL black soap, and it does not stain as some would have you believe.</li>
            <li> the time has past.....</li>
            <li> NOT SURE</li>
            <li> Not really, I love the soap.</li>
            <li> I use it at night or when i plan to have a lazy day indoors.</li>
            <li> I can not wait to see the results I get within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> Small price to pay</li>
            <li> :-/    </li>
            <li> this soap small like s</li>
            <li> While it does leave the washcloth stained, it is a small inconvenience.   </li>
            <li> If you suffer with chicken skin on your arms , this is your holy grail , it&#x27;s completely changed my skin.</li>
            <li> Not sure why.</li>
            <li> by day 3 - no more.  </li>
            <li> I have used this soap for the past year now.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is, but this stuff clears body acne like nothing else.</li>
            <li> Sorry to all the acne prone hopefuls, but this is no miracle bar as perceived by recent reviews.</li>
            <li> as usual.</li>
            <li> When I accidentally skipped a day of deodorant in the past and ended up sweating a lot, the pits of my shirts would hint a bit of BO, who wouldn&#x27;t?</li>
            <li> So I hopped in the shower, washed my face, body- shampooed my hair, everything per usual.</li>
            <li> Plus, the usual obsession of putting lotion on is no longer an... obsession.</li>
            <li> We are hosting a small Valentine&#x27;s party and have already started to built the gift baskets and of course...it includes your soap.</li>
            <li> In the shower this soap dried my skin OUT!</li>
            <li> I am not a person that goes crazy over things labeled as natural or organic.</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase it through Amazon sadly, but I did through my local beauty supply store.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not overwhelming, but just not to my liking.</li>
            <li> Not sure if it works on body acne</li>
            <li> My skin got worst than better.</li>
            <li> I won&#x27;t use any other soap again (even those very expensive French soaps).</li>
            <li> I would not recommend using this soap because it is very harsh on skin and nail polish.</li>
            <li> This soap is very harsh to my skin.</li>
            <li> so I said they are just mad about something or maybe on medication making their skin sensitive etc</li>
            <li> My entire family and I have been using black soap for years, and there are quite a few bad bars out there.</li>
            <li> Using it as a body soap was not a very good experience.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a common effect</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused; Is Dudu-Osun called &#x27;black&#x27; soap because it is blackish in color?  </li>
            <li> The majority of my dry skin is all cleared up, and since I lost the oils in my scalp due to the fire I was in, my scalp was really bad, and in about a months times, I have very little flaking on my scalp today.  </li>
            <li> the raw one looks like poop!</li>
            <li> Kinda hard to explain...</li>
            <li> We have hard water in our area, and while we have a softener, it is still noticeable.</li>
            <li> I know it can be hard, if anyone has any questions about the mask i use or about my regimen</li>
            <li> This soap is hard to describe.  </li>
            <li> and, not burn, but it feels a little uncomfortable a little after I wash my face and even when I put lotion on.</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old guy, and I have really bad acne, My face has cleared up</li>
            <li> I had bad skin as far as scars from insect bites as a child.</li>
            <li> but i decided to at least give it try.</li>
            <li> and she was at least 40.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not over-drying - a common experience one can get from using soaps.</li>
            <li> I got acne in my late teens and all through my tweenties and nothing</li>
            <li> The first few weeks I had some small pimples that I thought was part of the \\&quot;purging\\&quot; stage but after week three it was terrible!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s confusing</li>
            <li> Everyone should at least try this soap.  </li>
            <li> Lye is a common soap ingredient.</li>
            <li> Lime is not so commonly used.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It performed as soap, so I will give it 3/5 stars because 1/5 would just be rude.</li>
            <li> A big disappointment...</li>
            <li> The only thing is it can stain a wash cloth and make your tub get dirty.</li>
            <li> I had a burn scar that seems to be slowly fading as well!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I dont need to use the green alcohol to go behind this soap.</li>
            <li> Since using this soap my scars have slowly faded but it does take months.</li>
            <li> I like this product - It s a bit expensive compared to other name brands in the market .</li>
            <li> I mean, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me - soap</li>
            <li> does this mean for a soap meant to help with breakouts?</li>
            <li> and I was resigned the fact that my fingertips were going to be annoyingly calloused looking and uncomfortable for a couple of days, because you know, it&#x27;s super glue.</li>
            <li> And then.. 2 months later, doing the same routine, my face broke out HORRIBLY!</li>
            <li> And I wonder if all those reviews are fake, because it seems weird that I can&#x27;t find this soap anywhere else on the net</li>
            <li> Seriously, ever.</li>
            <li> I am sorry I bought a six pack because I have not even used half of one bar</li>
            <li> Seriously.</li>
            <li> so day 1 in the morning and day 2 in the morning I would see random little whiteheads.  </li>
            <li> Then on the third day the redness and irritation got so bad that I had to go see a doctor</li>
            <li> , if you have bad acne, sometimes no amount of topical solutions can help you.</li>
            <li> The only bad thing I have to say about it is that immediately after using it feels like you need to follow up with a moisturizer which if I do I used organic coconut oil</li>
            <li> Sleeping in make-up is not good for your skin...</li>
            <li> In other venues I&#x27;ve seen people claim that Dudu-Osun soap has artificial colors and fragrances.</li>
            <li> and that was especially terrifying when I first used it.</li>
            <li> which has VERY HARD water.</li>
            <li> , doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin too bad</li>
            <li> Unpleasant smell and stings sometimes, probably due to the lime in it.</li>
            <li> $40-$100+ in the past!!</li>
            <li> $40-$100+ in the past!!</li>
            <li> I have really bad skin that can be both oily and very very dry as well as pilaris keratosis around my eyes.</li>
            <li> Be careful though it can burn badly if u use incorrectly</li>
            <li> it just made it worse.</li>
            <li> One thing I do after washing my face with this is add a thin layer of aloe vera gel as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> , I know it is frustrating trying to find products that work for you.</li>
            <li> It may be too drying and irritating for others.</li>
            <li> Then, they are confused when they start having breakouts and acne.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not making it worse.  </li>
            <li> It leaves residue behind, that is mud-brown in color.</li>
            <li> THEY GOT MUCH WORSE.  </li>
            <li> I would have given this soap 4 stars, but the messiness was so annoying that I give it only 3 stars.</li>
            <li> My soap arrived about a week late unfortunately.</li>
            <li> (it made itching worse -</li>
            <li> The reviews on here that state their skin got worse must have allergies to the ingredients.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun soap contains things like palm oil and shea butter which should help to reduce the burning that caustic substances can cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> But then, the Syrian civil war began, and supply was slowly cut off, or became to expensive.</li>
            <li> , it doesn&#x27;t make it worse</li>
            <li> Everyone who has smelled it hates the scent, so much as to say that they think it smells awful.</li>
            <li> If you have problems with acne or oily skin, black soap is for you!!!!  </li>
            <li> Seriously!</li>
            <li> I know my question is totally idiotic, but I thought it was because of the color of the bar until a lady at the hairdresser told me it was \\&quot;soap for black people\\</li>
            <li> Dudu osun has made dramatic difference.</li>
            <li> I thought it was a bit crazy to use such an ugly bar of soap, but don&#x27;t let it&#x27;s</li>
            <li> And it wasn&#x27;t the typical pizza face acne either, it was swollen, painful cysts underneath my skin.</li>
            <li> Due to me taking birth control my hormones got a little out of wack, leaving me with TERRIBLE break-outs!</li>
            <li> Its so bad that it bleeds, sometimes it even crust up and dead skin falls off.</li>
            <li> No more acne!!!</li>
            <li> in just a few days!!!!</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s honestly not that bad.</li>
            <li> How wrong I was.  </li>
            <li> I also tried the soap on my husband who is white, has a balanced skin type, no acne, but has awfully cracked feet</li>
            <li> WRONG.</li>
            <li> I must say, I was at the beginning skeptical of trying this soap.</li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using the expensive recommended by staff that work in beauty product area, which 90% alwasy gave me rash or dosent do anything, wasting my money....</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s a weird experience to use this soap.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, I am allergic to fragrance and cannot use it.  </li>
            <li> Im sorry</li>
            <li> If you buy this you&#x27;re just going to end up with expensive soup.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, they all went into the trash can.</li>
            <li> but it is from some random company in Nigeria</li>
            <li> and it has a weird fruity smell</li>
            <li> My mom was skeptical but even after using it, people kept telling her that her skin was glowing.</li>
            <li> It dries the acne, but does not strip the skin to the point where it is uncomfortable.</li>
            <li> The USPS tracking is useless too - it just says they received the package on the 10th.</li>
            <li> Even my boyfriend is obsessed with this</li>
            <li> However, the only downfall is the fact that it&#x27;s terribly drying.</li>
            <li> Forget Proactiv and all of those expensive products, this is all you need and this is coming from someone who has fought acne for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I also bathed with the soap for a week and my strech marks have faded so much it is ridiculous!!</li>
            <li> I used this soap and it dried my extremely bad, so bad that it looked craked.</li>
            <li> artificial colours  </li>
            <li> but it burns like crazy.</li>
            <li> just gets inflamed and burns like crazy and tends to have issues with drying out for days afterward.</li>
            <li> and I would recommend you use this soap with cold water because it will sting and burn.</li>
            <li> For starters, I KNOW this soap has artificial fragrance and dyes in it because I can see it and smell it.</li>
            <li> and it burned like crazy.</li>
            <li> It was really depressing.</li>
            <li> , I hated the smell and hated the actual usefulness of this product.</li>
            <li> or if you do, like me, you will be sorry you did!</li>
            <li> It mad</li>
            <li> Very weird.</li>
            <li> After about 3 days of using this soap I noticed something very frightening.</li>
            <li> Late in March I had a horrible break out of acne on my face on my neck and my chest.</li>
            <li> It all seems very silly to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Smells too bad to use.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s not that bad.</li>
            <li> It is a bit drying to my skin but not too bad.  </li>
            <li> so I was worried that I was having a bad reaction to it.  </li>
            <li> and I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I have bad skin.</li>
            <li> It was really bad</li>
            <li> I also have really bad acne scarring and hyper pigmentation all over my cheeks and chin,</li>
            <li> also had a really bad habit of always picking my face and popping my pimples</li>
            <li> I would rather just not use water this smells so bad.</li>
            <li> My daughter has realiy bad eczema and acne.</li>
            <li> day I discovered that my sulfur soap was gone, and I had a bad breakout on my scalp.</li>
            <li> I have bad acne</li>
            <li> It stains terribly bad.</li>
            <li> After 2weeks, our acne was so bad like never before, we had to start on antibiotics from our doctor.</li>
            <li> Me and my sister have had bad acne since we were teenagers and now we are 21.</li>
            <li> I was shocked at how well it worked.</li>
            <li> :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> So disappointed.</li>
            <li> And so I just give them an awkward look and leave it up to their imagination!</li>
            <li> You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> WTF!?!</li>
            <li> You won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
            <li> Hollywood doesn&#x27;t tell us because they want us to go out and by expense crap that doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
            <li> It zaps those annoying zits you can sometimes get on your face.</li>
            <li> I make a shower gel out of the soap shavings and I dilute the crap out of</li>
            <li> the crap gel with added chemicals..</li>
            <li> the crap gel with added chemicals..</li>
            <li> so well I hate to wash it off the face cloth.</li>
            <li> It was really painful and it looked horrible!</li>
            <li> very bad packaging without any protection</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed in this product.</li>
            <li> Very disappointed</li>
            <li> Just dont get any in your mouth when you wash your face, it tastes horrible.</li>
            <li> In the beginning it brings all of the germs (I guess) to the surface and my face looked horrible but eventually everything cleared up.</li>
            <li> but now it&#x27;s a worst.</li>
            <li> I have horrible acne..</li>
            <li> what I use I still break out horribly..</li>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial material.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks AMAZON for sending this soap to KOREA!!!!</li>
            <li> Is horrible smell and can&#x27;t be cleaned on my face.</li>
            <li> It also does not prevent acne breakouts, as I&#x27;ve had my worst while using this soap for a month.</li>
            <li> It was horrible</li>
            <li> and it helps to keep my skin from breaking out terribly.</li>
            <li> /&gt;The ingredients are all-natural, and I admire that, but the smell is not so much awful</li>
            <li> I have horrible acne problems.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Item received as described.</li>
            <li> This is an all natural soap. I use night and mornings after a workout. In the winter time it can seem a little drying to my face in particular so I just use a little extra rose hip seed oil or witch hazel and I&#x27;m good to go.  I also use this soap to wash my hair and I no longer have problems with dry scalp.  My face skin is always clear and I attribute much of that to my skin care regimen.</li>
            <li> Smells too bad to use.</li>
            <li> Just loved it, wonderful stuff</li>
            <li> makes a mess in the tub and really didnt help with acne</li>
            <li> GREAT! Best Soap I have every used so far. It feels really smooth and works great. Amazing Smell too.</li>
            <li> Love this soap! I bathe in it and wash my face with it! My skin looks perfect!</li>
            <li> the name is hard to pronounce, but very good soap. this soap smells delicious.</li>
            <li> Love this organic soap, skin feels fresh and clean after using it.</li>
            <li> I wash my hair with this bar. It&#x27;s VERY sudsy. Smells very nice like citrus and flowers. Careful around eyes and sensitive skin. I guess it&#x27;s the essential oils makes it burn.</li>
            <li> I love the clean feeling i get after using this soap, my only issue is the brown staining of my wash cloths but i guess it&#x27;s a small price to pay</li>
            <li> I love this soap, you really get a soft feeling on your skin, and it also gives you a clearer complextion. I have to say there is a little tingle I get sometimes on little sensitive areas on my face, so a little heads up for someone with sensitive skin, but overall I really like this soap</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  It&#x27;s great at calming irritated skin and helps to reduce or remove skin tags and moles.</li>
            <li> Love this product a lot!</li>
            <li> Smell almost too heavenly.  Makes my skin feel so soft.</li>
            <li> Enjoyed this soap and would purchase again.  Has a nice scent.</li>
            <li> Really loved it the soap makes my body silky and I love the smell of it.</li>
            <li> Love the feel and smell of this soap. It leaves you feeling very clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suds up well, and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Lathers wonderfully, great fresh scent, leaves skin squeaky clean yet still soft. I use it for hands, body, and even hair!  Makes a brown drippy mess because of the color and can look gross if you don&#x27;t know where the residue is from. But I&#x27;m still ordering it again because I like it so much. Better than any other soaps I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Thanks for prompt delivery. Product as described.</li>
            <li> does not cure or work on acne at all. Just a soap. Dudu Osun Black Soap, 6-Count review right now.</li>
            <li> My skin is so smooth and sexy. By the way...I&#x27;m single ladies :-)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about three months. I like the all-natural ingredients, and I feel clean afterward (no residue). The scent is a bit overpowering, but I got used to it.</li>
            <li> I have always had very sensitive skin and absolutely nothing worked for my acne it just made it worse. So when I got this I wasn&#x27;t expecting anything great to happen but it did! I use this soap morning and night. Every couple days I will use an all natural sea sponge to exfoliate, and after every single wash I put on organic coconut oil. I have only been using it for about two months and my skin has honestly never looked better. I can&#x27;t wait to see what it looks like a year from now.</li>
            <li> This soap has a really great smell, as well as leaving me feel super clean due to the granuales exfoliating my skin as i shower. Kind of weird how it looks like dirty water and bubbles as you lather, but that is only due to the black color of the soap, All in all, I will be reordering. Just dont get any in your mouth when you wash your face, it tastes horrible. LOL.</li>
            <li> I like this soap, it&#x27;s gentle on my skin, non fragrant but it does have a slight medicated smell. No one mentioned in the reviews it stains white towels though.....</li>
            <li> My hubs and I absolutely LOVE this soap!!!  It definitely helps to protect and heal your skin.  We use it exclusively in our showers.  And based upon the other reviews, I&#x27;ve started using it for a facial cleanser.  It&#x27;s the perfect all-in-one travel companion.  You won&#x27;t need a separate soap and facial cleanser.  PLUS - The scent is perfect for either sex.  Very happy to find it online!</li>
            <li> I ordered this on a Tuesday...I received on Friday...this soap smells wonderful...I use it on my face and body...so much lather! and it leaves your skin squeaky clean...and it leaves your skin dry (that&#x27;s how you know your skin is clean) I use a little extra virgin olive oil on my face after I wash it...and pure Shea butter on my skin...I love this soap...will be using black soap from this seller always!</li>
            <li> Love this soap, lathers very well and my skin feels great.</li>
            <li> As an avid soap maker, I think this soap is excellent. It does have a prominent herbal, vaguely medicinal smell which I enjoy, but after rinsing the soap off, the lingering scent on my skin is subtle. In other venues I&#x27;ve seen people claim that Dudu-Osun soap has artificial colors and fragrances. Here&#x27;s what it says on the box:    Dudu-Osun is the age-long African black soap made the traditional way by hand from PURE NATURAL INGREDIENTS AND HERBS from the tropical rainforest and savannah regions.  -No artificial colours  -No preservatives  -Bio degradable    INGREDIENTS:  -Pure Honey  -Shea Butter  -Osun (Camwood)  -Palmkernal oil  -Cocoa pod ash  -Palm bunch ash  -Glycerine  -Aloe vera  -Lime juice  -Water &amp; Fragrance.    Also, despite the ash content (that gives it its dark color), it didn&#x27;t stain my bathtub nor washcloths. However, the wet bar of soap dripped brown liquid in my soap dish, which wiped off effortlessly.</li>
            <li> I just ordered this product, and I was surprised when I went to my mailbox, and it just reeked of a flowery/sweet scent.  It will permeate the bathroom for the first few days, but the smell dissolves.  I love the smell of the soap in the shower, though it is strong up front, it does not leave a heavy scent at all, it was very light and almost nonexistant.  Every bar soap I have EVER used, dove, neutrogena, lever 2000, etc. has always made my skin ITCH like nothing else, but, this soap does not.  I am very happy with it so far.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I was pleasantly surprised by the tropical smell. I would have given 5 stars except I thought that the black soap w/aloe and shea butter worked a little better for my skin. It leaves my skin feeling clean not filmy like the regular soaps. I do not recommend using it without a washcloth though. It is a raw soap and there are pieces in the soap that can scratch your skin if you rub it directly onto yourself. I did find that it produces a light brown rinse but it did not stain my shower at all. I ordered the \\&quot;natural shea butter\\&quot; at the same time. I have been using the shea butter as a moisturizer(even on my face)after bath time. I have already reviewed the shea butter. Both products together have been a lifesaver! My daughter has severly dry skin and she is softer than ever! I have even given two bars away as gifts! What a amazing soap!</li>
            <li> I was enthused to find this soap on amazon.  It&#x27;s awesome, and now I have my sisters using the soap as well.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product it is my favorite soap. It does wonderful things for my skin</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t purchase this soap via a vendor but my mom purchased this soap while she was overseas, since I asked for a generic African black soap.  When she came back with this soap, she said that so many people said this was better for skin ailments such as acne and I took her word for it.  When I first applied the later on my wet face, my skin started to itch and prickle, but I dismissed it as its healing properties taking into effect.  After three days of using this soap, my face was blistering so I stopped.  It took a week or two for my face to return to normal.  I then decided to use the rest of the soap on my body since my body tends to be more resilient.  How wrong I was.  I tried this soap as a body wash for a week before I couldn&#x27;t tolerate the itchy rash I developed while using it.      This is not a bad soap but I suspect my skin cannot tolerate either the camwood fragrance, honey (yes honey makes my face itch and blister when applied on my face) or the cocoa pod ash.  If you have a less reactive soap, I suggest you purchase some.  If that is not the case, just purchase one and test drive it.</li>
            <li> After reading all of the reviews online, I brought this soap.  I brought it because; I was looking for something that would help clear up my oily skin and fine acne. So far, I am pleased with the result. My face is not as oily as it use to be and my fine acne is gone.  I have been using it for over a month and it is the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used. It lathers very well and rinses of clean, no soap residue. Be sure to moisturize after using it because it can leave your skin very dry. This is the only soap I will ever use on my face or body Great product.</li>
            <li> My son had alot of dry patches. i looked up natural remedies to cure his dry skin and black soap was the first item to pop up on the majority of the reveiws. i first tried the soap in the beginning of the year and have been hooked ever since. now we all use this soap.</li>
            <li> I absolutely LOVE this soap hands-down this is my favorite!!!! It smells so clean and the clean smell stays on your skin... Its also is pure..no chemicals that can go through your skin...i will forever be a customer.</li>
            <li> I am a white female, and this soap makes my skin smooth and blemish free. The only time I get pimples now is when I forget to wash my face before bed and sleep with my make-up on. I know, I know. Sleeping in make-up is not good for your skin... but, boy, does my face recuperate when I wash with this. Dries the zits right up without drying my face out. Makes my skin smooth and soft, and tightens my pores. I found this soap when I started looking for natural/organic skin care alternatives because of my husband&#x27;s eczema. It&#x27;s not a cure for eczema (still needs his prescription creams), but it does help his skin stay healthy, and the eczema has not popped up in any new places. Since we started using this soap, we have not gone back to any other soap. It does not leave any residue... actually leaves you feeling incredibly clean and rubbery (in a good way). I also use it as shampoo sometimes for my scalp. It lathers nicely, smells great, and between the 2 of us showering each once per day, a bar can last up to a week (as long as we keep it from sitting in a puddle of water... sometimes we keep it in a zip lock bag to keep the brown soapy water from running everywhere).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Words of caution: I will say that I was glad I read the review that stated not to use it with any kind of body scrubbing sponge, puff, or wash cloth because it is slightly strong and can irritate your skin. I do not shave with it. Also, be careful with sensitive areas such as eyes, freshly shaved armpits and legs, and the nether-regions. It can go there, but don&#x27;t let it stay long because it will start to burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, best soap I&#x27;ve every used. I&#x27;ve recommended it to many friends who laugh at the name, but find it intriguing enough to try after hearing what I say about it. It&#x27;s also great in conjunction with raw shea butter which can be found from some of the same seller. I love that stuff too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And to add one last thing... this may sound weird, but it works great on my dog too. I have a Weimaraner and these dogs are known for having very sensitive coats... even too sensitive for dog shampoos and baby shampoos. Du-Du soap is the first soap we have used with no irritation. It actually left them with very shiny coats.... and the rubbery feeling was a bonus because it really helped the dog brush grip the shedding fur. Just thought I&#x27;d throw that it. : )these dogs are known for having very sensitive coats... even too sensitive for dog shampoos and baby shampoos.

            <li> The smell and the wash is great. But it caused my skin so itchy and red bumps.  I wish there is a way to get rid of this. Wasted of money.  Updated:   I had to visit the doctor for the irritated skin. There&#x27;s some ingredients in this soap caused people with whiter skin got irritated and burned out.  ------  The reviews on this products are misleading too... before I purchased the products (2 weeks ago), there are 84 reviews. After I received it, still 84 reviews. Once I submitted my review, 24 hours later, 94 reviews. All of the new reviews except mine rated a 5 stars. Very weird.</li>
            <li> This soap is great!! I just love it. It lathers up really good and I like how soft it leaves my skin. I&#x27;m in to using a lot of natural products these day and this is one I would definitely recommend.</li>
            <li> All i would say is that i look forward every day for the time i&#x27;m going to wash my face in :D i even keep the soap in my room to enjoy its AMAZING smell ... and how it feels washing my skin with it ? AMAZINGGGGG .. u must give it a try .</li>
            <li> very good and I will order more</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it&#x27;s the only one I use on my face. At first it was really tingly but after I used it a month, I guess I got used to it or it went away. It will dry up minor acne after a few washes. I use it at night and in the morning and saw a difference within a week or two. One thing I do after washing my face with this is add a thin layer of aloe vera gel as a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought this many times in the past before, from all different sellers. The package looks a little different this time &amp; I notice it says &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; on the listed ingredients, but doesn&#x27;t specify natural or artificial.  I am extremely allergic to artificial fragrance, which is why I can&#x27;t use any commercial acne products, even prescriptions have masking fragrances &amp; dyes also.  I do not have an allergic reaction to this soap, so either the amount is so small or it&#x27;s made with good quality natural fragrances--so that&#x27;s very good since I didn&#x27;t notice the fragrance thing until after I ordered. I&#x27;m pretty sure that it never had that listed on the box in the past or I never would have bought it, b/c in my experience you can&#x27;t really trust any company when they say something is natural.  I will specify I have cystic acne, scarring &amp; sun spots--this soap is initially harsh due to the lemon/lime oil (you have to desensitize yourself by using it for a few seconds &amp; washing it off every few days, then slowly increasing use, just like any acne product), but after you get used to it it is the best skin brightener, tightener &amp; the ONLY natural acne product that has worked for my cystic acne.  I no longer go to the dermatologist b/c of this soap When I stop using this soap for a few weeks I notice my fine lines, acne scars &amp; sun spots become a lot more apparent.  With this soap, nobody believes me when I say I&#x27;m over 30 :) Hope this helps anyone, I know it is frustrating trying to find products that work for you.</li>
            <li> We ordered five different soaps on Amazon for our son who has eczema on his hands and face every winter. Also, I get very dry and itchy skin every winter because of the heated air. This soap works the best out of five. Almost no more skin issues.</li>
            <li> Good product. Great value. I recommend you buy a supply that can last you for awhile, since the soap can dissolve pretty quickly. Also, the soap is so great that you can even use it on your hair. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin/hair dry like most soaps do.    Remember not to leave it too long on sensitive area of your skin because the stuff BURNS.</li>
            <li> This soap worked great for clearing up my skin. My only complaint is the added fragrance, it is overwhelming...smells like a car air freshener, very strong. I wish they&#x27;d make a fragrance-free version.</li>
            <li> I ordered DUDU OSUN for my daughter with acute eczema...I ordered the tropical by error...I sent an email and immediately received a return call as well as the correct item I needed...Two thumbs up ...I will definitely use this site again...</li>
            <li> Didnt see much of a difference</li>
            <li> , I used this soap for less than a week . It irritated my face leaving it red and itching , a burning feeling , also my skin gotten super oily after using this .</li>
            <li> Before buying a multi pack, buy one to test on your skin first. I read reviews on how it is good for sensitive skin and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. i started itching after getting of the shower from using it. At first I thought it was the lotion I was using so I disregarded the soap. But it happened the next day before I used any lotion. A relative and neighbor also experienced this.</li>
            <li> I just love the Dudu Osun soap. It has done wonders for my skin &amp; I received the product within 2 days of placing my order.</li>
            <li> We started using the soap because my husband would have rough skin after shaving. Both of us experienced discoloration and occassional breakouts.  We saw immediately results with clear skin showing through.  Toning and even skin color on our faces.  Talk about smooth and soft as a newborns bottom. I will try it on my body and the kids as well.</li>
            <li> I love it!!! My skin loves it. It lightened my skin, I use it all over my body!    Never buyin another type of soap again!</li>
            <li> The best soap for people with stubborn skin conditions -- acne, eczema, etc.  I keep several bars on hand all year around and find myself giving them to friends.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> THe Dudu soap has been a lifesaver! This soap has helped to clear up my body and facial acne. It has also gradually lightened the dark spots I had from acne. In the beginning it brings all of the germs (I guess) to the surface and my face looked horrible but eventually everything cleared up. My face looks better than it ever has. On the flip side, it does dry out my skin but lotion does the trick.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, but I rated it only 4 stars because it makes my face burn a little when I use it. Because of this, the apples of my cheeks have turned a little raw with use. I used it for 2 days without any problems (in fact, I noticed that my blemishes are clearing up), but when I had to wash my face 2 times in a time frame of about 4 hours, this caused my skin to become extremely sensitive and red.    I use this soap before I apply raw, unrefined shea butter to my face. Although I have only been using the two products for two days, my face has become softer, more moisturized and my blemishes are healing. For the most part, I love this soap. But my cheeks are pretty raw right now (and I have never considered myself to have sensitive skin) so I think I will not use it for a day or two until the rawness goes away. I have ordered a pound of african black soap from Ghana which does not contain lemon juice and I hope that it will be more soothing for my sensitive face.</li>
            <li> This soap works better than anything I&#x27;ve ever seen, heard off, or tried!!! I&#x27;m Hispanic, my skin color is brown, or deep tan. I have very sensitive skin and it&#x27;s quite dry and has an uneven tone, with no acne. In addition to this I also have stretch marks on my inner thighs, arms, hips and butt. I tried the soap first on my face and I kid you not, my face got about 5 shades lighter the first time!!! I also bathed with the soap for a week and my strech marks have faded so much it is ridiculous!! My skin was so soft without even applying lotion. I gave a bar to my friend and her mom, who are hatian, with sensitive, oily skin; and they love it as well. It controls acne very well apparently. I now bathe with the soap daily but exfoliate only twice a week because I have dry skin. It depends on your skin type but for me I put a very small amount of it on my face, if not my face can get a little red and look like I got a face lift. The soap is all natural and contains lime juice which is why my skin got so much lighter, and why the acne goes away. I also tried the soap on my husband who is white, has a balanced skin type, no acne, but has awfully cracked feet and we saw a significant improvement in about a week. (I don&#x27;t know how many times he used it) The soap is very powerful and I decided to by the all natural raw Shea butter to help me out with moisture, these two products combined will absolutely transform your skin. This soap lathers incredibly, so if you keep it away from water when you are not using it, it will last for a very very long time. I&#x27;ve ordered twice and over all, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product, the results, the price, and the seller&#x27;s prompt delivery. In fact I need more stars for this product!</li>
            <li> The best soap I ever used and it&#x27;s good for your body as well as your face and it helps with dark spots.</li>
            <li> This soap really helped me with my dry skin.  For the past two weeks, my face has been dry and tender.  Since using this soap, my skin feels so much better and the dryness is gone.</li>
            <li> For Eczema-this soap was supposed to work.  It did not.  I would recommend unscented Dove for sensitive skin.  Dudu stings too much...and it shouldn&#x27;t sting at all.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Smells good</li>
            <li> This is my third time ordering from this seller and their service and product are excellent!</li>
            <li> First off let me say that I am a skeptic when it comes to cosmetic products. So when I read all the claims I just had to try it for myself. I was convinced it wouldn&#x27;t work better than my favorite soap dove. I tried it on my son first. My 3 yr old son has extreme excema. Its so bad that it bleeds, sometimes it even crust up and dead skin falls off. He scratches nonstop. He&#x27;s been prescribed steroid cream, antibiotics, topical creams and various other types of medicines.....all to no avail but once I used this soap on his ultra sensitive skin his excema cleared up almost instantly. His skin is now flawless and I never see him scratching it. He gets compliments almost everywhere I take him.    I recieved this soap in the mail, beautifully packaged and super fast shipping. The first time I used it I noticed the pungent smell first (which is not bad) After my first shower I felt amazingly wonderful. It calmed me instantly, leaving my skin soft and brighter. I have stretch marks from my son and dark spots on my face which this soap has also cleared up. This the best soap I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;m glad I decided to give this soap a try and ordering from Amazon makes the buying process even better, you can&#x27;t beat the price.I can&#x27;t stop talking about this soap to my family, I will never stop singing it&#x27;s praises. My sister even noticed my skin and now she&#x27;s started using this soap as well. I RECOMMEND THIS SOAP TOTALLY AND COMPLETELY TO ALL SKIN TYPE AND ALL PEOPLE.    ** the only caveat is the brown residue its leaves on the tub and on your washing apparatus. **</li>
            <li> Smells good and my skin doesn&#x27;t itch with this soap either, GREAT JOB!!!!!</li>
            <li> Bought this hoping it would help with acne.  I had been using proactive which generally keeps my acne under control, but never gets rid of it, and dries out my skin.  I bought this, and Thayers Witch Hazel to use after it, and have been using both twice a day for a little over a month.  This soap makes my skin feel great, it doesn&#x27;t dry it out, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  First week I had it I looked forward to washing my face because I just felt like it was clearing me up.  But then looking in the mirror I haven&#x27;t seen the results, and as more time past I&#x27;ve been getting worse breakouts.  I use it on my body in the shower too and its fine, I don&#x27;t notice much of a difference from regular bar soap though.  Hasn&#x27;t been the solution to my acne but it does make you feel clean, so I&#x27;ll use it for now until I find something else to try.</li>
            <li> I started using this soap a month ago, once in the morning and before bedtime. I read every review and was so excited to use it. I am Asian, with eczema and acne here and there and I thought this soap would help. Well, it does make my face feel clean, but I really don&#x27;t see any change in my eczema or acne. In fact, after the first few days of using this soap, I developed a harsh reaction that caused my skin to &#x27;bleed&#x27; clear liquid out. I think this is partially my fault because I might have over exfoliated. These bleeding patches heeled after a week but left dark splotches behind. I am hoping this soap would lighten them up and the other scars on my face but I haven&#x27;t yet seen any changes and it&#x27;s been nearly 3 weeks. I&#x27;m giving this soap 3 stars because I&#x27;m gonna be optimistic and hope it still works but just takes a little longer for me. Like I said it does clean and does lather well and smells good but it can be harsh and can scratch you (there&#x27;s some rough particles in this soap that can scratch you). Keeping my fingers crossed and hoping for some great changes soon!</li>
            <li> The soap is really good. I felt a bit of stinging at first, but then with some other black soap I felt the same thing. I use it every day in the shower and it has to me a nice smell. You can feel and smellthe herbs that this soap is made off, and that is great&#x27; My skin feels smooth and in time the soap will show more results.</li>
            <li> Very high quality soap. Smells good and cleans well</li>
            <li> This is my favorite soap and now I&#x27;ve got my friends hooked too. I personally like the scent. Is not drying, lathers well. I purchase regularly, about every other month. Great seller. Will, and do, recommend.</li>
            <li> I decided to go the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; route and stop purchasing ProActiv. I started using the black soap and it instantly cleared up my skin. I loved how smooth &amp; clean my skin felt. And then.. 2 months later, doing the same routine, my face broke out HORRIBLY! I thought it was something else, but my sister did the same routine and 2 months later? SHE broke out too.</li>
            <li> I actually love this soap and it&#x27;s cleaning properties. I have found that when used on my face to help with mild acne, it tends to dry my skin out BADLY. My face would literally burn after using this soap. I had to stop using the product for that reason. It&#x27;s a great soap if your skin is not too sensitive and can stand a firm natural soup. Otherwise, beware! I am now using natural 100% Castill soap and prefer that a lot better as it does not dry my skin, but keeps it moisturized!</li>
            <li> This soap smells earthy and a bit woodsy.  It suds up great and rinses clean.  It could be a bit harsh for certain skin types.  For me, there is sometimes a bit of itching around the crevice of my nose.  It could also cause a bit of peeling which is from the lemon contained in the soap.  That&#x27;s great though because it renews the skin and reveals a brighter complexion underneath.  We love it!</li>
            <li> Great product.  Fast delivery.  Tried it because I heard it was a natural, result producing product and it is!  My skin is tighter, glowing and it smells wonderful.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month or so now.  Others noted that it can make you break out.  It did to me a little, but I think it was all those old clogged pores that needed to be cleaned anyway.  Once you get through that...WOW!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using dudu-osun&#x27;s black soap for the past four months as a cleanser night and day. it works really well for my moderate acne to reduce and prevent it when i use it consistently. i haven&#x27;t had any breakouts except for when i stop using it for a day or two. it also evens out your skin tone, but it won&#x27;t fade dark acne scars.</li>
            <li> This soap has helped clear up my acne.  I use it with a retinoid.  I recommend it for those with oily skin.  It may be too drying and irritating for others.</li>
            <li> This product arrived in a timely manner, but the boxes that the bars came in were pretty worn.  In spite of that, the bars were in perfect condition.  I was so excited to try the \\&quot;real thing\\&quot;, but the soap is too strong for me and began to sting and burn.  I had to return to using Shea Moisture African Black Soap.</li>
            <li> AMAZING!! This stuff makes your skin feel like new! Works really well for acne, but use a luffa!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It&#x27;s really good for Black people&#x27;s skin. I use it mainly on my face and it exfoliates and cleanses well. It&#x27;s cleared my skin pretty well. And despite preconceived notions, it smells really good (to me anyway). It&#x27;s not unpleasant at all. Complaints I have is that it stains things (i.e.: towels, clothes, etc) so be careful. The staining can come out, but over time of using towels, they&#x27;ll darken. Also, it can be drying to the skin, so be sure to moisturize after using it. Other than that, it&#x27;s a good product :)</li>
            <li> We absolutely love this soap-- it cleans very well and makes our skin feel wonderful!    The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the lather is brown--   it didn&#x27;t really work as a hand soap in our guest bathroom.  But for everywhere else, it&#x27;s perfect!  Highly recommended-</li>
            <li> This is a great product. It leaves me feeling clean and pure after every shower, and my skin shows the difference. My acne has virtually disappeared and scars have faded away. Initially, you fill feel very dry as the soap washes away the chemicals from your old soap, but the feeling disappears within a month, if not within two weeks. Try it. I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll feel the difference.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because of the great reviews and was hoping it will help clear up my mild acne.  It was very drying to my face even with  immediately applying moisturizer(raw shea butter).  It&#x27;s ok as a body soap (nothing spectacular ) and since I have the 6 pack I will continue using it just on my body.</li>
            <li> I really like the scent and quality of this soap. Its natural ingredients are great for my skin (I&#x27;m black) and I&#x27;ve noticed that the dark marks on my skin are beginning to fade. I use it on my face as well and I&#x27;ve received complements on my skin tone from persons who&#x27;ve noticed a difference.</li>
            <li> Smells good,  feels good,  natural, definitely for the negro!</li>
            <li> I had been using a different kind of soap similar to this because a lot of people were saying it&#x27;s great for your skin. I wasn&#x27;t that impressed with the first kind I tried. It was chunky, had a smell I didn&#x27;t like as much, dried out my skin and it didn&#x27;t help my eczema as it said it could. I tried this one today and it&#x27;s very fragrant. So far, my skin feels less dry compared to the other soap so that&#x27;s a great start! I like this one much better. Update: I have noticed my eczema not totally clearing up but fading a little. I also break out less often and less severely than before</li>
            <li> Love this soap! It&#x27;s super gentle on my son&#x27;s ultra sensitive skin. My son has had no flair ups with his eczema since we began using this.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping which is super. I placed an order for this product on Nov 18 wihich was schedule to be delivered on Nov 22, it got here a whole day earlier, thank you so much, love doing buisness with amazon, just excellent. I did some extensive research before I bought ABS(african black soap) and learned a great deal of this great soap that is doing WONDERS for my skin.  As a child I had extermely server eczema all over my body. I get them on my buttocks, chest, arms but mainly on my legs which made me quite embrassed to wear skirt and dress that werent ankle length. Scracthing them when they itched made them take alomost forever to heal and well they did left literally big black marks that stood out from a distance. All through my school years I was scorned and ridiculed which made me defensive and very aggresive. I am sorry I didnt learn of AFB as a teenager and young adult.  I began use AFB just over a year now and OMG, I swear its close to a miracle to my skin, those yearssss of old scars, 95% of them are gone. I use AFB along with Shea Butter and the two work very well together, I especially love use them together it cold weather and the cold air really dries out my skin badly. With other moisturizers I would get home from being out in the out and my skin would be dry and flaky. It is the total opposite with shea butter.  If this product doesnt work right away for you, please give it some time and you will love the results. Now people come up to by and tell me I have beatuiful skin (which has never happened to me in my young years).  I even introduced freinds and family memebers to both of the products and they loooooooove them</li>
            <li> I bought this product at my local african store..... I only got to use it once so far, but it is reaaaaly different, i never felt this clean before lol very good, i&#x27;ll post another review in a couple of weeks to show progress</li>
            <li> Works great on my skin. Does not leave skin feeling overly dry. Recommend for anyone with skin sensitivity. great overall</li>
            <li> First I wanna say don&#x27;t believe everything you read!!! I love the smell of the soap it smells so tropical. Although the smell at first is kinda  strong it goes away. It didn&#x27;t burn my flesh at all. I love how it left my skin squeaky clean the first use. I didn&#x27;t experience alot of drying, but I would add moisture to your skin. The lil bit of acne I could get rid of DUDU OSUN CLEARED IN A WEEK!!!!!! No I&#x27;m not exaggerating. I am allergic to benzyl peroxide so I am limited to acne medication. It cleared my face neck chest and back. Any problem you have use the soap in the problem area. I am shock a bar of soap made my skin clear and beautiful. Hollywood doesn&#x27;t tell us because they want us to go out and by expense crap that doesn&#x27;t work. BUY DUDU OSUN PLEASE TRY IT!! It works!!!!</li>
            <li> I love this soap but the bars that I received from this seller were out of date. They should have been taken off of the shelf about 2 months ago. However, Dudu Osun is a VERY good soap. I have acne and mild dermititis and I am so happy that I started using this soap. It has made my skin so much softer than it used to be. I give the seller 4 stars because the soaps have expired. Other than that I am satisfied.</li>
            <li> Although the soap has a slight smell of motor oil, it works great and my skin is so soft.  All natural black soap!  Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I love this soap because its all natural. Its a nice clean smell and it really exfoliates my skin. My husband always comments how soft my skin is. You know its working if the hubby notices. I love I have fewer acne breakouts and I have dark circles that are almost all gone after a few weeks of us. I love this soap!</li>
            <li> My favorite soap of all time. Leaves my skin smelling great and feeling soft.  I don&#x27;t have to use as much lotion or moisturizers when I use it.</li>
            <li> love this soap, will continue to purchase this soap, my husband and I use it every day, and my husband also uses it to wash his hair.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest soap ever. The scent is pleasant and last all day. This soap will also clear scars.</li>
            <li> I am always buying bathing products and can say that there are some that have been with me for many years.I have always wanted to try this product and when I saw my way clear to do so I did. I have used it twice and so far I am sold. It lathers up fast and with little effort. I do not need to reapply and it will last the whole while. The bar is large and the smell is very nice and the bathroom is scented from it. If I am not going to fast I can tell you that I will be buying more and making this my bar soap for a long time. It is almost to good to be true. If the price remains the same I am sure this will be my bar soap.</li>
            <li> Just recently got my soap and I like it very much. It smells nice, but natural and made my skin feel great. One reviewer said she was told that the black in the name refers to it being for black people....WRONG. It is \\&quot;black\\&quot; soap because there are plant ashes in the soap, giving it it&#x27;s dark appearance. It is made from leaves and bark of various trees and plants that are burned in a kettle or vat. The leaves are from banana trees, plantain skins, leaves and bark, palm tree leaves, cocoa pods, shea tree bark, etc. The ashes from the leaves are then mixed with water and then filtered. Oils such as shea butter, coconut oil, palm oil, palm kernel oil, and cocoa butter are added to this water to create the soap. It&#x27;s amazing how ignorant people can be, do some research people.</li>
            <li> I must say, I was at the beginning skeptical of trying this soap. I went to the beauty supply and right before my eyes, I saw Dudu Osun!!!! I decided to try it out because of the great reviews. I spent $4.99(1 bar), and can say honestly that every penny was worth wild. This makes my skin feel soooo refreshed,soft and clean. Dudu Osun has an earthy smell, and is pleasant to my sences!!!!!! My skin is brighter, cleaner, and my dark spots has lightened after 2 uses. I will most definitely purchase more of this soap and will use it as a bath soap as well. Just wanted to add that I also purchased, 100% pure Shea butter(Ghana), and I love this as a moisturizer after using Dudu Osun, and these two are a great combination together. My skin looks FLAWLESS!!!!!!</li>
            <li> ISO far so good,  I really like this product and I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for sometime. My face is clearing up and isn&#x27;t dry at all you can fill the difference just hope it can help me with dark marks I want a perfect tone</li>
            <li> All time favorite product of mine, best price I&#x27;ve found in a long time, excellent transaction.  I highly recommend this product and this vendor to everyone.</li>
            <li> I WISH I HAD KNOWN ABOUT THIS PRODUCT IN HIGH SCHOOL COULD HAVE SAVED  MYSELF A LOT OF BREAKOUTS. I AM 49 NOW AND NOT SO MANY BREAK OUTS BUT   OILY UNEVEN COMPLEXTION, WELL THAT HAS NOW CHANGED SINCE USING THIS SOAP  FOR ONLY ABOUT 3 WKS I AM TRULY AMAZED, I ALSO HAD A BLACKHEAD THAT I COULD&#x27;NT  GET RID OF AND TO MY SUPRISE IT IS NOW GONE. I AM SOLD THANKS TO MY DAUGHTER.  A BIT MESSY BUT JUST KEEP IT IN A PLASTIC SOAP DISH. FANTASTIC STUFF!</li>
            <li> Love this!! it made my skin super clean even though it made my skin dry afterwards but keep using it. It will clear up your skin really good!</li>
            <li> I bought the 6 pack of this soap and loved it! I eventually ended up giving a couple bars to my mother.  Pros: help my face feel squeaky clean while removing makeup             I liked the smell             Lathers really well             Helps even skintone a bit    Cons: well with the squeaky clean feeling comes dryness!              Stains everything it comes in contact with              If washing directly with the bar scrapes, and cuts will occur              Melts faster than an other bar soap I had</li>
            <li> All these reviews are accurate. It is AMAZING. I&#x27;m hispanic and my husband is very white- we both laughed about the name and how it looked, but were immediately addicted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Order up a decent stock, it&#x27;s so addicting I think we are using it up fast. It lathers generously, but it makes it more fun. It brightens your skin SO WELL. Additionally, people said they experienced a brief breakout period- my husband did the first day, but now both of us are clear 99% of the time, despite our heavy workout routines &amp; sweating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use CAREFULLY on sensitive skin, it will feel like it&#x27;s burning. I thought I was on fire and did a rain dance. The next day I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;scrub\\&quot;, just gently lathered and only had a very mild sensation of \\&quot;warm tingling.\\&quot; My husband said he felt mild tingling. It&#x27;s faded over a few days use because we are used to it &amp; use it how we need to. Regardless, rinse &amp; stand in the water and it will fade away. Another important note for the sensitive folks, DO NOT rub your skin with your towel- blot your skin. I have to lightly pat all over. My husband doesn&#x27;t need to pat at all, but his skin will get red for a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you rinse, you will literally squeak clean. It&#x27;s funny. This is probably why \\&quot;rubbing\\&quot; your body dry isn&#x27;t the best. Your skin will seem dry even though it is so smooth and glowing. We apply our own favorite lotions right after we dry and our skin sucks up the lotion and it \\&quot;fluffs\\&quot; up- AMAZING. Since this soap clears up breakout, fades scars or blemishes, makes your skin glow, and creates an environment for softness- who wouldn&#x27;t be willing to invest in a thick greedy lotion and cover themselves!!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great, but a light mild smell. Kind of tropical, herbal? Like a nice light tea? The scent doesn&#x27;t seem to stay, but skin does smell \\&quot;fresh &amp; clean\\&quot; after. My husband hates 99% of smells &amp; it didn&#x27;t bother him after he realized it didn&#x27;t linger and also once he weighed in the benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use the soap, cover your body in a lotion you love, have an extra soap under the cabinet for when you run out, and ENJOY. If your a man with a gf, wife, or daughter (ect), snatch some up and give them in a gift basket with some lotions &amp; act super savvy. They&#x27;ll be baffled after they use it &amp; tell them to research the soap too so they are even more impressed with you. It&#x27;s a fool proof item that doesn&#x27;t even need researched lol, even though it&#x27;s impressive to read all this and feel the results at the same time. Genius. Something original and new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;t THINK- ORDER. ALL SKIN TYPES, PUT ALL COMPLAINTS TO THE TEST, ENJOY YOUR COMPLIMENTS.ou love, have an extra soap under the cabinet for when you run out, and ENJOY.

            <li> Great product that my husband and I have been using for years.</li>
            <li> I love the soap and makes my skin soft</li>
            <li> Since I started using this soap, my skin glows. I live in a hard water area and have tried many soaps that claim to be gentle but they still dry my skin. I also use it on my face once a week mixed with a little coconut oil and my skin looks wonderful. It also has a nice smell.</li>
            <li> Best black soap ever. Be careful though it can burn badly if u use incorrectly</li>
            <li> Dudu Osun has been my best-kept secret for many years now. People always compliment me on how beautiful, smooth, and even my skin is. I say \\&quot;thank you\\&quot;, but almost never tell them what I use- Dudu Osun to clean and pure shea butter as a moisturizer! This is truly the best soap on the market and too many people let the color turn them away. It is REAL black soap, and it does not stain as some would have you believe. I also love the earthy scent and love to just sniff the boxes when they arrive in the mail! Too many of my African sisters come to the States with beautiful, smooth skin then start using Western products because they believe these products are somehow \\&quot;better\\&quot;. Then, they are confused when they start having breakouts and acne. They attribute it to the different food- which may play a role-but I believe it is because they stop using native products like Dudu Osun. This soap lathers richly and rinses clean- squeaky clean. The lather is so rich, I also use it as a shampoo for my dreadlocks. My skin is flawless, my hair is clean and healthy. You couldn&#x27;t pay me to try anything else.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best.  Smells good and leaves your skin feeling good.  great for all over your body including hair and face.  Won&#x27;t over dry you.</li>
            <li> I read reviews and did a bit of research on african black soap and I must say, I was in the frame of mind that \\&quot;this is too good to be true\\&quot; when I ordered.  Well, it IS too good and it IS true!  The soap is a luxurious experience right when you open the package.  The beautiful, crisp, clean scent fills the room and is an instant air freshener. I have been looking for a natural soap that was affordable and this is it.  When you first use it, your skin will feel \\&quot;squeaky\\&quot; clean and that may be a bit odd for some but we are all so used to the chemicals in our soaps that we don&#x27;t realize what natural clean is like.  I have read reviews that some users experience a tingly (or itchy) feeling at first but this didn&#x27;t happen to me and I have sensitive skin.  If you are on the fence about buying this soap, I would highly recommend you give it a try.  For all you over 40 moms (like me) out there, use this and coconut oil for a moisturizer and be ready for the compliments on your youthful appearance to start flooding in.  :)</li>
            <li> This soap is truly great! I have eczema and since I have used it I barely use my cream that my dermatologist prescribed for me! I highly recommend this item the only thing is don&#x27;t use it with white wash cloths! But other than that it washes off shower and leaves my skin feeling so nice!</li>
            <li> Always comes on time and well packed. It works real good in removing dead skin cells and clearing skin up.</li>
            <li> been using it for about a week now. so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ive been using the expensive recommended by staff that work in beauty product area, which 90% alwasy gave me rash or dosent do anything, wasting my money.... so took a chance at this soap instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this soap is really nice, not too strong, but the smell isnt light either. the soap makes you really dry after using the soap though, so really recommend that you put on lotion right after wards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will update after more time has past...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;so the time has past.....&lt;br /&gt;the soap isnt bad or good. i cant really say if its making my skin any better since i dont check every single day and keep record of if its doing good or bad, but it hasnt gotten bad either.( no rashes!) so i say its all good and fine.</li>
            <li> Great soap, seems to rinse off well, leaving me squeaky clean. I don&#x27;t get that slimy feeling that other soaps leave.</li>
            <li> I first bought and used this soap when suggested by my African hair braider.  I was a little skeptical because the soap was a dark color (foams dark brown too.)  But, it had a nice smell so it was worth a try.  I was currently using the Goats Milk Soap - I like it, but it has a funny smell.  Once I used the black soap I really liked it. The fragrance and it has rough pieces that help to exfoliate the skin.  So I officially switched soaps.  It was much cheaper buying this product from Amazon.</li>
            <li> WHEN IT ARRIVED IN MY SUB &amp; SAV ORDER W/OTHER ITEMS- IT SMELLED SO STRONG, THE WHOLE BOX HAD A SMELL. SO I WAS A BIT CONCERNED IF IT WAS GOING TO BE &amp;#34;GOOD&amp;#34; OR NOT? I PERSONALLY LIKE STRONG SMELLS, LAUNDRY, AIR FRESHENER, SO I GAVE IT A SHOT!&lt;br /&gt;WHEN I USED IT ON MY BODY , MY SKIN FELT NICE*, CLEAN ,BUT NOT* STRIPPED!! IT WAS NOT DRYING LIKE OTHER &amp;#34;BAR SOAPS&amp;#34; I&#x27;VE TRIED. I ENJOYED IT!  THEN MY FACE... I USED IT BEFORE PUTTING ON MY OWN SELF MADE VIT.C SERUM. MY FACE HAD A SLIGHT, VERY SLIGHT TINGLE TO IT, NOTHING TOO STRONG OR BOTHERSOME- , IT SUBSIDED WITHIN 30 secs. I LIKED THE FEELING , AS IF IT WAS GETTING INTO MY SKIN&amp; PORES, DOING &amp;#34;SOMETHING&amp;#34; ( at least! Lol) . MY FACE DOES SEEM TO LOOK BETTER, &amp; IT DEF FEELS GOOD , SOFTER!!  NOW, I HAVE BEEN USING A SELF MADE VIT.C SERUM ( SOOO EASY TO MAKE &amp; COST PENNY&#x27;S A BOTTLE!! ) , &amp; STARTED ABOUT THE SAME TIME AS THE SOAP USE, SO IM NOT SURE IF THE QUICK DIFFERENCE I &amp; OTHERS HAVE NOTICED IS FROM THE SOAP ALONE OR BOTH TOGETHER ( probably both!) ?&lt;br /&gt; BUT I REALLY LIKE THE SOAP, yea it leaves a little brown water/soap in soap dish, no biggie ppl! NO BROWM IN MY TUB &amp; I TRIED IT BY ITSELF( like it better) AND ON A WASHCLOTH , light colored too see , &amp; NO IT DIDN&#x27;T STAIN IT! IT RINSED OFF MY WASHCLOTH COMPLETELY, JUST FYI AS OTHERS HAVE COMMENTED ON IT STAINING TUBS, WASHCLOTHS ETC. I HAD NO ISSUE W/THAT AT ALL...&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY LIKE THIS SOAP &amp; HOPE IT DOES SOME OTHER &amp;#34;CLAIMS&amp;#34; THAT IT&#x27;S KNOWN FOR, BUT I WILL STILL USE IT EVEN IF I DIDN&#x27;T DO ANY MIRACLES , BECAUSE THE FEELING &amp; EFFECTS I AM ALREADY NOTICING ARE WORTH IT JUST FOR THOSE ALONE!!&lt;br /&gt;** WILL UPDATE AFTER I HAVE USED IT AWHILE , WETHER I NOTICE ANY BIG DIFFERENCES, GOOD OR BAD*&lt;br /&gt; AS FOR THE SMELL, I REALLY LIKE IT NOW, LOL- ONCE IT&#x27;S WET &amp; YOU USE IT , THE SMELL IS LESS STRONG &amp; IT&#x27;S FROM NATURAL CITRUS , &amp;OTHER INGREDIENTS... SO DON&#x27;T LET SMELL PUT YOU OFF BUYING THIS! ( unless your REALLY SENSITIVE to smells, then maybe, but I&#x27;d still try it!)&lt;br /&gt;4 STARS, ONLY BECAUSE IM WAITING TO SEE IF I GET SOME OF THE GREATER BENEFITS FROM IT, BUT REALLY, I WAS CLOSE TO GIVING IT 5 STARS EVEN AS IS, WITHOUT ANY SUPER BENEFITS!&lt;br /&gt;I WILL DEF BUY MORE , NO MATTER WHAT!

            <li> Love this product. the speed in which the company delivered the product was awesome!!!! thanks.</li>
            <li> smells good and feels good</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap because of all the great reviews I read about it but please don&#x27;t be fooled liked I was. This soap is very harsh on your skin not only does it severly dry your skin out to the point where it begins to itch it also takes off your finger nail polish. I couldn&#x27;t figure out why the polish on my newly manicured nails would not stay on until I stopped using this soap. I would not recommend using this soap because it is very harsh on skin and nail polish. After a few days of use my skin or my nails couldn&#x27;t take anymore abuse. What I thougt was a great deal for 8 bars of soap turned out to be a waste.</li>
            <li> Great product. I love what it is doing for my skin</li>
            <li> I have used this product as an all-over body soap and in the art studio where I am constantly in contact with harsh paints, solvents, etc. The soap makes my hands feel instantly restored. My daughter who has had eczema her whole life also uses this product with wonderful results - we are Northern European by heritage with extremely dry itchy skin and this is now our soap! Incidentally, I&#x27;ve discovered it also keep natural bristle brushes in wonderfully supple condition - probably not it&#x27;s intended use, but far better than anything else I have used.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap! Leaves your skin feeling so clear &amp; clean! Takes away acne like no other products! I&#x27;m in my mid 30s &amp; just started getting acne and this soap is the only thing that clears it up! Highly recommend</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this on my body...no problems. Then I used this on my face on a frequent basis. For 2 weeks to be exact. I have always had clear skin. After the first week I noticed small bumps. Then I got cystic type small&lt;br /&gt;Bumps all over my face. I just chalked it up as being the fact that I use oils in my hair and wrap my hair at night . At the same time I was on Medifast and thought it was that. But I had never had a problem with Medifast before. After not using the Dudu Osun for 2 days my skin is finally clearing up. Will never use again.</li>
            <li> I bought 1 bar of this soap, hoping it would help with my acne and dry skin. I&#x27;ve only used it for four days, and it feels like my face is on fire. I have slightly sensitive skin, but not overly so. I am very disappointed in this product. I doubt I&#x27;ll be using it again.</li>
            <li> This soap does wonders for the skin and aura. I use it daily and generates a lovely lather.  Ever since using this soap, I feel like my skin is glowing and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m the only one who notices. While walking down the street, a gentleman who looked similar to me approached me at random and said, \\&quot;Damn, I&#x27;m jealous, you look younger than me!\\&quot; It also seems to be increasing the magnetism between me and the opposite sex. I&#x27;ve never gotten this much attention before. Sometimes it shocks me! LOL!</li>
            <li> Great soap. Leaves skin so soft compared to other black soaps and god forbid using dove or Irish spring. I even use it on my hair. It bleeds black quite a bit, however, I think all soaps bleed, just this one is more noticeable.</li>
            <li> Honestly, i am leery of buying products from Nigeria. There dont seem to be many checks and balances as far as anything goes in that country. The strong rule, the weak suffer. However, after reading all the reviews, i decided to give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;First off, the name Dudu-osun (but specifically the Dudu part) was a hilarious way to tease my kids. Imagine their shock at finding a dark brown bar of soap named \\&quot;Dudu\\&quot; in the shower. Priceless! In fact, that alone would have made the purchase worth it.&lt;br /&gt;However, the real truth is that the soap smells and feels great, and leaves my skin feeling and looking healthier. I admit, that isnt really a problem for me, but my girlfriend has some skin issues from time to time, and she absolutely loves this soap as well. I can see the difference in fact.&lt;br /&gt;So, thumbs up and five stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second time I&#x27;ve bought this. The first time, i bought the four pack...now, the six pack.</li>
            <li> I have dry skin and I was a little nervous about trying this soap after reading the other reviews.  The first time I could tell it was like no soap I&#x27;ve ever tried before.  It was tingly.  Kinda hard to explain... but tingly in a good way, not bad.  After a week or so, I noticed my skin was much softer.  Also, I used to get occasional breakouts, and that has all gone away.  I use it on face and body, and now my skin is more smooth and even and clear than it was before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried all the drug store lotions and body washes and spent tons of money.  This is the best thing ever.  You won&#x27;t feel like your covered with slick lotions and heavy perfumes.  You just feel clean.  I recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recently purchased some Dudu-Osun at a local beauty supply store and came to Amazon the check the reviews- the reviews were terrific and I was excited to try it. I bought it based on the all-natural ingredients and I was curious to try some authentic black soap from Africa. I was not disappointed! This soap transforms into a creamy rich lather as you wash with it- a little goes a very long way. Another reviewer&#x27;s words kept coming to mind- she called it \\&quot;brown silk\\&quot; and that is what it feels like- it is luxuriously silky and foamy and smells lovely too. You can use this soap head to toe- I wash my hair, body, face and even the most intimate areas- all smooth silky and smelling great! Even better- after a couple of uses my skin is feeling touchably soft and silky. One thing that seems to be true that other reviewers said was that my face is having some minor breakouts although it also is starting to feel softer and is looking more radiant- I am hoping my skin will clear up to reveal lovely results and I&#x27;ll keep everyone posted-</li>
            <li> Was the second time just bought, very good quality, very suitable for oily skin and acne skin.</li>
            <li> i purchased this for my son.he had eczema and this really soothes the skin.WE cured his eczema with a product called eczema no more.we are using the soap to smooth and even his skin tone now that the eczema is gone.and its 6 bars for 13 dollars not 13 dollars each bar,as someone indicated.with free shipping!!!</li>
            <li> I do not like this soap. It&#x27;s my own fault for straying from nasabb, but the amazon reviews make it sound like this Dudu-Osun is pretty much the same thing. It is not. What, did they add black dye to the soap?    Cons: Peculiar \\&quot;sweet\\&quot; smell (although that might be a pro for some)  The dye. I do not want brown water streaming down my arms. That is SO unnecessary, and seems an affected authenticity--like, \\&quot;It&#x27;s called black soap, so make sure it looks black and turns water brown!\\&quot;    Pros: I&#x27;m sure there are some, but I was so put off by the dye that I don&#x27;t use the soap.    I might liquefy the bar I&#x27;ve already used, put it in a pump and use it as a liquid soap. Meanwhile, it seems a shame to throw the rest away, so if anyone would like five unopened bars of this stuff, just let me know. I will gladly send them to you, no charge. I want rid of it.</li>
            <li> This soap is good , it has helped keep my face fairly clean and no contains no artificial ingredients , face feels smooth , leathers a lot , very user friendly , I would recommend it for any one looking for a good face cleaner and it is very affordable</li>
            <li> I will get straight to the point.  I ordered this soap during my deployment to Saudi Arabia.  Prior to purchasing Dudu-Osun I have been using Dove (pretty much every scent) for the past 4 years.  I didn&#x27;t know if I was having a reaction to the water or the soap itself but I began to break out!  I have oily clear skin on my face and slight acne on my shoulders with a few scratches/ scars here and there from playing basketball.  My face peeled and burned for the first 2 weeks.  I had a patch of little scabs on my nose.  But I stopped washing my face with a wash cloth and lathered the soap in my hands.  I have never had a problem since then.  I will say that it does dry out my sking.  Not worst than Ivory soap but you should follow this up with unrefined shea butter.  Many of my battle wounds on my arms from people swiping at the basketball as I drive to the lane have pretty much disapeared.  You can barely see them so I think this soap does a great job at evening my sking tone.  Also the little breakouts I would get on my shoulder and behind my triceps has started to clear up.  I think its best at evening your skin tone!  I would recommend this product but will also try Dr. Brommers castille soap cause from what I have read it is supposed to be a great moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I have pretty sensitive skin and was terrified from the reviews with people talking about their skin getting irritated and red after use. I have to admit, it&#x27;s a weird experience to use this soap. It does burn, especially if you leave it on for a while and that was especially terrifying when I first used it. I was convinced after using it the first few times that I&#x27;d get out of the shower, dry off, and look like a tomato. Not the case at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin does feel a little dryer after use than typical soap. But wow, my skin is looking better all over in the last month than it ever has. My back acne is all but gone, and the redness on my face is almost gone, my skin tone is evening up. Definitely recommend, but it may not be for everyone.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t particularly care for the smell of this soap, but it does leave your skin soft.  Plus who doesn&#x27;t like yelling, hey honey you left your dudu in the shower.</li>
            <li> Great for skin, especially great knowing that the ingredients are natural.</li>
            <li> This soap is absolutely wonderful. It does not take much water to lather up. A little goes a long way. I like to keep this soap dry after use as it leaves a brown stain. I use this on my daughters sensitive skin and I also use it to wash my hair.</li>
            <li> I bought this based on everyone&#x27;s reviews.&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I cannot comment on its effectiveness for skin issues that it claims to help heal - I didn&#x27;t get it for this reason. I just wanted to get an all-natural soap for everyday use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap doesn&#x27;t smell that great (it has that generic, strong cheap soap smell, the kind you&#x27;d find at the dollar store - no hint of honey or shea butter or any of the other ingredients listed), but more importantly, I find that it is harsher than other soaps I&#x27;ve used - I find that it irritates the sensitive/private areas. No other soap that I&#x27;ve used has had this effect (and mostly, I don&#x27;t use organic or all-natural soaps).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be re-ordering it.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap back in early August and noticed wonderful change in my skin. My used to be always oily skin that would get blackheads and breakouts became my dryish skin that only gets small ever-fading nose blackheads and a couple small zits. It gives a fantastic clean that means I can skip one day without a shower and not feel absolutely disgusting like I used to. It didn&#x27;t make my acne scar disappear but my skin does have a much more even complexion. It&#x27;s down to a state that I can tolerate and not feel self-concious about. For Christmas, everyone I know is getting this soap.</li>
            <li> Great natural soap. Smells wonderful.</li>
            <li> This soap is the reason my face has had excellent skin for the last 15 years. I remember when it was just a brown box (not tropical). I used to like that one more, but now I have gotten used to the newer tropical version. Can&#x27;t imagine living without this.</li>
            <li> love DUDU OSUN! has cleared up my acne 100%! I will never go back to store bought acne products</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for a little over a week and and my skin has cleared up wonderfully. i&#x27;ve now brought some to the office and passed it our to my female coworker to try.     time to order more. :)</li>
            <li> I am 43, incredibly pale (Northern European heritage) and have overly sensitive, extremely dry skin, and I love this soap! Great fresh smell, nice lather and leaves your skin feeling lifted, clean and soft.  I&#x27;ve noticed it cleans so deep that I use less moisturizer, wrinkle cream and sunblock because your skin is able to absorb more effectively when deeply clean.  Throw in the natural ingredients without added chemicals and the like and I feel I have (finally) found my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; daily soap.    After using it for a couple weeks, my love has only grown.  The little bumps on my upper arms are virtually gone, a blemish above my lip that would not go away (even with prodding and an \\&quot;ultra-sonic\\&quot; face cleaner) has flattened, faded and is nearly gone.    I passed this soap onto my sister whom is experiencing a three year battle with hives and other assorted problems, her first reaction was incredibly positive, I&#x27;ll keep you informed of her longer term use (and be back to buy more if she continues to like it).    As soon as I can better figure my family&#x27;s usage rates, and the shelf life (natural products have shorter lives - as they should), I&#x27;ll be back to buy more.    Great product and is highly recommended for anyone trying to break free of some of our chemical laden lives.  Plus my skin feels, in the words of my sister, \\&quot;as soft as a baby&#x27;s bum.\\&quot;  Can&#x27;t beat that.</li>
            <li> I read so much about this soap that I finally decided to order some and give it a try. Well, my skin was smoother after a week but on my daughter, her skin tended to go a bit dry. It smells nice and I loved it, but it was quite strange to watch the dark brown water coming off me from using this. We are not used to seeing that, so it took some getting used to. I wish the suds were not brown... but it is what it is. We&#x27;ve affectionately named it the doo-doo soap for that reason.</li>
            <li> Maybe before this product was good but now it&#x27;s a worst. I read a reviews bought it and I been disapointed. No lightening effect at all in black african skin</li>
            <li> Love this black soap! It&#x27;s the only one that work on my skin.</li>
            <li> I have \\&quot;problem\\&quot; skin. The very first entry in my baby book was \\&quot;she has a rash - to the doctor\\&quot;. Not a typical baby rash, either. I have KP and nothing has really helped much over the years. I also live in the desert and genetically have dry skin. This soap does not dry my skin out any more than any other soap and it&#x27;s probably actually less drying than other soaps. I&#x27;ve noticed a decrease in my KP. I like things that have a natural, organic fragrance and this does. The discoloration from the soap washes out of the washcloth in the laundry. But even if it didn&#x27;t, buy a bundle of inexpensive washcloths and use them for that. Definitely worth the price of $5 or so. I plan to use this soap for a loooooonnnnng time. It really is quite nice.</li>
            <li> I use when I shave my head, helps stop the razor bumbs , also bathe with it to help with dry skin itching.</li>
            <li> It seems good soap..it didn&#x27;t work for me:( I&#x27;m having allergy with the soap...&amp;#34;I got redness all over my body and itchy  and super dry.....So after 4days I stop using and I use alovera gell and I&#x27;m glad it work for me to stop itchy .. ..so I gave it to my husband and he like it..he said good soap and it work for him ....</li>
            <li> Delivers what it iis describe</li>
            <li> I really love the way my face feels so clean! It feels like it tightens it up too, wouldn&#x27;t it be great if my wrinkles vanished haha. One can hope! Anyways,  I highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I first tried this soap in April 2010 after hearing so many good reviews about it on youtube. When I finally bought a 4 pack and tested it, it was so harsh on my skin! I was itchy, red, and my skin was always on fire. I gave up after using 2 bars and left the other 2 in my cabinet and forgot about it. In April 2011 (exactly one year later) I was moving from my apartment into my new house and was packing up the cabinet and discovered it. I figured, hey why not try it. I&#x27;ve been using it now for a month and a half and I absolutely love it. My skin is so clear and so moisturized and best of all, NO MORE ITCHING! Dark spots have faded and my skin is just glowing from within. This stuff is fantastic.</li>
            <li> This soap is good to use every day for the body only not the face. For the face twice a week is great.</li>
            <li> The only soap that I use on my face... I&#x27;ve purchased this soap for years and I swear by it. It has eliminated my dark spots and keeps bumps away. It makes a mess, but the soap is excellent. The lather is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever seen with any soap.</li>
            <li> Helped a little but certainly removes oil from your skin need to lotion afterwards or else you in trouble bro.</li>
            <li> I had tried everything for my acne prone skin.  I&#x27;ve gone threw countless prescriptions, microdermabrasions, chemical peels, all natural remedies, but nothing would work.  I got pregnant and alot of the stuff I normally used was off limits. I had deep cyctic acne all around my jaw line and it extended up to my cheeks.  I stumbled upon Dudu Soap while shopping on Amazon and after reading the reviews I figured why not.  I could read all the ingredients and knew what they were.  The soap came and the first thing I noticed was how clean it smelled.  I used it along with some shea butter as a moisturizer and within a week there was a difference in my skin.  After a month all my acne was gone and I had an amazing glow to my skin.  I&#x27;ve recommended this soap to all my family and friends.  It&#x27;s amazing!</li>
            <li> I live by this soap and when I don&#x27;t use it I have outbreaks</li>
            <li> Love the smell.........................I love smelling good and this soap is as clean and refreshing as it get. Not to mention the goodness of the original black soap mixed with honey (my fav). This is good stuff, recommend this hands down...........</li>
            <li> I was hoping this soap would be gentle like a few other brands i have tried of African black soap.&lt;br /&gt;Beware of this product as it is very different from the typical stuff you find a health food stores (at least in San Francisco bay area). The fragrance used on this soap is very strong, it smells a bit like pine tree/ Christmas tree sap very close to floor cleaner smell. It is super irritating.  If you have sensitive skin  avoid this product. I would recommend Shea Moisture African Black Soap instead. Shea Moisture&#x27;s soap is very gentle and helps control oily skin as well as help with ingrown hair irritation, sure its more expensive, but at this moment i rather just have two bars of gentle soap than 8 of this irritating product, ugh 12 dollars down the drain. Literally.</li>
            <li> This soap smells very refreshing and clean.  The texture when wet is a little scratchy but I like that.  Doesn&#x27;t seem to be doing anything special to my excema but it&#x27;s not making it worse.  I like it.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. I have suffered from acne for over 20 years and this is the best cleanser I have used.</li>
            <li> i just recently bought the soap so my review is not as detailed. I have now used it for 3 day &amp; all i can say is wow! It left my skin feeling so fresh &amp; clean. The smell is very mild &amp; tropical, i love it! It lathers really well too &amp; the brownish color washes away really easily in the tub. I haven&#x27;t felt any irritation or tingling as some people claim. I will continue using it all over my body &amp; will be back in one month for updates. But i have a feeling i finally found the best kept secret!   I am also planning on using it on my sisterlock as a shampoo.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about 3 months and have seen less Rosacea breakouts then before. My esthetician mentioned I should look into this soap to help with my server red bumps. I purchased this particular brand and use this once per day and then the witch hazel afterwards and my skin looks great. One thing to note is you should not get the soap to close to your eyes because it burns. The bar of soap lasts for a long time and smells great. I did pass along a few bars of soap to friend and they also love it for their skin.</li>
            <li> I have psoriasis all over my face and spots of it pretty well on a large portion on my body.. This soap has been a life saver. I use it about once to twice a day to wash my face and then moisturize later with Shea butter and it has helped the over all look of my psoriasis quite a bit. I haven&#x27;t been able to find any other soap or product that can do what this soap does. My no means does it make it all disappear and go away but help yes! It mainly helps reduce the redness and the flakiness I experience. If I don&#x27;t use it and miss a day, my face will be twice as red and about twice as flaky. By no means is it a cure but it does do a good job managing the problem!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used lots of stuff for my acne, like creams, ointments, various treatments, but nothing worked. I kept having breakouts. A family member of mine gave me this and said I should try it. It has cleared my face right up. I don&#x27;t use anything but this now, I love it!</li>
            <li> Bought a lot of times DUDU OSUN black soap, and family and friends are in use, the effect is very very satisfied</li>
            <li> I like this soap even though it does dry your skin. Just make sure to lotion up right after the shower. This keeps my pimple free while toning my skin</li>
            <li> This soap has helped my kids faces and my daughters eczema</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve heard plenty of raving reviews about this soap so I decided to give it try. It is definitely worth the hype! I been using this product for 4 days now and my blemishes and dark spots are already fading! In order to get the maximum results, rinse your face with cold water, because if you rinse it with hot water it will burn. Also be sure to use little product and gentle hands.</li>
            <li> very good, fast shipping</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this soap for over a year now. We are both hooked. I love the way this soap gets you so squeaky clean. It zaps those annoying zits you can sometimes get on your face. The only draw back is, this soap will stain your wash clothes. So I suggest using dark ones.</li>
            <li> Bought these for my girlfriend, but use it myself as well.     We&#x27;re the kind of folk that shop at Trader Joe&#x27;s and Whole Foods so she doesn&#x27;t use just ANY soap.    This stuff smells great and cleans very well.    A note though - it gets used up quick and is messy!     You lather up in brown suds, but wash off clean.    Highly recommended</li>
            <li> It caused my skin so itchy and red bumps.&lt;br /&gt;Wasted of money.</li>
            <li> This is the best soap!! My Grands with eczema are helped with this!</li>
            <li> Very cheaply made (in Nigeria, so what do you expect, besides an e-mail scam?).. the soap smells great, but it runs all over your shower&#x27;s floor, like black mud. It leaves residue behind, that is mud-brown in color. The soap is cheap, easy to use (add water, use a washcloth, do NOT insert in mouth or rectum). All in all, a great deal for the price, but it&#x27;s soap. Ignore the hype on amazon.com. If you want biodegradeable soap that smells like Renuzit air freshener and don&#x27;t mind the \\&quot;running\\&quot; of the soap, then grab this soap. I plan, personally, to stick to French triple-milled soaps and pay a bit more for less mess.</li>
            <li> Leaves your skin with a good amount of moisture. It&#x27;s a great addition to my beauty routine.</li>
            <li> 1st. The shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;2nd. The bars sometimes shed some of the soap particles.&lt;br /&gt;3rd. The soap smells really good..&lt;br /&gt;4th. If left on skin for a while, it begins to burn, so do not leave on skin for a while.&lt;br /&gt;5th. Leaves skin so soft, and tight.&lt;br /&gt;6th. BUY IT!</li>
            <li> As good as our regular black soap with a very pleasant scent to boot!</li>
            <li> Love the smell and confused about how dirty I really am with the rinse water.  Not really, I love the soap.</li>
            <li> I read all of the reviews and was rather worried about this soap. I am fair skinned, blond hair, green eyes and I have to say this soap leaves my skin soft, even without a moisturizer after use.  I love the smell of the soap and I experienced no itching or burning, even on my private parts.  All I know is how it worked for me and I suggest giving it a try.  I live in Montana where the winters can be brutal on one&#x27;s skin and this soap gives me hope that I won&#x27;t experience the extreme dryness that I have experienced without it.</li>
            <li> Great soap. Helps my 74 year old mother&#x27;s sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> It is a really nice product.</li>
            <li> It is such an incredible soap--I use it for everything I can!  Smells very nice (like flowers) and is certainly a cheaper option in comparison to other soaps (i.e., Dr. Bronners)</li>
            <li> My favourite soap, and the best deal I can find on it. I shave with it, and bathe with it. It&#x27;s great for razor burn and sensitive skin, and I like the subtle scent. Way to be NewLifeBotanicals!</li>
            <li> Delivery was on time and the product is exactly what I expected</li>
            <li> Bought the 6 pack and only got through a week of using it. It dried out my skin so much and made me break out so I gave up. I&#x27;ve read that some people have an &#x27;initial breakout&#x27; but I don&#x27;t have the patience for that personally.</li>
            <li> good to use, never used so good soap! I love it, and will buy again when I finish these 12.</li>
            <li> First soap I&#x27;ve ever used that did not dry out my skin.</li>
            <li> Really good soap. Amazon has one of the best prices for the amount. A bar has lasted me a month now.</li>
            <li> I have reordered this a couple times. Very easy on my eczema and smells good. No filmy residue. My wife likes it too.</li>
            <li> This is great for sensitive skin and rashes. I sometimes have a bit of eczema during certain seasons and this will knock it out quickly. It doesn&#x27;t smell great but it works great. I will warn you that if you keep it in the shower, it can dissolve pretty easily.</li>
            <li> After using this soap for a week, I can&#x27;t say I LOVE this soap, but I can&#x27;t say I hate this soap, either.  Presentation-wise, it&#x27;s not like other soaps which keep their form since it&#x27;s packed like a very large muddy ill-formed soapbar from the start and while bathing, it breaks down in brown/black muddy pieces.  BUT it&#x27;s wonderfully perfume fragrant with decent lather and after washing with it, I can tell it&#x27;s a natural soap because I don&#x27;t feel my skin get tight and itchy as is usual with mainstream soaps which have chemicals in them.  I have normal, not sensitive skin so I don&#x27;t know how it would work on sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s a great bargain deal for such a small price for a mainly natural soap which also has a good fragrance.  My problem is an abundance of riches with all the different types of luxurious organic and non-organic soaps I have which give me a better pampering bathing experience compared to this soap.  Still, if I had to pick a natural soap while saving my $$&#x27;s AND i didn&#x27;t care about having a luxurious bathing experience, I&#x27;d pick this soap which gives you 6 large soapbars, albeit ugly-looking &amp; feeling, for a lowly bargain price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As long as you don&#x27;t really care how your soap looks or feels, I would recommend it as fine for aromatherapy and everyday use, but not as a gift to a friend since the packaging and product form leaves a lot to be desired unless it&#x27;s a friend with sensitive skin or who likes dabbling with natural and/or organic products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other more pleasing appearance/texture, good lather, high quality organic soaps are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B00429PC8K South Of France - Twin Pack, French Milled Vegetable Soap - Lavender, 4.25-Ounces Bars  (Pack of 3)]] which is #1 on my list with soft texture, triple milled made in the french way but made in the US&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B000IQSU0I Pre de Provence Milk Soap, 250g wrapped bar.

            <li> Hi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product cannot be send to the my designated address. I need to know the reason why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kind regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charity</li>
            <li> This soap is great for me especially with my adult acne prone skin. If you have normal skin, slightly dry like my daughter, you will only want to use this maybe 3x per week (and only once per day then)</li>
            <li> Okay Guys, Read much of the reviews before attempting to put in my two cents. I thought I&#x27;d add more then \\&quot;this is aWESome!!!\\&quot; or \\&quot;I turned into a supermodel after just ONE use!!\\&quot; or \\&quot;WoW\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why I like it:&lt;br /&gt;* It evens out my skin tone&lt;br /&gt;* It smooths my skin&lt;br /&gt;* Brightens my skin tone (Yes it lightens a shade meaning very subtle-not enough to change my race)&lt;br /&gt;* Encourages me to moisturize (This baby is not your average soap.You will look ashy if you&#x27;re dark. Lighter skin? Please moisturize too! You can&#x27;t see it but it&#x27;s there.)&lt;br /&gt;* Great for body cracks, ash, bumps, roughs etc (Please don&#x27;t use on abrasions or cuts. You&#x27;re welcome!)&lt;br /&gt;* This soap is inexpensive and will last longer then most soap. (not the kind you would want to luxuriously rub or love yourself down for 20 mins under the shower without walking around with sensitive skin.....looking like a some sun burn victim)&lt;br /&gt;* Love the smell. I put a box in every other closet and the underwear/sock drawers. I take it out for the smell to mellow out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* This baby is HARSH!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0.&amp;lt; Tips:(this works for me..)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I make a shower gel out of the soap shavings and I dilute the crap out of it.&lt;br /&gt;2. I use it at night or when i plan to have a lazy day indoors. Why? I want to wash this thing off again in a morning shower in case of phytodermatitis(google it along with lime juice...some of you might be experiencing this if you don&#x27;t wash the soap off properly).&lt;br /&gt;3. I use the duduosun diluted gel in the shower over entire body (every other day)then chase it with coca butter soap then a bath oil during winter. I wash my sensitive areas with the second soap.&lt;br /&gt;4. Works on dry lips.&lt;br /&gt;5. Do not keep this thing on your face for more then a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;6. Good shampoo. Good for Dandruff(guy uses it every other day). Will lighten hair. I use a hair oil before hand because it is can be drying especially for kinky hair plus I want to protect from sun sensitivity.(goes well with Indian Vatika hair oil). Works awesome for both our hair types.(Noticed that it makes his face stubble softer)&lt;br /&gt;7. I use an overnight moisturizing mask. Awesome combination. My favorite is Origins Drink Up(tm) Intensive.&lt;br /&gt;8. Would not use this as makeup remover because of the delicate skin around my eyes.(usually the first to become sensitive if used too long)&lt;br /&gt;9. I use the dudu every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW: Recommended Estee Lauder Night Serum to friend when she ignored my tips(using the soap-bar against her face...silly girl. smh). It helped soothe her skin.A mask/misting of organic pure rosewater(sans alcohol) and 100% pure aloe(not the crap gel with added chemicals..the plant is best while 100% store brought is good)helps too!from sun sensitivity.(goes well with Indian Vatika hair oil).

            <li> I truly love this soap it seems to work well with my skin and I feel completely clean when I use it. If you have sensitive or delicate skin it might be a bit too dehydrating or irritable for your skin. A good moisturizer after use is recommend in my opinion no matter what your skin type but I love it all the same for its clarifying and skin smoothing properties.</li>
            <li> It smell well and give full measure.It seem to be natural ingredients and  no stimulation.This toilet soap lathers so nicely.</li>
            <li> I like this black soap a lot.  I have been using it for a while now and wanted to wait to review.  It&#x27;s 5 star quality, but I deducted a star because if you have light color wash cloths, then it will leave a dark residue that is challenging to remove.  This soap does stain.  The soap itself is solid and good for the skin.  It produces a nice lather.  initially, I thought this was great for the face, but I think my face adapted, so now I switch between this and shae butter.</li>
            <li> Great soap. I feel so extra clean after using it. Second time ordering it</li>
            <li> We absolutely love this soap! Makes your skin feel so clean; helps if you have acne &amp; helps if your skin is too dry! It&#x27;s amazing...like a cure all! Have gotten several other people to try it, and now they are hooked on it, too. Plus, my husband uses it for his hair, which is fine and somewhat oily, and loves it! We will definitely keep buying it!</li>
            <li> I have oily, acne-prone skin and while researching, I read that black soap is really good for my skin type. I have used other types before with ok results, but  Dudu-Osun is the best brand of it that I&#x27;ve found so far. It&#x27;s not a miracle product, so it doesn&#x27;t clear up your skin overnight, but it really conditions the skin well without over-drying it and I&#x27;ve found that my scars have faded over time and my skin feels soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be warned though, it may make your skin feel irritated the first time you use it, it did that to me. After I washed my face with it the first time I freaked because because it tingled uncomfortably, and I wasn&#x27;t expecting that, so I thought I might be allergic. I checked myself out after a few minutes and I saw no redness, there was no itching or swelling, and I haven&#x27;t really felt that sensation since then unless I accidentally get it on my lips. I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a common effect or if it is just my skin being sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap lathers really quickly and has a very smooth texture. It almost feels like rubbing liquid silk on your face, and you don&#x27;t need a lot to get the effect. I just washed my face with it about 3 minutes ago and haven&#x27;t used any moisturizer and my skin feels soft an smooth and not tight and dry. You may still want to use a moisturizer but I find that even if I don&#x27;t, my skin doesn&#x27;t overproduce oil to compensate like it used to with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the smell too, very natural and pleasant. I&#x27;m trying to place it but the best I can come up with is a pleasant woodsy plant smell with a hint of something sweet. It&#x27;s not floral but it&#x27;s a sweet light plant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it! I&#x27;m seriously thinking about throwing out my body soap and just using this one for everything, it&#x27;s that good.</li>
            <li> start of by saying that i&#x27;ve read so many reviews on this product and most of them weren&#x27;t so good. most of them were regarding Irritation to the skin and so such breakouts; which got me thinking if i should proceed. but i decided to at least give it try. i have sensitive skin. i&#x27;ve noticed that a lot of people used the whole bar of soap on their face. which honestly sensitive or not u should take baby steps with new products. so i began with rubbing the soap in the palm of my hands; you don&#x27;t need that much. apply to your face. use both hands to rub each sides in circular motion. make sure you get your whole face because the parts you don&#x27;t rub will absorb the soap quick. you don&#x27;t need to scrub your face that long. give it about 2-3mins. then just wash it of with luke warm water. so this is the part where some times my face feels very clean but just a little sting but it&#x27;s not that bad. but due to my sensitive skin i quick apply honey oatmeal naturally facial scrub. (you can find it any store, i got mine from Walgreens) do the same thing by scrubbing your face for 1-2 mins and wash it off. pat your face dry and if your face still feels a little stinging or irritated. just apply 100% Aloe Vera Gel. trust me the Aloe Vera Gel will cool the irritation down. i know these are more steps to washing your face but honestly i have good results so far and it&#x27;s my second day of usage. my face has cleared up a little. my acne scars have lighten up; which i am very happy about because i have been using these expensive brands and nothing has work or showed my quick results. so once again use Aloe Vera Gel if any irritation please.</li>
            <li> be prepared for ultra strong smell--to the extend that i need to double zip lock the rest of un-used unopened soap to avoid the smell getting everywhere; but the soap itself is buttery and i will buy again</li>
            <li> I tried the Dudu Osun Black Soap as soon as it arrived [because I was recently having trouble with my unfortunate delicate skin breaking out] and all I can say is that I&#x27;m delighted that I made this discovery. Even after the first use I was highly pleased by the way it left my skin feeling smooth and refreshed. I&#x27;d also like to add that the soap has a unique scent that I really enjoy. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a couple of days now and can already see an astounding difference in my skin. I can not wait to see the results I get within a few weeks!</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it&#x27;s starting to do some wondrous work on my skin.</li>
            <li> I PURCHASED THIS SOAP THINKING IT WOULD BE GOOD JUDGING FROM THE REVIEWS BUT I HAD NO IDEA.  IN MY 20&#x27;S I STARTED GETTING DARK BROWN SPOTS - LOOKS LIKE FRECKLES, AND MOLES ON MY FACE, CHEST &amp; SHOULDERS. I AM NOW 56 YEARS OLD.  THE DERMATOLOGIST SAID IT WAS MELASMA &amp; WAS HERITITARY, MY HERITAGE IS BLACK, CHEROKEE, FRENCH &amp; IRISH. SHE SAID WEAR SUNBLOCK-WHICH I HAD BEEN DOING FOREVER, &amp; THAT I COULD TRY A CHEMICAL PEEL FOR $250 BUT IT COULD POSSIBLY LEAVE SCARING.  I DID&#x27;NT GO BACK.  THEY GOT MUCH WORSE.  I HAD TRIED EVERYTHING - I THOUGHT. I USED THIS SOAP &amp; PURE UNREFINED SHEA BUTTER.  AFTER ONE USE MY FACE LOOKED BRIGHTER. I THOUGHT IT WAS MY IMAGINATION.  I USED IT MAYBE 2 MORE TIMES &amp; TO MY AMAZEMENT, THEY WERE GETTING LIGHTER. JUST IN CASE IT WAS JUST WISHFUL THINKING; I HAD MY HUSBAND LOOK &amp; HAD HIM KEEP TRACK.  THE VERY NEXT DAY, HE LOOKED AGAIN &amp; NOTICED THEY HAD GOTTEN EVEN LIGHTER OVERNIGHT &amp; SOME HAD DISAPPEARED.  NOW, HE ALSO USES THE SOAP &amp; SHEA BUTTER EXCLUSIVELY.  WE HAVE OTHER NATURAL SOAPS WE THOUGHT WERE GREAT LIKE SHEA BUTTER &amp; OLIVE OIL BUT NON CAN COMPARE TO THIS BLACK SOAP.  WE WILL NOT BE WITHOUT IT.  I ALREADY ORDER 3 MORE BOTTLES IN LIQUID FORM.  THIS STUFF IS GREAT!!!!</li>
            <li> For those that do not like scented soaps this will not be for you. It is very strongly scented. Also, it&#x27;s very dark such that it can \\&quot;dirty\\&quot; your shower or bath. We weren&#x27;t able to use the soap because of the smell so i do not know how well it would work.</li>
            <li> I love this product !! I have been using it for years and have been amazed on how it has changed my problem areas on my face like the acne. My daughter also uses it and she love it for her issues of acne. My husband uses it to shave and does not get razer burn. He said that it is a woman soap so don&#x27;t tell the guys. Public here we come..lol</li>
            <li> I like this soap because it really did help my skin. It started out with more breakouts but eventually it started to clear up and slowly clear my blemishes. I got a little more to clear up but I do see a big difference</li>
            <li> The soap made my skin break out so I&#x27;ve gone back to using Dr. Bronners.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this to cleanse from head to toe. Shortly thereafter, I broke out in hives from head to toe. Clearly not a product for sensitive flowers.</li>
            <li> One word &amp;#34;AWESOME&amp;#34;. It was what I have been looking for!</li>
            <li> I currently use this soap but I was usually paying $4-5 for each bar. I highly recommend this soap for blacks, may be good for others but I just don&#x27;t know. I first started using it to help clear up my face. I wanted something to help close my pores and I had tried all of the expensive stuff at the cosmetics counters and all of the cleansers, masks, toners, exfolliants and peels available at the drug store. I met a women who had the clearest skin I have ever seen she was from West Afria I asked her what she used because her skin was so beautiful, she told me black soap. She told me that is all she ever used and she was at least 40. She was from Ghana and so used what was from her country. I did some research and found out that the so called best black soap came from Nigeria and so I bought it and I LOVE IT!  Best soap you will ever use, I use it all over my body now. Best thing is you can get a good lather, I mean really soap up your wash cloth even when the bar is almost gone. Also if you forget to put on lotion you will NOT be all ashy at he end of the day. You skin feels so good after using this soap exactly how your skin should feel.  *The only bad thing I can think of is Do Not use White or light colored wash cloths they will get stained. Small price to pay, I now use all of my old wash cloths and keep the soap in a plastic soap dish in the shower. However does not stain tub, shower etc. rinses away clean.</li>
            <li> THIS SOAP IS GOOD FOR ANYONE THAT HAS A SKIN DISORDER.  I HAVE ECZEMA BUT WHEN I USE THIS SOAP EVERDAY AND APPLY SHEA BUTTER, I HAVE CLEAR AND HEALTHY SKIN.  SINCE DISCOVERING THIS SOAP AND SHEA BUTTER, I NO LONGER GO TO A DERMATOLOGIST WHICH WAS COSTING ME $$$$.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a light skinned African American that bought this soap for softer skin, fading of dark spots (mainly on my legs), and stretch marks (in combo with pure shea butter). This soap really irritated my skin! First it made my face tingle for a couple of days, then it turned my face red! I also developed tiny bumps on my face, but that could be because of the shea butter. In addition, this soap will lighten your skin so if you don&#x27;t want to get lighter, DO NOT by this soap! I only used it for like 5 days but I think it helped a little with my stretch marks, but that could be because it lightened my skin and my stretch marks are white :-/    Last but not least, I don&#x27;t know why people are saying that they felt so fresh and clean, because I did not. I understand that everyone&#x27;s skin type is different but I felt like I had a layer of soap still on my when I was finished showering.</li>
            <li> I have to say that this is by far one of the best soaps that I have ever used!  The expiration date on my soaps were 2013..more than enough time for me to enjoy the benefits of the six pack ordered.  I have oily, acne prone skin and this soap has helped me to not only dry up acne/oil from my face, but to visibly soften acne marks and smooth my skin all over.  I use this soap all over my body including my face and have never been any softer than this...a true beauty soap!  I will continue to buy for such a great price and the natural quality of this black soap!</li>
            <li> After all the positive reviews I decided I had to try this out to see if it would help with my oily acne prone skin. This soap is nice and creamy and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad but it burns like crazy. I do have sensitive skin but I&#x27;ve never experienced such a strong burning sensation from a soap before. I agree with another reviewer that their ingredients don&#x27;t seem to be accurate as only a few natural items are listed. Using this soap feels like what I would imagine using a chemical cleaner on ones face would feel like.  I would strongly recommend that people with sensitive skin avoid this soap.</li>
            <li> Not all black soaps are made equal. I&#x27;ve used others that use &amp;#34;black soap base&amp;#34;. I don&#x27;t know what that is, but Dudu never disappoints me and it&#x27;s all-natural, literally, not 80%, but 100%. FYI, I have acne-prone oily skin and this stuff is amazing! It&#x27;s not over-drying - a common experience one can get from using soaps. However, if you&#x27;re acne-prone/oily like me, this is not a fix. I have clear skin now due to habits and this soap helped. Drink plenty of water and I even recommend to stick with washing your face with soap at night after it&#x27;s been hit with the elements from the day and after sweating, but you don&#x27;t need to wash with soap in the morning, just water and a washcloth will do. Over washing can cause irritation too. Moisturize with something not too oily and you should be fine whether you choose to wear makeup or not. I recommend this all-natural soap to clean your face and body over any benzoyl peroxide, salicylic acid-containing product that probably does more harm than good with all the extra junk they put in it.</li>
            <li> Great product.. fast shipping.</li>
            <li> This product is marvelous</li>
            <li> best soap ever!!! I use this as a shampoo,face wash and body wash!...started using it a little less than a year ago.....cheaper to purchase 6 count off of amazon!....quick shipping..will be using this seller again :) thanks!!!!</li>
            <li> Arrived promptly but not the quality I expected. Unpleasant smell and stings sometimes, probably due to the lime in it. I was hoping this would be comparable to Alaffia&#x27;s black soap, which I use as body wash and shampoo. This soap lathers better for shampoo but stings as a body wash and has an unpleasant smell. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> We love Dudu-Osun soap.When I started use dudu soap my skin was rough and dry,now my skin is better.Family and friends used the soap also.</li>
            <li> I have only used this product for a month and my skin looks better. I am a victim of acne, so I was skeptical at first. However, to my surprise it really improved my skin tone by fading away blemishes.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery. Fresh soap. Can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
            <li> not so much of a fan of the smell.</li>
            <li> this soap small like s***, and after I use this, the skin is dry and itchy</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s working for my daughter&#x27;s acne...</li>
            <li> This is d only soap that works for me, I haven&#x27;t had any new break out n my pores have become smaller, very moisturizing, works well with my oily skin.</li>
            <li> Beautiful American woman of African decent 24 yrs old. I used this soap and it dried my extremely bad, so bad that it looked craked. Somone told me about another soap for acne &amp; acne scars many people have used. I used it and it was a God send.    Its called pineapple cilantro soap from medicine woman. It is all natrual with shea butter. It lighten my scars and my skin felt like butter. It is $12.99 or so. Here is a link. O and p.s. the grapfruit soap works wonders as well.    Please believe.    [...]</li>
            <li> It makes your skin soooo clear and it smells so good.  The smell is like a fresh, natural, clean smell.  I have never felt so clean than I have when using this soap.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> Love this soap and have used it for years! Glad I found it on here for a good price! Will be ordering more in the near future!</li>
            <li> Had high hopes, but found the soap to be very drying.  My skin itched and felt dry and cracked.  Try Nubian Heritage Black Soap instead.</li>
            <li> Great soap, really helps with acne. One thing though: this does have &amp;#34;Fragrance&amp;#34; which means it might have some harmful chemicals in it they&#x27;re not required to tell us about. If you don&#x27;t care about smell as much as how your skin looks go with standard black soap.</li>
            <li> Great product... Really good for your face.. Will be purchase again . Love this product..a whole body soap for family</li>
            <li> This is a non drying soap and has a pleasant clean smell.  It leaves skin clean without stripping all the natural oils and rinses off well.  I plan to buy more when I run out.</li>
            <li> Love this soap. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of years because I&#x27;ve got scars on my chest, arms, breasts and back. The scars have faded significantly and I even notice my stretch marks fading. The only downside is that it stains my bathtub, but it&#x27;s not that big of an issue to me. Will continue to order and use this soap!</li>
            <li> Cleanses and exfoliates beautifully!</li>
            <li> I bought this to try and correct my skin issues.. I have horrible acne.. I wash my face two times a day no matter what I do and what I use I still break out horribly.. I am hoping this solves my issues.. Will update later.. This shipped crazy fast and expiration date is 5/15..</li>
            <li> Great soap, my holy grail !!!</li>
            <li> I was so excited to use this soap! My only problem is that it was easily flushed down the toilet by my children</li>
            <li> My boyfriend and I use this soap daily. He uses it for his face and I for my whole body. I love it because its natural, it last longer than body wash (which is true of most soap bars) and because its non-drying. My only issue is that it easily melts (fades away) when left in the soap dish in the shower as the water hits it so we had to move it to the metal caddy hanging from the shower head.</li>
            <li> I had read of the many benefits of using African Black Soap and along with the the high reviews I chose this brand.  I love the scent, the exfoliation and the all natural ingredients.  It is a bit drying to my skin but not too bad.  My 15 year old son loves it as well.  The bar is large and does make a mess in the tub, not a deal breaker though.  I am on my second order of a 6-pack.  We went through 5 bars in 2 months with 4 people using daily which is a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> This soap is always a favourite.  It has a clean scent and seems to be good for my skin. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
            <li> No complaints about this soap. I have been using it for about 8 months now, and it keeps my skin soft and moist.</li>
            <li> The only black soap I buy!</li>
            <li> I love Dudu-Osun soap it works great. I have super sensitive skin and this soap works very well with my skin. I don&#x27;t have itching or breakouts while using it. It leaves my skin feeling very clean. This soap also works great if you have a promblem with inbalance with your underarms and you sweat alot. It deep cleans your pores. If your like me and have to change your deorderant every 6 months use this soap and you can tell the difference. You won&#x27;t have to change your deorderant so often.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product on my face for a couple years now. I love it! I have combination skin, mostly oily, and this works great to remove oil and make-up without over drying my skin.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this soap it stains washcloth.  The feel is good but I think their better soaps on the market that would be better results.</li>
            <li> I really really like this soap. I did a lot of research on black soap before deciding on this one. I&#x27;m glad I did. It smells good, it cleans great without leaving any residue (I didn&#x27;t realize that all the other soaps I&#x27;ve used leave residue until trying this), and it lasts longer than other bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a European American with long thick, but fine, hair. Occasionally, I use this as a shampoo too. I just get my hair wet and lather the bar into my head. It lathers up nicely and rinses out quickly. I don&#x27;t know why, but it takes my hair longer to dry afterward; however, the results are nothing short of amazing! My hair both looks and feels much thicker and it styles easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will ever stop using black soap now that I&#x27;ve tried it. The only reason I deducted one star is because of the sediment it leaves in the drain. I used to live in a upper apartment and my drain began getting slow (1940&#x27;s house, sewer system, root issues). I tried plunging the drain but broke a pipe in the process. I had a plumber come up and use an auger. The problem may not have been caused by the Dudu Osun; however, a LOT of ash came up during the plunging/augering process.</li>
            <li> It definitely helped any scars and acne. please allow for results to show within a 7-10 day period. I noticed that ever since I switched to organic and natural products, it takes a little but of time but results are better and healthier for your skin. Also, i noticed it was great for overall body soap, espcially if you mix it with sugar and make a scrub out of that. Helps reduce redness, reduces scars, gives skin a good cleanse without being too harsh. I will definitely be using this in the future. Seriously!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this would have worked as a soap. My skin is too sensitive to use it. I&#x27;ve tried a few times and every time I do my skin just gets inflamed and burns like crazy and tends to have issues with drying out for days afterward.</li>
            <li> I loved this soap, I really really love African black soap. It&#x27;s exotic and it feels good on the skin. The only thing is that it sort of melts, pretty fast. But I think that&#x27;s how African black soap is. But other than that, and it being a little pricy I really love this soap.</li>
            <li> This soap smells great, works great, and lathers great. The brown suds a little scary but my bacne (back acne) is diminished. my soap forever.</li>
            <li> It is all natural, cleanses very well and I will continue to order.  It has a really good scent and last long.</li>
            <li> Looks like s*** but is a nice soap.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap.  At first it seemed to be really drying and I was itching all of the time, so I was worried that I was having a bad reaction to it.  Thankfully, this was temporary and was alleviated when I moisturized after using the soap. It has really good clarifying properties. The smell is nice. I can smell the African ash, rain water, and the fragrances that are added to it that are pleasant and soapy smelling so it does double duty as a really nice body deodorant. The one knock I have on this product is that it almost has the consistency of one of those bath fizzy things so you have to cover it up and not let water run on it too long or you are going to waste your money as the soap goes down the drain. Basically you should make a very good lather with you hands, and then work the soap in without the use of a loofah or anything too abrasive.</li>
            <li> love the soap very much. despite the dark brown appearance, it smells good and washes smooth. will buy more when runs out.</li>
            <li> When I use this soap on may face, I have people saying that &amp;#34;you have beautiful skin&amp;#34;.  I also use this soap on my under arms. I notice that my under arm odor is less smelly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, I recommend you test a small area on your face our body first.</li>
            <li> Still a great soap after 2 years of use. Any one can use it and works esp. well on those with acne like my daughter has.</li>
            <li> My sister introduced me to this product and I loved it instantly.  I have problems with eczema on my scalp but this soap has reduced it by 80% so far. The itching is gone and I no longer need dandruff shampoo. The soap has replaced my shampoo, and I can&#x27;t believe how shiny and healthy my hair appears.  I use the soap in the shower, in the kitchen, in the bathroom.  And it smells great!  That&#x27;s why I bought 6 bars from Amazon.com.  I&#x27;ll probably have to buy more soon because I&#x27;ve been giving some of them away to my friends to let them try it out.  And it&#x27;s so nice to know that it is all- natural and that it complies with fair trade regulations.</li>
            <li> The best soap ever for my face,my face looks clear although i have blemish. it is gradually drying up the acne i had. this soap is the real deal. The only problem is That its messy and it can dry out ur skin, but just dont use it for 2 days an then go back and you&#x27;ll be fine. definitely recommend it</li>
            <li> My husband swears by this soap!  Other soaps make his skin break out but not this one :)  A little messy, but worth it...</li>
            <li> I am AfrIcan American and I have thicker skin and most products are not too sensitive for my skin. I&#x27;ve never in my life used a product and my skin burned and became raw until now. As studies show other races that are not ethnic have thinner sensitive skin so there is no way all of these positive reviews are true. There was only 2 negative reviews so I said they are just mad about something or maybe on medication making their skin sensitive etc but they were the only truthful ones. I&#x27;ve used a whole box my body was squeaky dry n my face became raw. It wasn&#x27;t a rough period that you just have to get over. My skin is still the same. Has not lightened any blemishes or stretch marks or done anything for my pores. My sister told me to order saying it was safe and she didn&#x27;t need lotion afterwards and that is completely a lie. It&#x27;s is not safe to use in sensitive areas as she said it balances pH etc. NOT TRUE! She has sensitive skin and can only use a few products and I&#x27;m the opposite. I would hope that we didn&#x27;t have a bunch of people just lying on reviews for no reason so I&#x27;m going to say to help me sleep better at night that maybe they are not consistent with their batches and I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap on my face and body. I have moderate/severe cystic acne and while I don&#x27;t think this soap has not cured my acne, I think it has helped fade the red marks and scars left behind by previous breakouts. When I use this on my face, I will often lather it up and let it sit for about a minute. This works well as a \\&quot;chemical\\&quot; scrub because of the acid from the lemon juice. The soap has not caused my breakouts to worsen. I purchased six bars and I don&#x27;t know how long I will continue to use it on my face because of the problems outlined in the next paragraph. The soap is also slightly drying, so I would suggest using a facial and body moisturizer with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My single complaint is that the soap contains \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot;. While the fragrance does smell great, it is also very very strong and makes me cough, sneeze and/ore wheeze when inhaled... very suspicious and problematic when you are washing your face with it. This is such a disappointment because everything else about the soap is absolutely gorgeous. I have been making a conscious effort to use more natural products, and I doubt this fragrance is natural. I will probably not repurchase. :(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion to anyone who is considering buying this for the first time is to get one bar and see how you like it first. I&#x27;ve never had problems with other fragrances so I suspect others will probably have the same experience that I have. There are lots of other African black soaps out there. Whole Foods carries a few. I&#x27;ll be trying them and will try to remember to update here if I find any better and more natural then Dudu Osun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I&#x27;ve decided to give it a 3 star instead of a 2 star because maybe that is being a little too critical. The soap really is lovely, but I&#x27;m afraid people who are sensitive to fragrance would have serious issues with it. I&#x27;m not sensitive to fragrance and it manages to choke me up a bit, so I would imagine it could bother others even more.</li>
            <li> My husband was using your soap and he loves it, but I had to take it away because I don&#x27;t like the smell. I am allergic to perfumes and lots of smelly things. The perfume of this soap lingers on his body and in the bathroom and rest of house. This soap would be perfect unscented. I also bought a large chunk of this type soap that is unscented and I use it and love it. To get my business back, take away the smell/scent. I threw away all 3 bars.</li>
            <li> This is my second purchase of this soap, I just love the scent. It&#x27;s a little pricey but it lasts a really long time and the smell just keeps bringing me back.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It evens out my skin tone, exfoliates, and smells great. When I started using this soap I noticed a huge difference. I stopped using it for a while (no reason, just didn&#x27;t get to buy it) and my skin went back to it&#x27;s dull, uneven tone. It&#x27;s a great price since in the nearby health store they sell a bar at around $4.50/each.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap!! Smells so good and my skin just shines!!</li>
            <li> Everything is okay&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
            <li> Did not do what it said it would do...... Very disappointed</li>
            <li> I have bad skin. There&#x27;s no getting around it. It&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s oily, it&#x27;s about to break out in an itchy rash.  My husband is constantly making fun of my natural &amp;#34;hippie&amp;#34; soaps, but lately he has abandoned his Dove bars in favor of these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This leaves my skin squeaky clean and soft. I love the textured bits in the bar and the mild, fruity smell. I&#x27;ll never go back!</li>
            <li> We wanted to give this a try and we did. I have nothing good to say about this product. It doesn&#x27;t smell nice, it leaves nasty residues all over the shower, and it dried both mine and my boyfriend&#x27;s skin. We gave it a try I guess, and it didn&#x27;t work for us</li>
            <li> It was very effective in controlling my outbreaks with eczema. I would recommend this soap to anyone. Has a clean fresh scent.</li>
            <li> First off I will start off by saying I love everything about this soap, it smells like candy!! And feels good on my skin. My fiance tried it and loves it as well.</li>
            <li> I am very dark skinned and - for those of you in the know - that means ash central after showering...BUT NOT WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I don&#x27;t even need to moisturize anymore!  And yet it&#x27;s not greasy and you feel clean after using it.  Miracle of miracles.</li>
            <li> My skin tend to be dry and itchy during the winter. Those over the counter soaps really irritated my skin. Read the reviews and decided to give it a shoot. To this days, I could not be more happier. The result is great.</li>
            <li> It was perfect came in the mail very quickly and still smoothens my skin great buy for a great price</li>
            <li> I like the feel of the soap and how I feel clean after using.  Unfortunately, I am allergic to fragrance and cannot use it.  However I gave it to my grandchildren and they love it.</li>
            <li> This soap is lightening up my dark marks slowly drying up the bumps but I only been using the product for a couple of weeks.  I have learned that you do need a moisturizer when using it will leave your face tight. Your face will also feel soft at the same time.</li>
            <li> Well, it didn&#x27;t solve all of my life problems like the other reviews had me believe. It&#x27;s good soap, though. Really good. Smells good, lathers well, doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin or leave a filmy oily residue. My wife hasn&#x27;t complained about it yet, and that fact alone makes it amazing. I&#x27;ll be buying this stuff for the foreseeable future.</li>
            <li> This is a friend so I bought for her, she said, do not quit after washing the face tight. I also give her husband left a use, he also liked that very clean wash</li>
            <li> I purshased the Dudu Osun Black soap, because I saw the reviews and live in an apt. which has VERY HARD water. I found the soap is effective when showering under hard water, but is VERY MESSY. I would have given this soap 4 stars, but the messiness was so annoying that I give it only 3 stars. Also, the smell of this soap was a little unusual and bothered me after using the 2nd bar.</li>
            <li> This is one of the few products I can use on my face that doesn&#x27;t dry it out. Also my whole body during the winter and no itchy skin.</li>
            <li> Real nice drying effect for greasy skin. The bottom is concave and slips off the soap dish, so I shave it off with a knife. It is a large soap so the loss is negligible.</li>
            <li> After order arrived, husband and son made comments and jokes about the appearance of the soap BUT after trying it one time they have changed their minds....This soap leaves such a clean, refreshing feeling and a wonderful scent on your skin. We have hard water in our area, and while we have a softener, it is still noticeable. This soap eliminates that &#x27;slimey&#x27; feeling after showering. While it does leave the washcloth stained, it is a small inconvenience.   The most impressive thing I liked about it was the way it leaves my face feeling....softer and cleaner than any other product I&#x27;ve ever used.   The existing soaps and body washes we have in the linen closet will be given to a shelter and replaced with the Black Soap.</li>
            <li> This is helping to clear up my son&#x27;s chronic acne break outs and oily skin. It doesn&#x27;t cause the dreaded rebound breakout either.</li>
            <li> Dudu Osun Black Soap is a good soap to use if you have very sensitive skin or dry skin problems. It&#x27;s all natural and leaves your skin feeling smooth not dry.</li>
            <li> This is the best African Black soap I have tried and my family and I have tried quite a few.  It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out after bathing and it gets my whole family nice and clean without stripping away our natural oils.  We are African-American so this is very important to us.  Our skin can look ashy when dry and because Dudu Osun is not drying, it has reduced our lotion use.  It is also more inexpensive to buy in bulk, so we are loving this offer of a 6-pack. I used to drive across town to get this soap, so this is ultra convenient.  Love it!</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing!  I got acne in my late teens and all through my tweenties and nothing helped.  Even tried the dermatologist and still could not get 100% clear, and I tried it all!!  The last was clinique 3 step system and yet I always had a breakout no matter how much I paid for products.  I discovered this soap and now I very rarely have any acne.  I do recomend getting some organic jojoba oil to add to your moisturizer to help replinish your skin even if you have really oily skin already.  I added a good gel moisturizer and it works wonders for me.  I will never be without it.</li>
            <li> I started using this because a lot of soaps have heavy scents which make me itch and dry out my skin. One of my favorite doctor shows on tv suggested trying &amp;#34;black soap&amp;#34;. I went online found this product &amp; have been using for a couple years now. It also helps me with the age spots on my skin from aging. They appear to be lighter and not so noticeable . I will continue to use this product.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s cause I have sensitive skin... but when I used this product my skin would get red and itch a lot. I read some reviews saying that it should be burning but the pain would last for about 30 minutes. I then ordered the raw African black soap which works 10X more.</li>
            <li> I was looking for an all natural soap (sick or buying 10 different product) &amp; saw this item along with reviews. So I wanted to give this a go.....my review (week usuage) 1.) Real Black Soap w awesome lather 2.) Even better smell 3.) Great Price &amp; Affordable 4.) Clean rinsing 5.) Visible difference after usuage- only directly after using though. 6.) Use 1 bar for face &amp; neck, use additional bar for back &amp; body. 7.) Use African Shea Butter 32oz Tub for lotion afterwards...Love! Only been using soap a week now, after more time; maybe results will be better &amp; far more lasting. Can&#x27;t beat it for quanity &amp; price though.</li>
            <li> I like this product - It s a bit expensive compared to other name brands in the market . We have become regular users . Watch out it may leave soap stains on the Tiles , theses are washable but they will be visible on light surfaces</li>
            <li> Love this soap. Best stuff ever!</li>
            <li> Came on time actually a earlier. I love this soap</li>
            <li> If you suffer with chicken skin on your arms , this is your holy grail , it&#x27;s completely changed my skin. This is the only soap I use fr my body.</li>
            <li> So far so good and I&#x27;m using the Soap with my Foreo Luna for men and my skin feels really good and not died out.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, doesn&#x27;t last long per bar, and I&#x27;ve used more costly brands that seem to help better with acne</li>
            <li> Great item. I am not sure it&#x27;s the best black soap quality wise but it&#x27;s easy to use and smells great, it won&#x27;t sit in your soap dish and melt like organic base black soap can. I like the product and it&#x27;s an easy formulation for any family and bathroom.</li>
            <li> This product cleans well without over drying your skin. However you can find other similar cleansers like this in drug stores with cheap price as well. It is good, but not a miracle product for me.</li>
            <li> I used this soap before. This soap is very good I also have friends that told me about Dud-Osun Soap, because they all use this soap.  Yes I wil tell other about the soap.</li>
            <li> First time tryer and I LOVE THIS STUFF! I have oily and acne prone skin sometimes on my chest and back as well as my face.  I use this as my face wash instead of all my acne wash and as a daily body wash and my skin looks better than ever!!!</li>
            <li> love the smell and used it for the first time last night. definitely not pretty soap but wanted to try something natural.</li>
            <li> This soap really smells bad.  I haven&#x27;t been able to use it because of the smell.  Just beware if you are sensitive to smell you may not want to order this product.</li>
            <li> Love this soap too. It smells great.</li>
            <li> Continue to buy monthly. Does not dry out skin but, helps moisturize and great for those w/sensitive skin like myself and son w/eczema. Down-side? Soap dissolves rather quickly, that is reason for 4 star. This affects the amount of time soap has to be purchased, so be conscious. I have learned to keep it at a higher height in shower, as not to be affected by water when not using.  The coloring of soap effects body cloths but, as long as you rinse thoroughly you will be fine. Additionally? IT SMELLS GREAT AND FRAGRANCE LASTS FOR HOURS.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34; ) Always aware it is in delivery box because the smell resonates through the box.</li>
            <li> This is my first product review i have ever done, this product is just soooo ahhh-mazing!! I have been using this soap for about a little over a month now and it has honestly been the best thing I have ever done for my skin! I use this soap as a cleanser for my face and in the shower for my entire body. It is also really great to use as a shampoo once a week. I feel like it really gets all the dirt and oil out and my hair is really clean soft and shiny after using it. I have two separate soap dishes for sanitary purposes of not contaminating the one i use for my face. This soap definitely seems like it will last me for a while and a little goes a long way! This soap lathers into a creamy foam. After using it my body and face feels amazingly clean and baby soft, I do follow up with coconut oil as my moisturizer for my face and body because this soap can be drying if you don&#x27;t use a good moisturizer afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;So let me tell you about my skin history...&lt;br /&gt;I have very acne prone skin. Ive had acne since I was 16 and now Im 25 with adult acne. In the past year I started getting huge cystic pimples all over my cheeks and along my jawline. It was really painful and it looked horrible! I tried everything the dermatologist recommended including retin a, differin, epidou etc, I was also prescribed doxycycline. For a little while the retin a made my skin flawless and after 6 months my face started to breakout again. I guess my skin got immune to the retin a...im not really too sure.&lt;br /&gt;Since Ive been using this soap i noticed that my acne is starting to clear up. For the first couple of weeks my skin purged. It was really bad but i decided to stick it out and continue to use the soap. I noticed that i was not getting any new break outs after the first 3 weeks. The soap pretty much just brought out the acne I had under my skin to the surface. I am very impressed with this soap because after only using this soap for a little over a month and almost all my acne cleared up. I just have a few pimples around my chin that are getting smaller day by day.  I also have really bad acne scarring and hyper pigmentation all over my cheeks and chin, since i started using this soap it definitely has seem to lighten the scars. Every once in a while I will use the Up&amp;Up (target brand) benzyl peroxide as a spot treatment to help speed up the process of the pimples going down.&lt;br /&gt;I Also noticed that little marks on my legs from ingrown hairs were gone and my skin just looked glowy, smooth, even toned and it was baby soft. I had a burn scar that seems to be slowly fading as well!&lt;br /&gt;I also had a really bad habit of always picking my face and popping my pimples but they are soo right when they say it leaves worse scarring when you touch your face! Now i really try not to touch my face at all and i always sanitize my hands before washing my face. It definitely pays off. Other than the benzyl i use a turmeric mask at least 4 times a week which has drastically reduced the size of my acne and has helped to lighten the scars as well. I will be repurchasing this soap again! And i recommend this soap to anyone! Im sorry this review was soo long Im just soo happy that i found some kind of regimen that works for me and I would lovee to share that with anyone who is also suffering with acne. I know it can be hard, if anyone has any questions about the mask i use or about my regimen Id be happy to answer ;)&lt;br /&gt;I will update in about a month how the soap has been working for me.</li>
            <li> I am a 22 year old guy, and I have really bad acne, My face has cleared up but I still get bad back acne, I used one bar of this so far and almost 90% of back acne is gone and I don&#x27;t get new ones. I still have scars and etc. from the ace obviously but I am glad I don&#x27;t get new ones. I would recommend this for anyone having body acne.</li>
            <li> Very awesome soap on your skin. It will leave your tub looking dirty,lol</li>
            <li> Love the soap, not expired, no problems with shipping</li>
            <li> I love the smell!! oh Clears skin. I think Im a shade lighter lol. I have no acne not that I had much but its been a year and I only had 3 passing pimples.</li>
            <li> Excellent! I feel squeaky clean every time I bathe with it! Follow it up with some cocoa butter, and you&#x27;re set!</li>
            <li> It is a very nice item. I can use it very well. It is fit for my face as well.</li>
            <li> I love this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a patient gave to my Herb Doctor let me try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried, and I ordered, recevied, gave my friends who are black and yello skin.  They all like Dudu Osun Black Soap.</li>
            <li> I was tired of using all those synthetic soaps with all those chemicals and especially the ones used for animal testing. I&#x27;m not supporting those companies anymore and decided to use an all natural soap that is also not tested on animals or made from animals. This soap is great so far and I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li> love the scent. Used on my face and body, feels good.clean but not dry.</li>
            <li> I  get terrible cystic acne every couple of months. When I started using this I haven&#x27;t gotten ANY  cystic acne since.</li>
            <li> The Product speaks for itself. It&#x27;s a skin product so you will have to try it yourself as it will affect you differently in some cases. This is the only soap I have used for about a year now. It has helped me to manage my acne, softens my skin, and also makes you feel refreshed coming out of a shower. Some people argue it makes their skin too dry, it&#x27;s not overboard for me, in fact I believe this is one of the reasons why it&#x27;s effective for acne given that many people with acne have excessively oily skin.</li>
            <li> I started experimenting with natural products to heal my scarred skin from acne. I am light skin african american and scar very easily and have had little to no luck finding a solution. I did some research online and came across this soap so I shopped for it a local beauty supply store. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks and I am definitely seeing results which amazed the heck out of me. The skin on my face has brightened and my spots are surely fading. I noticed I use less foundation. It will dry your skin out and I would recommend you use this soap with cold water because it will sting and burn. Also, don&#x27;t leave it on the face too long and do I would not recommend applying the soap directly to your face. I always work up a good lather (this stuff LATHERS) in my hands and apply. I also use it on my body...directly because the skin is tougher. It leaves your skin smooth and soft. The smell is very strong and fruity and I personally like it. I use 100 percent shea butter immediately after using this soap to prevent dryness. I am no way affiliated with the makers of this product, just a review junkie dependent upon other people&#x27;s experience as well as my own :)</li>
            <li> very good for my skin and it makes me feel cleansed after I use the soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;although it smells like a chemical-soap at the time of opening,  the smell goes away after.</li>
            <li> I like this soap very much.  It lathers well, I know it&#x27;s pure &amp; smells good.  The only downfall with it is you may want to keep it in a soap dish because it can be messy because of the black color.</li>
            <li> My family loves this soap--my daughter uses it for her face, and my husband and I use it as a shampoo.  It smells great and works well.</li>
            <li> I GET IT ON TIMES GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE I REALLY LOVE IT, GOOD PERFOMANCE, EXCELLENT JOB , SEE YOU NEXT TIMES OK BYE</li>
            <li> The smell of the soap wasn&#x27;t that great and extremely strong. Also the soap itself it didn&#x27;t really last that long. In the end I went back to my old black soap as it really didn&#x27;t do anything other that leave really hard stains in my soap dish.</li>
            <li> This soap has a great scent, consistency and produces a full and rich lather. I have been very happy with it and would recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> This soap has become a staple for me. I use it every evening to remove makeup and cleanse my face. It has helped with my acne!</li>
            <li> Best soap for psoriasis! Helped quite a bit with my acne too. This is the only soap I will wash my face with and has been for the last 5 years. Truly awesome stuff.</li>
            <li> My skin is super picky with soap and shaving products.  This soap, however, works like magic on my skin.  My skin is oily, and is super prone to breakouts.  Not only does this soap eradicated any blemishes on my skin, it also works to keep the oils at bay to prevent future breakouts.  It smells great and keeps you smelling good all day.  Even after sweating, you stink less than you would normally.  I highly recommend this soap and have usd it for years!!</li>
            <li> We used to have an African supply place in town that sold this, but since they left I continued ordering it from Amazon.  It could be my imagination but I think it actually lightens and evens out skin tone.  Others have told me that they see an improvement in my skin and ask me what I have been using  I think it is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Started to use this soap to help clear my skin. In store, a bar would cost 5 dollars so buying in bulk saves money. My skin does not feel dry as long as a type of lotion is applied after shower. Also, this soap should be kept in a dry soap dish after use because it does melt.</li>
            <li> Great soap, I have used this product for about a year now.&lt;br /&gt;It really helps reduce my oily skin and leaves me smelling smooth and fresh!</li>
            <li> I was reluctant at first, but I have been using this soap for the past 2 weeks and I already see the changes. My skin is getting smoother and my acne is just shrinking day by day. I love love love what this soap is doing to my african skin. I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> Amazing!!!! You will not be disappointed. It leaves your skin so clean and smooth. I feel like it is finally breathing!</li>
            <li> Great smelling natural soap, what could be better, it leaves your skin feeling a little sticky at first but you get used to it,  I suspect that&#x27;s the honey</li>
            <li> The soap is great! I get so many compliments on my skin... So what are u using on your skin I smile and say Dudu osun black soap</li>
            <li> Smell good for a natural black soap!</li>
            <li> This soap has been a lifesaver! I had eczema/dry patches on my arms for years. I&#x27;ve been to several dermatologist and all they did was prescribe me a cream that didn&#x27;t do much. I&#x27;ve always been a huge Amazon.com buyer so I decided to do just a little research. I looked up cream or soap for eczema and this soap was the first to come up. I always love to read all the reviews (I can be a sucker sometimes) but this one really surpassed my expectations. I love it!&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was out with a friend the other night and she mentioned she&#x27;s been battling Psoriasis all over her body and now her face and not one Doctor in five years has been able to cure her. I told her you must try Black Soap by Dudu-Osun! We logged on her iPhone Amazon App and she ordered it immediately. Seriously, five days later she called me and said, \\&quot;I can not Thank You enough\\&quot; and her RASH is completely GONE! She wants to walk into all of the Top Dermatologist she&#x27;s been seeing in Beverly Hills and show them that she&#x27;s been cured with just a few washes of this Black Soap! WTF!?! How can these Doctors not know about this??!! Really??!! Unreal! Please do yourself a favor and buy it!!  Simply The Best!</li>
            <li> Yes dudu osun soap met my expectations. It works great on my son skin. He has eczema. It worked wonders. He has less itching and scratching.</li>
            <li> It is a good product and I am happy wit it and I will purchase it again when we need it.</li>
            <li> I have been using the Dudu-Osun black soap for years now and it&#x27;s been my reliable part of my nightly face cleansing ritual.  After many wasted soaps, facial washes and scrubs, I found this to be the best match with my acne-proned, oily/dry combination, sun sensitive skin.  I don&#x27;t even know how many hours I&#x27;ve wasted researching and experimenting with different products until I found this black soap which uses a formula that&#x27;s been around for hundreds of years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I simply lather and apply to face by rubbing gently in circular motion.  Then I leave it on while brushing my teeth so the cocoa pod ash and aloe vera can do it&#x27;s thing.  Then I rinse with a washcloth to get rid of dirt and dead skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the perfect blend of natural ingredients that cleans my face thoroughly with no funky residue and without drying out my skin.&lt;br /&gt;- Honey and oil for lathering and acting as a binder for the ingredients&lt;br /&gt;- the ash acts as a sponge with its porous surface area for absorbing toxins and dirt from the skin&lt;br /&gt;- shea butter and aloe vera for healing and moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;- citrus juice for toning</li>
            <li> I love this soap. Awesome smell. Lathers really good. The first pack I ordered through Amazon about 6 months ago was kinda icky. The individual boxes of bars were stuck together and the cardboard appeared to have gotten wet or oily or something. Not sure why. Soap was still good.  This most recent pack I ordered was in a sealed back and the individual boxes were in great shape.  Good job!</li>
            <li> Lucky to even give ONE star. Been using for a month haven&#x27;t seen ANYTHING. Frequently get acne &amp; ingrown hairs. Nothing for my scars... I know it&#x27;s only been a month but everyone is swearing on this like its actually something that good.</li>
            <li> Just arrived but definitely sure it will be good for my skin. It doesn&#x27;t contain any artificial material.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks AMAZON for sending this soap to KOREA!!!!</li>
            <li> Spent thousands on my son&#x27; acne. Tried everything except accutane; have tried antibiotics, facials, retin-A, cosmeceuticals of various types. Dudu osun has made dramatic difference. No more cystic lesions, only fine pimples, no more scarring. Daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Very helpful for husband&#x27;s eczema. Daily use.&lt;br /&gt;I use it  occasionally. I cannot use it every day as it causes itching.&lt;br /&gt;Is very messy but worth it!</li>
            <li> This soap will help your skin exfoliate always making it look fresh, clean and soft.  I always follow up with raw shea butter to moisturize my skin when I am done.  This soap is good for helping fade scars which is very good for me since I scar easy and it takes a long time for my scars to go away.  This soap will melt away very easily so you have to keep it out of the shower stream or water when you aren&#x27;t using it.  This soap is dark brown so it will leave a dark residue in your tub or shower when you are done so cleaning the tub or shower directly after every use is a must. (but hey you should be doing that anyway right?)  This soap is great for people who have problem skin and are easily irritated or scared by soaps with perfumes in them.  This soap is all natural and I recommend it to anyone who is struggling with acne prone skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m getting older and my skin is changing...the normal noxema and petroleum jelly have run their course. After using this soap once I knew it was perfect for my entire family. My son who is 15 and should be getting major pimples by now has little or none and his skin tone is even as is mine. You must have a great moisturizer because this soap will tighten and dry your face. Initially i was using emu oil but decided to change to something less expensive, natural and more bang for your buck...African Shea Butter(ivory)..works wonders on my skin together. I&#x27;m already on my 3 order of dudu osun..only because I shared with friends and family so they too could see how it worked...If my skin allows, i&#x27;ll be using this forever!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I read some good reviews about it. I really like it. It lathers up very nice and the scent is mild and pleasing. It&#x27;s not too perfumy or flowery, just lightly fragrant. I use it on my hair instead of shampoo because it&#x27;s all natural. I also use it on my body, which saves having to buy many different products. It&#x27;s priced reasonably and lasts a long time. It would be nice if they made different colors because it does look odd when I set it down in my shower and the water runs down kinda brown looking. I look forward to trying it on other cleaning tasks, it&#x27;s probably a great multi-use product!</li>
            <li> I am in my 30&#x27;s and have been battling acne for over 5 yrs now. recently they have been so bad, im pregnant and so i figure maybe that has attributed to it.  I have used the regular black soap and green alcohol in the past to atleast control my breakouts. I also scar very easy.  my skin tone is caramel and with the dark spots and breakouts i have had-I am very self conscious about taking pictures unless i have make up on, which further aggravates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;I started using this about 4 days now on my body and face.  What i noticed is on my face it brought up the bacteria so day 1 in the morning and day 2 in the morning I would see random little whiteheads.  by day 3 - no more.  I dont need to use the green alcohol to go behind this soap. The soap has a very refreshing fragrance and lathers so well that I have a hard time getting out of the shower. :)  My face so far is responding to it VERY WELL.  other black soaps i use are like regular soaps - they leave a residue behind, which is why is used the green alcohol behind it.  This one there is no residue, my skin is not dry but I can feel that it is very clean. I dont get ashy after bathing with this product but I still follow with shea butter. I love it! Only a few days into it but it WORKS!!!</li>
            <li> I just received it yesterday and I love it already! I used one for myself and gave one to my boyfriend. He currently has no acne or any redness but I on the other hand did have a few breakouts. My goodness, when I woke up I noticed my face was not very oily (nor dry) as it usually is but also, the pimples had reduced in size and redness. I have never seen a product work so fast!!! My boyfriend said his face wasn&#x27;t dry like prior products he had tried  for his acne and was very similar to the dead sea mud soaps.  I&#x27;m rating this product 4 stars for now to see how effective it is. I shall update my review in a week.</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use. the best soap in the world. I also share it with others. love it</li>
            <li> This worked pretty well on face and blemishes.  Warning: If you use this, then you really need a separate soap dish for it.  It turns everything black it rinses away, but you&#x27;ll constantly rinse lighter colored soaps that it comes into contact with. It&#x27;s water soluble, but it will turn a white washcloth-brown, so you want to use a darker colored cloth. But, it does work on blemishes.  It can be too drying to use daily, but great if when a pimple is starting or in early stages. I use a moisturizer after when necessary and only use the soap for face.</li>
            <li> I have been using DuDu Osun Black soap for about 5months now. This is the best soap I have ever used in my life! At first use it made my skin tingle,but that only lasted a couple of days of use. It lathers very well and makes you feel soooooooo clean and refreshed! I have noticed clearer skin and my blemishes(from popping pimples) are GONE! I will NEVER use another soap again. EVERYONE SHOULD TRY IT!</li>
            <li> Unlike any soap you&#x27;ll ever buy. I have given so many bars out as gifts. Everyone that try&#x27;s it buy&#x27;s it. After you use this, swipe your hand down your arm or leg to remove excess water and discover your hand does not slide down. Why? because there is no film or residue that commercial soaps leave. It is said that the properties in this soap help pull skin cells together to give a more youthful appearance to the skin along with many more healing degrees. Do the research. I keep my du du osun in an unbleached cotton soap bag. This bag is a great way to store it. You can find it on Eco [...]. The soap bag is also a wash cloth. Hang this on one of those plastic suction cup hooks in the shower. ~V~</li>
            <li> Absolutely LOVE this soap! I am 30 and have acne prone skin due to PCOS. This soap combined with the OCM, Moroccan rose water and spirolactone have finally cleared my cystic acne. COULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT!</li>
            <li> Smooth skin for life!</li>
            <li> This is the only soap I use. It keeps my skin radiant and soft, and it smells amazing.</li>
            <li> We will continue to buy</li>
            <li> Excellent. My skin is so soft.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! A definite rebuy as my daily body cleanse routine. I will use this for life, NUFF SAID!</li>
            <li> Due to skin reactions to Commercial soaps I typically purchase soaps with Natural ingredients .My Husband and I have been using this soap off and on for 3yrs now. This soap leaves me feeling truly clean. Removes  the heavy underarm flim from deodorants,  husband no has back acne and shaving bumps are not a issue either. This soap can be a little drying  , I apply lotion after and would not recommend using this soap on children under 5yrs as it may be too harsh.  But it is perfect after a  Hot humid day . I have given bars away to family and friends of different races who love using it too .</li>
            <li> I accidently came across this product only it was the orignal bar without the tropical scent.  I really like the original better wish I could find it !&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless, this is a wonderful product I give it to family members and friends especially for the teens who have acne prone skin.  They always come back asking for another bar!  It really is a miracle bar for the complexion, not drying.</li>
            <li> Smooth washing experience using this soap.</li>
            <li> Definately very good for people with acne. Even if you dont have acne it gives you a very nice glow. I have started getting acne a couple ago started turning into cystic acne. I used this soap 3 times and it automatically got rid of my acne. I can see my acne scars fading away already. Definately going to start using this on my back as well. I 100% trust this soap and so glad i bought it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is fantastic. Use it with my exfoliating clothe and its perfect on the suds.</li>
            <li> love this soap.. it leaves your skin feeling soft and soooooo clean. make sure you use a moisturizer with this product because it can dry out your skin if you arn&#x27;t too careful. Whenever i use this soap i see a huge improvement in my skin. This six count is amazing because the bars are pretty big so 6 bars should last you a pretty long time (depending on your household size of course) I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> A) Its a soap made out of natural ingredients and herbs that does the job.&lt;br /&gt;B) It can make your skin burn if you keep it on your skin for too long for some reason (there is a disclaimer that even says that and it happened to me a little bit)&lt;br /&gt;C) It looks like poop and is called &amp;#34;dudu&amp;#34; so that&#x27;s either a plus or a minus (my roommate said it looked like there was poop in the bathroom floor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately I did not use it all and its not for me, but its very unique and from Africa so give it a try if your interested.</li>
            <li> Many scented bubbles that clean feeling.&lt;br /&gt;Price is reasonable, I like to come.&lt;br /&gt;Available at a reasonable price in good usability is satisfactory.</li>
            <li> I have bought this soap several times.  It has a wonderful clean smell and leaves my skin smooth and refreshed.  I also love the fact that it is all natural</li>
            <li> We got the first bar at a local health foods store and found it for less here on Amazon.  It has a great smell and is a good soap.  I also really like that it is available with subscribe and save.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. Going all natural slowly and this helps the process.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap, i was amazed at how it removes deoderant residue so quickly and has a very nice scent. This is an all over soap and i feel like my skin is not only cleaner but softer also.</li>
            <li> The soap makes me feel dry and it burned certain areas of my body. I used it last night in my shower and I&#x27;m still burning and in pain.</li>
            <li> the best soap ever....</li>
            <li> The title says it all.  If you buy this you&#x27;re just going to end up with expensive soup.  It won&#x27;t clear  up your skin or do anything else special.  It will just drain your wallet.</li>
            <li> This black soap has definitely helped fade my acne scarring. It&#x27;s made with all natural ingredients and I can actually read and pronounce all of the ingredients that&#x27;s how you know it&#x27;s natural (no foreign words lol). It makes my face squeaky clean without drying it out. I also use it on my body as well.</li>
            <li> Cleans very well. Will be slighly drying so you will need a good moisturizer.  Otherwise the smell is nice and mild so  you wont smell like dudu all day. Somehow I think it is more processed than other black soaps that I have tried buuuut...still the best cleanser of them all...</li>
            <li> This soap has a unique smell that is very hard to describe- not an unpleasant scent but it&#x27;s not to my taste. The soap is long lasting.  The biggest thing you should know is that as dark soap, when it gets wet and then sits, it leaves behind a brown sticky goo. Also think about the fact that you will have a sticky, brown, oval object sitting by your sink or in your shower. This soap is brown and not black.</li>
            <li> will buy again it clear your skin up well good for acne dark spots and deep cleans your skin i just love this soap</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this soap.  Yes, it leaves a ring around the bathtub, but I grew up with bar soaps that left a ring like that. Just clean the tub and keep it moving. Whether soaps leave a little film on the tub or not, the bathtub NEEDS to be cleaned anyway, so it&#x27;s no big problem for me. :-)  What is important to me is that it leaves my skin feeling wonderful....even in dry, winter months.</li>
            <li> This is pure unadulterated black soap.  This is the purest and most effective black soap I have been able to find.  The cost for a box is awesome and makes it a better deal than most grocery store cosmetic soaps.  Black soap is effective at so many things.  We use it for moisturizing and facewashing in our house.  We absolutely love it and will keep buying it.</li>
            <li> This soap is very harsh to my skin. When i wash my face with it, it seems to erode the top layer of the skin on my pimples and making them bleed. When I tried to use it in the shower, it created a burning sensation (and I kid you not) in me and my husband&#x27;s private parts. Needless to say, they all went into the trash can.</li>
            <li> The name of it makes you giggle to yourself especially when telling others about it but this product works great. I used to buy it at a local African store who stopped selling it... so I said hey! maybe I can get it on Amazon. And voila... for six bars the price was a steal. This product is the ONLY thing that has helped me retain a good complexion. And Ive tried it all. one bar will last me almost 4 months. you can even wash your hair with it. I highly recommend it for those with acne or complexion issues.</li>
            <li> This black soap is very good for the skin, does not dry it out and reportedly has some healing benefits. I stopped using regular store shops a while ago and find black soap to be an affordable and natural alternative.</li>
            <li> Soap is good but if you have dry skin I still prefer natural glycerin soap</li>
            <li> This soap does make your face glow and also treats your acne and dark and all that, if you read so many reviews. Also it gave me a rash, and it looked like a plant rash, THATS WHEN YOU KNOW ITS ALL NATURALL BABY hahaha but i don&#x27;t really mind the rash, i&#x27;m happy my face is getting better. Remember moisten up those skins after that</li>
            <li> The only soap that works for my eczema. I always feel like I glow with this soap. I love it!</li>
            <li> My soap arrived about a week late unfortunately. I am happy with the product so far. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be like the other black soaps that melt after 1 weeks usage. The scent isn&#x27;t one that I really like too much, but overall I am ok with my soap.</li>
            <li> Just got my soap, this soap is awesome I use it for face and body.It&#x27;s thick and has a earthy smell, no fake perfume/imitation smell .</li>
            <li> I used this soap for about a month. It really took a toll on my face, leaving it ridiculously dry even after applying moisturizers. I&#x27;m not saying this product isnt good, I just don&#x27;t think its for everybody. I&#x27;d suggest trying out just one soap first before you buy a whole six pack like me!</li>
            <li> This soap really exfoliates your skin leaving it soft and clean</li>
            <li> This soap is hard to describe.  It has a nice smell and leaves my skin feeling nice after a shower.  I don&#x27;t feel like I have instantaneous results, but over time is makes my skin feel great.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap on my face for over a year.  I must say that my face has never looked better.</li>
            <li> I took the reviews claiming it completely clears your skin and fades stretch marks with a grain of salt, but even so the soap exceeded my expectations.  My skin is really soft and smooth now, like silk.  Totally moisturized, too.  And it smells nice and is cheap!</li>
            <li> I love this soap!! Smells great, doesnt dry skin....and the price for the size of bar is very good. I am Happy!</li>
            <li> i love love this soap. At beginning, i used it for shower.  i saw the different at the 1st week. it cleans oil skin without hurting.&lt;br /&gt;And there is not any build-up on the skin. i felt clean after wash, and never felt dry.  My back acne was getting better at first week of using it. now i&#x27;m using it for face wash too.  Only thing is: i&#x27;m not confortable with the odor at beginning. But i think the odor is because of its natural material.  now i&#x27;m feeling good with the odor.</li>
            <li> This soap is all natural, and what I love about it is that it doesn&#x27;t dry your skin. I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 4 years now, and I would not use anything else.</li>
            <li> Great product, especially in the cold dry air of Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s black soap... though you&#x27;ll find it&#x27;s a much better value if you purchase the larger cakes and break it apart; however, if you want something that &amp;#34;looks&amp;#34; good in the soap dish, then probably worth paying the extra.</li>
            <li> I saw a review of this on one of the YouTube channels I follow.  It was only sold as a pack of 6 bars on Amazon.  The smell is something you have to get used to and the black dye gets all over the place.  I would not recommend.</li>
            <li> One of the ingredients is labeled fragrance which basically means cheap chemical smell. Better off with a handmade soap with real essential oils and maybe even bought locally. Aside from the fragrance it seems to be the ash they claim it to be but it is from some random company in Nigeria so one can only hope that it is ethically sourced and that the ingredients are what they claim to be.</li>
            <li> I have used this soap for the past year now. I absolutely love it and recommend it to all my friends and family. I had a very hard time using facial products with any success, even the \\&quot;sensitive skin\\&quot; ones would irritate me. I use this soap on my whole body and face two times a day and my skin has never been clearer or smoother. To boot, the smell is invigorating.</li>
            <li> I used this soap for a little over a month.  The first few weeks I had some small pimples that I thought was part of the \\&quot;purging\\&quot; stage but after week three it was terrible!  My whole face broke out in a rash and you could feel little bumps all over my cheeks, temples, and jawline.  I went back to using the product I was using prior and I&#x27;m happy to say that things are clearing up.  I was hoping this was going to be a great find, but I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
            <li> Not sure what it is, but this stuff clears body acne like nothing else.</li>
            <li> it did not clear my acne at all....it also stinging my face a lot....Good thing its a natural product, just not working for me.</li>
            <li> The smell was so overbearing/fakey-funk that I returned this before even opening the the plastic. I don&#x27;t care how &amp;#34;wonderful&amp;#34; it is- nothing could convince me to live with that stench. At least it convinced me to stay with my current soap.</li>
            <li> This soap has a great smell and a good skin feel, but it dries out my skin terribly. I already live in a desert climate, and lotions tend to irritate my skin, so I really can&#x27;t use this soap anymore.</li>
            <li> After reading all the great reviews about this soap I decided to give this a try. After about 3 days of using this soap I noticed something very frightening. After using the soap all over my body I had an extreme burning feeling on my face and arms... during about the second day of using the soap  my face and arms started to get extremely red and irritated. Then on the third day the redness and irritation got so bad that I had to go see a doctor and I was prescribed some ointment.     My best advice is to buy just ONE bar of soap and test it out. If you have sensitive skin stay clear of this stuff because it will seriously damage your skin.  And also beware of all the positive reviews... sometimes I wonder if they are truly genuine.    The organic products sometimes do more harm than good... If anyone would like the rest of my unopened soap... let me know and I will gladly send it to you for free.</li>
            <li> And I wonder if all those reviews are fake, because it seems weird that I can&#x27;t find this soap anywhere else on the net but amazon.com has a ton of positive reviews about it? Anyway....    I have sensitive skin. I need soap that&#x27;s good for sensitive skin. After 2 days of use, my skin was dry, scaly, and itchy as hell. My first concern with this soap is that they don&#x27;t disclose all of the ingredients, they only list the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients in bullets on the box. For starters, I KNOW this soap has artificial fragrance and dyes in it because I can see it and smell it. It rinses brown like you had covered yourself in dirt and rinsed it off and the soap just absolutely REEKS, my entire bathrooms stinks of the stuff. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, it&#x27;s quite pleasant actually, but its just too strong and powerful for sensitive skin. Won&#x27;t buy again and would not recommend to anyone.</li>
            <li> Smells wonderful, and makes our skin feel great!  Will be ordering more soon! We like the therapeutic properties of this soap.</li>
            <li> Good soap. Smells very good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy more of this. It&#x27;s good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts pretty long and the bars are big.</li>
            <li> It can clean my face very well and owning to this, my acne start to disappear. It&#x27;s even much better than any special facial cleansers I used before.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap. I used to buy it from a store in the town where I was living but I moved and had to order it from here, so I bought the 6 pack and well after trying it I realized that it feels different in texture and it has a weird fruity smell and it also burned my cheeks. It&#x27;s confusing cause I&#x27;ve been using this soap for about 4 months now and it never gave me that reaction. It sucks cause it was really working for my acne.</li>
            <li> I LOVE THIS STUFF!!! IT WORKS!!</li>
            <li> Best soup ever!!! Leave my skin soft and smell so good!!!</li>
            <li> Very satisfied with the purchase.</li>
            <li> am start to use it for almost one week. it is refresh my face and keep it clean. i think it is better for oily skin very good</li>
            <li> It was great I love the scent. It reminded me of back home in the Caribbean.</li>
            <li> i love this soap made my skin clear up and super smooth</li>
            <li> I think its really good for acne and it is not really for dry skin. So be careful if you have dry skin.</li>
            <li> Great soap, smells really nice.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I use it twice a day. It does wonders for my face and my eczema. Be sure to moisturize right after you use it to get the best results.</li>
            <li> A friend recommended this soap and I&#x27;m glad she did.  It leaves my skin so soft and the smell is wonderful.</li>
            <li> I honestly purchased this soap for childish reasons. I bought this soap as a gag gift for my mom because it had &amp;#34;Dudu&amp;#34; in the name and was brown. It got a few chuckles. Then she immediately re-gifted it to me. So I gave it a try. It is actually very good soap. It is great for sensitive skin and moisturizing. The dry skin on my hands was smooth in less than 3 days. It was great on my face, and left it feeling squeaky clean with no residue. The only drawback is that it is extremely soft, so it melted away pretty quickly when left on my sink. It quickly dissolves when sitting on a wet surface (even a slightly wet one). I ended up using a soap holder with holes that let water drain out. The second bar lasted probably twice as long doing this. I plan on buying more.</li>
            <li> I use this soap on my face, and it has been such a help. I don&#x27;t have an overwhelming amount of acne, but I get some from time to time. In general, I have oily skin as well. This helps keep my face feeling suuuper nice, and keep everything even. It&#x27;s a little much the first times around. Like my face would get too dry, but the key that I&#x27;ve found from my experience is not to leave it on my face too long. Of course moisturize after. It smells nice, and lasts a while if you only use it as a face soap since a little goes a long way with this.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a couple months.  I really like the soap.</li>
            <li> I bought because the box says pure natural ingredients. Once I received it, the last ingredient is &#x27;fragrance&#x27; which there is nothing natural about. I also really don&#x27;t like the way it smells. I recommend Nubian Heritage black soap over this. I&#x27;ll use up what I have but I won&#x27;t be reordering this.</li>
            <li> it smell good,I hava a try as soon as I receive it!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like it. Is horrible smell and can&#x27;t be cleaned on my face.</li>
            <li> I will always buy this soap.</li>
            <li> very bad packaging without any protection, I don&#x27;t know product is good or not, but package was very awful and dissappointed.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite facial soap ever. I have finally built my perfect skin care routine and it is going very well even during this harsh winter. Note: I have eczema and this actually made it worse when I used it on my body so I would not recommend it (it made itching worse - but I also was not properly moisturizing my body after using this so it is possible that might have been the problem). On the other hand, I&#x27;ve been taking one of the white washcloths I use only for my face and I wet it. Then I rub the soap with the towel to get a small-to-medium amount on there and wash my face. That combined with Audrey Organics Vitamin C toner and then raw/pure Cocoa Butter or Shea Butter afterwards has really done wonders and I&#x27;m always getting compliments on my skin. Another note: I do try to eat healthy, but no more than the average person so I know its due to the combo I described above.&lt;br /&gt;Just to compare with other black soaps. It is not crumbly and maintains a solid shape. Dark brown that does NOT stain at all (my white washcloths are just fine and stay white when rinsed out or washed). It does melt a significant amount faster in moisture than most soaps so make sure to keep in a separate dish. It has an herbal citrus-y smell that is a little strong at first, but does not last on your skin. I believe that it can even tone and fight acne very well as long as you make sure you are using a good moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Avalon-Organics-Vitamin-Balancing-Facial/dp/B001211B0Y/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1393330634&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;vitamin+c+toner</li>
            <li> This soap works wonders for my skin. I recommended to my best friend and she loves it. I will definitely keep using this product.</li>
            <li> Really good for skin problems will definitely buy again</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t really do anything for my acne. It actually made my face really dry. It smells good though, that&#x27;s the only good thing about it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, give Shea Moisture Black Bar Soap a try, it worked for me.</li>
            <li> Cleared up oily skin bumps on hubby&#x27;s back.  Nothing had worked prior to using this. It appears to have an antibacterial effect on the sweat and skin oil build-up while he is working. Whatever it does, he is very happy with the results.</li>
            <li> I have oily acne prone skin (still at 40) and this is a great soap!!! The reviews on here that state their skin got worse must have allergies to the ingredients. It lathers well, washes clean... As matter of fact I have a &amp;#34;soap residue ring&amp;#34; in my shower and I have this soap on a hanging organizer, where the water has dripped from the soap it cleared a path through the soap scum, yet gentle enough to not leave my skin dry. The only downside is it smells a little different than I am used to, but there is no fragrance after I get out of the shower. Other than that I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this stuff!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap to wash my face for the past 3 months, and it&#x27;s been a nice surprise. Some of the reviews had me worried as I have a sensitive skin. The soap turned out to be good for me. At first, my face felt really dry after washing it, but as long as you moisturize your face, you&#x27;re fine. It did get rid of some of the blemishes, but I wouldn&#x27;t count on the soap alone to do that. At any rate, I like this soap, because it leaves me feeling very clean whether it&#x27;s my face, or my body. My girlfriend now uses it to wash her face, and she loves it too. We&#x27;re sold!</li>
            <li> The soap really does leave your skin smooth and moisturized. The bars are individually packaged. Each bar lasts a long time. It is advisable to keep bar in a soap dish because it will leave a brown residue. I had expected my wash cloths to get stained but has not been the case.</li>
            <li> left my skin feeling and looking great....mixed with my cologne, it did a good job with scent as well. good purhase overall</li>
            <li> This is our family&#x27;s new favorite soap. We&#x27;ve been a Dr. Bonners family for years, but this soap just smells so good and works so well that it has become our new favorite. It&#x27;s all natural and the charcoal in it helps soften hair and skin and leaves you feeling extra clean.</li>
            <li> I have found this to be one of the best soaps that I&#x27;ve ever used. It leaves your skin clean. Be sure to use a  moisturizing lotion afterward as it seems to pull all the oils from your skin. It also has a pleasant smell, not too sweet. I recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Dudu osun Is the best soap ever for your face. Shipping was fast and free. The boxes were a lil beat up but I still give it 5 stars.</li>
            <li> Best Soap ever smells hella good only soap I use...  I wash with this soap and put on a  Versace Dreamer or Polo Big pony number 1 cologne and get stopped by women all the time telling me how good i smell</li>
            <li> I have really bad skin that can be both oily and very very dry as well as pilaris keratosis around my eyes. After the first time I used the soap my skin felt softer and tighter. Because of my skin&#x27;s dryness from the extreme temperatures this winter, my skin would burn a little for a week or so when I used the  soap, but after patting my skin dry and applying coconut oil, I felt fine and now that it&#x27;s healed there isn&#x27;t any burning. The area around my eyes gets red and burns occasionally briefly after using but that&#x27;s because of the sensitivity of the area. My skin still breaks out, but not as frequently, though when they do appear they tend to be big but it seems to be getting better and these seem to be more related to hormonal issues than oiliness.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap in place of my face wash now for 2 years. I will never go back to putting chemicals on my face. I used to have slight break outs but now my face is always clear. I love this stuff and how clean it makes me feel after using it. There was though about a month purging period where I broke out like crazy along my jaw line when first using this soap. But then after that my skin was perfect. After I wash my face I use jojoba oil as my moisturizer. It&#x27;s imitates the skins natural sebum, Works great together.</li>
            <li> Sorry to all the acne prone hopefuls, but this is no miracle bar as perceived by recent reviews. At first, the soap seemed to work, leaving my face feeling refreshed, but as the weeks went on, I started having dry skin. This especially was true near my nose, where the skin started peeling. It also does not prevent acne breakouts, as I&#x27;ve had my worst while using this soap for a month. I&#x27;ll continue looking for one that will.</li>
            <li> Great items at great prices With fast shipping from a great dealer.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> My husband has itchy, sensitive skin.  This soap lathers up really good and he doesn&#x27;t have as much itching with this soap..</li>
            <li> Customer time and time again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is shipped tightly package in a sealed bag with box cushion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the fragrance is heavenly , think of the cleanest smell x100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suds are plentiful and easily achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Storage is a MUST IN A DRY PLACE, I bought a soap box from target .99 .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my face and my body with a exfoliating pad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No break out problems,  I have medium sensitive skin in areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again purchase this,  and you&#x27;ll be hooked!</li>
            <li> Perfect product. Great shipper!</li>
            <li> Been using for almost a year. Love the smell and helps a lot with exfoliation.</li>
            <li> My favorite soap. Came nicely and tightly packaged. No issues at all.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my son who has facial dandruff and required special cream. It cleared up his skin without irritation and went back to natural tone. I tried it on my skin although I don&#x27;t have issues. It leaves my skin very smooth and lathers so well I hate to wash it off the face cloth. Smells pretty decent and I take it with me on the road. It will dwindle fast if you leave it wet so make sure to put it in a drainable soap dish.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I need to clean my face and make me feel better</li>
            <li> Great product! But one bar only last for a week...</li>
            <li> My skin has been getting a lot better, I am acne prone and it has fading my scars away and minimizing my acne. Great Product (:</li>
            <li> I love this soap!  I use it as a nightly cleanser.  I then apply my nightly cream.  The first few times of using this sopa it can seem harsh and may seem drying but with continued use you will notice softer glowing skin.</li>
            <li> Looks ugly, with good.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, did I say  love it!!!  Great smell makes your sking feel great,</li>
            <li> great buy !! just get a good lather and it wont be as harsh</li>
            <li> This soap is great for your skin.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff- use it on body and hair. Hubby loves it too. I notice fewer body bumps and blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;It is a bit drying so have a good lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> These were bought by my wife but she didn&#x27;t like them I ended up reluctantly trying the mud packed looking bar and found that I really loved them! I use them for everrrryyything, shower related, not everything everything, I mean like face and body weirdos. I really really like them and will probably order more soon. Spicy World of USA, Inc, watch out for my order! I will be buying sooooon! Hope that got their attention to make sure my order of 6 come on time, just like the last time.</li>
            <li> This soap is definitely clearing up the marks on my face. I love it and will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This is my second time ordering, this time not for me but my Aunt as a part of her Christmas gift. She got a bar from my last order and loves it. Smells good, lasts pretty long as long as you don&#x27;t let it sit in a puddle after your shower.</li>
            <li> I would rather just not use water this smells so bad. Nothing healthier anyways than scrubbing your body with water only.</li>
            <li> Smells to earthy, and not clean to me.</li>
            <li> Okay! So this soap is a miracle (FOR MY SKIN). Due to me taking birth control my hormones got a little out of wack, leaving me with TERRIBLE break-outs! And after having years of clear skin, this bothered me so much. I started getting facials with Bioelements products which started making a &amp;#34;little&amp;#34; difference.But break outs would still pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So finally a good friend of mine from Nigeria went to visit &amp; brought me back about 2 bars and told me to try it. I started a routine of washing with Dudu-Osun black soap and washing with Bioelements Foam Cleanser (Good product also). And using witch hazel as an astringent. My face has cleared up SO MUCH! Blackheads/Dark spots has disappeared, my skin is back glowing again. P.S. I sometimes use the Dudu Osun with the Japanese exfoliating towel about 2x a week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it! But not for EVERY SKIN type. My skin type is oily/dry combination. So yes, it leaves my face a bit dry but I moisturize well directly after I apply my astringent.</li>
            <li> A co-worker of mine gave me a bar of this wonderful soap for me to try. I thought it was a bit crazy to use such an ugly bar of soap, but don&#x27;t let it&#x27;s appearance fool you! I&#x27;m a bubble and suds fan so I was pleasantly surprised on the lather that this soap creates! It has a fresh smell and it actually makes my skin look fabulous! I have keratosis polaris and very sensitive skin. This soap didn&#x27;t turn me red at all like other soaps do. I even use it on my face which has been ridding me of dark spots and redness.The only down side to the soap is that its a bit messy. When it washes off your skin it looks a little brown when you see it go down the drain. Also you need to get some kind of soap holder (super cheap at Wal-Mart), because if you don&#x27;t it runs brown drips down your walls. Now my other co-workers want to try a bar too! :)</li>
            <li> I stumbled across this soap when I was buying stuff at my wholesaler (I sell products on Ebay and at flea markets). I noticed right away the nice aroma, so I said, what the heck and bought a six pack. This is great stuff, if you keep it in your bathroom there is no need for anything else to keep it smelling fresh, the soap has a strong but very nice smell, you will know that it is there as soon as you open the door. The soap clean very well, I would say this is one of the only bar soaps that could be classified as a a &amp;#34;all in one soap&amp;#34; . Body, hair, face does not matter where it is used you will be pleased with the results. Buy just one six pack and you will be back for more. As a seller of many other products I can say that is product is of very high quality.</li>
            <li> It is a good soap for sensitive skin. It is a little weird to clean yourself with a soap that looks like dirty but not a big deal. Smells really good. Doesn&#x27;t last so long</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me</li>
            <li> Dudu Osun Black Soap&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this because it seemed odd and had a funny name.&lt;br /&gt;My second order was because it&#x27;s great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Dudu leaves a bit of beneficial amino acids on one&#x27;s hands.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smoothing and protective.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried bathing with it, but I bet it would be good.&lt;br /&gt;It smells good -- not like doo doo.</li>
            <li> First off let me give you a little background... I am a hardcore buyer and trier of new products to better my skin (anti-aging, blemishes, spot correcting), along with other products like cosmetics, hair products, and body moisturizers. I am on a constant search to find a beauty regimen that suit ALL of my needs. If you ask anyone I know, they will tell you I am always looking for the \\&quot;next best thing\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to look no further for face soap!! I do use it on my hair and body as well, so it&#x27;s an all-in-one, but the most notable difference is in my face. I am biracial and suffered from random breakouts below my cheek bones over the last few years. And since I can&#x27;t just let things be, I picked them and left dark marks on my skin. I used the clinique bar for years, and it left my skin feeling clean, but there&#x27;s no discernible difference in the health/appearance of my skin. I switched to Cetaphil for about a month and it was too gentle. Anywho, I have been using this soap day and night for about a week and I&#x27;m telling EVERYONE I know about it since I am the cosmetics/beauty guru at my work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is combination with a little more than occasional large cystic acne in the aforementioned area. I have small blackheads on my nose, small bumps in my t-zone area, and under my eyes called milia (possibly from concealer that contains oil). I also have some sparse, very small, clogged sebaceous glands in various areas on my face (forehead/chin). THIS SOAP IS CORRECTING ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS!!! Again, I have only used it for about a week!! Also the pores on the side of the bridge of my nose, under my eyes, have noticeably gotten smaller AND the dark marks on my cheeks from picking at old blemishes have lightened considerably in this short period of time. The women in my life that I VERY OFTEN discuss beauty products with have also noticed a difference. I suspect that I will have the skin I used to have (before quitting birth control) in the next few weeks.THIS SOAP HAS BEEN A MIRACLE FOR ME!! No need to ever try the \\&quot;next best thing\\&quot;.. this IS the best thing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since everyone&#x27;s skin is different, all I can do is suggest you give it a try. I bought the 3 pack to save a few bucks per bar figuring that I could always just use it as a shampoo or give it away if it somehow didn&#x27;t agree with my skin. My skin did NOT burn but I feel a slight tingle in the crevasses around my nostrils after sudsing up. I love a deep clean, so I lather my face and rub in small circles for a few minutes before rinsing. My skin feels tight and dry post-wash, so I moisturize immediately after. This has not stained my tub or towels and the only way I would see this happening is if people are using too much soap and not rinsing thoroughly. This soap is quite concentrated and a little goes a loooong way!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be purchasing more of this soap in the future (in greater bulk), and I&#x27;m sorry I haven&#x27;t found it sooner. I do plan to try the 1 lb block of soap at some point, but this is working so well on my face, why would I want to ruin a good thing?</li>
            <li> My favorite soap, can&#x27;t live without it. It&#x27;s earthy smell is what makes it so awesome. It smells so good I could eat it...just kidding.</li>
            <li> I use this product to deal with ingrown hairs, abscesses, and psoriasis.  My skin feels great.  Three points to make:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. This is not the &amp;#34;raw&amp;#34; product.  It is, however, more consumer friendly.  It is ready right out of the box and won&#x27;t require any tinkering, cutting, or solidifying.  It&#x27;s still a great product and can help you with acne, psoriasis, dry skin, oily skin, razor bumps, and is also antibacterial WITHOUT the use of chemicals (it creates an environment that bacteria can&#x27;t live in, basically).  You can also use it in your hair to help with dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The smell is less than ideal for me (26 year old male).  I usually follow it up with just a little bit of my ordinary bar soap and everything works itself out. Soap still works as advertised. I actually keep the unopened boxes in a plastic bag, since the smell is pretty strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. If you don&#x27;t already have one, get a soap saver or something.  This stuff gets pretty soft and will &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; itself out if kept in standing water.</li>
            <li> It took me a long time to find the right soap.  Fortunately, I finally found Dudu Osun Black Soap.  It&#x27;s exactly what I have been seeking.  Great!</li>
            <li> I am so pleased with the results of this soap. The other reviewers were right. It clears up skin problems, leaves your skin moisturized or at least, more able to benefit from your moisturizer. My hair responded to it&#x27;s healing qualities as well. Don&#x27;t know how I ever got along without it. My skin is in better condition than it has ever been and even though I didn&#x27;t have terrible skin issues, I had troubling rough areas and some stubborn whiteheads. This soap has taken care of all of that. Have recommended it to several other people. Also, really appreciated the wonderful price from Spicy World of USA.</li>
            <li> I love the smell and it works wonders on my body and face. Helps with acne. If you get a bump on your face, wet your finger, rub it on the soap and simple cover the pimple or bump. It will dry it up and get rid of the imperfection.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of soap and this has been, by far, the best! Great scent, clean rinse, not overly drying, all natural! Such a great product, and at $2/bar, very reasonable compared to some over-priced luxury soaps on the market.</li>
            <li> Great soap. It smells amazing and helped clear up some &amp;#34;sunspots&amp;#34; I had close to my nose. I highly recommend it to clear up any blemishes.</li>
            <li> It feel very good on the skin</li>
            <li> BEST soap in the world!</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a good soap, it doesn&#x27;t help with my psoriasis at all, but it&#x27;s feels better on it then regular soaps.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve gone through probably 15 bars.&lt;br /&gt;i like it, and will keep ordering it.</li>
            <li> Great soap for cleansing, smells great!</li>
            <li> Love this! It works amazingly... My mom was skeptical but even after using it, people kept telling her that her skin was glowing.</li>
            <li> as usual. LUV,LUV,LUV IT!!!!! I use this soap from head to toe!</li>
            <li> Everyone should at least try this soap.  This soap is clean and has no chemicals added to it.  I am a burn survivor that has had a problem with dry skin for a long time.  I have tried lotions, medicated soaps and none of them helped me like this soap does.  The majority of my dry skin is all cleared up, and since I lost the oils in my scalp due to the fire I was in, my scalp was really bad, and in about a months times, I have very little flaking on my scalp today.  I use this soap for my body and my hair, and it is imo, the best soap ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a dry skin problem, give this soap a try.  I tried the 3 pack, and then ordered the 6 pack and will continue to order from this good seller on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My case worker as well took down the information on this soap and will be passing it along to other clients that have been severely burned and have to deal with severe dry skin problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was amazed when she saw the difference of my skin not being so dry and cracking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to Amazon and to the seller of this product for making it easy to order and to shop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
            <li> 7-25-12 I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement acne/bumps wise. The plus that I do see though is the texture and feel of my skin. It makes it super soft and easier for lotion/body butter to sink in. It also does wonders for my feet, keeps them soft all day long and I only put vaseline on my feet: with other soaps the vaseline never had this effect. IDK if this is normal, and I&#x27;ve only been using this for almost two weeks but from other reviews they say that this soap has an almost instantaneous effect. So far, I don&#x27;t see any big changes. I&#x27;ll update when it&#x27;s been a month of using and let you know.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time.  Initially, I was in awe of the soap but as the weeks progressed I became more and more leary of all the rave reviews I had read.  I did not dry my face out but it did not help to clear blemishes either.  Overall, I would say the product was okay but will not continue to use in the future.</li>
            <li> This soap is nowhere near the product that it is supposed to be, it is very misleading when trying to buy real black soap that actually helps the appearance of your skin. This product did nothing for my skin and I will never buy it again!!!</li>
            <li> My sons play a lot of sports and they break out a lot , thier back forehead etc.. I bought after reading about it, my sons and husband use it and it&#x27;s worked! We would spend so much money on acne products and now I just stock up on the soap.y husband works with oil and grease, he&#x27;s a machinest and one side of his arm gets full of oil and grease which would result in breakouts on his arm and back.  With in a couple of weeks it all cleared up!! Very Happy !</li>
            <li> It is ok...I&#x27;ll stick with Safeguard when all gone. Didn&#x27;t see what everyone else was raving about.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I heard it was good for your skin.  It lathers great and has been wonderful for skin.  I am an adult who still gets occassional acne.  This soap is the best cleanser I have ever used.  I cancelled my Proactive subscription an only use this soap now.  I use this soap for my whole body and also for my son who has eczema.  My husband also uses this soap.  We just love it.</li>
            <li> Best soap I ever used! I suffer from acme on face and body and have tried everything. Proactive works but as soon as you stop using it the acme comes back! So I got this soap and its amazing I saw results right away! I&#x27;m trying to use all organic and natural products and also eat organic and for this price its amazing. I recommend this to everyone. Will be buying forever! Lol :)</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had redness and breakouts all over my shoulders, chest, back, and face since hitting puberty. I tried everything and nothing but this soap works. I can finally see my shoulder with no blemishes for the first time since I was a little girl, and I love how it smells. It&#x27;s also nice to know that it&#x27;s all natural.</li>
            <li> love this product reorder it all the time</li>
            <li> I feel silly saying I love a soap, however, it&#x27;s true! The smell is crisp and clean, and makes my skin feel amazing. In addition, I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months and have been noticing stretch marks fading! I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different creams and lotions for this, and nothing has ever worked as well as this soap seems to. The only downfall is that it IS black soap. It tends to leave ugly soap smudges (looks like dirt), but easy enough to clean up. Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I obsolutly love this soap, it keeps my skin smooth and velvety. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the strong acidity in it, don&#x27;t let it get in your privates or it would burn.</li>
            <li> Makes you skin soft and smooth help to remove dead skin especially from arm pits. Gives skin a nice glow</li>
            <li> Oh. My. God. This is possibly the best soap I have ever purchased. I love handmade soaps, natural soaps, anything really, but this stuff is the BEST! The smell is over powering at first, but once you use it a few times it dies down. I personally think it&#x27;s a wonderful fresh woodsy smell. I&#x27;ve tried other black soaps and they stained my sponges and after I took a shower I would have to quickly wipe the bottom of the tub with my foot or the black streaks would stain and stay until I actually took the time to scrub it with a sponge. This soap splashes little gray dots on your shower wall and you stand in a puddle of what looks like dirty water while you use it but without even trying to clean it, by the end of the shower, every dark mark is gone! I like to rub the bar onto my sponge and use that to wash my body. It suds up so well even without the sponge though and doesn&#x27;t leave a &#x27;slippery&#x27; residue when you&#x27;re done. It really cleans. Also, I read a review where it helped with body acne and although my days of battling body acne are pretty much over, I still break out on my back and face sometimes. I have very oily skin and I noticed when I use this on my face in the morning, that day my face looks less shiny. However, it&#x27;s a little harsh and I can feel my face tighten and, not burn, but it feels a little uncomfortable a little after I wash my face and even when I put lotion on. So I try not to do that all the time. However, I love using this soap all over my body, especially before I work out because I found out that if I use this bar and sweat a bunch and I can&#x27;t clean up after I won&#x27;t break out at all, usually I&#x27;ll have a couple pimples here and there because of the sweat and stuff but none that I can really think of since I&#x27;ve been using this soap. It also improved my underarm odor. When I accidentally skipped a day of deodorant in the past and ended up sweating a lot, the pits of my shirts would hint a bit of BO, who wouldn&#x27;t? After using this soap, however, thatdoesn&#x27;t happen. I LOVE it :) Plus you get SO many for an amazing price! I received it very quickly as well!</li>
            <li> Love it! Just as I expected!</li>
            <li> Some of the best smelling soap you will ever come across, seriously wonderful smell. Cleans good, very nice soap.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this soap for a while. It&#x27;s all we use now. I love the rich scent!</li>
            <li> Thank you. Just started using but face feels wonderful afterwards. Will repost after 4 weeks of use.</li>
            <li> This soap has improved my skin significantly, which is prone to cystic acne. It can be a little drying, but overall I really like it. It has a great scent as well.</li>
            <li> My children love this soap and claim it works on acne, so I purchase the soap regularly.</li>
            <li> It was ok, there was no exfoliation from this soap and its a more creamier lather. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing, not for me!</li>
            <li> This is a great product. I have been using it for years. Great for eczema!</li>
            <li> Began sloughing off dead skin after the first use!! Burns a bit but I noticed a difference after the first time I used it!! Will be ordering more and more!!</li>
            <li> Been using dudu osun for a while and I like it. A little goes a long way but the con are; it dries your face so get a good facial moisturizer, and keep on dry surfaces because it melts easily.</li>
            <li> I have been using Dudu Osun Black Soap everyday for six months now. I wash my hair with it using only the bar.  I have long fine hair and with this soap their is no need for conditioner.  The soap rinses very clean and leaves my hair squeaky, and dries baby soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely need body lotion on my body or face, but I do use 50-50 water and vegatable glycerine after a shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad to find a product that works so well and without all of the chemical additives.  Dudu Osun Black Soap is the only soap in my bathroom!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
            <li> This IS my favorite soap. Yes, it is messy and will leave stains on your sink, but they are easily rinsed off, so no problem. I at first used it for my face only, and it felt radiant. I now use it for all my body, skin feels really smooth and clean. I don&#x27;t mind the smell either. I like it a lot.</li>
            <li> Okay, I can vouch for all the other reviewers&#x27; praise for this soap. I now use it for my face in addition to my body, and as long as one applies a lotion afterward, this is the best soap ever. Seriously, ever. For example: I got super glue ALL over my fingertips during a project. The glue had been dry for a couple of hours and I was resigned the fact that my fingertips were going to be annoyingly calloused looking and uncomfortable for a couple of days, because you know, it&#x27;s super glue. Nothing gets this stuff off, right? So I hopped in the shower, washed my face, body- shampooed my hair, everything per usual. Applied make-up, went out, only to realize, \\&quot;Wait!? My fingers are completely, 100% clean!!! What the---??!\\&quot; There is no redness, no soreness- which makes sense because I did absolutely no scrubbing, but my goodness. Completely amazed. Wonder soap. Yes, my face tingled when I first began using this product, but it goes away. It&#x27;s great for acne. Not to be overly dramatic, but this soap gets you a different kind of clean. I&#x27;m spreading the word and buying this soap for everyone.</li>
            <li> I use it for my face and it works very well.  It has cleared my skin.  When using as a total body wash it puts a major ring around he tub, but then again it is black soap.</li>
            <li> Let me start this off by saying that I have tried nearly everything. My dermatologist even told me my skin was one of the most sensitive types she&#x27;s ever seen, even if u touched my face, the spot where you touched would turn red and stay red for a minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had bad acne. And it wasn&#x27;t the typical pizza face acne either, it was swollen, painful cysts underneath my skin. There was a specific type of acne I had, but I forgot the name. It was caused by hormones, since I had been on hormone replacement therapy for nearly 5 months at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried proactiv, acne free, wexler, cetaphil, tea tree oil, Neutrogena, all kinds of generic brands and more. All of which nearly chemically burned my face or dried it out to the point where my skin would crack and bleed no matter how much moisturizer, I was literally starting to look like a zombie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came across this stuff and it didn&#x27;t work for me, didn&#x27;t clear up my acne and still dried out my skin. However, I was put on accutane for 6 months and it cleared me up but only for about a month after treatment ended. I started using this soap again when I noticed more breakouts and it started working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this in combination of a face brush and cetaphil facial lotion - I have not had a breakout since and it has been a full year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, if you have bad acne, sometimes no amount of topical solutions can help you. Ask your derma about accutane or an oral antibiotic, its helped me and my brother tremendously</li>
            <li> I still have apparent melisma after a half year of using it...😞</li>
            <li> I will definitely continue ordering!  No more acne!!! Perfect on my body as well.</li>
            <li> Love it. My skin has never looked better. Good price too.</li>
            <li> This soap had a lot of good reviews and I bought it because of that. I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now, since I started using it I developed a rash on my face( my face is usually clear)! I like the way it feels and smells though. I&#x27;m glad other people like it but personally I will not purchase this black soap again! So disappointed.</li>
            <li> This product is awesome. My face hasn&#x27;t been this moisturized after washing in so long. I have dry skin so I use this combo with raw shea butter and my face feels like a baby&#x27;s bottom... which is the desired effect.</li>
            <li> Smells more manly than I like - seems to moisturize OK. It is a rough soap - meaning there is a grit like substance in it. Had my neighbor try it and she did not like it ...Would not be good for sensitive skin. If you love a clean shower tub - be forewarned - this will leave a brownish residue on the tub....</li>
            <li> i love this soap!  Pros:   good for acne,  oily skin and hair,  and tightens you vag! works like china shrink creme but last longer!    cons:  I am not a fan of the scent  don&#x27;t use no dry skin.</li>
            <li> This is like the best soap I have ever used. It is now our go-to soap for the household. Get yourself some. Clean yourself.</li>
            <li> I tried many products but this one is the only one that I feel does all it promises to do. My son uses it for his dry skin and it works so well. I have oily skin and it works well on me too! I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> First of I have used dozens of Shea butter soaps over the last 10 years in search of my ideal soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box this soap smells strong if you are like me and have a very strong sense of smell this stuff can be smelled half a mile away. Up close this stuff its overpowers most of the chemical soaps on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is super drying compared to better shea butter soaps, I can hardly believe how drying this soap is for all the positive reviews on it. My skin hasn&#x27;t felt this dried out since I stopped using normal store brand soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall if you like &amp;#34;store&amp;#34; soap and you are looking for something more natural this could be a good soap, if you are looking for something that is really going to make your skin feel good after a shower and not burn your sinuses keep looking.</li>
            <li> I really love using this soap. I first discovered it after visiting a friend in Florida and the bars cost $4 each! Buying on amazon is a much better option for me. Its a great supply of soap at an affordable price. This soap is an awsome exfoliant that is great for getting rid of dead skin and cleansing pores. I use this as an all over soap and as a mask. I&#x27;ve also heared of people using it to wash their hair and I plan on giving that a try as well since I&#x27;m going natural :) Overall really good product!</li>
            <li> No complaints. Good price, natural product. Seems to lather very well and the bars are much bigger than other brands of soaps, which seemed to have reduced their bar sizes over the years.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product and so far it works great. I feel clean with no residue and my skin doesn&#x27;t feel dry after I get out of the shower. As far as my complexion and break outs go, I think I need to give it more than 2 uses before I can judge on that.</li>
            <li> This soap cleanses really well and got rid of my acne and acne scars. My skin is soft and has a nice even tone. It can be a little drying, though, so make sure you moisturize.</li>
            <li> I use this product all time.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing!!! I purchased initially for my face due to hormonal acne changes &amp; dark spots. Cleared everything without rebounding. The dark spots took about 6 weeks to notice a difference, but looks great. It has a fresh, tropical scent, doesn&#x27;t overdry the skin &amp; leaves it feeling squeaky clean. I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a great product and it shipped quickly!I will be ordering this product for awhile because it clears my skin!</li>
            <li> It just feels like regular soap to me. It dries my skin out a lot more than other things in the past that i used have.</li>
            <li> Been great so far. Dries my skin a little, but it&#x27;s nothing some lotion can&#x27;t fix.</li>
            <li> My husband and I won&#x27;t use any other soap now. I even have my daughters and grandchildren using Black soap.</li>
            <li> purchased this on a reccomendation from someone else, made my skin and face feel really soft and hydrated. would def reccomend to others</li>
            <li> Got my soap very quickly. I swear by this stuff! I love it!</li>
            <li> I like the scent and how the soap lathers. It does stain the bathtub though....</li>
            <li> Fantastic!!! Absolutely love !! made my skin feel awesome!! Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> I first found this soap at a flower how in Boston, Ma. The next year I was able to get more and after that I was unable to locate anymore. Just found them on Amazon and I couldn&#x27;t be happier!  The soap leaves you clean and refreshed . The soap doesNOT dry out your skin and leaves it soft and moist.</li>
            <li> Im a real fan of african product. African castor oil (or the Haitian one) , black soaps...ladida...this one leaves me feeling clean and the price was reasonable. Will purchase more because i have been sharing what i have so far:)</li>
            <li> This is a really great soap, and the price for that many bars is a great deal.  I&#x27;ve always had acne prone skin since I was a teenager, and it&#x27;s not until I started using various brands of black soap that it started clearing up.  I&#x27;m sticking to Dudu cause the price is unbeatable.  Oh, and I love the smell.:-)</li>
            <li> I use this even for my face and it doesn&#x27;t dry it out AT ALL - and I have very dry skin.  I also use it as a shaving soap for my legs.  I have seen people complain about this staining and I don&#x27;t agree with that AT ALL.  Yes, the bar is black so it can turn things brown that it touches but I&#x27;ve never once had it stain anything and I have been using it for a couple of years.  A quick rinse and everything is fine.</li>
            <li> Very good soap. Notice some great changes in my skin since using dudu osun. It also leaves your skin clean without soapy residue.</li>
            <li> It smells great and moisturizes my skin wonderfully. I have a history of dry skin and eczema for many years now. This stuff literally speeds up the healing of my skin cuts and scabs. Plus, the usual obsession of putting lotion on is no longer an... obsession. That tight feeling I usually feel after I shower and lotion is barely there. I&#x27;m planning on ordering more of these in the future!</li>
            <li> My mother put me on to \\&quot;black soap\\&quot;. I went to go visit her after about 2 or 3 weeks of not seeing her. My mom was about 45 at the time, and has always been very very low maintenance, and never really had any kind of skin care routine, but her skin looked beautiful, radiant, tight and she had a visible reduction in the lines around her eyes and between her eyebrows. Unprompted I was like \\&quot;what are you using!?\\&quot; And she told me she&#x27;d been using some black soap from the local farmers market. She never told me the brand, but I did my research and decided to try dudu osun, and my experience with it has been great. My skin is relatively dry and flakey and the soap exfoliates my skin and makes it soft and glowy. The first time I used it I buffed my face with this soap and a gentle washcloth. My skin looked raw, bright pink and shiny but after a few hours, the redness went down and my skin felt cleaner and smoother than it ever did in my life, and after that I never had the sensitivity when using the soap. This soap leaves no residue whatsoever and makes your skin feel fresh. I also have some hyperpigmentation issues (freckles), dark circles, and a few fine lines around my eyes. I swear this stuff, within a matter of weeks, evens my complexion and tightens and reduces puffiness in my eye area (maybe it has some kind of antinflammatory properties?). While using this soap I got so many complements on how beautiful my skin was. Im a high maintenance girl and love to use expensive creams and products, but black soap is my go to cleanser.</li>
            <li> Using it as a body soap was not a very good experience.  I found that it stung your private areas.  Not right away but a little after.  I&#x27;m not a really sensitive person, to anything.  So for that reason alone, I didn&#x27;t like it and wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> This has been a miracle for our family! From acne to eczema!  I will be purchasing more to share with family and friends!</li>
            <li> The lather is awesome!  I loved how squeaky clean my face felt after the first use.  I now use it for my whole body as well as my face.  My 7 year old uses it as well.  I wish I would have known about it sooner.</li>
            <li> Great product. My skin feels super clean after use.</li>
            <li> All jokes aside from using soap with a name akin to washing yourself with a turd, I am very pleased with this product&#x27;s performance as someone who has suffered from skin conditions related to stress and constant aggravation from sensitive skin to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My family remarks that I smell like fresh baby powder after a shower, which isn&#x27;t a bad thing at all. My skin simply feels &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; and unburdened with any left over residues. Some black soaps cause a burning irritation if left on the skin while showering for too long, but this specific product is more tolerable. I have sensitive skin and have always been careful with my soap selection, especially on my face. I use this soap on all areas of my body except under the eyes and I am very pleased with the results. My skin feels refreshed with a healthy glow, even clearing up my occasional problematic skin irritations, such as acne and any rashes caused by the outdoors or stress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d highly recommend this product to anyone with similar issues.</li>
            <li> Smells great, all natural, eliminates eczema and keeps skin soft and supple. I even use it in my hair. Lathers great. Can be drying so please use shea butter after shower as a lotion.</li>
            <li> My entire family loves this incredible soap!</li>
            <li> This is some of the best soap I have ever used.  I have very sensitive skin and have found this soap to be helpful in eliminating the itching and skin rash.  Because this soap seems to be concentrated  using  less works best for me especially when using it for my face. I think it is a great product.</li>
            <li> This soap has a nice fresh scent. It works well clearing acne on face and occasional back acne.</li>
            <li> I use it once a day to prevent drying out. It cleans very well, though so far no noticeable difference on the acne, but I hope with more patience it will work. Love the price!</li>
            <li> Works amazingly for acne or other skin conditions.</li>
            <li> What a find, this soap is excellent! I love trying new soaps and will stick with this for a long, long time. I have gifted this to close friends (who are all surprised when I gift them a bar all wrapped up, lol). This takes off makeup, especially eye makeup, faster, better and cleaner than the priciest facial cleanser. It smells wonderful; energizing in the morning and calming at night. I am of Asian descent, over 50, and have clear skin that I have always taken care of, so I can&#x27;t speak for clearing up skin conditions, but for whole body, including face, this is the only soap you will need!&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are what motivated me to buy it, but the performance made me set this up in subscription delivery.</li>
            <li> I have friends that use this soap and I gave it a try.  To be honest I feel MUCH better using this soap.  This soap removes all the lotions, dirt, oils, etc yet not harming your skin.  You feel so refreshed and skin feels reborn.  Like a fresh new start.  It helped out with my little acne breakouts. I do recommend using lotion after you wash if you have dry skin but you will definitely feel cleaner and naturally refreshed!</li>
            <li> awesome product...great for my acne!</li>
            <li> I like it a lot, wife says it burns a bit.</li>
            <li> LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS SOAP.  SO GOOD FOR YOUR SKIN, DOESN&#x27;T DRY IT OUT.  LASTS A LONG TIME TOO</li>
            <li> It burns when you first start using it.. Don&#x27;t have a cut on your face or you will think your face is melting off. It is great for fading dark spots.</li>
            <li> It is a gift to my friend.</li>
            <li> Clean well low fragrance ,for some I thought it would eliminate lotion</li>
            <li> Late in March I had a horrible break out of acne on my face on my neck and my chest. I have never had anything like this before and to say the least it made me very upset. I tried everything you could think of and honestly I think I was making my face angry because the acne seemed to look like a rash; almost like I had the measles. After three weeks or so I decided to purchase black soap and I have to say it has been almost a month and I am acne free! My blemishes are diminished and my skin is becoming more even toned. I use this soap along with a toner and Lush cosmetics moisturizer. I have now stocked up on black soap for future breakouts and to maintain my skin.</li>
            <li> Smells great - and you&#x27;ll smell great also. Lathers up well. And it&#x27;s all natural - which is a giant upside to what you might find n the major brands. It rinses off well also. As someone else suggested you might want to buy one bar as a test for your skin. But my family uses it and no one has had any problems.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun soap. there are no words for this. Love this soap. My daughter has realiy bad eczema and acne.We have tried everything including a dermatologist. Nothing has worked as well as this and in such a short time. In just a week she know longer had very dry skin. I used it also and after showering my skin was not dry and I felt clean. I also noticed her acne was going away. she  still has flare ups but not large acne. love the soap.</li>
            <li> Do get a good clean feeling after a shower with this. Only downfall is that this soap makes me darker...I am brown skin and it&#x27;s turning my skin black. But in terms of cleaning it&#x27;s as good as it can get. Acne gone just twice after using this soap. Now I use preliminarily to battle acne when I do get them occasionally!</li>
            <li> I literally just got my Osun in the mail yesterday and decided to try it the next day.  I work early in the morning so I take a shower before hand I use the soap lightly and it was okay of course it had a burning sensation as do all black folks but overall it was fine. I&#x27;m getting home from work and I decided to take another shower before I go relax. But this time my intention is to get a deep deep clean so I take the soap and I rub it directly on my body and then I get my washcloth and I lather it up and I really deep clean my body. This time I experienced immense itching. To a point where I thought that my eczema was spreading throughout my entire body at that very moment. I quickly washed off and began to use Dr. Woods black soap that I also purchased from Amazon.  It immediately calm down the soap I was using before and the inflammation went down as well. I don&#x27;t recommend using Du Du Osun soap for deep cleaning but for lights Washing, but I will not be purchasing again</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m African so I&#x27;ve already known all about these soaps. I ordered this soap because where my school is (Norfolk, VA), there are no African stores like back where I&#x27;m from (Alexandria, VA/Woodbridge). I really love this soap and blue soaps for my face and underarms. I love the smell and I love the way it lathers up. I love this soap so much because it makes my skin smooth and if I accidentally forget to put on deodorant for the day there is NO SMELL what so ever. My underarms would actually smell really good, just like the soap :) I&#x27;m not really an odorous person to begin with but thats still amazing!</li>
            <li> I have two teens who struggle with acne. This soap works well for them - better than any other acne soap or lotions we&#x27;ve tried. And we&#x27;ve tried almost everything. It dries the acne, but does not strip the skin to the point where it is uncomfortable. Also, it&#x27;s gentle on the sensitive skin around the eyes. They use this morning and night, then follow with acne cream on individual spots. It&#x27;s been a little over 2 weeks, and I can see definite improvement in their skin. If you have acne, give it a shot.</li>
            <li> I love to cleanse my face with this soap. It is mild and deep cleanses. It works very well for people of color and does not dry out the skin or leave residue.</li>
            <li> Excellent lather. The lather is a light brown, but does not stain light colored washcloths. I like the way it smells, too. Sometimes I use this in my hair to experiment. Doesn&#x27;t seem to do any harm.</li>
            <li> my husband like this soap,i like their odour,and effectively is good.</li>
            <li> I like the way this soap smells, and it softens my sensitive, dry  skin. My only gripe is that it doesn&#x27;t last long, it becomes a little slimy and melty, not like triple-milled soap. However this may be because it is so moisturizing (I am no &amp;#34;soap-expert&amp;#34; but some other moisturizing soaps I have tried have been a little melty, too). All in all, I like it, I may try some other brands of black soap to see if they last a little longer.</li>
            <li> Love this soap!  This work very well on my skin! I recommend for anyone who has oily and dry skin and acne problems!</li>
            <li> Was for a gift from a wish loist last year.  Daughter in lsw loved it.</li>
            <li> I used have pimple on my arms but since I start use this soap it&#x27;s getting disappear and my skin become very smooth. I like smell too. (^O^)</li>
            <li> Been using it for the past few days, and my stubborn acne is starting to vanish. I&#x27;ve used all kinds of organic, high end creams and soaps, but this one actually works..natural ingreidients straight from Nigeria. And, it keeps my skin soft and moisturized as well.</li>
            <li> Right off the bat, I have to pose a question:  I&#x27;m confused; Is Dudu-Osun called &#x27;black&#x27; soap because it is blackish in color?  Or is this soap intended for people of AA skin-types?  I know my question is totally idiotic, but I thought it was because of the color of the bar until a lady at the hairdresser told me it was \\&quot;soap for black people\\&quot;.  I mean, it doesn&#x27;t matter to me - soap is soap, and this is GREAT soap.  It is great for my problematic skin (my Momma LIED when she told me, as a teen, that my acne would go away before I got wrinkles!), it is great for my dry skin (I LOVE LOVE LOVE to use those exfoliating gloves in the shower, and lather &#x27;em up good with my Dudu Osun, and scrub my legs... so invigorating), and I can not stop telling people about how it completely cleared my teenager&#x27;s dandruff after 1 use. (That&#x27;s where the topic of the Dudu Osun came up at the salon, because someone else was complaining about the rancid smell of the T-Gel, and I let them know that T-Gel didn&#x27;t ever help my kid, but the Dudu Osun took care of his dandruff in one shampooing.)  I LOVE THIS SOAP.  The only thing I would advise anyone who uses it, is that because it is such an all-natural product, make sure to not leave it anywhere in the shower where it gets the constant flow of the showerhead, because it will literally rinse-away over time.  That&#x27;s a testament to what a clean soap this stuff is - and how well it rinses from skin, too.</li>
            <li> I like that this is in bar form. Reading reviews about the blocks crumbling made me try this instead. Smell is a bit strong but it doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin. The best part is just knowing I&#x27;m not putting chemicals on my body. Still have to use lotion afterwards.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome and leaves skin feels refreshed, but not dry.  Keeps skin clear and moisturized and I think my skin tone has evened out since using this soap! Great for face but I use it everywhere!!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this soap for 12 years, nothing else touches my face.  It clears up every blemish and uneven tone within 24-48 hours. Leaves skin smooth and flawless.  Love it!</li>
            <li> I just took a shower and used this soap &amp; I felt like my skin was squeaky clean!! Never have I felt that my skin was so clean or felt so good! Thanks so much!</li>
            <li> After I passed the age of 60, I started having facial breakouts for reasons that escaped both me and my doctors. After abandoning the medical profession&#x27;s expensive prescription remedies, I started using a combination of sulfur soap with Dead Sea salts, vitamin B-5. And Tri-Derma skin repair creme. This was effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One day I discovered that my sulfur soap was gone, and I had a bad breakout on my scalp. I decided to give the Dudu-Osun soap a try. How and why this soap may be effective requires some explanation, and I apologize if this seems a bit like lecturing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dudu-Osun soap contains different forms of wood ash, which in turn has a high percentage of calcium carbonate (used in agricultural lime) and potash (used in lye). Lye is a common soap ingredient. Lime is not so commonly used. Both are alkaline (high pH level). As such they can be caustic and corrosive although in small quantities this can be controlled. Dudu-Osun soap contains things like palm oil and shea butter which should help to reduce the burning that caustic substances can cause.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does this mean for a soap meant to help with breakouts? Here is my own analysis, based on chemistry and personal experience:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Anti-bacterial action. Bacteria do not thrive well in alkaline environments. Dudu-Osun creates a highly alkaline environment which has a more highly disinfectant action than most soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Skin irritation. Caustic alkaline soaps have a very high potential for skin irritation. The more sensitive your skin, the worse this will be. This is the downside of Dudu-Osun&#x27;s disinfectant qualities. If left on the skin for even a minute, I can feel the burning for up to six hours later, and my skin sensitivity level is normal. If you use Dudu-Osun, wash it off immediately. Don&#x27;t let it get near your eyes or other more fragile tissue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Exfoliation. Exfoliants remove dead skin cells, which clears pores, allows hair follicles to grow, and generally promotes skin health. Chemical exfoliants are typically acidic (e.g., alpha hydroxy acid). Dudu-Osun is alkaline. It is not the best solution for skin exfoliation. With a good exfoliant, your skin will feel more refreshed. While your skin will feel clean with Dudu-Osun, you won&#x27;t have the refreshing quality that a good exfoliant produces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. General effectiveness. It took only a couple of days for me to resolve a scalp breakout with Dudu-Osun. But when I wasn&#x27;t careful about flushing with water, it hurt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. Alternatives. Sulfur soap with Dead Sea salts (such as what Jericho and Adovia offer) tends to be acidic when combined with water. Acid also has an anti-bacterial action as well as being good for exfoliation. The salts themselves have magnesium, which has anti-inflammatory and hydration qualities that people have found therapeutic for over 4,000 years. I rate these soaps as better than Dudu-Osun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. Value. What can I say? This product is a steal at its current pricing. If you&#x27;re careful about flushing with water and don&#x27;t mind getting a separate exfoliant, it should serve you well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope that some of this helps to clarify the sometimes conflicting comments from other reviewers.enerally promotes skin health.

            <li> Used it for two months. For couple of days it dried out my skin so I had to use oils right after to lock in the moisture. However, some bars may contain elements which could scratch you. I have three long scratch marks on my leg, which irritated me all day. Other than that, not bad just be careful.</li>
            <li> I love my soap! It helps with my dry eczema patches and I never feel itchy afterwards</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve using this for years on my face. It&#x27;s  just the thing for my oily t-zone.</li>
            <li> This was a true blessing finding out about this amazing soap. My skin has improved so much that I am sure by the middle of next year I will look 18 again!! This stuff shows that nature truly is the best way to go when it comes to health and beauty!!</li>
            <li> This soap smells amazing. It doesn&#x27;t over dry my skin and it has helped my blemishes. Make sure you keep it away from water when you are not using it, because it will disintegrate quickly. I have already purchased again!</li>
            <li> Its okay, but it leaves a residue that I don&#x27;t care for.</li>
            <li> I bought this hoping it would help with my acne. After 3 days there are now small bumps all over my face and my skin is incredibly itchy! I am so disappointed especially since there were such great reviews! BEWARE!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best product I have ever purchased for my problematic skin, a great addition to my skincare routine It really has helped me clear up my face :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I love the fact that it is all natural, &amp; the best part is that buying 6 at a time is such a steal!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that this soap has a scent that is strong &amp; unique, &amp; might need some time to get use to. This soap is also very drying, so make sure you have an excellent moisturizer :)</li>
            <li> Great smelling and great cleaning capabilities. Be warned it stings in some regions if left on for too long. And don&#x27;t get it in your eyes.</li>
            <li> this soap is amazing..i consider it a miracle soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i had gotten a large tattoo on my arm back in March and started to develop red bumps alllllll over my tattoo (before you say allergic to the ink, this is my 4th tattoo and it is not an allergy).  i went to the dermatologist where i had the doctors stumped..after about $200 in medicine and co pays and 2 biopsys to see what it is, the bumps did not go away and the biopsys came back as perfect nothing wrong with them.  a nurse friend of mine told me to try this black soap because her co worker who has psoriasis and the soap help get rid of them.  it was worth a shot and wow, after a week of using this soap on my arm, the bumps started to slowly go away..then eventually...GONE..i continue to use this soap incase they were to come back and also because i have very oily skin and this helps dry it out.</li>
            <li> I first found this soap at an outside market in Washington D.C. I had heard of &amp;#34;black soap&amp;#34; while in Florida and had tried it, but was a little pricey.  Then I found the Dudu Osun, tried it and now I have my family and some friends hooked on it! Lather it really good and soap up your face, leave on for a few minutes (while you wash your hair..) then rinse at the same time and it is a wonderful blemish treatment! Buy it by the 6-pack now. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this soap.  It has a nice gentle scent, and lathers generously.  I even use it to wash my hair.  Looking to get more.</li>
            <li> I am so glad I was introduced to this soap.  My daughter csn use this without her sensitive skin getting irritated.  I dig the smell.</li>
            <li> Good soap，I will buy again。</li>
            <li> I normally buy the raw black soap but I decided to try something new. I like that it actually looks like soap when someone sees it in my bathtub... the raw one looks like poop! But Im definately going back to raw because I feel like it cleans soooo much better!</li>
            <li> I like the lather and scrubbing that this soap produces.  Its scent is overwhelming though, and permeates anywhere it is present.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap after seeing it on a blog and reading though reviews. The package arrived on time and was exactly as pictured. I was really excited to try this soap out, after i used it i came to the conclusion that I LOVE this soap. It leaves my skin feeling fresh and clean without feeling dried out.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will ever switch soaps again! Next time I am going to order the larger variety of this- the &amp;#34;5 lb block&amp;#34; from another seller. Buying in bulk will help save a little money, i just hope it is as good of quality.</li>
            <li> This soap is made in Africa and is all natural.  It will not dry out your skin and has a pleasant scent.  Amazon offers a good savings as some stores are selling at up to $5 a bar.</li>
            <li> I find this is a good quality soap that doesn&#x27;t dry out  my skin. I enjoy the aroma it leaves in my bathroom as well.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily skin and experience hormonal breakouts quite often. My usual face cleansing routine included washing with Aveeno Clear Complexion soap or Basis Sensitive Skin Bar soap followed by Retin-A micro...which kept my skin somewhat clear but still oily. I purchased a six-pack of the Dodu-Osun soap and after two weeks of daily (morning and night) use, I can attest to all of the great reviews. The soap smells great, develops into a rich lather, is extremely long-lasting, and has worked wonders on my skin. Not only have I not experienced a single breakout while using this soap, my face is softer and noticeably less oily, and I find myself needing to powder my nose less frequently throughout the day. I am also able to use it as a makeup remover, which is an added benefit. If you suffer from skin problems, do not hesitate to purchase this soap!</li>
            <li> Love this all-purpose soap.  Works well for facial use as well as general cleansing.  Easy to cut into smaller pieces for travel.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m perplexed at the reviews mentioning race. Is it because the soap is black or because it&#x27;s made in Nigeria?  I don&#x27;t get it.  Should black people say they are black when they review Ivory Soap and white people say they are white when they review Dudu Osun?  Is white soap for white people and black soap for black people?  I just don&#x27;t get it.  It all seems very silly to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway,  I&#x27;m here to talk about soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is great soap.  I love it.  I bought it for myself.  My wife and daughter grabbed it off the soap dish and started using it too.  They love it.  My first six bars are almost all gone. Now I have to order more.  You won&#x27;t regret ordering it.  I think you will like this soap even if your skin is purple with orange polka dots.</li>
            <li> I really like this soap! It&#x27;s my first time purchasing and I&#x27;m not disappointed! It cleanses and moisturizes</li>
            <li> I have bought this soap  before and loved it. However, they have added a fragrance to it and now it is not the same. I am sorry I bought a six pack because I have not even used half of one bar and I will not use the rest.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin on my hands but not so much on the rest of my body. Using this doo- doo irritated and caused a burning sensation on parts of my body that I have not experienced from even the most artificially chemical laden garbage on most grocery store shelves. So glad I only bought one bar.</li>
            <li> I love the scent of this soap. I also love how my skin is not overly stripped of oils and feels quite natural after I use some avocado oil as moisturizer. My skin is extremely sensitive so finding soap that does not make me itch is quite rare. I recommend this soap to everyone.</li>
            <li> You have to remember to keep it out of standing water becasue it will melt.  Other than that it has a great scent that lasts all day and my skin seems softer.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome.  It helps your skin but can dry skin if you use it every day.  (if you have acne it will dry your acne, which my friends loved). It smells so good! I gave a bar to my friends to try &amp; they loved it too!</li>
            <li> This soap is heavenly. I have been using this for years, and I&#x27;m still satisfied. Using similar black soaps doesn&#x27;t do the job, this product leaves my face feeling cleansed and oil free. I&#x27;ve never bought soap in bulk, but I saved so much money by doing so.</li>
            <li> Beautiful and gorgeous</li>
            <li> I have use this for a while as my regular shower soap. Leaves your skin clean, fresh, works very well on eczema and rashes.</li>
            <li> Healthy soap, I&#x27;ve been repurchasing this soap since I started switching to more natural ingredient soaps, the down side is that the bar doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> LOVE this soap, all natural and smells great&lt;br /&gt;I use this daily on my face because my skin is very oily and prone to acne, and this soap helps with that nicely.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: you must be careful to keep soap bar dry after using, since it gets mushy and melts if you leave it wet, and it also will dry your skin out too much if you over-use it. So I recommend drying the bar off after using, and putting on body-lotion after washing with it.</li>
            <li> I so badly wanted to love this soap because I heard wonderful things about it.  However, it really dried out my skin and caused some redness.  I even began using it once every other day and it burned like crazy.</li>
            <li> Love it! I like the way it cleans my skin and takes off all of the impurities. I highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Love this product.  Good for shower, face, and hair.</li>
            <li> As bad as the sound of its name or the ragged look of it. This soap does its job as advertised. Did i mention exceptionally well?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: the smell could get too strong on my skin but soon faded 15 mins after shower. The suds is brownish thus require an extra step to rinse your shower to rid of the brown color splashed on the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: price is good, i can live with it but hoping it could go down more so i could gift this more widely among relatives and friends. the soap cleans my skin very well w/o leaving it dry or irritatedly cracked, it left my face clean and tight (just watch out for prolonging skin contact. I tested leaving it on my face for 60 seconds vs 15 secs of massage on my face and I can feel the slight burning). After thoroughly cleansing out my face, the irritation stopped, and it never left my skin dry to crack (Amazing!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About other&#x27;s claim to remove impurities from your skin, I can&#x27;t judge on that until further proven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for now, I think this soap deserve a solid 5 stars and a try from anyone who haven&#x27;t already. It does its job well on your whole body and this soap will be on my toiletry list for quite a while.</li>
            <li> Very good soap. Originally purchased this item at a festival and liked it very much then turned to Amazon.com to replenish. Great price for the item.</li>
            <li> I have combination skin that has some leftover spots from old pimples. Those were easily covered up by makeup, but I&#x27;m getting kinda sick of wearing makeup and having those marks in general.I&#x27;m around Gabrielle Union&#x27;s shade and decided to purchase this because I found out the Ambi black soap I was using wasn&#x27;t real.Real black soap will not &amp;#34;bleed&amp;#34; a black dye into your water. That seems like common sense, but I had never heard of African Black Soap or properly researched it prior. I bought this back in December I believe, and it&#x27;s truly a godsend. I had something strange happen to my skin and was rather embarrassed, too embarrassed to go see a dermatologist. I believe they were melasma patches(thanks to birth control pills) that were dark gray and almost black patches along the sides of my mouth. My Bare Minerals foundation just barely covered it. It was really depressing. After my first use, I was amazed! My patches looked so much lighter! They were still there of course, but even my mother was surprised by the instant difference. The soap smells amazing and has a very earthy scent. It lathers up really nicely, too. I always wet my hands and lathered the soap in my hands, and then I massage it on my face for a bit before rinsing it off with warm water. One bar will last you a very long time! It dissolves in water, which means you can create your own liquid black soap if you choose to do it. It removes all of my makeup, which is nice because my skin feels very freshly washed. This soap is incredibly drying though. I strongly recommend using a moisturizer in order to combat dryness. My skin took a week or so to adjust to the strength of the soap. I had a very weak moisturizer initially and noticed that it wasn&#x27;t strong hydrating my skin. Bottom line: no matter what skin type you have! As months continued, I noticed that my skin was becoming less dull looking. I believe it&#x27;s the combination of the soap and the use of an exfoliating pad I bought. This soap isan amazing exfoliant and will make your skin glow. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day and my skin has been thanking me dearly. My skin feels smoother,it glows after each cleansing, it doesn&#x27;t feel itchy,there were no breakouts,etc. I&#x27;m definitely going to start buying it in larger quantities. I&#x27;ve started using it on my body as well; any form of dryness can be easily fixed. Sometimes I use a blend of coconut oil and shea butter on my body to make me feel silky smooth. Vaseline will do the trick as well. Once again, always moisturize your skin! As for the leftover marks from pimples- They weren&#x27;t as easy to remove but have become significantly lighter.Around that time of the month,I still have a few spots pop up but this soap makes them dry up and virtually erase them.I&#x27;m really impressed since more commercial cleansers never really stopped my bumps from appearing.Thanks to this soap, I&#x27;ve become more comfortable walking around without makeup. I strongly recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> I did not care of this soap. It&#x27;s messy and did not seem to deliver any kind of special cleansing/moisturizng benefits for me.</li>
            <li> [...]  check out this website they have a way better product line of black soap...it was really dry didn&#x27;t lather very well I used it for about one week and then everything went down hill my skin was really itchy and red</li>
            <li> I have been hearing about black soap to help with skin problems, so I finally purchased some for my son and it is doing wonders to clear his face. He also has warts on his hand that we have paid to have removed (but came back) and was preparing to go to another doctor to try it again....no need. The warts have begun to shrink.</li>
            <li> My husband and I are Caucasian, and we both have occasional facial break outs.  My skin is very sensitive  and reacts immediately to most facial products.  Three years ago while on vacation and browsing in a store in that carried African products, we discovered Dudu-Osun Black soap.  From the moment that we started using this soap,  we have been thrilled with the results.  This is the only soap that we use on our faces and our bodies.  I am constantly receiving compliments on my skin.     I have always ordered online and I learned one very important lesson after my first order.... ask the vendor for the expiration date printed on the boxes.  This is a natural product and my first order, which was non-refundable, was almost outdated when I received it.  Now, that is the first thing that I ask the vendor.     I have never ordered from this vendor, so my recommendation is only for the soap itself.  However, I did email them 4 days ago requesting information and I haven&#x27;t heard back from them, so I today I ordered through another vendor, at a much much cheaper  price.</li>
            <li> I ordered this on January 8th and my estimated delivery was from the 14th to the 17th. It&#x27;s already the 21st - no product to be seen. The USPS tracking is useless too - it just says they received the package on the 10th. Come on! 11 days?! REALLY?!</li>
            <li> This soap is expensive and I saw no better performance on my manly skin compared to Dove or Old Spice. If you are a girly man and enjoy doo-doo brown organic soap from the tropical regions, then by all means buy this for your wife.  IMO you are paying a lot for soap that looks like a turd in your bathtub. I did not see results that justified the price point on this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It performed as soap, so I will give it 3/5 stars because 1/5 would just be rude. Additionally, I enjoyed laughing at the name Dudu because it litterly looks like you are scrubbing yourself with a oddly shaped turd.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and buy your wife some jewelry or buy yourself a nice 1911 instead.  Be a man (insert bald eagle screech).</li>
            <li> Highly recommended if you have bad acne or dark spots on your face!  I use it on my whole body. Amazing soap! Fast delivery!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a fair-skinned blonde with extremely sensitive skin.  I&#x27;ve struggled with breakouts and blemishes well into my adulthood.  Nothing seemed to work until I tried this soap.  Within days the texture of my skin seemed to change.  It felt less oily and so much more clean.  The little red bumps I used to get stopped appearing completely.  My skin became smooth and appeared so much more even-toned.  I actually get compliments on my skin now.  I started using it all over my body, and it cleared up the small red bumps I got on my shoulders and back.  It is a little bit drying, but I think that is what does the trick to keep the breakouts at bay.  It may make your skin feel just a bit tight right after using it, but I don&#x27;t mind.  It doesn&#x27;t overdry and it just makes my skin feel so clean.  If it bothers you then slap some moisturizer on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bar will last a long time.  I&#x27;ve been using the same bar for a month -- they&#x27;re HUGE.  And worth their weight in gold, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Great for back acne, but you must give it time to work. Great lather with very little effort and I think it smells really good.</li>
            <li> I love this soap. It dries my skin a little but that&#x27;s probably because of the exfoliating process. My skin loves this soap and so do I.</li>
            <li> I was finally able to get rid of a stubborn black head I had for years... yes years. I rubbed it on and left it for a minute or two and the first time i did most of the blackhead came out. I was amazed. Leaves my skin feeling really clean. That&#x27;s about it. Did not help with blemishes or acne for me.</li>
            <li> The soap turns everything in contact with black (body, shower, towels).  I can find any use for it.</li>
            <li> wouldnt wash my body with any other soap...</li>
            <li> I have purchased this soap a few times. I love it! I always leave the shower feeling very clean. Be careful washing any sensitive areas at first. Let your body get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap comes exactly as pictured in 6 separate boxes bound together by plastic wrap.</li>
            <li> It looks a bit funny, smells divine, cleans well and moisturizes your body so there is no need of additional moisturizes. One drawback is the is disintegrates rapidly if not kept dry in a soap box. It is a little messy, but well worth the trouble. I won&#x27;t use any other soap again (even those very expensive French soaps).</li>
            <li> I really love this product.  I have eczema and get frequent flare-ups.  This soap keeps it on check and keeps my skin soft.  I use it on my face but use caution around your eye area.  This soap is great!</li>
            <li> Great African black soap! I even use it to clean my hair, but only if I have a lot of product build-up as it can make you hair feel too clean. I always follow-up with a conditioner if I use this on my hair.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this soap. Bought it on a whim after reading about African black soap, and I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this brand. Seems to strike a good balance between being all natural, but not so much that you find pieces of bark in the soap, which I read can happen in some other brands. I&#x27;ve had several houseguests comment on the soap with mixed reviews. Some love the fragrance (which I think is the best part of the product), while others are put off by the mud-like residue it leaves on tile. The residue never bothered me, and this is now the only bar soap I&#x27;ll ever purchase. Some reviewers also complain about sensitivity to the soap. I experienced this at first when I made the mistake of leaving it on my face too long. Just wash it off quickly if you&#x27;re going to wash your face with it and you shouldn&#x27;t have any issues.</li>
            <li> Although drying, I like that it takes the deodorant off much more quickly than regular soap.</li>
            <li> I have ordered this three times thus far. I think the formula was tweaked a bit, as the issues I had with the first batch (strong smell when using, irritation where the skin is sensitive) are no longer present in the current batch. It is amazing at clearing up acne. I used to get acne flare-ups anytime the season changed, but I have yet to get a one since I started using this soap (January). I took one star off, as it does nothing for my dark marks.</li>
            <li> I get pretty bad acne and it helps fight it off pretty well!</li>
            <li> The dudu osun soaps shipping time was expeditious, and the product itself far exceeds my expectations. The scent is a bit strong, but not overpowering, and I have not had any adverse reactions even with my sensitive skin. Make sure to apply lotion after use to avoid issues with product drying skin out.</li>
            <li> I love this soap.  I use it every morning and night to wash my face, then i use a green tea exfoliator to gently scrub my face. then I apply my moisturizer. this has made my face soooooo much smoother and I am very happy that it has only a few ingredients in it. Other &amp;#34;organic&amp;#34; soaps are not even close to this product. Its something my parents used and I love it. Dudu is the best on the market as far as pure black soaps go.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other black soaps and they seem to help my daughters eczema better than this one. It didn&#x27;t hurt anything but I didn&#x27;t notice any improvement after using it.</li>
            <li> My loves Dudu-Osun soap for use on our entire body. I have purchased it several times and will continue to purchase it in 12 counts. It doesn&#x27;t aggrevate my husband&#x27;s eczema like other soaps. Thanks for the product.</li>
            <li> It will clean really well but dried my skin out alittle! A good lotion will cure this issue. So will some shea butter! I will order again!</li>
            <li> Great purchase! I would highly recommend this product to anyone. Makes your face feel tight, soft, and refreshingly clean. Love it!</li>
            <li> I have been buying this soap for my household for a couple of years now.  It lasts long, has a wonderful scent, and is very mild yet cleans thoroughly.  All ages in our house, including teens, use it happily.  I have more mature skin and it does not dry it out at all.  The price is extremely reasonable, too.  The  only thing I do not like is the way the residue from the black soap shows up on our white porcelain bathroom sinks, but it is nonetheless well worth buying.</li>
            <li> Love black soap. Love this black soap. Doesn&#x27;t stain. Great lather. I use it on my face and body and my skin has never felt cleaner. I would always follow up with a toner for you face though,especially if you use this everyday like I do. Can be drying.</li>
            <li> We love &amp;#34;our&amp;#34; black soap!  My &amp;#34;twin sister&amp;#34; turned us (husband and self) onto your soap when she dropped off a bar and said &amp;#34;try this.&amp;#34;  Well, it is the ONLY bar soap we buy now!  We said &amp;#34;Try this&amp;#34; when we shared a bar with our grown son and now it&#x27;s his only soap.  To make it even less believable... Our son said &amp;#34;Try this&amp;#34; when our nephew was visiting him overnight.  Well, you drew the right conclusion... It&#x27;s his new soap as well.  We are hosting a small Valentine&#x27;s party and have already started to built the gift baskets and of course...it includes your soap.</li>
            <li> Love this soap and how it makes my skin feel, good for the face as well, doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out and smells great. The only down side would be the brown lather or residue it leaves behind in the shower or on the soap dish, it doesn&#x27;t stain or anything but it doesn&#x27;t look pleasant either.</li>
            <li> This soap has done wonders for my skin. I&#x27;ve been suffering from Bacne for a good portion of my life (i&#x27;m 25) and this has pretty much cleared it all up and helped with my scaring. I cannot recommend this enough. Seriously.</li>
            <li> I love this soap, it&#x27;s great for the skin.  If you have any skin conditions like eczema or psoriasis it works to help heal it.  Leaves skin with a nice glow, has a mild scent that&#x27;s not overwhelming, only thing I don&#x27;t like is the fact that the soap stains my light colored wash cloths but I can live that verses the benefits</li>
            <li> I absolutely love the smell of this soap; and, I actually like how clean it makes me feel.  However, it leaves my skin horribly dry. Otherwise, it is a good buy.  Just beware that you&#x27;ll need a very good body moisturizer after using it.</li>
            <li> Dudu-Osun black soap is awesome.  Dry skin is quenched quickly when using this soap on a consistent basis.  Thank you, Dud-Osun for a fantastic product.</li>
            <li> Have some breakouts and this clears them up.  It&#x27;s strong when you first use it - you won&#x27;t want to leave it on your skin for long but it&#x27;s fine after a few uses.  You&#x27;re squeaky clean and You have to moisturize after.  It smells really good to me, fresh and lime(y).  I wouldn&#x27;t use it if you&#x27;re very sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I have bad acne but this really helps! It does dry out your skin so I would suggest using a moisturizer. This is one of my favorite beauty products!</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this soap by my sister because her husband was using it for his bacne problem, to which it helped to greatly reduce the instances of breakouts.  I love it for three reasons:  it smells great; it cleans better than any other body soaps without too much drying or leaving a film; and it has cut down/control my facial acne.  I would recommend that first time users try it out on their hands before using it anywhere else on their body lest they have a reaction to any of the ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real downside is that it does leave an unsightly and somewhat suspicious looking brown trail wherever you place it, but even then it doesn&#x27;t stain.</li>
            <li> I started using this product primarily on my face for acne and the scars they leave. This soap leaves your skin soft and because I have very oily skin, I do not use any moisturizer after and this soap and my skin is never dry. Since using this soap my scars have slowly faded but it does take months. i have also notice no new acne popping up which is a plus. About a month ago I started using this soap on my entire body and love the way my skin feels although it does leave a mess in the shower. I would have given it 5 stars but the smell is not the best. Overall I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for a few Years now.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best soap I ever used. Even as an adult my skin always had problems with breakouts, not anymore. You experience may vary, not cheap soap but worth it imo.</li>
            <li> In the shower this soap dried my skin OUT! It was horrible I was so terrified I had that tight filmy residue feeling to my skin. Once I got out of the shower and dried off after about 2 minutes that feeling went away. It was before I added lotion, my skin was no longer tight or had that residue feeling. It felt good but I will not repurchse. I do not want my skin to feel like that ever. Not even for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Its a great soap it makes my skin feel very soft and smoothe. This is my 2nd order for this soap and my husband is NIGERIAN and he to use this soap back home so it works for us. Tasha</li>
            <li> I immediately loved the natural smell when I opened the box. I used it right away and it lathers up VERY quickly.  My skin felt, moisturized, soft and clean. Immediately put on your moisturizer for the best effect. I also used it on my face which had a fresh look to it after washing. Great value, will definitely purchase again.</li>
            <li> I have been using this everyday for about 4 years now and I love it! Its natural and my skin feels so clean afterwords. It also helps reduce acne! I would recommend this to anyone from oily to dry skin types.</li>
            <li> Dudu Osun is quickly my personal favorite Black Soap to use because the skin conditions people have like Psoriasis, Eczema, and others could benefit from an easy to use soap like this that is already shaped for you to use. It bleeds of nutrients for your body/skin, reason I continue to re-buy it, and I like to change my buying habits up too! RAW African Black Soap is perfect too, BUT when you buy it, you have to cut it to however much you wanna use, Dudu is convenient and you can use right out the box!</li>
            <li> My whole family uses Dudu-Osaun Black Soap. I had dinner at my sister&#x27;s on New Years Day and she kept complimenting my complexion. I recommended the black soap to her. Follow up with Raw Shea Butter and you have the perfect remedy for problem skin!</li>
            <li> love this on my skin - it is rich and soft. really glad i got it and will likely use it from here on.</li>
            <li> The soap smells like the washing powder when I open the soap box. It works like the washing powder too, very slippery when touching water, as same as when you washing your clothes by hand without rubber gloves on, and I feel it burns on my skin and peel.</li>
            <li> I have tried this soap before in the past and love the results.  If you are suffering from body acne or dark spots, this soap is what you need.  I decided to order this soap from this seller because of the price.  The seller was very informative.  They informed me when product will be ship and when I will receive my product.  The seller has good customer service which is very important in business.</li>
            <li> I started using this because my skin is super sensitive and had become rough, dry, and uneven in appearance. I used it on my face and it completely changed everything. My skins soft and its appearance has greatly improved. I don&#x27;t even wear makeup anymore because It&#x27;s helped so much. I use it all over my body, I love this :D Buy it it&#x27;s so worth trying&lt;br /&gt;-Real person review :)</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I am not a person that goes crazy over things labeled as natural or organic. I have used regular soaps all my life and tried dozens of different types. This soap smells amazing, makes you feel clean, and helped illuminate most of my dry skin. I had tried many soaps that are designed to put moisture into you skin like dove, which leaves a oily feeling, and the black soap works much better.</li>
            <li> I rarely, I mean rarely leave reviews for products. This stuff is a miracle. I have PCOS which means I pretty much always have skin issues. I also have a lot of scars from having severe acne when I was in my teens. I&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun, along with multiple products from my dermatologist and endocrinologist (for pcos) and nothing has ever worked. I&#x27;ve only been using this for 2 weeks and the difference is huge!! All of my pimples were gone within two days and I can already see a significant difference in my scars. A few more weeks and I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;ll be completely gone. I literally cried tears of joys after having used this for a few days. My skin has always been my biggest insecurity and it feels so good to have finally found something that actually works!! I have been using this along with Jojoba oil to remove makeup, and this is the clearest my skin has been since I was a kid. If you have acne and feel like you&#x27;ve tried everything out there, then this is the product for you!! You won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
            <li> I use to break out all the time, then I found this soap and I started using it when I lived in California, this soap works great and Ive used it since 2004, going on 10 or so years! A warning: This soap can cause embarrassing moments when you visit other peoples houses and use their showers, because it is a charcoal soap it leaves brown/black stuff in the shower and when you forget to clean it out, people are like....what in the world is that in the shower! And so I just give them an awkward look and leave it up to their imagination! hahahahaha! Enjoy people! God Bless!</li>
            <li> This product works perfect with my skin tone! Only soap besides Dove I find that works great on women on ethnic races!</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap because of all the amazing reviews.  I&#x27;m all about using products with natural ingredients.  I have been using this soap on my face AND body for the past few days.  I can already tell a difference with my face.  I have a lot of hyperpigmentation from adult acne (possibly due to hormones) and they are fading away.  I am Asian, so whenever I have acne, it ALWAYS leaves an unattractive dark spot - so irritating!  I&#x27;m so glad I found this soap!  The smell is nice, different and noticeable, but not too overwhelming.  I much rather use this than to use hydroquinone which is bad for your liver after period of use.</li>
            <li> I love African black soap and this soap works well.  However, I would prefer a FRAGRANCE FREE VERSION.  Many of us with sensitive skin have no use for added fragrances in soaps.  This is why I&#x27;ll buy another brand until this one comes fragrance-free.</li>
            <li> When I bought this product, I was trying to find something to clear up the dry rash that has been on my face for months. I think the rash is eczma. I have been using this soap for about three weeks and WOW what a difference it had made. My skin is clear and glows. I pair it with virgin Argan oil and my skin looks and feels amazing. I love it and will continue to use it!  I have been using this soap since the beginning of July and have nothing but amazing things to say for my skin! my skin is radiant and feels so soft and silky... I get compliments all the time. I will be using this soap for a long time!</li>
            <li> I have used this soap occasionally and really like it.  As a 44 year old female I find it can be a bit drying so I do not use it daily but when hormones get the better of my face and I start to break out.  I have given this soap to my 21 year old niece who suffers from facial and back acne and she called me a week later to say it is &#x27;amazing&#x27;.  My 15 year old daughter who breaks out occasionally on her face and her back is now starting to use it.  I&#x27;m curious to see her review.</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for about three weeks. I love this soap. I have oily and adult acne and it has done a great job. It has lightened up the dark scarring and made my skin very soft. I am not as oily and i love the smell of the soap.</li>
            <li> I will have to order more soon because I love these soo much. I use it all over and it helps to keep my skin from breaking out terribly. Any bumps that I do get dry up quickly and dont leave a very dark mark.</li>
            <li> Absolutely a fantastic soap!  It was highly recommended to me, and I have not used &amp;#34;bar soap&amp;#34; in years,&lt;br /&gt;as my skin is sensitive, and I gave it a try and it is fabulous!  Lathers up so you feel really clean but there&lt;br /&gt;was absolutely NO &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; soap tightened feeling after rinsing!  I make my own anti aging serum which I put on&lt;br /&gt;directly after this, and it is a win-win combination, totally!  Love this black soap.</li>
            <li> I have purchased 2 6 packs already. it has permanently replaced my facial cleanser, and i have tried soo many products out there. This is the best soap for oily blemish prone skin</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have used!it make u feel so clean,clears up skin,and smells good!!!I order 6!and I will be using and ordering this soap for good now!!!I&#x27;m so happy my skin looks so healthy and glows.I can&#x27;t believe it,it also make ur hair feel.so silky,that I Dnt have to use conditioner anymore my hair is soft as a baby bottom!!!!I love this soap,its worth the money and shipment price!!!!!</li>
            <li> I use Dudu Osun Black Soap as a bath soap. It has lovely natural ingredients, cleanses my skin without stripping all of its moisture and smells of limes and citrus fruits. I buy Dudu Osun Black Soap from African grocery stores for $2-$2.50 per bar. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years and look forward to using it for many years to come.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: Honey, Shea Butter, Osun (Camwood), Palm Kernel Oil, Cocoa Pod Ash, Palm Bunch Ash, Aloe Vera, Lime Juice, Water</li>
            <li> My friend told me about product  I love the smell it feel great after you get out the shower give it a try</li>
            <li> This is probably going to be  my most in depth review, when i first saw this product I  checked out the reviews and the bad ones were a bit worrisome. I saw some where people thought that the good reviews were actually fake reviews,  and that really worried me.....but I wanted to see for myself. Im on my second bar and at first I only used it on my back (because of acne) now I use it just about everywhere except my very sensitive areas. I use it on my face at night as well.....so far I love this soap and I think it spells pretty good.</li>
            <li> High quality soap - not only for Africans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  Smells good, doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin too bad either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  Makes your soap tray look like someone took a %#!@ in it.</li>
            <li> I purchased this item for a stocking stuffer. It came in earlier than I expected, which is great! Will definately order again.</li>
            <li> I love natural and affordable and this product hits both out of the ballpark. I wash my face and body with this product because it&#x27;s both gentle and effective. A great alternative to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s. The only downside is that the soap tends to crumble and doesn&#x27;t hold a clean, compact shape like big-brand soaps. Given the crumbling structure and the brown-black shade, it can sometimes look like someone took a dump in the soap dish.</li>
            <li> This was my first time buying black soap.  The smell is pleasent and not too strong, my pet peeve with this soap is that it dirties the tub easily because of the dark tint.</li>
            <li> fantastic. I&#x27;ve been using this for a year on my face and body.</li>
            <li> Love this soap, whole family uses this and every family member likes this soap very much.  We will keep ordering!</li>
            <li> My entire family uses this soap with great results. My daughter has eczema and very sensitive skin. I use it for her skin and hair and she have very little itching and redness. After her bath I follow up with my homemade Shea butter cream or I&#x27;ll use Babyganics lotion. That works great for us. I use it for my skin and hair too with great results. It helps with any blemishes I might get and my skin seems brighter and healthier. My husband has oily skin and prone to breakouts and it has worked better than anything at the store for his skin. I think it&#x27;s a great value too because my entire family uses one soap for washing and shampoo. Two less things to buy at the store! Plus six bars lasts us about 3 to 3.5 months. Just be sure you place it in a dry soap dish after using it because it will dissolve a lot faster.</li>
            <li> I have been looking around for a great soap for quite a few years now. I slowly drifted from the commercial American junk to more natural products. Ultimately, what I ended up on after a while was Aleppo soap; the one from Syria made from olive oil and laurel leaf. I was very satisfied with that soap. But then, the Syrian civil war began, and supply was slowly cut off, or became to expensive. So, I eventually came down to Dudu-Osun. Immediately upon using i, I thought it was great. It really did make my skin appear smoother. After a couple of weeks my skin became more even toned and full looking. Take it from someone who has explored the world of soap, this one is the best.</li>
            <li> This soap looks so strange, but you will be so glad if you try it!  I have tried other black soaps, and none have the quality of this brand.  I stopped using it for a while because someone gave me something else that they loved, but now that I am back to this soap I can&#x27;t believe I ever went away.  The lather is great, you feel super clean, but it washes off easily with no residue.  You almost feel like you don&#x27;t have to put lotion on after - and I am 57 years old!  It quickly lessened any dark spots on my face and hands also.  That seems almost unbelievable, but when I stopped using it for awhile and then resumed I could tell the difference right away in how my skin looked.  Try it!  You will never go back . . . or if you do, like me, you will be sorry you did!</li>
            <li> A lot of the reviews scared me because of the complaints of the smell but it&#x27;s honestly not that bad. IT CLEANS! It doesn&#x27;t matter how much makeup I put on it always comes off, I just love that. It lathers very nicely, I use it for for my face &amp; no reaction whatsoever. Only thing is, I used it in the shower but don&#x27;t do it! It causes a burning uncomfortable sensation in private areas lol</li>
            <li> Love this Black soap..Quality and lasts for about a month with regular use..Be mindful not to leave the bar sitting in water or it will not last long at all..Keep it in a dry soap dish..I tried liquid black soap but nothing compared to my bar.  I will be using this Black soap for life..</li>
            <li> Great soap!&amp;#34;I love the natural ingredients, which gives a fabulously bathing experience. Would love to see something put out for babies...</li>
            <li> best soap i ever bought. it does what is says, i&#x27;ve gotten compliments on my skin. theres a natural glow that i get and i love the smell.&lt;br /&gt;i originally got for my teenage sons eczema but the whole family is using it now. will be ordering the 12 bars very soon lol down to 1 bar.&lt;br /&gt;wish i found out about this years ago eczema really scars the skin so far the breakouts are not severe and the itching is not as bad either. i use this with the ivory shea butter which i have also ordered fromm amazon and curel anti inch lotion. these will forever be our everyday staples for healthy skin care. for those eczema sufferers a hint of advice stay&lt;br /&gt;away from hot bath or showers, trying using cool or luke warm water it makes a difference try and see and no soaking in the tub, moisturize, moisturize,  and then moisturize some more. keep it simple and you will def see results</li>
            <li> Love this soap! I previously used Clinique 3 step system. I still use the moisturizer. After having used Clinique for 3 years and consistent break outs of fine bumps on my cheeks I decided to try other products. After several other options Bingo! This soap along with a tea tree oil toner (cococare) and Clinique moisturizer I&#x27;ve finally found the right combination. My fine bumps are gone and my skin looks bright, Dewey, moist, smooth and healthy.  I periodically use this soap on my body too. Also I&#x27;ve tried several other black soaps which have dried out my xtra oily African American skin. I don&#x27;t find this soap to be drying at all. It&#x27;s a great complexion soap. I would definitely recommend and will for sure continue to use. And it&#x27;s so much more affordable and more effective than Clinique.</li>
            <li> Fragrance too powerful pungent.&lt;br /&gt;Not like natural fragrance but similar to the chemical essence.&lt;br /&gt;i felt headache and Chest tightness when breathing the fragrance.</li>
            <li> Love the natural ingredients. LOVE the rich lather it makes, along with my &amp;#34;Cure Series Japanese Exfoliating Bath Towel.&amp;#34;  Best showers ever. No funky smell, has a nice clean scent. Will definitely buy again when I run out!</li>
            <li> Great soap, I love it.</li>
            <li> Great overall soap. Long lasting, will purchase again.</li>
            <li> This product broke my face out. A big disappointment...</li>
            <li> One of the best soap I ever use</li>
            <li> This is the best soap I have ever used.  It smells great and is price right.  I highly recommend this soap for sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a \\&quot;review writer\\&quot; in any sense of the word, but I had to say something about this soap. WOWZERS. I didn&#x27;t purchase it through Amazon sadly, but I did through my local beauty supply store. It is AMAZING! It managed to do what weeks of Hydroquinone hasn&#x27;t done and my hyperpigmentation seems to be less noticeable after the first use. If you have sensitive skin, this might not be the product for you because it has made my skin itch slightly, but after two coats of Dial 7 Day moisturizing lotion, the itch has faded. I will most likely try this for about a month and see how it goes, but I&#x27;m loving the results so far!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried raw black soap before, and I loved it.  However, I didn&#x27;t want to buy it in bulk again, so I decided to try this soap.  I have to say that I LOVE the way this soap smells!  It&#x27;s reminiscent of the smell of black soap (obviously) but fruity.  It&#x27;s a really nice smell.  I feel like I&#x27;m going on a tropical vacation whenever I use it.  I think I have found a replacement for the raw soap that I have to break down myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This soap is super gentle and moisturizing.  You will not be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Bought as a gift for my mother-in-law. She loved it!! She loves the smell and ONLY uses this soap now!! GREAT PRODUCT!!</li>
            <li> Smells good and has very natural ingredients which is a plus...I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in any clearing of my skin or evening the tone but it does make me my skin feel smooth.</li>
            <li> My husband posted a photo of this soap on the floor of our shower on Facebook, and I had a hard time convincing people it was soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, the soap is wonderful, but you don&#x27;t want to put this in your guest bathroom.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not generally a negative reviewer, but I really did not like this soap...&lt;br /&gt;Which is a bummer because I ordered a large package of it, and ended up throwing the rest away after using the first bar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are all-natural, and I admire that, but the smell is not so much awful (it isn&#x27;t pleasant) as it is potent; each time I walked into my bathroom, I could smell it sooooo strongly, and it never went away. It made ME smell like it, too, and not in a normal, soapy way. It was more like a strong musky smell that lingered. Ew.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my face, and that burned/tingled quite a bit. After a few tries, I came to the conclusion that it was just too harsh for my face, and used it on my body instead. The problem with this, is the mess. It got all over my bathtub and all over my shower curtain. With continued use, I had to wash my shower curtain every few days because this soap literally turned bottom of it brown!&lt;br /&gt;If you really want to use this soap, just know that when you use it, it will also turn your skin brown until you thoroughly wash it off... I found that pretty weird.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, there was no noted improvement in my skin, so the negatives were not worth suffering for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, I hated the smell and hated the actual usefulness of this product. I found a million reasons to use a different kind of soap in its stead. South of France bar soaps are really nice!</li>
            <li> I have eczema and on occasion cystic acne. Since using this soap I have had no problems at all! Definitely recommend this product.</li>
            <li> The smell is really sweet and good, I use it every day and it seems work well for people who usually get allergic</li>
            <li> the smell of this soap is out of this world! The soothing to the skin is just amazing and how clean it leaves the skin it&#x27;s just something I can&#x27;t describe. The black soap helped my friend&#x27;s boyfriend with his eczema. I have no skin problems but I love how my bathroom and skin smell after I shower. The only downside is that it leaves stains so make sure you spray your bathtub with water.</li>
            <li> I have been back and forth with different types of natural soaps. This one is my favorite. Has a tropical smell and works very well with a loufa. lathers up really well. Price is also reasonable and each bar lasts quite a long time. I am expecting a month&#x27;s use of each bar with 5-6 showers per day.</li>
            <li> Does an amazing job on problem skin, my son has cystic acne which can cause scarring, this soap is a blessing!  Some reviews state that is very drying to skin, I would say all depending on sensitivity.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
            <li> Me and my daughter use this. We are African American decent and she asked me one day, do you have makeup on, that was after I washed my face with the bar. The smell is clean fragrance and lathers really well. Keep the bar in container that will make it last longer. It did improve my dark spots.</li>
            <li> Love this soap.  I smells sooo good and leaves skin feeling great!</li>
            <li> like they say... once you go black.. you never go back.</li>
            <li> Feels so nice on the skin, after shower, leaving  a nice clean smell</li>
            <li> Great soap, in the desert environment,  my face as taken a beating along with daily shaving.  This soap helps keep face clean and refreshing.</li>
            <li> Love you using black soap and this is a really good at a fair price as it can be expensive to buy at a store.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product. It smells fresh and natural, but is not over powering. Even my boyfriend is obsessed with this soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s environment friendly- which does mean the bar doesn&#x27;t last as long as traditional soap does... But the quality of the product and the way it makes my skin feels is totally worth it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also buying in bulk makes it WAY more affordable. I&#x27;m sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using dudu for about 2 months, and I don&#x27;t think Id switch anytime soon.</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews here scared me but I am glad I bought it anyway.  This soap really cleans.  I use it every where, it&#x27;s not scary like some of the posting here, at least not for me, no burning, no skin cuts when applying it direct to the body.  I use it on my face at night to wash off my make up, it works great!  I went over my face with witch hazel on a cotton ball and there is no residues left, nothing, the cotton is still white!  Not any face soaps or make up remover can clean so well in one quick wash.  It doesn&#x27;t stains my showers or sponge, it does drip brown but rinse off quickly.  I gave some to my daughter and she said it actually cleaned her stained sponge from the left over make up.  I gave my brother some and he&#x27;s using it as shampoo and body wash, he said it really cleans!  Besides the cleaning power, there is no other benefits like some of the reviews posted that it helps with eczema and lighten the skin.  I have eczema on my legs and back, it doesn&#x27;t make it worse but it didn&#x27;t help either.  The smells is really mild and fresh.  I have been using this for over 4 months and will continues.</li>
            <li> This soap pulls all impurities out of skin and leaves your skin very soft. I love it!!!!! I do not even purchase any other soap now. I had bad skin as far as scars from insect bites as a child. I can actually see the lighting up after 4 months of use. I am not ashame anymore to wear my bare legs. With anything you must stay on it.</li>
            <li> This soap was suggested to me by a friend. I tried it and like it. I can&#x27;t say that it does anything special...Can be drying in Winter.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t see amy improment</li>
            <li> Love the feel and smell of this soap.  Natural and not too pungent.  Feel very fresh using it.  Lasts fairly long - lathers well but doesn&#x27;t dissolve too quickly.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing! However, the only downfall is the fact that it&#x27;s terribly drying. Make sure to use a moisturizer!! I use this soap 1-2 times a week on my face. It cleared most of my breakouts.. I no longer have huge clusters of acne. I&#x27;m sure if I used it more often, I&#x27;d be completely clear. But I can&#x27;t bare to have dry skin! It also smells wonderful.. very clean and I also notice that this soap whitens lol, must be from the lemon; nothing a little bronzer can&#x27;t fix!</li>
            <li> I really love this soap! It holds it&#x27;s shape well, some black soaps start to crumble quickly but this did not. It does have a brownish lather so you need to be sure to rinse your shower/tub well. It is very moisturizing and cleansing at the same time. It is great for the face and body. I love the scent too, it&#x27;s refreshing and I&#x27;ve gotten lots of compliments from people on how I smell after I&#x27;ve used this soap in the shower, some woman stopped me in the grocery store to tell me how good I smelled, so that is an awesome bonus for this great soap!  :-)</li>
            <li> This may be the processed commercialized version of African black soap but it is still pretty darn good and more reasonable to acquire than the softer raw stuff that you often have to cut off your own bars from a 1 LB brick and pay more for or deal with shipping charges.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! Smells divine and gets rid of my face, chest and back acne AND calms my keratosis pilaris (KP) which I have on my arms and back. It is very drying so be sure to use a good lotion afterwards. I rotate between Bio-Oil, Cetaphil Cream or Amlactin to keep my skin moisturized. Also this soap can leave a dark residue on your tiles so try to keep it contained in the shower.</li>
            <li> I tried this soap for the first time not having tried any products like it and it was WONDERFUL! I started noticing positive changes in my skin immediately. My acne stopped immediately, my skin feels healthier, and my dark spots are starting to fade and I haven&#x27;t been using it a month yet. The only bad thing I have to say about it is that immediately after using it feels like you need to follow up with a moisturizer which if I do I used organic coconut oil but I didn&#x27;t a few times and after awhile that little tight feeling goes away if you don&#x27;t want to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give you a bit of dryness and can have a &amp;#34;sensation&amp;#34; (don&#x27;t know how to describe it: not bad but not good either) but I did lots a research that stated this was normal and the dryness &amp; &amp;#34;sensation&amp;#34; went away a few days after using the soap. The research also said not to was private parts with it....... I never did but my mom did and based on what she told me.....you shouldn&#x27;t. Do NOT get it in your eyes. It stings like fire!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also used it to wash my hair (DO NOT GET IT IN YOUR EYES) and my scalp feels so much better since. Not as itchy. I wouldn&#x27;t wash with it daily....just doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall..... great product the only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it does leave brown residue all over the shower but, the benefits outweigh having to scrub my tub more often.</li>
            <li> This soap is not for all skin types. I had an increase in breakouts after using this soap for 5 weeks.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin look beautiful..</li>
            <li> Use this everyday. It replaced all other soaps I use, even shampoo. Works well on my sensitive skin. My hair feels clean and silky. My boyfriend has sun damaged skin and has noticed that his skin is less dry and flaky. Good delivery and packaging.</li>
            <li> This soap is the best. I only use it for 2 weeks and i can see a big difference.the first week it waz poppin out only my pimples and almost give up and then the 2 week all the pimples were dead and my face looks good, the dark spot were too black for the 1st week but on my second week you only see them if you close to me. I had lotion too but did not use it yet.this soap rocks and brought back my smile..cant wait to use it for 2 months and forever 😊😊😊</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful, I have been using this soap for quite a while now. It is great for my skin and it does not dry it out. My husband is also now hooked on Dudu Osun.[[ASIN:B000TAE0RK Dudu Osun Black Soap, 6-Count]]</li>
            <li> I love this product and I use it daily. It looks really gross but you feel clean. It has been great for my skin too.</li>
            <li> Great for oily skin. Do not use with light or white rags! It stains terribly bad. Don&#x27;t use on private areas! It is drying. I would highly recommend for teens or adults with acne, not young children or the elderly.</li>
            <li> Great soap, all natural, enough said.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing. I cannot imagine another soap that I&#x27;d take time out of my day to write a review for. It&#x27;s just soap but it leaves my skin smelling amazing and soft. Every other soap leaves a dry feeling but not this one. In a way the smell reminds me of the classic Dial Gold; it doesn&#x27;t smell like it, per say, it just has that clean smell that works for men or women. I give bars of this soap away to friends and family because I&#x27;m so impressed with it. Yeah, all that about soap. Ha.</li>
            <li> Great soap. This is easily as good as any dead sea mud soap out there. Great for acne or just feeling clear and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin. Residue will discolor your bathtub but it can be cleaned.</li>
            <li> This soap is awesome and does wonders for my skin.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a very good soap,strong clean force but not too dry, i will buy-back</li>
            <li> This soap smells so good. I ordered the 6 pack. It mad e me feel so clean and fruity that i gave some to my family. They love it. so I will be buying a larger package next. I received a lot of compliments working with elementary kid of how nice i smelled.</li>
            <li> Leaves my combination skin soft--I only use it on my face.  Actually prefer it to my usual Dermalogica facial cleanser.  Great lather, rinses off completely with no residue.  Only complaint is I don&#x27;t care for the scent--it&#x27;s not overwhelming, but just not to my liking.</li>
            <li> Best soap ever! Love this product as it is helping to keep my skin clear. It can be drying at times, but I use a small amount of vitamin e oil (cococare 100% vitamin e oil) on my face after using this and it restores the moisture back into my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main thing that is appreciated about this soap is that my skin is really clean after using this product. I know that because when alcohol free witch hazel is applied as a toner, there is no residue that is visible from doing this. I have recommended this product to other family members and would highly recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Order was delivered on 8/15/2014 and the expiration date on the soap is 4/2017.</li>
            <li> This soap is wonderful! My only complaint is that I didn&#x27;t buy more. The best black soap I have used(and I&#x27;ve used many in my time).</li>
            <li> Great clean and smell!!</li>
            <li> OMG! I love the way this soap makes my face feels after I wash with it.</li>
            <li> Smells a lot like Irish Spring.  Lathers up really well with a nice thick rich lather.  Needs to be put where it can drain well, I keep mine on a pumice stone.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing.  I was getting breakouts on a regular basis.  I bought this because I have oily skin.  This soap started working from day 1.  I immediately noticed that my skin was softer and had a better tone.  The most important thing is that since using for about 2 months, not a single break out.  It controls my oily skin.  The manufacturer shipped it with a good expiration date as well.  This soap does have a expiration date since it is all natural.  I ordered six bars and it had a far off expiration date. No problem at all.</li>
            <li> My skin feels great. My only complaint is the color which can leave something looking stained when it is placed on them(my soapbox holder). It feels great though when I am done. The first time I used it my skin kinda felt dry but that resolved by third use.</li>
            <li> I purchased this soap only because it was an add on for an order I was placing and I wanted to give it a go. I used it this morning on my face and neck and this soap cleanses my skin, leaving it brighter and smoother! I was shocked at how well it worked. The fragrance is lovely as well. After I finished showering I used a little coconut oil on my face and it feels baby soft and smooth. I would definitely recommend this soap!</li>
            <li> Soap works great for helping with eczema skin conditions. Will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> Cheap, lathers very well, gentle on sensitive skin. Not sure if it works on body acne but I have no irritation or breakouts while using it. Needs to store in soap case or you will have brown stains which washes away easily though</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a middle-aged white dude with large pores and somewhat oily skin.  I&#x27;ve tried various facial cleansers over the years and I believe this is the best soap for my type of skin.  It has a very natural, kinda grassy scent that does not linger on he skin. It lathers nicely, too. One bar has lasted me about three months with once-daily (twice-daily on occasion) use.  Other reviewers have noted that this soap will stain white washcloths, so I use darker colored washcoths with this soap.  Also may leave dark marks where you store it, so I would recommend a soap dish reserved for this product.  I keep mine on a wire mesh shower rack and that works fine for me...no unsightly stains to be found. Give it a try!</li>
            <li> I love this soap. I can&#x27;t express how much I love this soap!    The way my skin feels after lathering up a wash rag and scrubbing down is inexplicable, you really have to feel it to understand it.    -1 star for the scent and the color.  Everyone who has smelled it hates the scent, so much as to say that they think it smells awful. However, I love it. Perhaps this is a psychological attraction due to how good it makes my skin feel. I actually only use the soap when I know I won&#x27;t be running into anyone for a while, because of how much people dislike the smell.    Also since the soap is \\&quot;black\\&quot; it leaves very obvious residue. It&#x27;s very easy to wash away, but if you&#x27;re the type of person who freaks out when their bathroom isn&#x27;t 100% white this may put you off.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t notice anything different, except it really messes up bathtub or sink with black marks.</li>
            <li> This soap should be a staple in any home.  It is a head to toe soap! Years ago when my bf at the time and I traveled together, we never went anywhere without this soap. He liked it to shave and I love it for keeping pimples off of my face. I breakout easily when I travel (I know, weird huh?!). When I take my braids out, I wash my hair with this soap. I gets my hair squeaky clean...really it is squeaking when I&#x27;m done!&lt;br /&gt;My package arrived very fast and the soap smells VERY fresh, even the boxes look brighter than I&#x27;ve ever seen. I&#x27;ve been using this soap since around 1998. I&#x27;ve tried other black soaps but this brand  doesn&#x27;t have a bunch of other ingredients and fragrance that my skin does not need.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great antibacterial soap. My son has MS and I use this and/or tea tree soap on his skin ESPECIALLY when he has active bed sores. My son has very good and healthy looking skin and I attribute this to using the right soap.</li>
            <li> I just started using this product last month. I really like it as my hair soap. It makes my hair feel so clean. I haven.&#x27;t seen it do wonders for my skin but I can really tell the difference on my sisters skin.</li>
            <li> With all of the high priced designer French milled soaps, muds, and skin tonics this product does it all!!! With it&#x27;s rich aroma, silky smooth creamy lather, and pumice like scrub, this is the best of all worlds for just a few bucks. There has never been a better soap end of story.</li>
            <li> The scent of this soap is amazing and makes my skin so clear and soft. I have somewhat fair skin that gets irritated easily and if used too often this soap can cause dry spots but I moisturize religiously so it&#x27;s never an issue. I&#x27;m 23 and still get small breakouts sometimes on my back too but now they very very rarely happen.</li>
            <li> I am in my lower 20&#x27;s and I have naturally oily skin...and acne (even cystic) has always been an issue.. The soap is drying and can burn at times, as others have said. But other than that, my skin is clearer than it has ever been. The smell isn&#x27;t overly perfumed like most soaps but it does smell kind of &amp;#34;natural.&amp;#34; I love this soap! It&#x27;s cheap and effective. I will never use other soaps again. Definitely recommend. I had to use this for over a month to see results, so stick with it and you&#x27;ll be happy you did!</li>
            <li> I was a bit weary about using this product, but decided to give it a try. It did initially leave my skin very dry after the first two times of using it but after that it was fine. I use it day and night to cleanse my face and shower with it daily. My older kids use it on their face as well and they love it. I have some dark spots on my face from pregnancy, and have noticed them fading. I thought I might have seen difference a bit earlier as i&#x27;ve been using it for about 2 weeks now, but the spots are definitely fading! Smells great too, but the only thing is it does leave a bit mess because the soap is dark so you really have to keep it in a soap dish.</li>
            <li> This handmade soap taste good, to wash your face really good. Facial cleansing oil, the effect is very good, a total of six loaded, sent a few friends, said effect is good, the next time you run out will then consider buying.</li>
            <li> My skin feels very fresh after a day working outside is washed away and a night cream is applied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for caring this product.</li>
            <li> My face was getting pretty durn terrible and now it is doing a lot better. Thank you soap. &#x3D;] &#x3D;]</li>
            <li> Best soap around!! Good price, great smell, and gets you really clean.</li>
            <li> I have been getting so many comments on how I look since I started using this product. It has diminished the pores and scar marks on my face as well as toned and tighten my skin. Hopefully it will do the same for all that use it.</li>
            <li> I enjoy the rich lather of this honest, natural product.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> This soap gets your skin squeaky clean, tightens, and brightens it too. It also helped me get rid of some keratosis pilaris I had near my knees and on my elbows. The only downsides I&#x27;ve found are it be a drying and it burns a little especially on my face. It makes an excellent body soap and my skin feel exfoliated and it soaks up oils and moisturizers better.</li>
            <li> I have tried many different types of black soaps, but Dudu-Osun seems to the best one yet, and has became me and my wife&#x27;s favorite body cleanser.</li>
            <li> I have horrible acne problems. I&#x27;ve tried everything there is. I even went on acutain...TWICE. Nothing helped. I learned about this on YouTube and thought why not. So glad I did because I have a clear face for the first time in who knows how long. I have very fair skin, Very sensitive. My nickname is snow white if that gives you am idea. I&#x27;ve been using this as my cleanser, witch hazel as my toner and coconut oil as my moisturizer. Give it a try. You won&#x27;t be sorry!!</li>
            <li> I love this soap because it provided great moisture in the winter and will buy again in the future.  Came quick.</li>
            <li> Buy back feels like has expired as very old and the packaging has been far from complete i‘m so sad</li>
            <li> I really liked using the soap but I believe you have to continuously use it in other to see the changes. When I stopped using it my face became rough after a while.</li>
            <li> I buy this soap again and again. Ever since I started using this with a pro-x exfoliator, the skin on my face has looked marvelous. It doesnt over dry my face if I dont push down too hard and I havent had a pimple in months.</li>
            <li> Only product that could get rid of the breakouts on my back. I searched for years and wasted so much money trying different acne washes. Using this daily and then moisturizing with coconut oil has changed my life.</li>
            <li> This dried up my skin so bad my skin actually started to overcompensate by producing more oil- therefor more acne. It does seem to fade the scars but whats the point if it just gives you more acne?</li>
            <li> We found this soap a few months ago from a vendor in a shopping center, and we loved it so much we had to find where we could order several bars at once and were very happy to have found them here.  The soap is very clean smelling, all natural and it&#x27;s the only soap I can use on my face that doesn&#x27;t break me out and actually stops any small blimishes that are starting.  Since the soap is all natural and handmade, you do get a little variation in strength sometimes, One batch we got was a little stronger than the rest, but that is to be expected by all natural handmade items.  Arrived quickly and without issues.</li>
            <li> It is mild on my face and as long as I continue with my daily twice a day regimen it works wonders.  I recommend anyone to use this if u have problematic skin.</li>
            <li> Love this! Turned all my friends and family on to this. Lathers a lot! Messy, but true African Black soap is. Best to keep dry and out the shower after use. I bought a soap dish that kinda looks like a grill plate and set it on that with a wash cloth under. &amp; I keep it out side the shower on the toilet.</li>
            <li> really good seller, I like it</li>
            <li> Good price. My boyfriend and I love this soap. It make your face feel fresh, and wont feel very dry after washing face. There are some black spots on my boyfriend&#x27;s face, he keeps using this soap for few month, those black spots turning light. He still keep using it right now, and see what will happen. Maybe the black spots will go away hopefully.</li>
            <li> This product did not work for me or my son. We were so excited to use since we both have a SMALL problem with breakouts. After using for 4 days, we noticed more breakouts. We figured it was cleaning out our pores so we continued. After 2weeks, our acne was so bad like never before, we had to start on antibiotics from our doctor. We immediately stopped using the soap and are working on clearing up our acne with medicine.</li>
            <li> Very delicious! Thanks!</li>
            <li> All soaps I have purchased over the years just don&#x27;t do what I need them to.  Even the ones that claim to be for sensitive skin with no fragrance don&#x27;t cleanse and still leave me dry and itchy for days.  Black soap is the only soap I can use on me and my kids that smells great and leaves our skin clean and nourished afterward.  I follow with shea butter to moisturize. Perfect!</li>
            <li> I love this soap! It smells good and good for your skin.</li>
            <li> I like this product, could not find it anywhere in my area. Will be ordering more of it real soon.</li>
            <li> I bought this soap because I wanted help with my dry skin and acne, and it has worked the way I thought it would. It helps me clear up my acne, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like most other body soaps. My skin still feels a little dry, but a bit of lotion is all that is needed. Before lotion couldn&#x27;t even help my dry skin. I have also come to find like some others said that the size of my pores seems to have decreased which also helps with the clearing of acne and not to mention it just makes your skin look great. :) Also it smells fantastic my husband keeps using it because he says it smells so good, hahaha.</li>
            <li> It took a while for my skin to get used to this soap. At fist it burned a little an left red rashy areas on my face. I stopped using it so frequently and cut back to one every 2 days. Now I use it morning and night on most days and have noticed a definite improvement in my skin. I use it on my face and body a especially on my face I have noticed dark acne spots getting lighter. My boyfriend has commented on how smooth my skin feels. I love the smell, but it is very earthy which some people may not like.</li>
            <li> So how much could be said about soap?  That is what I thought, but this is really nice.  The smell is amazing, the feel after a shower is great, and the bars seem to be twice the size of normal ones (thicker).  I felt I needed to write a quick review because this is great soap...immediately after I got it, I added it to subscription.  Good stuff.</li>
            <li> I live by this soap. I have really oily skin and hair. I&#x27;ve always suffered from acne but this really help my skin brighten up. My hair gets really oily so it&#x27;s hard to find the right shampoo. I don&#x27;t even use conditioner and irs oily by the next day after a shower. I&#x27;ve been using this as shampoo also. It lathers great and it feels like it&#x27;s really giving my hair a deep cleanse without drying it out. This is my go to shower bar for Eveything! Face body hair or does it all.</li>
            <li> I have no idea how this item received so many positive reviews.  It is way to harsh on the skin even if you use very little.  It really stung my eyes, which makes me think, if this item is natural, what makes the eyes sting?  It&#x27;s not the type of sting you get from lime and lemon.  I have a good reason to believe that this product contains ingredients that are not listed.  Maybe SLS?  Please rethink and research before you purchase.</li>
            <li> Love this soap; so soothing on your skin!</li>
            <li> Nice smell, lather nicely</li>
            <li> I have never had acne before, now in my mid 30&#x27;s I started having what the doctor calls &amp;#34;hormonal acne&amp;#34; which leaves horrible scarring. Came across this soap on another website decided to compare price on Amazon which is a better deal, anyway this soap is absolutely amazing!!! My scars are fading significantly after just one week, No new pimples I&#x27;m just thrilled with the results, was going to the dermatologist which prescribed expensive creams but nothing worked like this soap soo glad I came across it wish I could give more than 5 stars can&#x27;t wait to see what my face looks like in a month.</li>
            <li> I had a rash from some coconut oil body raps around my belly button and a few mosquito bites when i started using this and it healed them up a very significant amount. Makes my skin mad soft too, my stretch marks are a lot better as well.</li>
            <li> I enjoy this product but was disappointed by the fact that 4 of them had damaged packaging and were practically opened. This poses doubt of the integrity of the product.</li>
            <li> I love black soap, and this is a fantastic brand. My entire family and I have been using black soap for years, and there are quite a few bad bars out there. Most store bought bars are not really black soap, and the color comes from dyes they add to a regular soap. Real authentic black soap is not black, it&#x27;s brown, and soft. Locally I cannot find authentic black soap, but I have found a few brands that although they are not authentic they are made out of the good stuff [Shea Moisture and Nubian]. However, here they&#x27;re only found in specialty shops and can get rather pricey. I have heard of Dudu-Osun but hadn&#x27;t seen it in any of the shops locally for a reasonable price. In some cases I&#x27;ve seen it for upwards of 7 to 10 dollars a bar. When I found it on Amazon with the Subscribe &amp; Save option I decided to give it a go. We have a family of sensitive skin, I have dry eczema prone skin on my body and a normal to oily skin on my face that is prone to breakouts and has plenty of acne scarring. My husband has really sensitive skin that will crack, swell, and break out when he uses some products, he&#x27;s also a fire fighter and is constantly training and exercising so he&#x27;s a pretty dirty guy. My son is 11 months [his birthday is September 10th] and he has eczema flare ups on his face, arms, and legs. My personal experience has been great, no tight dry skin afterwards and I haven&#x27;t had any eczema breakouts in months. My husband has been able to calm his break outs down considerably, and my son&#x27;s skin is doing great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great ingredients&lt;br /&gt;Large Bar&lt;br /&gt;Skin feels great afterwards&lt;br /&gt;Clears up break outs quickly&lt;br /&gt;Great for eczema&lt;br /&gt;Price is great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;Smell [personal preference, it&#x27;s not strong or lingering, I just prefer the Nubian &amp; Shea Moisture brand smells better]&lt;br /&gt;Melts quickly in the shower&lt;br /&gt;A little gritty [personal preference, it&#x27;s not super noticeable and if you are looking for exfoliation this could be a pro]&lt;br /&gt;Not great for shaving [per my husband]&lt;br /&gt;Like all black soaps leaves the shower looking gross*&lt;br /&gt;Because it is an oil based product it creates a film on the shower and clogs the drain *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*These two cons are something I will have to deal with no matter what brand I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly prefer black soap over castile soap, I also use it in my locs, my sons wavy hair, and my husband&#x27;s short straight hair. Gets it clean without stripping it and drying my hair out. Love it, just wish it smelled more natural.&gt;Not great for shaving [per my husband]&lt;br /&gt;Like all black soaps leaves the shower looking gross*&lt;br /&gt;Because it is an oil based product it creates a film on the shower and clogs the drain *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*These two cons are something I will have to deal with no matter what brand I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly prefer black soap over castile soap, I also use it in my locs, my sons wavy hair, and my husband&#x27;s short straight hair. Gets it clean without stripping it and drying my hair out. Love it, just wish it smelled more natural.</li>
            <li> Only use this on my face and its awesome! Leaves my skin soft and refreshed. Definitely recommend it to others!</li>
            <li> I bought this soap at a local black arts festival, in Denver, CO. After a week went by and of using the soap, I could see a huge change in my skin. Blemishes cleared up and I noticed I didn&#x27;t get acne as much after using the full bar. I have very sensitive skin and eczema I normally cannot use anything on my face, but I kid you not this soap served it&#x27;s purpose, and it&#x27;s affordable. I bought the 6 pack for my sister and I to use. I will no longer go back to the facial products I was using in the past.</li>
            <li> I have hypersensitive skin and any body soap with fragrance or comedogenic ingredients breaks me out. This product was no exception. Soap smells nice but my skin had a bad reaction to the fragrance in the soap and i brokeout. I tried it on 2 different occasions, same thing each time. I wish dudu osun sold an all natural version without fragrance but currently to my knowledge, they don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not trying to promote a different soap but, if youve used this product and had the same reaction or have hypersensitive skin and don&#x27;t want to risk more breakouts, there are other available no fragrance containing black soaps on amazon.</li>
            <li> My daughter has sensitive skin and severe acne.  She&#x27;s seen a dermatologist for years.  This soap has done what no prescription could...in just a few days!!!!</li>
            <li> I have been using this soap for three years and I love it.  I have problem with dark spots and blotches.  This soap has helped to lighten the areas in my face and leaves me with a clear complexion.  My husband noticed the difference in my complexion and I hadn&#x27;t told him about the soap.  It lathers really great and I use it all over for baths.  I keep a supply on hand always.</li>
            <li> Great soap.  Last long and great scent.</li>
            <li> Great soap with expiration dates on the packaging. I use this soap on my hair only when it needs to be clarified. Took off 1 star because it burned the hoo ha, so it&#x27;s too strong for me bathing with it! I have also used this on my face before to control mild acne, but it made it worse because It was overdrying my facial skin which caused an overproduction of oil. The acne becoming worse possibly was what most would consider the purging stage, to where it&#x27;s worse before it&#x27;s better, but I&#x27;m too impatient for that. I now use 100% tea tree oil for acne prevention which is amazing!! I&#x27;d say for my hair overall the lather is great with no worries of sulfates or other chemicals found in most shampoos. The smell is amazing!!</li>
            <li> Leaves a lot of dark mess on the sink.</li>
            <li> It broke me out. My skin got worst than better.</li>
            <li> awesome soap for cleaning the whole body, not too much the face all the time but lightly a few times a week i use it for face.</li>
            <li> Very luxurious and moisturizing soap. Fragrance may not be for everyone but the lather is incredible. Love this soap.</li>
            <li> Very grateful ~ Very good</li>
            <li> Strong initial scent but it doesnt stay strong on the skin. Good soap for scrubbing.</li>
            <li> This soap is amazing.  I use it for hair, body, face, shaving, all over.  All natural.  Great for those of us who have reactions to the nasty chemicals put into modern hygiene products.</li>
            <li> Oh thank you very much the price was good and great quality the delivery was fast took last than one week.</li>
            <li> I keep ordering this soap over and over. It has cleared up my skin a lot.</li>
            <li> Just order my second one! I can&#x27;t help that this is the only soap I use on my body.</li>
            <li> Being used to see if there is no effect.</li>
            <li> I love this soap! I am planning on buying this 6 pack again. It&#x27;s starting to clear up my skin&#x27;s acne blemishes/scars and I have seen a little improvement after the 5th use.I use one bar for my face and one bar for my body.  Shipment was very fast and it arrived before the expected date.</li>
            <li> My husband and I love this soap and it is a staple in our house. Guests often rave about it and how wonderful it has made their skin feel. We&#x27;ve turned quite a few people onto this. If you are having any skin issues, acne, dryness, sensitivity I reccommend giving this a try.</li>
            <li> Great for acne. Clears face in less than a week. Thank you.</li>
            <li> This is a great soap, and there is plenty of it! I use it for everything, including my hair. I don&#x27;t bother with shampoo anymore. A whole winter went by without dandruff. No chemicals, just natural ingredients. Recommended.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product about a month ago. My face and upper body ( chest and back )are covered with old acne spots and marks.  Initially i thought the product was too drying as it began to tighten my skin particularly on the face, however i just layered the product more sparingly after a couple uses and I think that I have achieved the right concentration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has definitely improved in that my spots and scars are lightening up so i would rate a 4, not 5 because the residue on wash cloth, loafah etc from continued use tends to leaves a stain.</li>
            <li> Better than the other &amp;#34;RAW&amp;#34; one on Amazon</li>
            <li> I used accutane to get rid of acne and after 6 months of being off of the accutane the acne came back. A family friend told me to give this soap a try. After 4 months of using the soap i can tell you this stuff works for acne. I&#x27;m not going to say it has completely cleared my acne because i want to be honest but i don&#x27;t have pimples anymore. All i have is a couple of little red bumps that go away after a couple of days. I am pretty sure that if i keep using it my acne will be completely gone. If anyone is looking at this soap for acne give it a shot, you wont regret it. I would also suggest picking up a exfoliating cream that you can use 2 times a week and a moisturizer because the soap will dry your skin when you first use it.</li>
            <li> I really like the soap. I will definitely reorder.thanks</li>
            <li> This soap has a very nice fresh smell.  It leaves you clean and does not leave the normal soap scum in your tub.</li>
            <li> BEST SOAP EVER... leaves face so smooth!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap daily, sometimes even twice a day, for about 3 weeks, and it&#x27;s really helped reduce oiliness and acne. It&#x27;s not completely gotten rid of acne, but it&#x27;s definitely pulling its weight. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone with oily skin. I read that it can bother people with more sensitive skin, but if that&#x27;s not a major concern to you then you really ought to try this soap. It&#x27;s so much better than chemical-laced products - I would love to see it and products like it become more popular in the U.S.</li>
            <li> Most of the soaps will make skin dry ... even those advertised for winter care. But this one works great on my skin and doesn&#x27;t make it dry. This are neutral odor , so no smell at all, wish they came in some choice of nice scent.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff LOVE the smell and how It makes my skin feel</li>
            <li> I was ordering this soap from another source and was paying $5.00 per bar, so needless to say I&#x27;m totally happy that I found in on Amazon saving approximately $15 on each 6 pack I purchase.  Bless them!</li>
            <li> I got this soap when I seen all the good reviews for the soap. My sister and I have been using this soap for about six weeks now and I can honestly say that this soap works wonders! Me and my sister have had bad acne since we were teenagers and now we are 21. We have tried almost everything to get rid of it. We have used this soap and it significantly helped improve the acne on our face. The soap also has a pleasant smell. I would recommend this soap to anyone that has acne issues for an inexpensive cost.</li>
            <li> I love this Black Soap.  For one, I find the smell so comforting.  The alkalinity of it is very potent because often times when i leave it on my face for a few minutes, I can feel my skin tightening and slightly burning (which feels lovely).  I honestly think It does help clear up imperfections on one&#x27;s skin as well as evening its tone.  This paired with Raw Ivory Shea Butter on my body and rosehip oil on my face has become my simple, effective and natural skin care regimen :)</li>
            <li> If I could have this particular item on auto order and the 6pk, my family love this soap and now this is the only soap that we used for shampoo, facial and body its does a GREAT with multi purpose use.</li>
            <li> First of all Black Soap is EXCELLENT for your skin!!!  If you have problems with acne or oily skin, black soap is for you!!!!  Forget Proactiv and all of those expensive products, this is all you need and this is coming from someone who has fought acne for years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My comments on this specific brand:  I first tried Nubian Heritage Black soap and loved it.  I tried this brand Dudu Osun and although it smells awesome, it did not have the impact on my skin like Nubian Heritage did.  I would recommend their brand!!</li>
            <li> my 2nd order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this lathers great &amp; leaves me smelling like haile selasie&lt;br /&gt;the ethjopian ruler of past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now, pass me a spear &amp; run...</li>
            <li> Cleans me better than any other soap on the market I&#x27;ve ever tried. Have been using it for years and it lasts long too. Has a good lather, rinses clean. The only thing is it can stain a wash cloth and make your tub get dirty. I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
