            <li>Just what I needed and works perfectly.</li>
            <li>Just not the best use for this product.</li>
            <li>It is also a great smudger for shadows!</li>
            <li>its incredible and marvelous product i ever used.</li>
            <li>I use it to give my eyeliner that smoky &amp;#34;smudged&amp;#34; look, and it works splendidly.</li>
            <li>Otherwise very pleased!</li>
            <li>Great sponge to apply a gel liner evenly on your eyes.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know how well it would perform for extensively adventurous makeup attempts, but for basics like smudging or blending some liner (for example), this brush does an awesome job (and is great for those who like to apply their makeup with a touch of frugality).</li>
            <li>Works perfectly and easy to wash.</li>
            <li>I was pretty impressed with this.</li>
            <li>It would be nice if they all did. .</li>
            <li>The brush is easy to use and its a good quality sturdy brush.</li>
            <li>very easy to use.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li>Love them and will continue to buy them.  </li>
            <li>i guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li>I have brushes, but I tend to use this more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t get a better result with my finger or a q-tip.</li>
            <li>Love the smudge sponge.</li>
            <li>Elf is always inexpensive and I really enjoy their quality of brushes.</li>
            <li>The quality is so cheap</li>
            <li>Glad I found these for my eyeliners that don&#x27;t come with this kind of tool on the opposite end.  </li>
            <li>There are so many products offered here, it&#x27;s hard to figure out which reviews to read, but the smudge eye sponge works great.</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t received mine from Amazon yet, but I can tell you these are great little brushes.  </li>
            <li>Great little tool for a smoky eye!</li>
            <li>Shipping was quick and I would certainly recommend this brush.</li>
            <li>Instead of a smooth smudge, it grabs the lip liner and chunks it or wipes it off completely.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>;)  </li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t really work like the video suggests.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t really know what it is suppose to do.</li>
            <li>Love this product and the delivery was as expected.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t really smudge.</li>
            <li>Like others have reviewed, it is a bit more stiff than desired, but here&#x27;s hoping it will soften up with continued use.  </li>
            <li>This is exactly the smudge sponge you get on the opposite end of an eyeliner that comes with a sponge (as all</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried other eye sponges and this one worked just like the rest nothing particularly special about it.  </li>
            <li>It is clearly labeled an eye sponge.  </li>
            <li>I was surprised that this cost around four bucks, because it does the job probably as well as more expensive brands.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s very soft to use on your eye but firm enough to work.  </li>
            <li> but strangely don&#x27;t).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve searched everywhere and couldn&#x27;t seem to find this without an actually eyeliner attached to the other end or without it being couple with a bunch of other brushes I don&#x27;t need.</li>

            <li> I ordered one off of Amazon because the other one I have from ELF fell apart, which ELF brushes often do.  </li>

            <li> Small</li>

            <li> but it was a hard sponge</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Sorry!</li>
            <li> very disappointed sponge is hard.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> Just what I needed and works perfectly.</li>
            <li> The sponge end is VERY tiny, smaller than the picture looks. Couldn&#x27;t use it. Not worth what I paid. Sorry!</li>
            <li> There are so many products offered here, it&#x27;s hard to figure out which reviews to read, but the smudge eye sponge works great.</li>
            <li> It blends so well. The brush is easy to use and its a good quality sturdy brush. I&#x27;m glad I bought it</li>
            <li> Small but it gets the job done just like any other smudge brush. Elf is always inexpensive and I really enjoy their quality of brushes. A must have!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not need this :-( don&#x27;t read and  is sponge</li>
            <li> This is exactly the smudge sponge you get on the opposite end of an eyeliner that comes with a sponge (as all should but strangely don&#x27;t).  Works perfectly and easy to wash.</li>
            <li> I ordered one off of Amazon because the other one I have from ELF fell apart, which ELF brushes often do.  I haven&#x27;t received mine from Amazon yet, but I can tell you these are great little brushes.  I just wish the wand was a smaller, travel size.  For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it.  This is an eye sponge, NOT a &amp;#34;lip sponge&amp;#34; like the other poster was thinking.  It is clearly labeled an eye sponge.  It&#x27;s very soft to use on your eye but firm enough to work.  Even if it falls apart, for the price, a drop of adhesive will keep it on.  Love them and will continue to buy them.  Great little tool for a smoky eye!</li>
            <li> I was expecting it to be a smudger brush but it was a hard sponge i guess it&#x27;s ok</li>
            <li> I purchased this item after watching a youtube video on how to contour your lips.  It doesn&#x27;t really work like the video suggests.  Instead of a smooth smudge, it grabs the lip liner and chunks it or wipes it off completely.  Probably not a product malfunction.  Just not the best use for this product.</li>
            <li> I was pretty impressed with this. I use it to give my eyeliner that smoky &amp;#34;smudged&amp;#34; look, and it works splendidly. I was surprised that this cost around four bucks, because it does the job probably as well as more expensive brands.

            <li> I wet the end first then use it to smudge dark powder shadow as eyeliner. very easy to use.</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for. I&#x27;ve searched everywhere and couldn&#x27;t seem to find this without an actually eyeliner attached to the other end or without it being couple with a bunch of other brushes I don&#x27;t need. Shipping was quick and I would certainly recommend this brush.</li>

            <li> How is this a &amp;#34;sponge&amp;#34;?  It&#x27;s hard as a rock.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t really smudge. I can&#x27;t get a better result with my finger or a q-tip.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush to smudge my eyeliner since I was in college.  It is inexpensive and gets the job done!</li>
            <li> i like it alot .  i do recommended. its smudge so well.  its incredible and marvelous product i ever used.</li>
            <li> Glad I found these for my eyeliners that don&#x27;t come with this kind of tool on the opposite end.  It would be nice if they all did. . .but anyhow. . .  Like others have reviewed, it is a bit more stiff than desired, but here&#x27;s hoping it will soften up with continued use.  ;)  Otherwise very pleased!</li>
            <li> Love the smudge sponge.</li>
            <li> very disappointed sponge is hard.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried other eye sponges and this one worked just like the rest nothing particularly special about it.  For the price you can do no better and it creates the effect you want for that smokey look.  Would recommend to others.</li>
