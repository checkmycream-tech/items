            <li>Awesome! !</li>
            <li>I am so happy that I can get this product through amazon!</li>
            <li>I am 62, and have always had the best of the best creams,  and paid a fortune for some of them.</li>
            <li>It took some getting used to, and I wasn&#x27;t very impressed, but as I continued through the wash and cream&lt;br /&gt;I began to see my skin getting a glow from within, and tighter.  </li>
            <li>Works great!</li>
            <li>Great results!</li>
            <li>and I am asked all the time how I keep my skin so beautiful.  </li>
            <li>I also apply Cerave PM lotion after this at night to help moisturize, great stuff.</li>
            <li>have used Retin A for years and thought that I was happy..  </li>
            <li>Love them all!!</li>
            <li>My skin has never looked so good, at any price.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>think that if you stay with this product, you too will be writing a review of your own, you  will want to share your joy, as I feel compelled to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My skin looks great, feels great and is blemish free.  </li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li>This cream is amazing.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried all kind of moisturizers</li>
            <li>This is the best, strongest product I&#x27;ve found thus far!  </li>
            <li>I mix it with Cetaphil cream and the top layer of my skin</li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>I was told by a friend that her dermatoligist had reccomended this to her because of skin cancers on her face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I, too, have had many MOHs surgeries all on my face.  </li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t know how Amazon was able to get it.</li>
            <li>Fantastic cream!</li>
            <li>BUT, it&#x27;s strong and</li>
            <li>I feel this is proof positive of how effective it is.</li>
            <li>You have to watch out for sunburn, though, so timing is important.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many facial products this is far the best for the money.</li>
            <li>My skin is no longer flaky and my makeup glides right on.</li>
            <li>and I only use a little channel powder, and blush, and I am flawless.  </li>
            <li>But you can top it with some CC cream or other sunscreen and it will be fine.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been battling brown spots for years and have tried so many different products and even had IPL and chemical peels.  </li>
            <li>so I really don&#x27;t have any results as of yet but have used several other Glytone products for a number of years and can say they are very good.</li>
            <li>It is strong and you will definitely want Step 1 first.</li>
            <li>It does sting when you first put it on, but goes away fast.  </li>
            <li>Really helps with my large pores on my nose, etc.  </li>
            <li>and I spend too much time in the sun during the summer.</li>
            <li>I really like how it helps&lt;br</li>
            <li>Works even better, as expected since it is stronger.  </li>
            <li>I use this with Skinceuticals gentle cream cleanser</li>
            <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a strong cream and stings a little, but its doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;Great for older skin.  </li>
            <li>The first ingredient is water and the second is glycolic acid</li>
            <li>I only have to apply this one at night as its strong enough so it should last even longer.  </li>
            <li>Have used this for years on my mature skin, and I swear by it.  </li>
            <li>This product exfoliates, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as far as I can tell.  </li>
            <li>My skin has become so smooth since I started using this just a few days</li>
            <li>so you know you are getting a professional grade product.  </li>
            <li>I only use it during the winter months as it makes your skin sun sensitive</li>
            <li>I can see a big improvement and am on step #2 so far.  </li>
            <li>It definitely has a slight burn upon first application but that only lasts a few minutes and is well worth the results.</li>

            <li> Have used this for years on my mature skin, and I swear by it.  BUT, it&#x27;s strong and I recommend beginning with Step 1 until your skin is used to it.  This product exfoliates, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize as far as I can tell.  I mix it with Cetaphil cream and the top layer of my skin literally peels off after an hour.  You have to watch out for sunburn, though, so timing is important.  I also don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, so it isn&#x27;t an issue for me.  But you can top it with some CC cream or other sunscreen and it will be fine.</li>
            <li> I have tried many facial products this is far the best for the money. I have seen and I feel the difference.  Love this product. I just ordered the night cream and eye product too. Nancy</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 10 years. I&#x27;ve had seborrhea on my face in the past and my dermatologist suggested this to help with skin turnover and renewal. I only use it during the winter months as it makes your skin sun sensitive and I spend too much time in the sun during the summer. I really like how it helps&lt;br /&gt;My skin texture.</li>
            <li> I was told by a friend that her dermatoligist had reccomended this to her because of skin cancers on her face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;I, too, have had many MOHs surgeries all on my face.  I can see a big improvement and am on step #2 so far.  It does sting when you first put it on, but goes away fast.  I would suggest this for anyone over 50 to improve their skin texture, and overall appearance.</li>
            <li> My skin has become so smooth since I started using this just a few days ago.&lt;br /&gt;  Also noticed dark spots on my face going away.  It&#x27;s a strong cream and stings a little, but its doing its job.&lt;br /&gt;Great for older skin.  Would highly recommend.</li>
            <li> Started with step one and we&#x27;ve been using this one for about two weeks.  Works even better, as expected since it is stronger.  Can&#x27;t wait to use step 3.  While using step 1 I would apply it night and day (when I knew I wouldn&#x27;t be in the sun).  I only have to apply this one at night as its strong enough so it should last even longer.  Really helps with my large pores on my nose, etc.  I also apply Cerave PM lotion after this at night to help moisturize, great stuff.</li>
            <li> My search is over! I finally have found a product line that does what it claims! I use the face wash, toner and this ! I had very painful adult cystic acne for the last couple years. Tried various prescriptions, several antibiotics all which have side effects! I saw a noticeable difference in my face in a couple weeks! This is my 3rd month on the line and I have not had a breakout or cyst since! Fines lines are going away and acne scars are now fading! I use the body wash and body lotion and the heel cream from this line! Love them all!!</li>
            <li> Awesome! ! Thank you!</li>
            <li> This is a product that can only be purchased thru a Dermatologist so I don&#x27;t know how Amazon was able to get it. In a doctor&#x27;s office it costs $48.00 but lasts for about three months.  The first ingredient is water and the second is glycolic acid so you know you are getting a professional grade product.  Since it comes in a jar oxygen is going to deplete the power of the glycolic sooner then if it came in a tube, so open and shut the jar asap.  It does work well, I am now on Step 2 and it still stings when I put it on.  But I see a big difference in my hyperpigmentation.  Remember though, if you don&#x27;t use a sun screen every day applying at least twice during the day this product won&#x27;t work and any positive results will fade as the sun&#x27;s rays damage your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been battling brown spots for years and have tried so many different products and even had IPL and chemical peels.  This is the best, strongest product I&#x27;ve found thus far!  I have tried Obagi, Murad and numerous drug store products and nothing has compared to this.  It definitely has a slight burn upon first application but that only lasts a few minutes and is well worth the results.</li>
            <li> I love this product! I&#x27;ve tried all kind of moisturizers but I always go back to this one.</li>
            <li> I just started using this so I really don&#x27;t have any results as of yet but have used several other Glytone products for a number of years and can say they are very good.</li>
            <li> I have written reviews on this product several times and it is always with a 5 star.  I have used this Glytone product for over 20....I am now 74 and I am asked all the time how I keep my skin so beautiful.  I feel this is proof positive of how effective it is.</li>
            <li> Glytone has helped my skin look younger. Wrinkles are less pronounced.</li>
            <li> This is a thick face cream. It is strong and you will definitely want Step 1 first. Helps with acne and completion. I would compare the effects to tretinoin which you can only get with a prescription</li>
            <li> I am so happy that I can get this product through amazon! My skin looks great, feels great and is blemish free.  I am now you several of their products.</li>
            <li> Fantastic cream! My skin looks radiant</li>
            <li> This cream is amazing. My dermatologist had prescribed this to me back in 2007 to help treat my rosaceaIt makes a big difference in the smoothness of my skin. My skin is no longer flaky and my makeup glides right on. I use this with Skinceuticals gentle cream cleanser and I take a prescribed pill called Oracea and the combination keep my rosacea at bay. LOVE this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am 62, and have always had the best of the best creams,  and paid a fortune for some of them. From my lifelong experience, I am somewhat of an expert on them.&lt;br /&gt;I have used Retin A for years and thought that I was happy..  My dermatologist recommended this line of Glytone products, so I began with step 1, kit.I  It took some getting used to, and I wasn&#x27;t very impressed, but as I continued through the wash and cream&lt;br /&gt;I began to see my skin getting a glow from within, and tighter.  I recently bought the step 2 cream and WOW.&lt;br /&gt;I have to mention that it stings upon application,&amp;#34;  no pain no gain&amp;#34;, but the sting only lasts a couple of minutes.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is glowing and I only use a little channel powder, and blush, and I am flawless.  My skin has never looked so good, at any price.&lt;br /&gt;I think that if you stay with this product, you too will be writing a review of your own, you  will want to share your joy, as I feel compelled to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gI</li>
            <li> Works great! Great results!</li>
