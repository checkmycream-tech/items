            <li>I received this item for a honest review.</li>
            <li>I am amazed how much better</li>
            <li>I love these brushes.</li>
            <li>and I love it</li>
            <li>I absolutely love love love this product.</li>
            <li>Some of the brushes are somehow ok, but mostly the one you use for powder doesn&#x27;t work..</li>
            <li>she packed was this brush kit and a compact with her favorite colors.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s ok..</li>
            <li>I love &#x27;em.</li>
            <li>My wife really enjoyed reviewing this item.  </li>
            <li>The size range is excellent (according to my niece, who is the one using them) and covers pretty much any need.  </li>
            <li>She was able to easily get the job done with these brushes.</li>
            <li>This is fantastic because it allows for a lot more control and precision.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t receive the free  travel brush with it</li>
            <li>Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet but took a look and feel and looks good so far.</li>
            <li>These brushes are seriously very nice and soft, and they pick up pixels pretty darn well for the price.</li>
            <li>best is apron that holds the brushes, no more dropping brushes and getting makeup</li>
            <li>and these are by far my favorite I have used in many yeas.</li>
            <li>Shipping was fast and the package arrived safely at destination with the products in one piece.</li>
            <li>Well worth considering if you&#x27;re looking for a full set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]</li>
            <li>The brushes aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; as many brushes I&#x27;ve used, and the bristles are packed densely but are still very soft.</li>
            <li>Pretty good although the brush at taxmen is coming loose and will eventually fall apart.</li>
            <li>There was absolutely no hairs loose or in the package and they all are in perfect condition.</li>
            <li>This is one of the most complete set of cosmetic brushes at a reasonable price (under thirty bucks at the time of this review).</li>
            <li>The brushes are so soft and the powder spreads easily.  </li>
            <li>Love the brushed.</li>
            <li>They are light and the handles are made of natural wood.</li>
            <li>They are MUCH thinner than they look in the pictures!</li>
            <li>Overall I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li>I love all the different kinds they have, the brushes aren&#x27;t labeled for what they are suppose to be used for.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t dislodge any of them even when pulling with far more force than they would get in normal</li>
            <li>Everything in tact, thanks!</li>
            <li>They are super soft and can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li>Super soft</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the pink ones the first thing I noticed was much better packaging.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>Expected a bit better quality.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used many name-brand brush kits (IT Cosmetics, MAC, Too Faced, Urban Decay, Bare Escentuals, et al)</li>
            <li>maybe if I bought another set half pice would be better quality.</li>
            <li>This brush assortment does not match the main description of this item.  </li>
            <li>The last time I purchased these they came in a plastic bag and smelled a little bit funky but after using them, I quickly fell in love.</li>
            <li>The brushes are soft and gentle to the face.</li>
            <li>She stated that the brushes were very soft and no hairs came out.</li>
            <li>This is a very complete set of well-made brushes/applicators.  </li>
            <li>of the handles are a pretty blonde wood with a smooth lacquer finish and glossy black metal ferrules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>2 of them cost just about the same of this whole set.</li>
            <li>Plus the set of brushes is complete.</li>
            <li>The case they came in looks professional.</li>
            <li>Then there are seventeen brushes of luxuriously soft synthetic sable that is both hygienic and cruelty-free.</li>
            <li>The Brushes are soft.</li>
            <li>Normally she would have to take her big \\&quot;Tackle Box\\&quot; sized kit to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Most are different, but a few of the most-used smaller ones have spares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>First, last year, in the bamboo color and now in pink.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good way to replace all those dirty, worn-out brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It was basically a complete waste of money since I can&#x27;t use the large brushes.</li>
            <li>The brushes look nice, but the larger ones are just too thin!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews that said they smell funny and the brushes were falling apart.</li>

            <li> So, while I wish I had known that color was not the only difference in sets(bummer), I will now be returning for the black one!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s fabric, which allows the case plus brushes to be folded/rolled up to take up less room, which is a big plus for storage if you&#x27;re tight on bathroom storage space.</li>
            <li> We have bought some Cliniques and other well know brands but</li>
            <li> They don&#x27;t shed as much as other brushes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t smell like some other brands.</li>
            <li> and I use so much less.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these inferior brushes.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It includes a dual brow and lash brush with nylon bristles and a plastic comb, a round eyelash brush, and a foam eyeshadow applicator.  </li>
            <li> the synthetic hair is made of.. BAD quality..</li>
            <li> , just disappointed the description is so misleading.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Love the brushed. I am amazed how much better my make up goes on and I use so much less.</li>
            <li> I love these brushes. I&#x27;ve seen a few reviews that said they smell funny and the brushes were falling apart. I just opened them all I could smell was the plastic they came in. I&#x27;ve left them out for a couple of hours and the smell is already fading. There was absolutely no hairs loose or in the package and they all are in perfect condition. They are super soft and can&#x27;t wait to try them.</li>
            <li> Super soft and I love it</li>
            <li> I absolutely love love love this product. These brushes are everything!</li>
            <li> Some of the brushes are somehow ok, but mostly the one you use for powder doesn&#x27;t work.. the synthetic hair is made of.. BAD quality.. they smell like plastic.. maybe if I bought another set half pice would be better quality.</li>
            <li> This is one of the most complete set of cosmetic brushes at a reasonable price (under thirty bucks at the time of this review). The quality may not be as good as the best brushes we have. We have bought some Cliniques and other well know brands but 2 of them cost just about the same of this whole set. The brushes are soft and gentle to the face. They don&#x27;t shed as much as other brushes. They are light and the handles are made of natural wood. This set will last for a long long time of regular use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample item was provided to me for review purposes.</li>
            <li> The brushes are so soft and the powder spreads easily.  I like them! Plus the set of brushes is complete. Shipping was fast and the package arrived safely at destination with the products in one piece.</li>
            <li> The brushes look nice, but the larger ones are just too thin! I like a dense brush for my foundation, blush, blending, etc. and these do not meet my needs. It was basically a complete waste of money since I can&#x27;t use the large brushes. They are MUCH thinner than they look in the pictures! Don&#x27;t waste your money on these inferior brushes. You get what you pay for!</li>
            <li> These were admittedly an impulse-buy when I saw them on the Amazon Flash Sales. I didn&#x27;t even need them since I have a billion brushes already. However, I&#x27;m so glad I bought them because these brushes are wonderful. I&#x27;ve used many name-brand brush kits (IT Cosmetics, MAC, Too Faced, Urban Decay, Bare Escentuals, et al) and these are by far my favorite I have used in many yeas. The brushes aren&#x27;t as &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; as many brushes I&#x27;ve used, and the bristles are packed densely but are still very soft. This is fantastic because it allows for a lot more control and precision. They don&#x27;t shed, they wash up well. 10/10 would buy again.</li>
            <li> Very nice quality. Didn&#x27;t smell like some other brands. No shedding. Only issue is that the larger brushes all seem to look the same. The case they came in looks professional. Overall I&#x27;m quite satisfied.</li>
            <li> This set has brushes for the the lips, eyelashes, and everything in-between.  It&#x27;s a good way to replace all those dirty, worn-out brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It includes a dual brow and lash brush with nylon bristles and a plastic comb, a round eyelash brush, and a foam eyeshadow applicator.  Then there are seventeen brushes of luxuriously soft synthetic sable that is both hygienic and cruelty-free. There are shapes and sizes to apply every kind of makeup.  Most are different, but a few of the most-used smaller ones have spares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of the handles are a pretty blonde wood with a smooth lacquer finish and glossy black metal ferrules.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are packaged in a pro-style linen-weave cotton pouch with a webbing belt and plastic buckle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DBROTH provided brushes for evaluation and review.</li>
            <li> This brush set is very similar to a MAC brush set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife and I went to an out of town wedding and of course she needed to apply her makeup. Normally she would have to take her big \\&quot;Tackle Box\\&quot; sized kit to complete the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All she packed was this brush kit and a compact with her favorite colors. She was able to easily get the job done with these brushes. She stated that the brushes were very soft and no hairs came out. Also, this saved her a trip to the mall to have her makeup done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best is apron that holds the brushes, no more dropping brushes and getting makeup everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was supplied a sample for the purpose or reviews.</li>
            <li> Haven&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet but took a look and feel and looks good so far. Didn&#x27;t receive the free  travel brush with it but that&#x27;s ok.. no biggie</li>
            <li> These brushes are great for the price. They have not shed yet. I love all the different kinds they have, the brushes aren&#x27;t labeled for what they are suppose to be used for. Got to me on time. Fast shipping. My only concern is that the brushes don&#x27;t hold my loose makeup well like blush. I really have to push hard for them to pick up the color.</li>
            <li> The brushes are amazing! You cannot question the quality. No shedding at all. I love &#x27;em. The only issue is some brushes are the same.</li>
            <li> This brush assortment does not match the main description of this item.  The brushes are 100% synthetic and the storage apron is not leather, it is canvas.  This is not a high end brush set, do not be misled by the description.  The quality of the set matches the price paid as a reduced lightning deal price.  I have not used the brushed yet, just disappointed the description is so misleading.</li>
            <li> This is a very complete set of well-made brushes/applicators.  The size range is excellent (according to my niece, who is the one using them) and covers pretty much any need.  I tested them out in terms of build quality and was impressed. Excellent handle finish, and the bristles are very even and well-attached.  I couldn&#x27;t dislodge any of them even when pulling with far more force than they would get in normal use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The case is also well done. It&#x27;s fabric, which allows the case plus brushes to be folded/rolled up to take up less room, which is a big plus for storage if you&#x27;re tight on bathroom storage space. The case has individual pouches of various sizes to hold the brushes. There&#x27;s also a front pouch to hold misc items such as cotton pads/balls or Q-tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s an impressive set both in terms of completeness as well as build quality. Well worth considering if you&#x27;re looking for a full set of brushes.&lt;br /&gt;[Sample provided for review]</li>
            <li> Everything in tact, thanks!</li>
            <li> This is an awesome brush set.  It has brushes that we&#x27;ve never seen or used before.  My wife really enjoyed reviewing this item.  The are plenty of bridges and plus it comes with a little belt like a real professional.  I received this item for a honest review.</li>
            <li> This is my second time purchasing these brushes. First, last year, in the bamboo color and now in pink. The last time I purchased these they came in a plastic bag and smelled a little bit funky but after using them, I quickly fell in love. Upon receiving the pink ones the first thing I noticed was much better packaging. But, that is not what I was paying for. These brushes are seriously very nice and soft, and they pick up pixels pretty darn well for the price. The one problem I have with the pink set that I did not with the bamboo set is that the pink set comes with 4 or 5 lipgloss brushes and absolutely zero eyeshadow blending brushes. So, while I wish I had known that color was not the only difference in sets(bummer), I will now be returning for the black one!</li>
            <li> Pretty good although the brush at taxmen is coming loose and will eventually fall apart. Expected a bit better quality.</li>
            <li> The Brushes are soft. I&#x27;ve been using them daily.</li>
            <li> Good quality but why there is repeating for brush ?!!</li>
