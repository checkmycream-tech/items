            <li>While I absolutely LOVE the product, the information on the initial site is DECEPTIVE.</li>
            <li>Not too hot.</li>
            <li>my dentist said finally your teeth look better after year of exasperation</li>
            <li>Some are hot while others are milder.</li>
            <li>Great taste and the dental advantages are unbelievable!</li>
            <li>Very tasty, but don&#x27;t eat too many, instant diarrhea!</li>
            <li>I love cinnamon,for dry mouth</li>
            <li>This is a good product, but the flavor doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li>I wish they didn&#x27;t dissolve quite so readily.</li>
            <li>Fast shipment.</li>
            <li>Low carb and gluten free.  </li>
            <li>REALLY?  </li>
            <li>Amazon, you really need to consider another source besides UPS.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s much to say about that.</li>
            <li>I really like these.  </li>
            <li>Also very poisonous to dogs.</li>
            <li>I really like these mints.</li>
            <li>They take more time to dissolve than other Xylitol based mints.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li>My new favorite - similar to red hots.</li>
            <li>but it at least stops my breath from kickin during long shifts when it&#x27;s easy to get a bit dehydrated and have stanky breath after not being able to brush all day.  </li>
            <li>I love these, they give just enough cinnamon flavor, and they last long enough to take away the sweet cravings, that can hit while dieting.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>WOW!  </li>
            <li>and these are the only mints that really increase saliva flow.  </li>
            <li>I only wish the price was lower, thanks</li>
            <li>They satisfy the need for a little sweet treat.</li>
            <li>My favorite flavor- so hard to find xylotol mints!</li>
            <li>Really helps with dry mouth.</li>
            <li>the 4 packages being delayed, there is no expected delivery date.</li>
            <li>This tastes like the old Dentyne and the flavor lasts a long time...</li>

            <li> my dentist said finally your teeth look better after year of exasperation</li>
            <li> Some are hot while others are milder.</li>
            <li> Great taste and the dental advantages are unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Very tasty, but don&#x27;t eat too many, instant diarrhea!</li>
            <li> I love cinnamon,for dry mouth</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but the flavor doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I wish they didn&#x27;t dissolve quite so readily.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment.</li>
            <li> Low carb and gluten free.  </li>
            <li> REALLY?  </li>
            <li> Amazon, you really need to consider another source besides UPS.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s much to say about that.</li>
            <li> I really like these.  </li>
            <li> Also very poisonous to dogs.</li>
            <li> I really like these mints.</li>
            <li> They take more time to dissolve than other Xylitol based mints.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommended.  </li>
            <li> My new favorite - similar to red hots.</li>
            <li> but it at least stops my breath from kickin during long shifts when it&#x27;s easy to get a bit dehydrated and have stanky breath after not being able to brush all day.  </li>
            <li> I love these, they give just enough cinnamon flavor, and they last long enough to take away the sweet cravings, that can hit while dieting.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> WOW!  </li>
            <li> and these are the only mints that really increase saliva flow.  </li>
            <li> I only wish the price was lower, thanks</li>
            <li> They satisfy the need for a little sweet treat.</li>
            <li> My favorite flavor- so hard to find xylotol mints!</li>
            <li> Really helps with dry mouth.</li>
            <li> the 4 packages being delayed, there is no expected delivery date.</li>
            <li> This tastes like the old Dentyne and the flavor lasts a long time...</li>
            <li> They last a while too as long as you don&#x27;t chew them.</li>
            <li> some weird flavor in there besides cinnamon and the cinnamon isn&#x27;t that strong.</li>
            <li> Remember the tiny red &amp;#34;red hots&amp;#34; of your childhood that came in the little box?  </li>
            <li> I have severe dry mouth (also on O2, 24/7)</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended me this product cause I suffer from dry mouth which was causing tooth decay.  </li>
            <li> I bought these because my dentist wanted me to take them for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> Looking at the reviews, it seems that the two pack is $18.99 and this single was $8.64 -- which doesn&#x27;t even make sense!</li>
            <li> Flavoring on the cinnamon version of these mints is cinnamon as expected.</li>
            <li> They take only a few minutes to dissolve, also chewable.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon taste was not strong enough for my taste.</li>
            <li> Taste like little red hots but much less damaging to the teeth.</li>
            <li> If only these were less costly - I have trouble controlling myself around them, as I can&#x27;t help but eat 2-3 at a time.</li>
            <li> Xylitol is a sugar alcohol which tends to be bacteriostatic, and these relieve dry mouth problems as they slowly dissolve, without the tooth damage that regular sugar (sucrose) causes.</li>
            <li> Avoid other brands.</li>
            <li> /&gt;UPS says it is due to &#x27;inclement weather&#x27; as to the reason for the delays.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know about that one way or the other</li>
            <li> Have to have a mint in your mouth constantly to have it work on serious dry mouth</li>
            <li> No, not a total of 5 days, rather 5 days late.  </li>
            <li> The Cinnamon flavor is a little odd ...</li>
            <li> I usually pair these mints with the gum (which loses its flavor almost instantly) so that I can eat less.</li>
            <li> I suppose that $8.64 was too much to hope that it REALLY was a pack of 2 -- but I am VERY disappointed at the marketing allowed on this page</li>
            <li> and I dole out a few of these to each one, and with the confidence that since there&#x27;s no sugar, the kids won&#x27;t be bouncing off the walls.  </li>
            <li> Makes me feel good allowing my children to have without all the artificial crap in it.</li>
            <li> *supposedly* is beneficial for your teeth when you are not able to brush.  </li>
            <li> The texture is hard</li>
            <li> At the earliest, it will be 5 days LATE.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with these.  </li>
            <li> but I think it is a little expensive for what it is.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these &amp;#34;mints&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li> Too expensive.  </li>
            <li> It gets cold.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s crazy.  </li>
            <li> A bit disappointing.  </li>
            <li> Helps keep mouth from drying out so bad.  </li>
            <li> Maybe I got a bad batch.</li>
            <li> I like mint flavored gum but hate mint flavored breath &amp;#34;mints.&amp;#34;  </li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Great stuff, my dentist recommended this and I&#x27;ve tried this in his office. Great taste and the dental advantages are unbelievable!</li>
            <li> Good product but I think it is a little expensive for what it is.  I have to admit it&#x27;s delicious.</li>
            <li> Full cinnamon flavor.  Highly recommended.  Avoid other brands.</li>
            <li> Like very much.  Tasty.</li>
            <li> Great flavor and freshness, but not too overwhelming.  Leaves my mouth feeling cleaner especially after I&#x27;ve eaten something with a lot of sugar.</li>
            <li> Good mints for people suffering from TMJ. I can&#x27;t chew gum anymore and these mints are great after eating or just for freshening up your breath.</li>
            <li> On time and as advertised.</li>
            <li> These mints won&#x27;t rot your teeth.  In fact they promote dental health by fighting bacteria.  Great for anyone who has dry mouth</li>
            <li> I think it is better alternative than candies. I like the cinnamon taste and hopefully xylitol will protect my teeth</li>
            <li> This is a good product, but the flavor doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Excellent non sugar mint!</li>
            <li> These mints are so good that it is easy to eat too many. I have to set out a portion (10) to eat while I read. I wish they didn&#x27;t dissolve quite so readily. I usually pair these mints with the gum (which loses its flavor almost instantly) so that I can eat less.</li>
            <li> Great tasting. Nice cinnamin flavor. Smooth and freshens breath. Low price and you get a lot of mints. I recommend.</li>
            <li> Very tasty, but don&#x27;t eat too many, instant diarrhea!</li>
            <li> We love these mints and better for dental.</li>
            <li> Fast shipment. Love the cinnamon flavor and dentist approves.</li>
            <li> These have a really good flavor and work for me!</li>
            <li> These are very good. Excellent for people with fluid restrictive diets (dialysis patients), anyone with dry mouth from medications and those watching their sugar intake. We enjoy all of the flavors.</li>
            <li> I think these taste good - kind of like red hots.  They last a while too as long as you don&#x27;t chew them.</li>
            <li> Low carb and gluten free.  The texture is hard so you feel like you&#x27;re getting a treat.</li>
            <li> This tastes like the old Dentyne and the flavor lasts a long time...Plus it is good for your teeth!  what more could you want?</li>
            <li> Great tasting, and sugar free too.</li>
            <li> great tasting and so nice to think you are enjoying a refreshing sweet while doing a good thing for your teeth!</li>
            <li> Wow! These have a great cinnamon taste and like the Spry products, are easy to &#x27;stash&#x27; in my pocket to put in my mouth as I go through the days!  I will definitely order more!</li>
            <li> I love the taste of these cinnamon mintts. I enjoy the flavor of these mints as I am at work or studying. Besides the peppermint mints, these are a close second favorite all depending on which one I want to taste and feel at that time.</li>
            <li> While I absolutely LOVE the product, the information on the initial site is DECEPTIVE. It says a &amp;#34;Pack of 2&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;240&amp;#34; in a box next to it. But only one jar arrived. Looking at the reviews, it seems that the two pack is $18.99 and this single was $8.64 -- which doesn&#x27;t even make sense! I suppose that $8.64 was too much to hope that it REALLY was a pack of 2 -- but I am VERY disappointed at the marketing allowed on this page</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used various flavors of the Xlear mints -- lemon, berryblast, peppermint, and now cinnamon. They are all good and they are not harmful to your dental health. In fact, they are mildly beneficial.</li>
            <li> I love these mints.  Helps keep mouth from drying out so bad.  I have to use something all time to keep mouth moist.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve munched on Spry mints for years, but had never seen Cinnamon before.  My new favorite - similar to red hots.</li>
            <li> Kids come up to me at our congregation meetings and I dole out a few of these to each one, and with the confidence that since there&#x27;s no sugar, the kids won&#x27;t be bouncing off the walls.  This flavor has some kick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now… as to shipping. Congratulations on getting this to me in a timely way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rest of this post is not directed to this product or this seller, but to Amazon and UPS.  WHEN WILL YOU GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER???  I currently have FOUR packages delayed being shipped by UPS. Amazingly, some other packages being shipped by UPS have been delivered, most of them on time.  I&#x27;m a member of Amazon Prime and am supposed to get free delivery within 2 days. Hey, if it&#x27;s 3 days instead of 2, I never say a word. But 6, 8 or by the time things finally arrive, 10 days?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPS says it is due to &#x27;inclement weather&#x27; as to the reason for the delays. REALLY?  Here&#x27;s a news flash, UPS: It is winter. It gets cold. It often snows.  It does this each year. It is called a season.  So tell your drivers to put on hats and gloves and put chains on your tires and go do the job you are getting paid to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 4 packages being delayed, there is no expected delivery date. At the earliest, it will be 5 days LATE. No, not a total of 5 days, rather 5 days late.  Amazon, you really need to consider another source besides UPS.  Your drone idea made for a nice media splash, but with your money, why not start a competitor to UPS and FedEx?</li>
            <li> I like having a cinnamon mint that doesn&#x27;t have white sugar in it.  The cinnamon flavor is enjoyable.  I will be purchasing this product again.</li>
            <li> I like mint flavored gum but hate mint flavored breath &amp;#34;mints.&amp;#34;  These are a good substitute.  They taste quite good and xylitol *supposedly* is beneficial for your teeth when you are not able to brush.  I don&#x27;t know about that one way or the other but it at least stops my breath from kickin during long shifts when it&#x27;s easy to get a bit dehydrated and have stanky breath after not being able to brush all day.  The price on amazon is essentially the same price as my local dentist, too.</li>
            <li> Good buy for the price</li>
            <li> My favorite flavor- so hard to find xylotol mints!</li>
            <li> i enjoy the strong cinnamon taste they are delicious</li>
            <li> I have used these xylitol mints (favorites&#x3D;peppermint &amp; cinnamon) for several years.  I have severe dry mouth (also on O2, 24/7) and these are the only mints that really increase saliva flow.  Good flavors too.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m addicted to these &amp;#34;mints&amp;#34;.  This is a great supplier at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> If only these were less costly - I have trouble controlling myself around them, as I can&#x27;t help but eat 2-3 at a time. By comparison, these are like a more healthy version of red hots without all the dyes and sugar.</li>
            <li> Love the flavor, and the fact that these are not sweetened with aspartame or sucralose.</li>
            <li> Love these. Would buy again! Has a nice cinnamon flavor. Not overly strong or &amp;#34;Atomic Fireball&amp;#34; kinda hot.</li>
            <li> excellent mints, great flavor and good for the teeth.  You can&#x27;t get much better then that!</li>
            <li> I love these, they give just enough cinnamon flavor, and they last long enough to take away the sweet cravings, that can hit while dieting.</li>
            <li> Was looking for a good sugar free mint and these taste great.  Will definitely keep these on hand.</li>
            <li> Love the toothpaste? These mints are awesome and will fight cavities.  Just the right amount of flavor.</li>
            <li> These are so good.  They have a burst of flavor at the end of each piece.  I have then in lemon and berry, but the cinnamon is the best.</li>
            <li> Ithought I was ordering the gum. Not your falt.</li>
            <li> Great stuff! Really helps with dry mouth. Recommended by my hygienist.</li>
            <li> Love these and I continue to buy!  I cannot have Soy and most mints and gum have soy.  I also buy the toothpaste.</li>
            <li> Always like cinnamon mints, but not always able to find the sugar free cinnamon variety locally. I only wish the price was lower, thanks</li>
            <li> These are good.  I like the fact that they are sugar free.  There are a bit overpowering.</li>
            <li> Moistens mouth without water, great for long car trips.</li>
            <li> Flavoring on the cinnamon version of these mints is cinnamon as expected. Don&#x27;t know that there&#x27;s much to say about that. The most difficulty I have with these mints is stopping myself from chomping on them like candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hard shell of the mints and container they come in travels well, though not the most convenient size to fit in your pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0.5g xylitol per piece which is what makes these attractive in the first place, with the associated dental benefits.</li>
            <li> The cinnamon taste was not strong enough for my taste. I had to use 3 at&lt;br /&gt;A time in order to get enough cinnamon taste!</li>
            <li> Great gum. Makes me feel good allowing my children to have without all the artificial crap in it. Will always buy.</li>
            <li> These are more candy than mint. Mild mint flavor and I find myself shoving multiples in my mouth at a time. I would rather have a more concentrated mint flavor than cinnamon candies.</li>
            <li> Great mints, very pronounced cinnamon flavour</li>
            <li> These little mints are excellent!  I enjoy both the cinnamon and the berry!  They have a great flavor and help calm my sweet tooth.</li>
            <li> I really like these.  They satisfy the need for a little sweet treat.</li>
            <li> Great flavor and lots of mints.  Great value!</li>
            <li> I am loving these Spry products!  This one is no exception! Delicious!  I put one in my mouth and the first word that came to mind was &amp;#34;WOW!&amp;#34; I have a new favorite mint.  I am keeping one on my desk at work, one in my car and one on my nightstand.  The fact that they won&#x27;t damage my teeth but actually help!  WOW!  Love these!  More please! They are the perfect amount of spice.  Not too hot. Nice and mild.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not buying it anymore.  Too expensive.  That&#x27;s all.  I haven&#x27;t even tried them, but they cost more than most other breath mints.  What&#x27;s this almost  5 cents for ONE mint?  It&#x27;s crazy.  And it&#x27;s from China.  Maybe I&#x27;ll just start sucking on cloves or something.</li>
            <li> If you know what xylitol is, then you understand that these little candies are good for your teeth.  The berry blast flavor is my favorite.  I also have two containers of the cinnamon which is also quite good, with a very intense cinnamon flavor and also they are crispier than the berry flavor.  I always have some of each on hand.</li>
            <li> Huge amount of mints.  Great quality and sooo much better than the gum of the same brand.  I recommend these over the gum.</li>
            <li> I like this product because it is good for you as well as tasting good, it freshens breath very well.</li>
            <li> my dentist said finally your teeth look better after year of exasperation&lt;br /&gt;I prefer mints but gum last me longer I eat the mints to fast&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it</li>
            <li> I pop one of these after meals or snacks to help prevent tooth decay. The Cinnamon flavor is a little odd ... some weird flavor in there besides cinnamon and the cinnamon isn&#x27;t that strong. Maybe I got a bad batch. I buy this brand of gum though and it&#x27;s great!</li>
            <li> These were the only mints I could use on my weight loss, and they are definitely delicious, takes the sugar craving away and not bad on your teeth.  Seller was prompt an good customer service.</li>
            <li> Made my tongue sore. Also very poisonous to dogs.</li>
            <li> deliciously spicy hot</li>
            <li> Love these treats!!  Taste like little red hots but much less damaging to the teeth.</li>
            <li> handy to carry, big portions for the money, will order more when I finish with this bottle, like the flavor</li>
            <li> If your answer is yes, you will like Spry cinnamon mints.  They are white and pea-sized.  They take only a few minutes to dissolve, also chewable.</li>
            <li> Wife learned of these mints from our dentists, who loved the cinnamon flavor and got them on Amazon.  After searching the local stores and trying different flavors, we ordered from Amazon.  This is the best price (period) and the only place we could find cinnamon (which, in wife&#x27;s opinion, is the best)</li>
            <li> I love spry mints! I like this cinnamon  flavor because it&#x27;s not too strong. Good price on here compared to my local health food store.</li>
            <li> We have purchased this gum before and found it great to give to our grandchildren as a treat.</li>
            <li> I really like these mints. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because the strength has been inconsistent with subsequent orders. Some are hot while others are milder.</li>
            <li> Not thrilled with these.  Have to have a mint in your mouth constantly to have it work on serious dry mouth</li>
            <li> These taste great, and are very reasonably priced. Xylitol is a sugar alcohol which tends to be bacteriostatic, and these relieve dry mouth problems as they slowly dissolve, without the tooth damage that regular sugar (sucrose) causes.</li>
            <li> These mints rock! They taste great, last a while &amp; help with bad breath or are great for a sweet treat!</li>
            <li> My dentist recommended me this product cause I suffer from dry mouth which was causing tooth decay.  Very happy with nthe selection of different flavors.  They are all great.</li>
            <li> These mints are perfect for decay prevention as they reduce plaque buildup.</li>
            <li> Remember the tiny red &amp;#34;red hots&amp;#34; of your childhood that came in the little box?  These taste just like them and are addictive!</li>
            <li> As soon as the coating melts, these dissolve.  They take more time to dissolve than other Xylitol based mints.  But they&#x27;re nothing like a regular mint.  A bit disappointing.  I bought these because my dentist wanted me to take them for dry mouth.</li>
            <li> and the tangy, bite to it.  Also helps to keep my mouth moist.  If you resist to chew, it can last up to 15 minutes</li>
            <li> I think these are better than the peppermint flavor.  Our dentist recommended that we buy these because of the xylitol.</li>
            <li> I love cinnamon,for dry mouth</li>
            <li> Love them. They taste great and stop the dry mouth syndrome.</li>
            <li> I like the taste and texture</li>
            <li> Very good if you don&#x27;t mind the intensity and free of the titanium oxide found in the gum. This is a keeper.</li>
