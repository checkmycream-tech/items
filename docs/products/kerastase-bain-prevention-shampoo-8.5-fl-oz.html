    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was recommended this great brand anti dandruff shampoo at one of the Gene Juarez salons.</li>
            <li>My hair has been falling out a lot, I&#x27;ve tried many products, and they haven&#x27;t worked, I decided to try this one because of the reviews I read, and it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li>and he said that it  is good.</li>
            <li>So Kerastase is good but for now I feel Vichy is the more superior product .</li>
            <li>Kerastase is really great for strengthening hair strands but Vichy is amazing for strengthening the scalp and reducing hair fallout but it&#x27;s too early to tell if it stimulates hair growth.</li>
            <li>but my scalp and follicles seem to love this.</li>
            <li>Many people have had succes with this</li>
            <li>I love this shampoo</li>
            <li>I think this gives more strength and volume to my hair</li>
            <li>I loved Wen shampoo but suffered a bout of falling hair recently for unknown reasons and decided to spend the money on this, knowing it was an excellent brand.</li>
            <li>if those three things are important for you, go for this shampoo.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth the steep price to me.</li>
            <li>I need to use my regular conditioner plus a light leave in conditioner to comb my hair easily.</li>
            <li>My huge new bottle of Wen sits unused.</li>
            <li>I now adore this much more even than Wen for the way it leaves my hair, and the herbal smell, similar to Herbal Essence.</li>
            <li>I have several Kerastace hair products and love them all.</li>
            <li>A small quantity is good enough.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
            <li>The one thing I can say for certain is that is really tangles my hair.</li>
            <li>: I believe the Wen shampoo was responsible for the hair loss.</li>
            <li>I really like this product since I am thinning</li>
            <li>After a few purchases,  they stopped carrying the specifique kind anymore.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say for sure if this helped my hair grow any faster as I also take supplements and use other hair products.  </li>
            <li>I have long,  fine hair.</li>
            <li>but I gave it 3 stars because just recently I tried the Vichy Aminexil Shampoo and that really has made a difference .</li>
            <li>This shampoo fixed it in a 3-4 weeks.</li>
            <li>So I compared the new shipment shampoo to the old one (I just got done with my last bottle before this new purchase), and I noticed the print on the back of the new shipment was different then old one.</li>
            <li>star because the item in general is a bit pricey for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Also my hair is not as soft and silky as it was prior to using this shampoo.</li>
            <li>i like this shampoo for many reasons - i&#x27;ll start out by saying that it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, doesn&#x27;t have a weird fruity smell and does keep your hair hydrated and clean at the same time.</li>

    <ol>
            <li> A friend recommended this product cause worked for her husband... and it&#x27;s working for my hubby too.  Every morning I used to see a lot of his hair in the pillow... not anymore!  I will recommend this product!</li>
            <li> I loved Wen shampoo but suffered a bout of falling hair recently for unknown reasons and decided to spend the money on this, knowing it was an excellent brand. I now adore this much more even than Wen for the way it leaves my hair, and the herbal smell, similar to Herbal Essence. It does indeed stop the hair loss. I wouldn&#x27;t have believed a shampoo could do this but my scalp and follicles seem to love this. It&#x27;s worth the steep price to me. I have several Kerastace hair products and love them all. Nothing compares to the way my hair responds to this brand in terms of shine, texture, and body. My huge new bottle of Wen sits unused. If you have a falling hair problem give this a try. Many people have had succes with this I have heard.&lt;br /&gt;edit: I believe the Wen shampoo was responsible for the hair loss. It stopped when I stopped using it and I have heard others say the same thing. Some people may react badly to the&lt;br /&gt;menthol and various oils and plant essences in it.</li>
            <li> I love this shampoo but I gave it 3 stars because just recently I tried the Vichy Aminexil Shampoo and that really has made a difference . So I will be interchanging between  both products . Kerastase is really great for strengthening hair strands but Vichy is amazing for strengthening the scalp and reducing hair fallout but it&#x27;s too early to tell if it stimulates hair growth. So Kerastase is good but for now I feel Vichy is the more superior product .</li>
            <li> I had bad dandruff problem. This shampoo fixed it in a 3-4 weeks. A small quantity is good enough.&lt;br /&gt;4 star because the item in general is a bit pricey for the size of the bottle.</li>
            <li> My hair has been coming out in groups. After using this shampoo my hair stays cleaner longer and the fallout has slowed. I haven&#x27;t grown hair back, but ding fewer hairs in the sink. After all I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few months.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say for sure if this helped my hair grow any faster as I also take supplements and use other hair products.  The one thing I can say for certain is that is really tangles my hair. I need to use my regular conditioner plus a light leave in conditioner to comb my hair easily. I have long,  fine hair. Also my hair is not as soft and silky as it was prior to using this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I would recommend to all my friends to use this shampoo, it works for me! I was losing a lot of hair when used the regular shampoo that one get in the grocery.</li>
            <li> cons:&lt;br /&gt;- very drying on your hair!&lt;br /&gt;- hard to wash out&lt;br /&gt;- complete waste of money</li>
            <li> My hair has been falling out a lot, I&#x27;ve tried many products, and they haven&#x27;t worked, I decided to try this one because of the reviews I read, and it&#x27;s working great!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kerastase Bain Prevention Shampoo for almost 10 years. I&#x27;m not sure what happened this time, the shampoo doesn&#x27;t seem same as the one I used before. It has smell to it. It has scent like apple and also feels different after I rinse it off with water. So I compared the new shipment shampoo to the old one (I just got done with my last bottle before this new purchase), and I noticed the print on the back of the new shipment was different then old one. Can anyone tell me if anyone else experience the same? I noticed the difference in scent as soon as I put it on my hair and saw the print of the shampoo bottle back was different then what I used before.... I hope i did not get faked one....</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He is using since 3 months ago  and he said that it  is good.</li>
            <li> i like this shampoo for many reasons - i&#x27;ll start out by saying that it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down, doesn&#x27;t have a weird fruity smell and does keep your hair hydrated and clean at the same time. if those three things are important for you, go for this shampoo.</li>
            <li> I was recommended this great brand anti dandruff shampoo at one of the Gene Juarez salons. After a few purchases,  they stopped carrying the specifique kind anymore. After several searches I saw that Amazon had some. I ordered it and when I recieved/used it realized it was not the sameone.</li>
            <li> I really like this product since I am thinning I think this gives more strength and volume to my hair</li>
