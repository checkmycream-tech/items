    <ol>
            <li>It is a great addition to my collection!</li>
            <li>However, it still looks great!</li>
            <li>Perfect teal for summer!</li>
            <li>Perhaps a bit darker than I imagined with the picture but nonetheless a beautiful aquamarine teal shade that I can&#x27;t wait to wear to the beach this summer.</li>
            <li>Essie has wonderful staying power, and I also own the Sunday Funday which is also beautiful.  </li>
            <li>And it looks great with my Polish-skin.</li>
            <li>a great brand it suck on that part...</li>

            <li>LOVE this color, which is a funky teal color.  </li>
            <li>I would&#x27;ve given this 5 stars because I love Essie nail polish, however, I ordered this expecting it to be a turquoise type color (as pictured.)  </li>

            <li>Love the color...and all Essie products...</li>

            <li>The color is very nice and is just like it looks the only thing the</li>
            <li>worth the money vs in store here paying 8-10 a bottle!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so much fun!</li>
            <li>i love this color very much it is super pretty</li>
            <li>but the only thing is it chipped very easily even with 2 coats of a top coat</li>
            <li>it is true to its pictre and totraly</li>
            <li>The color is way darker in real life, however I still fell in love with it.</li>
            <li>I love this color from Essie, I really do.</li>
            <li>It only took two coats as opposed to three, and the sparkles really hit the light and look nice outside or in bright light.</li>
            <li>It really is a fun color</li>
            <li>After searching 3 other stores with this color sold out, I came home and ordered it on Amazon (should of known better) :).  </li>
            <li>I do wish that essie products were less expensive, but their colors are great and the quality of the paint is very good.</li>
            <li>Might pull this color back out again around Easter. :)</li>
            <li>Upon receiving the item I realized it&#x27;s a MUCH greener product and not at all turquoise.  </li>
            <li>You really can not see from the photo, but there is just the slightest bit of shimmer in the Summer collection.  </li>
            <li>You can really see the sparkle if you look at the bottle.</li>
            <li>but it really isn&#x27;t for me.  </li>
            <li>this color was a little green-er than I expected...still love it, it has a hint of sparkle to it.</li>
            <li>Love the color - it has a little sparkle in it.  </li>
            <li>The color is NOT a pale vibrant color such as pictured either.</li>
            <li>The sparkles are subtle but lovely.</li>
            <li>too see through, other ways really pretty color</li>
            <li>Much cheaper than the drugstore or other online shopping sites!</li>

            <li> It is much darker, used it once and was not pleased.</li>
            <li> it also has small glitter specks if you look really close.</li>
            <li> Very creamy, with a small hint of sparkle.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a big essie fan and this is one of the few shades they have where there is shimmer in the bottle that actually translates to the nails.</li>
            <li> The color is a little deeper than I thought it would be based on magazine advertisements, but I am a big fan of naughty nautical.  </li>
            <li> I will say that it is greener than I expected - based upon the picture as well as photos I&#x27;ve seen in magazines, I was expecting a bluer, slightly lighter color.</li>
            <li> that shows the true ugly color</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very dark color.</li>
            <li> I was a little disappointed, but now I know next time to try to find it in a store</li>
            <li> I have never experienced nothing like that....</li>
            <li> Next time I&#x27;ll just put base coat..</li>
            <li> For the price of this polish, it was SO THIN!!!</li>

            <li> this color was a little green-er than I expected...still love it, it has a hint of sparkle to it. And it looks great with my Polish-skin. Also, shipped faster than anything I&#x27;ve ever bought before!</li>
            <li> The color is very nice and is just like it looks the only thing the I didn&#x27;t like was that it stain my nails.... I have never experienced nothing like that.... Especially being Essie a great brand it suck on that part... Next time I&#x27;ll just put base coat..</li>
            <li> Just received my polish today and the color is so pretty, not sure how it will look on but can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
            <li> I wanted more of a fun aqua but it is acually a poopy blue! I think you need i picture on here that shows the true ugly color</li>
            <li> I thought this color was going to be a lot brighter than what I received. It&#x27;s a very dark color. It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
            <li> LOVE this color, which is a funky teal color.  It really is a fun color and it is sparkly, which I like.</li>
            <li> i love this color very much it is super pretty but the only thing is it chipped very easily even with 2 coats of a top coat</li>

Upon receiving the item I realized it&#x27;s a MUCH greener product and not at all turquoise.  I was a little disappointed, but now I know next time to try to find it in a store so I can see it in person.</li>
            <li> I love this color and the package arrived quickly! It is a great addition to my collection! I would recommend this color for summer</li>
            <li> The color is a little deeper than I thought it would be based on magazine advertisements, but I am a big fan of naughty nautical.  It&#x27;s so much fun!</li>

            <li> For the price of this polish, it was SO THIN!!! The color is NOT a pale vibrant color such as pictured either. It is much darker, used it once and was not pleased. Wont purchase or recommend.</li>
            <li> Love the color...and all Essie products...high quality and great colors. Good price...better than in the stores.  I always check Amazon for my Essie.</li>
            <li> Perhaps a bit darker than I imagined with the picture but nonetheless a beautiful aquamarine teal shade that I can&#x27;t wait to wear to the beach this summer. The sparkles are subtle but lovely. I feel like Sailor Neptune would approve of this shade.</li>
            <li> The color is way darker in real life, however I still fell in love with it. it also has small glitter specks if you look really close.</li>

You really can not see from the photo, but there is just the slightest bit of shimmer in the Summer collection.  Love them!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely gorgeous color for the summer, I wore it all throughout the summer on my hands and toes. Very creamy, with a small hint of sparkle. You can really see the sparkle if you look at the bottle. Might pull this color back out again around Easter. :)</li>
            <li> I thought I would enjoy this color more but it really isn&#x27;t for me.  It is a great product and wears well.  I love the name as well.</li>
