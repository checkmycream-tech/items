            <li>I&#x27;am in love with this product &#x27; buy it again</li>
            <li>Fantastic product!</li>
            <li>SO much more convenient than the snap off glass ones they used before.</li>
            <li>I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li>I have been using this product for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li>My hair always look healthy and shinny.</li>
            <li>I am so glad this package has so many vials in it because I hope to never run out of this product.  </li>
            <li>I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li>My hair feels and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li>Love it.</li>
            <li>fast result just use after shampoo during shower, what it&#x27;s great when i don&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li>My hair is in better condition than ever.</li>
            <li>Love this product will reorder.</li>
            <li>its never looked better now</li>
            <li>it works better if I leave it on my hair</li>
            <li>Be sure to leave it on for at 30 mins before you rinse it off.</li>
            <li>However, I prefer the mix I suggested because it can penetrate the hair much better, and it will act longer.</li>
            <li>I love this product.</li>
            <li>Can someone let me know some tips please:-)</li>
            <li>--my hair is just better with this conditioner.</li>
            <li>This product is very nice, leaves your hair really silky.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li>This is the best thing you could use when your hair is dry...</li>
            <li>As happy as that made me, after a couple of weeks of using this, 2x per week maximum (mixed with conditioner), I noticed that in the box is also a dropper that somehow screws to the top of the glass bottles.</li>
            <li>My hair is easy to comb and shine</li>
            <li>.my hair look shine and strong.</li>
            <li>Makes my hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>fabulous, I use it every time I wash my hair.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t help detangle, doesn&#x27;t smooth, didn&#x27;t help to strenghten, etc.</li>
            <li>The price is fabulous.</li>
            <li>I love how my hair feels and looks right after using it.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking to have shiney healthy hair!</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a strong smells, but not bad.</li>
            <li>I was very upset when I could not find it in the shop any more - luckily there&#x27;s Amazon :).</li>
            <li>I love it from the first used its make my hair light and bouncy</li>
            <li>great stuff, my hair is long</li>
            <li>use it for a special treatment twice a month.</li>
            <li>It is a great product and makes my hair look smooth again, It does not weigh your hair down at all.</li>
            <li>This product is by far the best I have used for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair gets smooth and shiny right away.</li>
            <li>the have are pretty strong smell.</li>
            <li>Same or maybe better quality than Kerastase oil ,must  try it :)</li>
            <li>but it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li>i Love the smell, and i love the way my hair looks after using this product and blow dry and the next day still looking good.</li>
            <li>Simply... I love it!</li>
            <li>I also like the heat released when being placed onto the scalp and hair, great spa product for everyday maintenance.</li>
            <li>it made my hair so soft easly to comb, my hair look healthy and shine.</li>
            <li>This made me smile as I did not see a mention about the box having a dropper measurement in the box and it works so well.</li>
            <li>Worth any penny.</li>
            <li>THIS PRODUCT LEAVES MY HAIR SHINY, SOFT, AND HEALTHY.</li>
            <li>I use  a vial about every 2 weeks and this is just right for me</li>
            <li>but i really recommend it specially if you dont wanna cut your ends that often but keep your hair healty and shinny</li>
            <li>I love AlfaParf in general and this product very much.</li>
            <li>The product leaves your hair silky smooth, and makes rough course hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li>I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li>When my hair show signs of dullness, I use this product and the results are consistent each and every time.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser gave me my first vial</li>
            <li>My hair is soft, shinier, damage free after all.</li>
            <li>Used it the first time in my salon, and have never used another product besides AlfaParf (shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner).</li>
            <li>and my hair is so soft and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m so glad they finally changed the vials for a safer one.</li>
            <li>This is an exceptionally fine hair product that really super conditions dry damaged hair.  </li>
            <li>therefore it has become more dry that it already was.</li>
            <li>After I use it, my hair is softer, less frizzy and smells nice.</li>
            <li>My hairdresser used this on me when she noticed how dry my hair had become and almost instantly, my hair was transformed into healthy, silky smooth hair.  </li>
            <li>None of them really worked well for my damaged hair except this blue fantastic oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think this real product.</li>
            <li>This product will make your hair very shiny.</li>
            <li>Also if you color your hair, it will strip your hair of color much faster.</li>
            <li>far!I mix it with the Alfaparf Rigen real cream</li>
            <li>I also bought the Real shampoo plus Real conditioner,</li>
            <li>and we know highlight really beat you hair up.</li>
            <li>Thanks.</li>
            <li>Thanks to Amazon and the seller.</li>
            <li>This product definitely makes the hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li>I really like it.</li>
            <li>Can I put the whole bottle and leave it in my hair or should I rinse it out ?</li>
            <li>After the first time that I used my hair was soft and shinny, definitively I recomended it.</li>
            <li>And the new bottles are plastic with screw on tops!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>Only use half a vial at a time and usually only when going to a special occasion cause it is kind of pricey.  </li>
            <li>Leave your hair soft, manageable and shiny!!</li>
            <li>but when I use this product the texture becomes silky soft and very manageable..</li>
            <li>It smells good and it made my hair silky smooth and shiny; as if it had undergone an expensive deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li>Smells really good, not sure yet if it did anthing essential to the growth and strength of my hair.</li>
            <li>Do like I did don&#x27;t waste any more money and just try it.</li>
            <li>I rub the mask all over my hair, wrap a warm towel around it and just let it sit for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Cant live without it.  </li>
            <li>and I live in South Florida, so</li>
            <li>You use it after shampoo, leave in your wet hair for at least 7 minutes or longer if  you can, and your hair will feel, smell and look great.  </li>
            <li>Try the white and pink leave-in vials also - they add softness and a lovely scent that lingers for hours.</li>
            <li>Alfa Parf makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li>youre hair shiny and soft!</li>
            <li>I used to dye it red, then I went back to blonde - think bleach, more bleach, toners, beach (sun), peroxide, etc.</li>
            <li>This product is amazing if you have dry hair due to constant chemical treatments, or blow drying.  </li>
            <li>So all I&#x27;m saying is that these liquid oil blue shots really do work on your hair,leaves it soft, shiny, and bouncy.</li>
            <li>My hair feels soft and shiny after I use it.  </li>
            <li>But, I haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately.</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Although, if you have naturally curly and frizzy hair, you will probably still need to use  serum afterwards to thwart away the frizzies.</li>
            <li>It makes my hair soft and my hair was noticeably stronger after just one use...</li>
            <li>Five minutes... and hair feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li>Makes it soft, silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li>This made my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li>It feels soft and shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have highlights; I blow dry and iron my hair every day, no need to say that my hair was becoming very dry.</li>
            <li>I should mention that I apply a small amount to my hair before blowing it dry and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product, especially purchased in a case using the dropper.</li>
            <li>but I believe its worth it!My hair was so dull, burned, super dry and frizzy</li>
            <li>But other then that they really do work!</li>
            <li>it is hard to keep my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li>However, be careful and don&#x27;t use this product very often.</li>
            <li>I felt a different effect, I am not sure that this product is 100% the original product Alfa Parf put on the market....</li>
            <li>For a long time I waste my money on hair products trying hair masks, hair conditioner, anyway all kind of hair products that would tame my hair</li>
            <li>aand complete dry hair  </li>
            <li>i got this because of my hair was really weak and dry and pale but now my hair is healthy as a horse and very shiny</li>

            <li> I&#x27;am in love with this product &#x27; buy it again</li>
            <li> Fantastic product!</li>
            <li> SO much more convenient than the snap off glass ones they used before.</li>
            <li> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 10 years.</li>
            <li> My hair always look healthy and shinny.</li>
            <li> I am so glad this package has so many vials in it because I hope to never run out of this product.  </li>
            <li> I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> My hair feels and looks healthy.  </li>
            <li> Love it.</li>
            <li> fast result just use after shampoo during shower, what it&#x27;s great when i don&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li> My hair is in better condition than ever.</li>
            <li> Love this product will reorder.</li>
            <li> its never looked better now</li>
            <li> it works better if I leave it on my hair</li>
            <li> Be sure to leave it on for at 30 mins before you rinse it off.</li>
            <li> However, I prefer the mix I suggested because it can penetrate the hair much better, and it will act longer.</li>
            <li> I love this product.</li>
            <li> Can someone let me know some tips please:-)</li>
            <li> --my hair is just better with this conditioner.</li>

            <li> Fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> This is the best thing you could use when your hair is dry...</li>
            <li> As happy as that made me, after a couple of weeks of using this, 2x per week maximum (mixed with conditioner), I noticed that in the box is also a dropper that somehow screws to the top of the glass bottles.</li>

            <li> I love it from the first used its make my hair light and bouncy</li>
            <li> great stuff, my hair is long</li>
            <li> use it for a special treatment twice a month.</li>
            <li> It is a great product and makes my hair look smooth again, It does not weigh your hair down at all.</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best I have used for my dry hair.  </li>
            <li> My hair gets smooth and shiny right away.</li>
            <li> the have are pretty strong smell.</li>
            <li> Same or maybe better quality than Kerastase oil ,must  try it :)</li>
            <li> but it wears off quickly.</li>
            <li> i Love the smell, and i love the way my hair looks after using this product and blow dry and the next day still looking good.</li>
            <li> Simply... I love it!</li>
            <li> I also like the heat released when being placed onto the scalp and hair, great spa product for everyday maintenance.</li>
            <li> it made my hair so soft easly to comb, my hair look healthy and shine.</li>
            <li> This made me smile as I did not see a mention about the box having a dropper measurement in the box and it works so well.</li>
            <li> Worth any penny.</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT LEAVES MY HAIR SHINY, SOFT, AND HEALTHY.</li>
            <li> I use  a vial about every 2 weeks and this is just right for me</li>
            <li> but i really recommend it specially if you dont wanna cut your ends that often but keep your hair healty and shinny</li>
            <li> I love AlfaParf in general and this product very much.</li>
            <li> The product leaves your hair silky smooth, and makes rough course hair more manageable.  </li>
            <li> I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at such a reasonable price.  </li>
            <li> When my hair show signs of dullness, I use this product and the results are consistent each and every time.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser gave me my first vial</li>
            <li> My hair is soft, shinier, damage free after all.</li>
            <li> Used it the first time in my salon, and have never used another product besides AlfaParf (shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner).</li>
            <li> and my hair is so soft and silky smooth.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad they finally changed the vials for a safer one.</li>
            <li> This is an exceptionally fine hair product that really super conditions dry damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> therefore it has become more dry that it already was.</li>
            <li> After I use it, my hair is softer, less frizzy and smells nice.</li>
            <li> My hairdresser used this on me when she noticed how dry my hair had become and almost instantly, my hair was transformed into healthy, silky smooth hair.  </li>
            <li> None of them really worked well for my damaged hair except this blue fantastic oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t think this real product.</li>
            <li> This product will make your hair very shiny.</li>
            <li> Also if you color your hair, it will strip your hair of color much faster.</li>
            <li> far!I mix it with the Alfaparf Rigen real cream</li>
            <li> I also bought the Real shampoo plus Real conditioner,</li>
            <li> and we know highlight really beat you hair up.</li>
            <li> Thanks.</li>
            <li> Thanks to Amazon and the seller.</li>
            <li> This product definitely makes the hair silky and smooth.  </li>
            <li> I really like it.</li>
            <li> Can I put the whole bottle and leave it in my hair or should I rinse it out ?</li>
            <li> After the first time that I used my hair was soft and shinny, definitively I recomended it.</li>
            <li> And the new bottles are plastic with screw on tops!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> Only use half a vial at a time and usually only when going to a special occasion cause it is kind of pricey.  </li>
            <li> Leave your hair soft, manageable and shiny!!</li>
            <li> but when I use this product the texture becomes silky soft and very manageable..</li>
            <li> It smells good and it made my hair silky smooth and shiny; as if it had undergone an expensive deep conditioning treatment.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, not sure yet if it did anthing essential to the growth and strength of my hair.</li>
            <li> Do like I did don&#x27;t waste any more money and just try it.</li>
            <li> I rub the mask all over my hair, wrap a warm towel around it and just let it sit for at least 20 minutes.</li>
            <li> Cant live without it.  </li>
            <li> and I live in South Florida, so</li>
            <li> You use it after shampoo, leave in your wet hair for at least 7 minutes or longer if  you can, and your hair will feel, smell and look great.  </li>
            <li> Try the white and pink leave-in vials also - they add softness and a lovely scent that lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> Alfa Parf makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> youre hair shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> I used to dye it red, then I went back to blonde - think bleach, more bleach, toners, beach (sun), peroxide, etc.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing if you have dry hair due to constant chemical treatments, or blow drying.  </li>
            <li> So all I&#x27;m saying is that these liquid oil blue shots really do work on your hair,leaves it soft, shiny, and bouncy.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and shiny after I use it.  </li>
            <li> But, I haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately.</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Although, if you have naturally curly and frizzy hair, you will probably still need to use  serum afterwards to thwart away the frizzies.</li>
            <li> It makes my hair soft and my hair was noticeably stronger after just one use...</li>
            <li> Five minutes... and hair feels soft and silky.</li>
            <li> Makes it soft, silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  </li>
            <li> This made my hair shiny and soft.  </li>
            <li> It feels soft and shine.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have highlights; I blow dry and iron my hair every day, no need to say that my hair was becoming very dry.</li>
            <li> I should mention that I apply a small amount to my hair before blowing it dry and the results are amazing.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product, especially purchased in a case using the dropper.</li>
            <li> but I believe its worth it!My hair was so dull, burned, super dry and frizzy</li>
            <li> But other then that they really do work!</li>
            <li> it is hard to keep my hair shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> However, be careful and don&#x27;t use this product very often.</li>
            <li> I felt a different effect, I am not sure that this product is 100% the original product Alfa Parf put on the market....</li>
            <li> For a long time I waste my money on hair products trying hair masks, hair conditioner, anyway all kind of hair products that would tame my hair</li>
            <li> aand complete dry hair  </li>
            <li> i got this because of my hair was really weak and dry and pale but now my hair is healthy as a horse and very shiny</li>
            <li> This is what you need if your hair is drying because of coloring, flat iron, etc.</li>
            <li> Leaves hair soft and silky without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> if you decide to go natural with your hair no more perm, you definitely will needs this!</li>
            <li> My hair is so soft, silky, and fluffy.</li>
            <li> know other people use these ampoules as a final rinse to their hair.</li>
            <li> wash my hair and towel dry for about 5-10 minutes then apply this oil throughout my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Then</li>
            <li> i have wave dry hair.</li>
            <li> Also, sometimes when I am not heating it up in the sauna, I put it in my hair after washing and let it dry and then rinse out in the morning</li>
            <li> I have been dyeing my deep black hair to medium brown color for 5 years.</li>
            <li> I use half of the vial 1x per week mixed with conditioner.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought or expected.</li>
            <li> I applied to my wet hair with the conditioner in.  </li>
            <li> I use it in combination with the pink vial.</li>
            <li> I tried this product and the pink AlfaParf</li>
            <li> I recently ran out and had to wait a few weeks before I ordered the next round</li>
            <li> Due to frequent coloring, my hair is very dry and dull.</li>
            <li> Wish it came in something other than a glass vial tho.</li>
            <li> I have tried to use other leave ins before, but I&#x27;ve just preferred this one.</li>
            <li> You will see how your hair will become dry and brittle a little bit after using it.</li>
            <li> Curly hair is so difficult to get shiny but this product really works.</li>
            <li> You buy, use a little each time you want and it lasts forever.</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years at the suggestion of my stylist.</li>
            <li> his by a few people saying it will help hair loss and shine but didnt see anything</li>
            <li> Waste of money...</li>
            <li> I have used this product for the past 2 years - it leaves my hair healty and shiny.</li>
            <li> Usually, the product arrives with a glass vial tube, however, this case arrived with a twist off cap for each mini-bottle.</li>
            <li> so I usually use two bottles per use-</li>
            <li> i put the liquid in a small pray bottle</li>
            <li> :S</li>
            <li> It is a treatment for those days when your hair is so damaged, that it is even hard to brush</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy tending to frizzy on occasion...</li>
            <li> thats how bad it was!!I have long wavy hair down to my bottom</li>
            <li> This is what always saves it from serious damage.</li>
            <li> and I was always disappointed until I decided to try these little lotion.</li>
            <li> Used it religiously, even though the florally smell was terrible, but never saw any improvement.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of crazy chemical process on my hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was badly damaged from bleaching and coloring, and my stylist recommended this product, so I went for it.</li>

            <li> I love this product!! I have been dyeing my deep black hair to medium brown color for 5 years. I re-color my hair in every 2-3 months ( I have the roots!!) Due to frequent coloring, my hair is very dry and dull. I&#x27;ve tried many hair mask, argan oils, hot-oil treatment. None of them really worked well for my damaged hair except this blue fantastic oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my hair and towel dry for about 5-10 minutes then apply this oil throughout my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Then, I put steam towel then wait for about 30 minutes before rinse the product.&lt;br /&gt;It works like charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommended it to my friends and all of them like it! I highly recommend it.</li>

            <li> I have used this product for the past 2 years - it leaves my hair healty and shiny. I simpy love it. I was very upset when I could not find it in the shop any more - luckily there&#x27;s Amazon :). And I got a shampoo for free as well as a gift :D</li>
            <li> This product will make your hair very shiny. I love how my hair feels and looks right after using it. However, be careful and don&#x27;t use this product very often. You will see how your hair will become dry and brittle a little bit after using it. Also if you color your hair, it will strip your hair of color much faster. Therefore, this product is great, but afterwards you pay the price.</li>

            <li> So, i purchased the iluminating oil shots about 2 weeks ago, my hair is recuperating so far!I mix it with the Alfaparf Rigen real cream and I leave on for 1 to 2 hrs and wash out.I also bought the Real shampoo plus Real conditioner,Its better if you use all the products.Its pricey but I believe its worth it!My hair was so dull, burned, super dry and frizzy it wouldn&#x27;t even bounce thats how bad it was!!I have long wavy hair down to my bottom, I get Now alot of compliments on my hair, I do highligths almost every 3 to 4 months and we know highlight really beat you hair up.So all I&#x27;m saying is that these liquid oil blue shots really do work on your hair,leaves it soft, shiny, and bouncy.The only thing I do not like is the smell of the liquid shots, to me the have are pretty strong smell.But other then that they really do work!</li>
            <li> I have been using this for a few years at the suggestion of my stylist. When my hair show signs of dullness, I use this product and the results are consistent each and every time. Try it once and you will be a fan for life.</li>

            <li> Love it! Glad they changed the glass bottles to plastic.</li>
            <li> I idnt like this product..i was refered tot his by a few people saying it will help hair loss and shine but didnt see anything</li>
            <li> A friend told me about this product so I gave it a try and I LOVE it! Makes my hair so shiny and smooth.</li>
            <li> Great product.  My hair has a two process color and was being exposed to the sun because I swim 6 days a week. Alfa Parf makes my hair very soft and manageable.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent product from an excellent company; AlfaParf. Usually, the product arrives with a glass vial tube, however, this case arrived with a twist off cap for each mini-bottle. As happy as that made me, after a couple of weeks of using this, 2x per week maximum (mixed with conditioner), I noticed that in the box is also a dropper that somehow screws to the top of the glass bottles. This made me smile as I did not see a mention about the box having a dropper measurement in the box and it works so well. I highly recommend this product, especially purchased in a case using the dropper. I use half of the vial 1x per week mixed with conditioner. It makes my hair glossy. I also like the heat released when being placed onto the scalp and hair, great spa product for everyday maintenance. Thanks.</li>
            <li> My hair feels soft and shiny after I use it.  The oil has a lovely scent.  The hair looks and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy to find this product in Amazon!  I started using this product more than 15 years ago.  I used to buy it in Buenos Aires, then I found one place that sold it in Miami.  But, I haven&#x27;t been able to find it lately.</li>
            <li> This product is very nice, leaves your hair really silky. I love it</li>
            <li> This is what you need if your hair is drying because of coloring, flat iron, etc. I completely love this product. My hair is so soft, silky, and fluffy. Thanks to Amazon and the seller.</li>
            <li> This is great stuff.  Adds body and shine and lasts for several shampoos.  My hairdresser gave me my first vial so I was happy to find.d it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This product is amazing if you have dry hair due to constant chemical treatments, or blow drying.  It is not oily, but somehow manages to restore shine, manageability and softness.  You use it after shampoo, leave in your wet hair for at least 7 minutes or longer if  you can, and your hair will feel, smell and look great.  I love it.</li>
            <li> Smells really good, not sure yet if it did anthing essential to the growth and strength of my hair. I love Alfa Parf products so im sure it works</li>
            <li> This is one of the best oil ..... Same or maybe better quality than Kerastase oil ,must  try it :)</li>
            <li> Moisture and shine...what else can I say??!! Highly recommend this product for anyone who is looking to have shiney healthy hair!</li>
            <li> Very good stuff.for my wifeÂ´s hair, it makes wonders, her hair looks healthier and shinier just after using 1 dose and sytem with dropper is perfect .</li>
            <li> My hair is thick and wavy tending to frizzy on occasion...but when I use this product the texture becomes silky soft and very manageable.. I would highly recommend</li>
            <li> My hair is easy to comb and shine</li>
            <li> For a long time I waste my money on hair products trying hair masks, hair conditioner, anyway all kind of hair products that would tame my hair and I was always disappointed until I decided to try these little lotion. Do like I did don&#x27;t waste any more money and just try it. My hair is soft, shinier, damage free after all.</li>
            <li> great stuff, my hair is long so I usually use two bottles per use- but using once a week has helped texture and breakage of my color treated hair for sure! I put it on in the shower, and put a plastic shower cap over it. Then apply a face mask and some whitening strips and sit for 30 minutes!</li>
            <li> A friend of mine gave me a box of these for a gift! It is a great product and makes my hair look smooth again, It does not weigh your hair down at all. I use it more than once a week.</li>
            <li> This product definitely makes the hair silky and smooth.  I have naturally curly hair and I didn&#x27;t need to use any leave in conditioner after using this.  Although, if you have naturally curly and frizzy hair, you will probably still need to use  serum afterwards to thwart away the frizzies.</li>
            <li> Great product,  and received on time.</li>
            <li> Got everything on time. Great product.</li>
            <li> I have been using these oil capsules for over 2 years and they leave the hair shiny and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it for a special treatment twice a month.</li>
            <li> Great product meet all my excpectations .my hair look shine and strong. I&#x27;am in love with this product &#x27; buy it again</li>

            <li> Fantastic product! Leaves youre hair shiny and soft!</li>
            <li> This treatment is the best I love the way my hair looks now since I used this product is way more flexible and shiny!</li>
            <li> This stuff is incredible! Used it the first time in my salon, and have never used another product besides AlfaParf (shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner). They are the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller of this product was great too, even received a follow up email telling me my package was out for delivery, nice touch!</li>
            <li> I love AlfaParf in general and this product very much. Thank you for excellent service.</li>
            <li> THE BEST!!!! Leaves hair soft and silky without weighing it down. And the new bottles are plastic with screw on tops! SO much more convenient than the snap off glass ones they used before. Awesome product!</li>
            <li> I really like it. It makes my hair soft and my hair was noticeably stronger after just one use...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for my hair for about 8 years now &amp; I LOVE IT! My hair dresser used to use it on me every time I got my color, highlight and cut done till I found it here now I use it when I need too. Leaves hair remarkably delicious I walk around smelling it lol it gives it that therapy it needs after all I put it thru. It&#x27;s softer, feels &amp; looks healthier and smells great . I use it around every two weeks and it just gives my hair that boost. I ABSOLUTELY LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS PRODUCT â¤ï¸.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for more than 10 years. I am very sure that I would use it for the rest of my life.  The way I use this product is: 1.- I take one vial and mix it with any Alfaparf Mask (three spoons). 2.-I leave it for 40 mins. 3.- I rinse my hair. 4.- and then I apply evenly to my hair one Alfaparf Midollo di Bamboo Renewal Hair Lotion. My hair always look healthy and shinny.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for seven years now. It&#x27;s the only one that works on my hair. Five minutes... and hair feels soft and silky. Doesn&#x27;t leave hair oily or w/ residue.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner I have used in my salon.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best treatment for shine your hair</li>
            <li> This product is by far the best I have used for my dry hair.  My hairdresser used this on me when she noticed how dry my hair had become and almost instantly, my hair was transformed into healthy, silky smooth hair.  I use it about once a week or so.  I like to put it on my hair and then cover my hair with a shower cap and let it soak up while I am relaxing in the steam room.  Also, sometimes when I am not heating it up in the sauna, I put it in my hair after washing and let it dry and then rinse out in the morning and my hair is so soft and silky smooth.  I am so glad this package has so many vials in it because I hope to never run out of this product.  This product is a five star winner!</li>
            <li> I was given a vial of this product by my hairstylist. Once I tried it, I was hooked. I immediately ordered my own box of the vials. It smells good and it made my hair silky smooth and shiny; as if it had undergone an expensive deep conditioning treatment. I love it and will continue to use it.</li>
            <li> fabulous, I use it every time I wash my hair.  Makes it soft, silky and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT!!</li>
            <li> My hair stylist recommended the Semi Di Lino and now I can&#x27;t be without it. It leaves my hair soft and manageable.  It doesn&#x27;t feel greasy and the shines holds out until the next shampoo.  My hair feels and looks healthy.  You won&#x27;t be dissapointed. Try it!!!!</li>
            <li> My hair was badly damaged from bleaching and coloring, and my stylist recommended this product, so I went for it. Used it religiously, even though the florally smell was terrible, but never saw any improvement. Doesn&#x27;t help detangle, doesn&#x27;t smooth, didn&#x27;t help to strenghten, etc.</li>
            <li> Waste of money... Does nothing for the hair...</li>
            <li> Exelllent treatment. Love it. Should be done in a salon or by someone who know what they are doing.</li>
            <li> You buy, use a little each time you want and it lasts forever. Worth any penny. Gives necessary softness and glow to any colored or chemically treated hair.</li>
            <li> Perfect!!!! Fast shipping!!!!</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought or expected.</li>
            <li> I actually had to edit my review of this product.  This oil works so well.  I applied to my wet hair with the conditioner in.  This made my hair shiny and soft.  Try it you won&#x27;t regret.</li>
            <li> It is a great treatment for the hair, specially if you can use it with a thermal cap for around 15 minutes. The smell is great and it gives bright and softness for the hair. Just love it!!!</li>
            <li> This vials are just gold in liquid form. It is a &amp;#34;MUST HAVE&amp;#34; if you want to have the perfect hait. I use it in combination with the pink vial.</li>
            <li> I finish with Nutri seduction, so i did buy semi di lino, after one day i can fell the difference in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Very fast result just use after shampoo during shower, what it&#x27;s great when i don&#x27;t have time.</li>
            <li> I like it and the product arrived in my home at time</li>
            <li> This product is really good. After the first time that I used my hair was soft and shinny, definitively I recomended it.</li>
            <li> My hair is in better condition than ever. Curly hair is so difficult to get shiny but this product really works. I don&#x27;t care for the smell but it wears off quickly. I use  a vial about every 2 weeks and this is just right for me</li>
            <li> I used this product in conjunction with the Alfaparf hair mask.  The results were incredible.  Luxurious shine, body and bounce.  These products gave me hair from my youth.  I hope with continued use I&#x27;ll continue to see results.</li>
            <li> AlfaParf Semi Di Lino is the best product on the market.</li>
            <li> This is the greatest for my hair.  Cant live without it.  Only use half a vial at a time and usually only when going to a special occasion cause it is kind of pricey.  Wish it came in something other than a glass vial tho.</li>
            <li> Awesome! Love this product will reorder.</li>
            <li> I use this product for my hair once a week. It feels soft and shine.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so glad they finally changed the vials for a safer one.</li>
            <li> I love this product!!! This is the best thing you could use when your hair is dry... I have highlights; I blow dry and iron my hair every day, no need to say that my hair was becoming very dry. I use 1/3 of the bottle of this oil during three consecutive days and it has been the best thing ever. My hair looks shiny and healthy again!!!! It does not leave my hair greasy at all!! I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> i had a hair disaseter and this stuff was a miracle brought my hair back to life its never looked better now</li>
            <li> i Love the smell, and i love the way my hair looks after using this product and blow dry and the next day still looking good. however i have a lot of hair so i have to use like 1 1/2 jars...:S thats the only reasson i dont give 5 stars but i really recommend it specially if you dont wanna cut your ends that often but keep your hair healty and shinny</li>
            <li> I had been using this product for about a year at my hair salon.  They stopped carrying it and my stylist suggested I try to find it on line.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon at such a reasonable price.  This is an exceptionally fine hair product that really super conditions dry damaged hair.  Thank You!!!!</li>
            <li> THIS PRODUCT LEAVES MY HAIR SHINY, SOFT, AND HEALTHY. IT ALSO SMELLS VERY GOOD, I USE IT ONCE EVERY TWO WEEKS.</li>
            <li> I ave use this product before, but wit a different label and a glass bottle instead of a plastic one. I felt a different effect, I am not sure that this product is 100% the original product Alfa Parf put on the market....</li>
            <li> Excellent product. I should mention that I apply a small amount to my hair before blowing it dry and the results are amazing. I know that tge instructions day to apply and then to rinse it out, but I fivd it works better if I leave it on my hair&lt;br /&gt;I love it, plus it smells great</li>
            <li> Be sure to leave it on for at 30 mins before you rinse it off. It works like a protein boots for your hair. Once you get your hair under control you can use an vile once every two weeks. So it will last you a while.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of crazy chemical process on my hair. This is what always saves it from serious damage. I used to dye it red, then I went back to blonde - think bleach, more bleach, toners, beach (sun), peroxide, etc. This is - again - what saves me.&lt;br /&gt;I mix one ampoule of it with conditioner to make a mask. I rub the mask all over my hair, wrap a warm towel around it and just let it sit for at least 20 minutes. My hair gets smooth and shiny right away. It is a treatment for those days when your hair is so damaged, that it is even hard to brush it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;âSemi di Linoâ is Italian for âFlaxseedâ. How great can it be that you get to rub Flaxseed Oil to your hair like that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know other people use these ampoules as a final rinse to their hair. I have done that, and it does work. However, I prefer the mix I suggested because it can penetrate the hair much better, and it will act longer. It leaves your hair easy to brush and looking really nice.</li>
            <li> Best hair restoration weapon out there! Works every time! Try the white and pink leave-in vials also - they add softness and a lovely scent that lingers for hours.</li>
            <li> Simply... I love it! My hair look amazing after I use it.  And I already recomend it to my syster.</li>
            <li> I love this product. I have been using it for years and it makes my hair shine and look healthier! The price is fabulous.</li>
            <li> Its a very good product that leaves your hair silky.&lt;br /&gt;It has a strong smells, but not bad.</li>
            <li> I love it from the first used its make my hair light and bouncy</li>
            <li> I have curly hair and I live in South Florida, so it is hard to keep my hair shiny and smooth. I tried this product and the pink AlfaParf Shine oil, it make my hair looks so beautiful like I just went to the beauty salon. I recommend it. a really good product , it was worthy  to spend my money.</li>
            <li> I just bought this and I&#x27;m wondering how to use it! Can someone let me know some tips please:-) I hightlighted my hair therefore it has become more dry that it already was. So I was my hair then put this product while its damp ? Can I put the whole bottle and leave it in my hair or should I rinse it out ? I do t want it to stay greasy. Please help.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using these capsules for about a year now about once a week. After I use it, my hair is softer, less frizzy and smells nice. I have tried to use other leave ins before, but I&#x27;ve just preferred this one. I recently ran out and had to wait a few weeks before I ordered the next round and I could see a difference--my hair is just better with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> I love it! I have curly hair and it&#x27;s works very good,  leaves my hair very soft. Very nice product.</li>
            <li> i got this because of my hair was really weak and dry and pale but now my hair is healthy as a horse and very shiny</li>
