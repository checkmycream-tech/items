            <li>I use Honest diapers on my son and I subscribe to ALL THREE of their bundles.</li>
            <li>I used it instead for myself since I liked the smell</li>
            <li>It also has a light scent to it, very nice.</li>
            <li>I love Honest Co. Products and will continue to use them</li>
            <li>My son has sensitive skin so this works great with him!</li>
            <li>Ok shampoo.</li>
            <li>Did not come with a pump top.</li>
            <li>Love love love.  </li>
            <li>Used to love this stuff and bought it by the gallon to use for my kids.</li>
            <li>More of a cherry color.</li>
            <li>I do wish it would sud up more though, so you could cover more area.</li>
            <li>Natural and good for you!</li>
            <li>True to its name honest.</li>
            <li>This is pretty good shampoo/body wash for your baby.</li>
            <li>If you havent tried honest products before, use this link for $10 off your first order: goo.gl/DYF91B</li>
            <li>The Honest Company has never failed at giving products that not only are effective but smell amazing.</li>
            <li>No pump top, chose this certain one for the pump top.....</li>
            <li>These products are cheap considering their quality.</li>
            <li>I had to push it many times to get a good enough amount out to  bathe my kids.</li>
            <li>Love Honest Company products so was very excited to find the Shampoo/Body Wash combo in a bigger size WITH a pump!</li>
            <li>Smells nice, but not so strongly that it covers up the new baby smell.</li>
            <li>Except when it came it has original cap with NO pumo.</li>
            <li>five stars for the gentle tear free formula, hair and body all in one, and that it comes with a pump to make it easy to hold a squirming toddler and not have to wrangle with a bottle.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;d easily pay double!! :)</li>
            <li>and it seems to work ok for a bit, but i need to keep on going to my old brand (BWC).</li>
            <li>and it seemed economical for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>The scent didn&#x27;t bother me, at first you do notice it&#x27;s different than any you will find out there, but i liked it.</li>
            <li>It is rare to find a company that values their customers so much!</li>
            <li>Also, the first time the bottle got dropped in the shower the pump broke off.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s got a gentle formula and a great subtle smell.</li>
            <li>This is the only soap my very sensitive little guy can use, Honest has fabulous customer service also!</li>
            <li>were she wants to do everything herself</li>
            <li>Highly recommend buying from this company.</li>
            <li>My young daughter is prone to eczema and contact dermatitis.  </li>
            <li>I like that this product is natural.</li>
            <li>If this is fixed, then I will give five stars</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t come with pump as advertised and it also is a different color (way darker) than any other Honest shampoo that I have purchased which makes me believe that it&#x27;s not authentic Honest brand and was probably mixed with other stuff.</li>
            <li>I can push the nozzle down very easily but it is hard for my 3 year old to do it.</li>
            <li>My hair is not as shiny as with my regular brand, it also tend to make my hair a bit wild.</li>
            <li>Scent could be a little stronger as it doesn&#x27;t really smell once you rinse it off.</li>

            <li> We have struggled with eczema and dry skin all 5 years..</li>
            <li> Prefer it to other pleasant smelling body washes that leave behind a fake, perfumey fruit/floral scent.</li>

            <li> After a few weeks my skin was getting drier and itchy.</li>

            <li> Love the pump! This is the only soap my very sensitive little guy can use, Honest has fabulous customer service also! Highly recommend buying from this company. It is rare to find a company that values their customers so much!</li>
            <li> BEST shampoo/body wash for my baby!  Smells great, perfectly bubbly and doesn&#x27;t leave a film on tub!</li>
            <li> Great body wash. Ok shampoo. Love the no chemicals! Natural and good for you!</li>
            <li> I like the shampoo, but was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t really come with a pump like the description says.</li>
            <li> It has a simple smell that I like. True to its name honest.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t come with pump as advertised and it also is a different color (way darker) than any other Honest shampoo that I have purchased which makes me believe that it&#x27;s not authentic Honest brand and was probably mixed with other stuff. Sad. I love Honest Co. Products and will continue to use them but I will not purchase from this seller again because of these issues. I have continued to use this product to get my money out of it but I can tell a difference when I use this shampoo vs another bottle of the same stuff that I have in a different shower that I purchased at a store. Very disappointing.</li>
            <li> No pump top, chose this certain one for the pump top.....Thinking it would be easier for the kids to dispense and help themselves. Did not come with a pump top. False advertising.....boo!</li>
            <li> My son has sensitive skin so this works great with him! We have struggled with eczema and dry skin all 5 years..honest brand is great! And what a great size!</li>
            <li> I like that it has no chemicals as other brands do. BUT, i sometimes feel like it makes my hair act a bit weird. My hair is not as shiny as with my regular brand, it also tend to make my hair a bit wild. I&#x27;ve tried using it with a different conditioner and it seems to work ok for a bit, but i need to keep on going to my old brand (BWC). The scent didn&#x27;t bother me, at first you do notice it&#x27;s different than any you will find out there, but i liked it.</li>
            <li> The Honest Company has never failed at giving products that not only are effective but smell amazing. I use Honest diapers on my son and I subscribe to ALL THREE of their bundles. These products are cheap considering their quality. I&#x27;d easily pay double!! :)</li>
            <li> Love Honest Company products so was very excited to find the Shampoo/Body Wash combo in a bigger size WITH a pump! Except when it came it has original cap with NO pumo. Very disappointed.</li>
            <li> The smell of this is like being in the middle of a Dreamsicle bar. Prefer it to other pleasant smelling body washes that leave behind a fake, perfumey fruit/floral scent. Mine came with pump as described on the product page.</li>
            <li> Scent could be a little stronger as it doesn&#x27;t really smell once you rinse it off. But still a great product.</li>
            <li> My young daughter is prone to eczema and contact dermatitis.  After the second use her skin looked red and irritated so I stopped immediately.  I used it instead for myself since I liked the smell and it seemed economical for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.  After a few weeks my skin was getting drier and itchy. Also, the first time the bottle got dropped in the shower the pump broke off. Thankfully Costco has a good return policy so I bought it back.</li>
            <li> Needs more suds but a great product. Very light and smells great! I pair this with the spray conditioner on my daughter&#x27;s curly hair and it always looks great.</li>
            <li> Happy with, smells good,</li>
            <li> Love the product but difficult to use because it didn&#x27;t come with a pump!!</li>
            <li> We love this product! It&#x27;s got a gentle formula and a great subtle smell.</li>
            <li> Love love love.  The smell is divine.  I just want to eat up my daughter during her bath.  five stars for the gentle tear free formula, hair and body all in one, and that it comes with a pump to make it easy to hold a squirming toddler and not have to wrangle with a bottle.  If you havent tried honest products before, use this link for $10 off your first order: goo.gl/DYF91B</li>
            <li> This is pretty good shampoo/body wash for your baby. Smells nice, but not so strongly that it covers up the new baby smell. But seriously, I use this stuff on my daughter every day and it works and seems to not contain poison.</li>
            <li> Used to love this stuff and bought it by the gallon to use for my kids. Based on recent experiences with the company&#x27;s products and customer service, would not trust my kids&#x27; skin with this company&#x27;s products again.</li>
            <li> Did not come with the pump. The color of the product is different from the one I&#x27;ve usually seen. More of a cherry color. Don&#x27;t know if they reformulated it or if the product&#x27;s not authentic. The smell is slightly different too.</li>
            <li> I like that this product is natural. It does not leave any slimmy or residue after you wash it off like some products. I do wish it would sud up more though, so you could cover more area. This is the only reason I gave it 4 stars. I can push the nozzle down very easily but it is hard for my 3 year old to do it. She is at the stage were she wants to do everything herself, so she gets a little frustrated with it. It also has a light scent to it, very nice.</li>
            <li> The soap is great. My kids have never had a break out with it. However, the pump on this bottle did not come up enoughtl to pump sufficient amounts. I had to push it many times to get a good enough amount out to  bathe my kids. If this is fixed, then I will give five stars</li>
