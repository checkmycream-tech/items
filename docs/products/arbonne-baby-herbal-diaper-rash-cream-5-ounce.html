            <li>It&#x27;s a wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>Even works great on adults for burns!!</li>
            <li>Best diaper rash cream I have found!</li>
            <li>Everyone says that the butt paste works great -</li>
            <li>This is great stuff</li>
            <li>My sister recommended Arbonne as she also loved it for her kids.</li>
            <li>Loved to use it on my grandchildren an myself also.</li>
            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>and I LOVE it!</li>
            <li>Really love this butt cream works so well!</li>
            <li>Their moms love it!</li>
            <li>It also has a nice scent.</li>
            <li>We recommend it to expectant friends, give it as gifts at baby showers, and encourage adults to try it on their own resistant skin problems.</li>
            <li>I received samples of this item at my shower and found that I liked this product much more than A-D or Desitin.  </li>
            <li>Works better than any diaper rash cream that I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
            <li>The doctor said it would be ok to put diaper rash cream to try to repel water from my baby&#x27;s skin in order to help it heal (on top of what they prescribed).</li>
            <li>I of course then had to buy more when we ran out.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>and i love it.</li>
            <li>I switched her back to Swadlers again, and a friend sent me a sample pack with some of this AWESOME diaper rash cream in it to try.</li>
            <li>the burn rash looks so much better already after one use.</li>
            <li>This cream simply provides the best balance of quality ingredients, price, and rash busting properties of any cream we have tested.</li>
            <li>This is a truly great all-around cream.</li>
            <li>When they need more,  I will.</li>
            <li>I love that it has great herbal ingredients that doesn&#x27;t just provide a barrier, but also offers some healing properties for the skin.  </li>
            <li>Never thought I&#x27;d feel so strongly about diaper rash cream.</li>
            <li>Desitin works just as well, cheaper, and locally available.</li>
            <li>Originally received this as a baby shower gift and out of all the different types of rash creme we received this was by far the best one.  </li>
            <li>We have tried 4 different kinds of diapr rash creams and this by far works the best</li>
            <li>Worked great on my first daughter, but not with my second.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff- it immediately relieves diaper rash and seems to soothe very well</li>
            <li>It worked quickly both on infants&#x27; and adults&#x27; skin issues.</li>
            <li>these items are great ,the basket did not fit</li>
            <li>So worth the additional cost.  </li>
            <li>In my opinion, Arbonne products are pricey, but in this case, economical.</li>
            <li>it is so awesome and worth the price tag since you only have to use it once or twice and the rash is cleared up unlike other creams where we&#x27;ve had to continuously use for days on end and still never healing the rash.  </li>
            <li>Fast shipping and product is worth every penny!</li>
            <li>Arbonne diaper rash cream starts working with the first application; no joke, rash almost gone after the very first application.  </li>
            <li>Additionally, my husband and I have used this on ourselves when we&#x27;ve had the flu and cleared up right away.  </li>
            <li>Good product; used it in full, but discovered a different brand and haven&#x27;t gone back to this one.</li>
            <li>However, this rash is creamy, and while it helps clear up rashes very well, some more viscous and oily creams (such as A &amp; D) provide better barrier protection.</li>
            <li>With no babies in the house and a monster heat rash under the bust and leg area, I was willing to try anything.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll never forget the sound of my 9 month old screaming when changing his diaper.  </li>
            <li>It worked in just a couple days, showing immediate improvement in the first day.  </li>
            <li>Found more areas of pinkness/redness around the tush with this product compared to a different brand.</li>
            <li>I love this product not only as a diaper rash cream but also if I have razor rash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a million types of diaper creams and by far none have been able to ever clear up my sons diaper rash.  </li>
            <li>This stuff works really well, cured my son&#x27;s diaper rash.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!  </li>
            <li>it really soothes it.</li>
            <li>This cream really helped heal his skin.</li>
            <li>We have always used Desitin but it doesn&#x27;t even come close to healing as fast as Arbonne.  </li>
            <li>This works much better than the other diaper creams that I have.  </li>
            <li>It worked quicker and better than the other brands I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li>Check out my other reviews to discover which one is more preferred.</li>
            <li>It helped to clear up my baby&#x27;s skin almost immediately after the first use.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY recommend this stuff now.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li>well worth it as healing is almost instant!  </li>
            <li>I only wish this stuff was a bit more affordable, but a single tube lasted us nearly 5 months!</li>
            <li>This product is by far the best at curing a bad rash.</li>
            <li>I have used other creams/ointments before but this one is by far the best - I won&#x27;t ever waste money on any other diaper rash cream - this is gold!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also much less greasy than other products of this kind.</li>
            <li>and if I use it every diaper change over the weekend she&#x27;ll be completely clear for the start of Monday.</li>
            <li>We have a six week old and everytime there is the slightest diaper redness, we use this cream</li>
            <li>My son has extremely sensitive skin</li>
            <li>We tried destin 40% zinc, Beudreax&#x27;s regular and 40%, triple past, Babyganics (my girl was allergic), coconut oil, Mylanta w/diaper cream, and i&#x27;m sure others.  </li>
            <li>Often one application is all that is necessary to clear up the rash.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll put this on and by the next diaper change she is clear.</li>
            <li>The cream is thin which makes it easy to spread.  </li>
    </ol>

            <li> The cream is thin which makes it easy to spread.  </li>
            <li> true, is very expensive, but totally worth it since it actually works.</li>
            <li> Other diaper rash creams worked but wouldn&#x27;t completely make the rash go away.</li>
            <li> Also due to his sensitive skin he gets rashes even on his face or from dry skin from the winter and this cream has cleared that up.  </li>
            <li> The other major brands all smell like medicine and I can smell it on him even with the diaper closed.</li>
            <li> This is the only diaper cream I&#x27;ve used but when my daughter starts getting a little red</li>
            <li> and I did - air dry, butt paste, anti-fungal, petroleum jelly, hair dryer dry, air out...</li>
            <li> A little goes a LONG way and it clears any diaper rash right up (usually within 24 hours or less).</li>
            <li> I used it last night when I put my daughter down for bed time</li>
            <li> so you only need a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve converted all my other mommy friends and daycare now also swears by it.</li>
            <li> This is the only stuff that actually works and doesn&#x27;t make the rash worse.  </li>
            <li> After trying other ointments and creams with no success, we gave the ABC a shot.</li>
            <li> Used a few other creams that did not really help before this one, but this one worked on my baby&#x27;s diaper rash!</li>
            <li> Because it worked so quickly, less was needed, and baby was relieved sooner.</li>
            <li> Typically takes away the issue over night.</li>
            <li> It only takes a small amount and usually not more than one or two applications.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a bright red color anymore and it looks close to her skin color now, so</li>
            <li> Was a must need for our little ones...</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but</li>
            <li> and it goes away within a few hours.</li>
            <li> so i was a bit confused buying this time, but it&#x27;s the same</li>
            <li> ; It was pretty bad.</li>
            <li> Very little is required.  </li>
            <li> My baby had severe diaper rash after antibiotics taken for an ear infection, a common side effect.</li>
            <li> My son had a bad bout of the flu which left his but raw from the diarrhea.</li>
            <li> This is seriously a wonder cream in my opinion....</li>
            <li> and my boyfriend went out to get diapers for me and came back with Pampers Baby Dry instead which caused a TERRIBLE rash from her diaper area up to her neck</li>
            <li> After the Baby Dry diapers I tried some Huggies which caused a bad burn like rash to form in her diaper area.</li>
            <li> The cream is very thick</li>
            <li> She breaks out worse when she&#x27;s at daycare</li>
            <li> I thought it may be something else causing him grief, so I used it again on the next diaper change...and again, he started screaming.</li>
            <li> My sons diaper rash was so bad his skin was almost raw.</li>
            <li> Both my daughters use this on their babies....less expensive than purchasing from the official Arbonne site.</li>
            <li> It is not especially effective,but it certainly is VERY VERY EXPENSIVE!!!!</li>
            <li> I was desperate in trying to get rid of my daughters diaper rash, as it kept getting worse with each diaper brand switch.</li>
            <li> Used it for a week,  This cream did not clear his diaper rash, it gave him a terrible rash all over his bottom.</li>
            <li> but I couldn&#x27;t get past the horrible smell.  </li>
            <li> The rash is slowly healing and it stopped that awful itching immediately.</li>
            <li> When diaper rash gets this bad, you&#x27;ll try anything and everything.....</li>
            <li> It looked so painful.</li>
            <li> This stuff has a very faint baby powder scent, which is what you want your baby to smell like!</li>
            <li> We had very bad diaper rash caused by hind milk/fore milk imbalance.  </li>
            <li> In keeping with the drug &amp; pharmaceutical industry&#x27;s pricing policy,this diaper rash cream is OUTRAGEOUSLY OVERPRICED!!!!I  </li>

            <li> Fast shipping and product is worth every penny!</li>
            <li> This and Desitin are the only things that go on my baby&#x27;s bottom!!! So worth the additional cost.  My sister recommended Arbonne as she also loved it for her kids.</li>
            <li> This herbal diaper rash cream can be used for multiple purposes. Loved to use it on my grandchildren an myself also.</li>
            <li> This works much better than the other diaper creams that I have.  Every time she has redness - I put this on and it is gone.  Everyone says that the butt paste works great - but I couldn&#x27;t get past the horrible smell.  This doesn&#x27;t have an odor and it works great!  Worth the extra money.</li>
            <li> With no babies in the house and a monster heat rash under the bust and leg area, I was willing to try anything.  My daughter-in-law gave this to me and it&#x27;s a gift from the angels.  The rash is slowly healing and it stopped that awful itching immediately. I&#x27;m buy two tubes so I don&#x27;t run out. This is great stuff and I&#x27;m really critical of products that don&#x27;t deliver on their promises.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never forget the sound of my 9 month old screaming when changing his diaper.  When diaper rash gets this bad, you&#x27;ll try anything and everything.....and I did - air dry, butt paste, anti-fungal, petroleum jelly, hair dryer dry, air out...the list goes on and on.   This is the only stuff that actually works and doesn&#x27;t make the rash worse.

            <li> I received this as a gift. Other diaper rash creams worked but wouldn&#x27;t completely make the rash go away. I used Arbonne and instantly overnight the rash was gone. It worked quicker and better than the other brands I&#x27;ve used. I totally recommend this product.</li>
            <li> Never thought I&#x27;d feel so strongly about diaper rash cream. This stuff works really well, cured my son&#x27;s diaper rash. It also has a nice scent.

            <li> Arbonne&#x27;s Diaper Rash Cream is a staple in our home, and in the homes of our grandchildren. In short, it works.  It worked quickly both on infants&#x27; and adults&#x27; skin issues. It&#x27;s a wonderful product.  Because it worked so quickly, less was needed, and baby was relieved sooner. We recommend it to expectant friends, give it as gifts at baby showers, and encourage adults to try it on their own resistant skin problems. In my opinion, Arbonne products are pricey, but in this case, economical. Often one application is all that is necessary to clear up the rash.</li>
            <li> I received samples of this item at my shower and found that I liked this product much more than A-D or Desitin.  It&#x27;s all we use on dd and will continue to order it from Amazon.</li>

            <li> Works better than any diaper rash cream that I&#x27;ve tried.  We had very bad diaper rash caused by hind milk/fore milk imbalance.  Baby girl was bleeding.  We tried destin 40% zinc, Beudreax&#x27;s regular and 40%, triple past, Babyganics (my girl was allergic), coconut oil, Mylanta w/diaper cream, and i&#x27;m sure others.  This worked.  It worked in just a couple days, showing immediate improvement in the first day.  I love that it has great herbal ingredients that doesn&#x27;t just provide a barrier, but also offers some healing properties for the skin.  Bought a second tube to have on hand.</li>
            <li> Good product; used it in full, but discovered a different brand and haven&#x27;t gone back to this one. Found more areas of pinkness/redness around the tush with this product compared to a different brand. Check out my other reviews to discover which one is more preferred.</li>
            <li> My baby had severe diaper rash after antibiotics taken for an ear infection, a common side effect. The doctor said it would be ok to put diaper rash cream to try to repel water from my baby&#x27;s skin in order to help it heal (on top of what they prescribed). After trying other ointments and creams with no success, we gave the ABC a shot. It helped to clear up my baby&#x27;s skin almost immediately after the first use. It allowed the medicine to work where others didn&#x27;t seem to make a difference.</li>
            <li> We have a six week old and everytime there is the slightest diaper redness, we use this cream and it goes away within a few hours. The cream is very thick so you only need a little bit at a time.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a million types of diaper creams and by far none have been able to ever clear up my sons diaper rash.  My son has extremely sensitive skin and this has never been an issue with this cream.  Also due to his sensitive skin he gets rashes even on his face or from dry skin from the winter and this cream has cleared that up.  Additionally, my husband and I have used this on ourselves when we&#x27;ve had the flu and cleared up right away.  This is seriously a wonder cream in my opinion....it is so awesome and worth the price tag since you only have to use it once or twice and the rash is cleared up unlike other creams where we&#x27;ve had to continuously use for days on end and still never healing the rash.  Works for adults too.  Thank you Arbonne!</li>
            <li> This is the only diaper cream I&#x27;ve used but when my daughter starts getting a little red I&#x27;ll put this on and by the next diaper change she is clear. She breaks out worse when she&#x27;s at daycare and if I use it every diaper change over the weekend she&#x27;ll be completely clear for the start of Monday. I try to just apply every night and she seems to not have any issues. Love it!</li>
            <li> Used a few other creams that did not really help before this one, but this one worked on my baby&#x27;s diaper rash!</li>
            <li> Received this as a gift at my baby shower and I LOVE it! A little goes a LONG way and it clears any diaper rash right up (usually within 24 hours or less). I have used other creams/ointments before but this one is by far the best - I won&#x27;t ever waste money on any other diaper rash cream - this is gold!</li>
            <li> these items are great ,the basket did not fit</li>
            <li> Was a must need for our little ones...</li>
            <li> Originally received this as a baby shower gift and out of all the different types of rash creme we received this was by far the best one.  I of course then had to buy more when we ran out.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. We have tried 4 different kinds of diapr rash creams and this by far works the best</li>
            <li> they recently changed the label/image/packaging so i was a bit confused buying this time, but it&#x27;s the same and i love it. it was the only cream of five we tried that actually cleared up our daughter&#x27;s diaper rash. also cured a different rash she got on her back. it&#x27;s the only cream we use on both our kids. true, is very expensive, but totally worth it since it actually works.</li>
            <li> I was desperate in trying to get rid of my daughters diaper rash, as it kept getting worse with each diaper brand switch. We&#x27;re a Pampers Swaddlers home and my boyfriend went out to get diapers for me and came back with Pampers Baby Dry instead which caused a TERRIBLE rash from her diaper area up to her neck; It was pretty bad. After the Baby Dry diapers I tried some Huggies which caused a bad burn like rash to form in her diaper area. It looked so painful. I switched her back to Swadlers again, and a friend sent me a sample pack with some of this AWESOME diaper rash cream in it to try. I used it last night when I put my daughter down for bed time (keep in mind that she sleeps 12 hours) and I changed her diaper when she woke up and the burn rash looks so much better already after one use. It&#x27;s not a bright red color anymore and it looks close to her skin color now, so I HIGHLY recommend this stuff now. I&#x27;m buying stock in this cream.</li>
            <li> I like that it was an herbal diaper rash cream, but it didn&#x27;t work as well for my son</li>
            <li> Love this stuff- it immediately relieves diaper rash and seems to soothe very well</li>
            <li> My wife and I have tried countless diaper creams over the course of two children. This cream simply provides the best balance of quality ingredients, price, and rash busting properties of any cream we have tested. However, this rash is creamy, and while it helps clear up rashes very well, some more viscous and oily creams (such as A &amp; D) provide better barrier protection. This is a truly great all-around cream.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend this product. The rash was gone by next diaper change.</li>
            <li> Really love this butt cream works so well! Typically takes away the issue over night. Highly recommend!  Even works great on adults for burns!!</li>
            <li> Bought it for my grandchildren.  Their moms love it! I would buy it again!  When they need more,  I will.</li>
            <li> Used it for a week,  This cream did not clear his diaper rash, it gave him a terrible rash all over his bottom. Never going to use this again!</li>
            <li> I used this rash cream on my son&#x27;s bum and he started screaming as soon as i applied it. I thought it may be something else causing him grief, so I used it again on the next diaper change...and again, he started screaming. On to the next product for me!</li>
            <li> Best diaper rash cream I have found!</li>
            <li> I love this product not only as a diaper rash cream but also if I have razor rash. it really soothes it. My son had a bad bout of the flu which left his but raw from the diarrhea. This cream really helped heal his skin.</li>
            <li> Worked great on my first daughter, but not with my second. We&#x27;ve since switch to Desitin on recommendation from our doctor. Desitin works just as well, cheaper, and locally available.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little pricey but well worth it as healing is almost instant!  We have always used Desitin but it doesn&#x27;t even come close to healing as fast as Arbonne.  It only takes a small amount and usually not more than one or two applications.  It&#x27;s also much less greasy than other products of this kind.</li>
