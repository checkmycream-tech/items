            <li>Nice colour, blends well.</li>
            <li>This is my all time favorite lip liner I love love love it!!</li>
            <li>The color matches my naturally pigmented lips perfectly.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a pretty color, but its wear life is not that great.</li>
            <li>Good price and shipping quick.</li>
            <li>Love love love this lip liner.</li>
            <li>There are thousands of lip liners that do a better job.</li>
            <li>Absolutely love the color</li>
            <li>It lasts more than most but nothing too outstanding.</li>
            <li>However, that is the case with most of my lip liners anyway.</li>
            <li>Love the color.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly!</li>
            <li>for the price, it is a great deal and I would highly recommend!</li>
            <li>love the color and it stays on well</li>
            <li>This is my favorite lip liner.</li>
            <li>First off, I will state the good.</li>
            <li>I just love the color and how smooth it is.</li>
            <li>Gorgeous, long-lasting color- Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>the color is flattering no matter what skin tone you are dark to light, it is that perfect nude brown, you can literally pair it with any lipstick color.</li>
            <li>Love the way this roll-up lip liner goes on, smoothly; rather than the pencil liners which are only good for scratching notes on paper.</li>
            <li>Nice lip liner but Tawny is much darker than what the picture shows.</li>
            <li>Applies smoothly.</li>
            <li>That being said, if you are looking for a neutral liner that looks good on nearly anyone, this is it.</li>
            <li>I usually buy this shade of liner and it works perfect.</li>
            <li>I love this neutral liner, but the price is very high on this site.</li>
            <li>I can apply it to my lips completely or just create a nice shape to them.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice, natural, pinkish color.</li>
            <li>I love it so much.</li>
            <li>I wear it all over the lip and add a bit of gloss on top, or I wear a nude lipstick on top of it and it makes it so long wearing</li>
            <li>The color of the pencil looks darker but when you apply it, its the EXACT color I wanted!</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s not even funny!</li>
            <li>The quality is amazing and you simply cannot beat the price.</li>
            <li>But for the price (a couple of bucks at Walgreens), it&#x27;s a nice enough product.</li>
            <li>It is worth it for the price though.</li>
            <li>but it was worth it and</li>
            <li>Completely obsessed with this liner, It is just the most beautiful color ever.</li>
            <li>amazing color for such a low price and easy to apply</li>
            <li>This is my first Jordana product.</li>
            <li>love the color but will not be buying on here anymore since i found it at a local store for 3 dollars</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this liner!</li>
            <li>Like almost red, and it does not run smooth, it drags your lips.</li>
            <li>I have olive toned skin, and I really wanted a lip liner that was nude for my skin, and that was flattering.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping and as described</li>
            <li>Very pigmented</li>
            <li>The lip pencil itself looks like a rosy pink, but it&#x27;s more on the brown side.</li>
            <li>Most were too cool, or far too dark.</li>
            <li>It applies on smoothly and has a nice rich dark color that can be paired with various other shades of nude or rosey lipstick.</li>
            <li>When I initially saw the liner, I was worried it wasn&#x27;t the right color.</li>
            <li>I received it very fast, 4 days after I ordered it to be exact and 2 days before it&#x27;s expected to be here.</li>
            <li>My first Jordana purchase, not my last...</li>
            <li>Liked the color but it kept breaking off even if only a small amount of the tip was out beyond the end.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s more of a pinky red and quite dark, not at all nude or tawny</li>
            <li>The color is closer to my natural lip color than I thought it would be, though.</li>
            <li>It goes with nude colors or soft pinks.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not dark</li>
            <li>I can even get away with just using a liner and no lipstick if I just want a bit of definition since the color is so similar to my natural shade.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very flattering nude pink brown.</li>
            <li>Much lighter than expected and doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Much lighter than expected and doesn&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Perfect. My go to liner. I can even get away with just using a liner and no lipstick if I just want a bit of definition since the color is so similar to my natural shade.</li>
            <li> Love the color! Love how it looks! ðŸ’‹</li>
            <li> Best neutral lip pencil! Better than premium brands!</li>
            <li> Love love love this lip liner. The quality is amazing and you simply cannot beat the price. You obviously have to moisturize your lips before applying it since it is matte.</li>
            <li> Perfect! Great product</li>
            <li> amazing color for such a low price and easy to apply</li>
            <li> I love this neutral liner, but the price is very high on this site. After I ran through this one, I found the same product at Walgreens for less than one dollar. That being said, if you are looking for a neutral liner that looks good on nearly anyone, this is it. I use it to line my lips with lipstick, and sometimes I use it to both line and fill in my lips with just this color. The staying power is great as well.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product, but buy it elsewhere.</li>
            <li> lasts about 1 minute. Threw it away. There are thousands of lip liners that do a better job.</li>
            <li> Completely obsessed with this liner, It is just the most beautiful color ever.</li>
            <li> This is my first Jordana product. I just love the color and how smooth it is. A lip liner that does not pull and tug your lips</li>
            <li> Very good liner for the price.</li>
            <li> Not a mechanical pencil a regular sharpening pencil</li>
            <li> Nice colour, blends well. My first Jordana purchase, not my last...</li>
            <li> Awesome quality. I like that it isn&#x27;t too creamy but doesn&#x27;t dry out my lips. The color matches my naturally pigmented lips perfectly. Best of all Jordana doesn&#x27;t test on animals! If you can look at Walgreens you&#x27;ll find Jordana for $1.99.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a pretty color, but its wear life is not that great. I find myself having to reapply it quite often. But for the price (a couple of bucks at Walgreens), it&#x27;s a nice enough product. The color is closer to my natural lip color than I thought it would be, though.</li>
            <li> When I initially saw the liner, I was worried it wasn&#x27;t the right color. I wanted a nude liner. The color of the pencil looks darker but when you apply it, its the EXACT color I wanted! I love it! I highly recommend this liner! It doesn&#x27;t bleed or smudge. I line my lips with it and then can apply any lip color I want because it&#x27;s a nude color. It&#x27;s not dark so you don&#x27;t get that &amp;#34;outlined&amp;#34; look. It just makes a neat/clean edge around my lipstick. LOVE IT!</li>
            <li> That&#x27;s find! I like the color. It&#x27;s perfect for me. Good price and shipping quick. I am satisfacted of the product.</li>

            <li> Love the color. Applies smoothly.</li>
            <li> love the color but will not be buying on here anymore since i found it at a local store for 3 dollars lol but it was worth it and the color is flattering no matter what skin tone you are dark to light, it is that perfect nude brown, you can literally pair it with any lipstick color. i have used this with red, nudes, and pink. it is creamy and you dont have to sharpen it. now the only reason i took off a star is because of the lasting power, def blot your lips when done it will help some.</li>
            <li> Good color. Saw this used on a makeup guru and it really is a very nice neutral color</li>
            <li> I like the color. It glides on smoothly! It stays fairly long on lips. And for the price, can&#x27;t beat that!</li>

            <li> completely different color than pictured, it&#x27;s more of a pinky red and quite dark, not at all nude or tawny</li>
            <li> This is my favorite lip liner. It&#x27;s a very flattering nude pink brown. I can wear it with any lipstick because it is just a bit darker than my lips.</li>
            <li> This is a perfect pointed lip liner for nude lips or if you could use a liner for a lipstick at all, I will use this. Great price!</li>
            <li> Loved this color! The lip pencil itself looks like a rosy pink, but it&#x27;s more on the brown side. Just like the image shown in the picture! It&#x27;s perfect to wear with a nude lipstick and rose lipstick as well.</li>
            <li> I was expected a nude color but when it came in it was a darker raspberry pinkish color. Goes on nicely and awesome pigment, I was just expecting a different color.</li>
