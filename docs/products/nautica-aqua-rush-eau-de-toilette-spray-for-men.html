            <li>great vaule for this product.</li>
            <li>Smells great.</li>
            <li>My dad was so happy when he opened this.</li>
            <li>Glad to have gotten it for a great price!</li>
            <li>smells so good and the price is great</li>
            <li>I like it, it will very light but very pleasant</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t mind that drawback it still smells good for the time it stays with your skin</li>
            <li>I have just seen lots of good reviews</li>
            <li>and I have received comments about how good I smell every time I have worn it.  </li>
            <li>However, this does smell GOOD.  </li>
            <li>If you just want to freshen up, this is a good choice.  </li>
            <li>I wore the cologne 2x before deciding I need to buy the full bottle, the staying power is impressive</li>
            <li>Wonderful fresh scent that isn&#x27;t too musky.</li>
            <li>My man is already VERY sexy, but when he wears this...</li>
            <li>Got to love Amazon!</li>
            <li>Awesome - nice big bottle for a great value</li>
            <li>Smells amazing.</li>
            <li>Cheap and smells great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;a nice slim glass bottle that gives you the feeling of having treasure.</li>
            <li>Rush starts off with relatively nice sillage and power</li>
            <li>Nice sent</li>
            <li>My husband liked it too.</li>
            <li>It kind of reminds me of a simpler version of Issey Miyake L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey, without the woods and florals.  </li>
            <li>otherwise nice fragrance</li>
            <li>Nautica products are good quality, and for something that may make contact with your skin, I&#x27;d say buy the better prouduct.</li>
            <li>but i liked the bottle, so I unscrewed the top and dumped it out but got some on my bathroom floor.  </li>
            <li>satisfied with product, nice delivery service thank you</li>
            <li>It has that VERY sexy, clean, out of the shower aroma.  </li>
            <li>The scent is just okay</li>
            <li>If you are looking for a fresh scent at a good price point this is it.</li>
            <li>Fast service, smells great</li>
            <li>Either cologne is a winner, but the Aqua Rush had the most immediate responses on what was associated with the person wearing it, where they wanted to be smelling it and what would happen afterwards.</li>
            <li>Women will ask you what you are wearing and your girlfriend or wife will love how you smell.</li>
            <li>This is a good spring cologne and bears a freshly showered scent.  </li>
            <li>He said it&#x27;s a better deal than in stores</li>
            <li>everything when ok with my order</li>
            <li>Ulta rep recommended this one for my husband since I was looking for a nice, clean scent, nothing musky.  </li>
            <li>It has a nice, tart yuzu note, and a soapy fresh backbone.  </li>
            <li>Our teenage neighbor girl came over and asked about the cologne because it smelled so good!</li>
            <li>For the price the cologne is great and the smell is good too especially for a fresh and cool smell.</li>
            <li>Liked it at first but eventually made me sneeze.</li>
            <li>great only thing is it dosent stay with me all day</li>
            <li>I use aqua rush more often as it is more manly and clean, however I use them together frequently also.</li>
            <li>Nothing Special .</li>
            <li>Aqua Rush, like many other of the Nautica fragrances, smells very nice and fruity while really capturing the aquatics essence as well.</li>
            <li>It is a cheap cologne, but it really does not smell cheap.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommended, I&#x27;ve gotten many complements.</li>
            <li>Just a nice, simple go-to when you want to smell clean and fresh.  </li>
            <li>Great price, half of department stores!  </li>
            <li>He announced it at our family gathering that I got him this right before we opened presents</li>
            <li>After a few hours it really does become a skin scent which is the main reason I took a star off; it would be nice if Aqua Rush had some more oomph to it.</li>
            <li>With scents being subjective and what you smell first and what intermixes with your skin is another thing.  </li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon, retail at department store is more than double.</li>
            <li>One of my wife&#x27;s first choices.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad by any means, but it&#x27;s not breaking into any new territory either.</li>
            <li>The top notes are a very citrusy blast of yuzu mixed in with some spice of coriander.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty new, but you always get your money&#x27;s worth from Nautica.</li>
            <li>but it dies fast.</li>
            <li>Never had a problem with colognes until I sprayed this once on my wrist and within one minute my whole arm broke out in a rash.  </li>
            <li>, it smells very aquatic which I definitly like.  </li>
            <li>Very Inexspensive .</li>
            <li>It smells VERY manly.  </li>
            <li>The scent is very soothing and not offensive at all.</li>
            <li>This is the second best Nautica fragrance, behind Voyage.</li>
            <li>Between this on one arm and Guess Obsession on the other; I found equally interesting responses from the women who gave their opinions</li>
            <li>Went to clean the floor a minute later and it had permanently discolored the bathroom tile.  </li>
            <li>The cologne smells nice, but doesnt last long</li>
            <li>The scent is very clean and fresh smelling, however, it does not last very long.  </li>
            <li>The smell is definitely good when it&#x27;s weak.</li>
            <li>The scent of mint fused with coriander warms the heart as you set your voyage for new beginnings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>/&gt;That being said, while it smells fine, Aqua Rush is a little ho-hum.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Regardless, I will try it again perhaps with less and will most likely change my rating.  </li>
            <li>More so, it lasts reasonably long and doesnt hold on the clothes like some other.</li>
            <li>Same thing, my whole arm.  </li>
            <li>so completely my fault.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I purchased this item directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li>Exactly what was expected</li>
            <li>Havent had this problem with any other cologne I&#x27;ve worn then again maybe this one requires less and is more potent.&lt;br</li>
            <li>just basic cheap for everyday use.</li>
            <li>for only the mature, this fragrance comes in&lt;br</li>
            <li>this perfume don&#x27;t really a really one, I spent my money from this one for no reason</li>
            <li>I saw it as an opportunity to add a nice aquatic, casual fragrance to my collection</li>
            <li>I bought these for myself, my wife is not too crazy about it, but like I said I love it!</li>

            <li> I bought these for myself, my wife is not too crazy about it, but like I said I love it!</li>
            <li> Aqua Rush is masculine and casual, almost a friendly fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last really long, so you need to reapply in the afternoon if going out later.</li>
            <li> Only downfall is the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
            <li> I feel like I am sailing on the open waters in the Caribbean with the wind in my face and the ocean breeze flowing through my loose linen cloths.</li>
            <li> When you give the spray, the scent might be a little bit strong, but it&#x27;ll soon become weak.</li>
            <li> if you know you might be sensitive to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> It did not wow me as expected.</li>
            <li> Now, I only mark it down one star because</li>
            <li> I was afraid that for such a good price it might be fake.  </li>
            <li> He still wears it, just not that often since it doesn&#x27;t have the staying power as some of his other colognes.</li>
            <li> If you find this in a store for cheap and feel like giving it a shot, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed so long as you don&#x27;t mind some reapplication through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Aqua Rush only lasts for maybe three hours before it completely fades which is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> so it was a shot in the dark</li>
            <li> Waited a few days until the rash cleared and sprayed it in the palm of my hand.  </li>
            <li> I could wear to work or on casual events with friends or potentially a woman (would depend on time of day) with some extras to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne for my husband, I had found a sample of it in a magazine, but had a hard time finding it in stores.</li>
            <li> I feel Aqua Rush is one of those fragrances you&#x27;d want to obtain for the least amount of money you could.</li>
            <li> The heart of the cologne brings on scents of aquatic mint, clary sage absolute and violet leaves, with the base notes coming through with some wear being amberwood, aquatic musk and teak wood.</li>
            <li> My final statements on this cologne are that Aqua Rush isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s a little weak and isn&#x27;t the cream of the crop of the Nautica cologne line.</li>
            <li> : The longetivity on this one seems to have gotten worse.</li>
            <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> I feel as though I am a pirate chilling on the deck all day with this!  </li>
            <li> Go to a TJ Maxx or Marshalls and see if you can snag one there though $22 isn&#x27;t bad for a 3.4 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Excellent smell great only thing is it dosent stay with me all day</li>
            <li> This is a great scent, it&#x27;s lights, but stays with you all day! I always get complimented on it! Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
            <li> Exactly what was expected</li>
            <li> Nothing Special . just basic cheap for everyday use. No one will notice or will care.  Don&#x27;t buy based on Reviews ..</li>
            <li> Another great fragrance by nautica&lt;br /&gt;made for only the mature, this fragrance comes in&lt;br /&gt;a nice slim glass bottle that gives you the feeling of having treasure.</li>
            <li> I picked up a Nautica Aqua Rush gift set from a local Marshalls. Twenty bucks for a 3.4 oz cologne, 4 oz. body spray, after shave balm, and shower gel. I saw it as an opportunity to add a nice aquatic, casual fragrance to my collection I could wear to work or on casual events with friends or potentially a woman (would depend on time of day) with some extras to boot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nauticas Aqua Rush is an aromatic and sea-based fragrance so the notes are based around this concept of \\&quot;the ocean\\&quot; and the \\&quot;open sea\\&quot; if you will. The top notes are a very citrusy blast of yuzu mixed in with some spice of coriander. The heart of the cologne brings on scents of aquatic mint, clary sage absolute and violet leaves, with the base notes coming through with some wear being amberwood, aquatic musk and teak wood. Aqua Rush, like many other of the Nautica fragrances, smells very nice and fruity while really capturing the aquatics essence as well. Aqua Rush is masculine and casual, almost a friendly fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overpower. Aqua Rush could be worn on just about any occasion but once the fall and winter hit, Aqua Rush&#x27;s place starts to go away as a summery aquatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, while it smells fine, Aqua Rush is a little ho-hum. It&#x27;s not bad by any means, but it&#x27;s not breaking into any new territory either. Nautica Voyage and Nautica Blue beat this out by a mile in my personal opinion in terms of smell and sillage, but I don&#x27;t regret owning Aqua Rush and I will use every drop of it. I feel Aqua Rush is one of those fragrances you&#x27;d want to obtain for the least amount of money you could. Go to a TJ Maxx or Marshalls and see if you can snag one there though $22 isn&#x27;t bad for a 3.4 oz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aqua Rush starts off with relatively nice sillage and power but it dies fast. After a few hours it really does become a skin scent which is the main reason I took a star off; it would be nice if Aqua Rush had some more oomph to it. My final statements on this cologne are that Aqua Rush isn&#x27;t bad, but it&#x27;s a little weak and isn&#x27;t the cream of the crop of the Nautica cologne line. If you find this in a store for cheap and feel like giving it a shot, I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll be disappointed so long as you don&#x27;t mind some reapplication through the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT 11/8/2013: The longetivity on this one seems to have gotten worse. Aqua Rush only lasts for maybe three hours before it completely fades which is unfortunate. If you don&#x27;t mind that drawback it still smells good for the time it stays with your skin but otherwise, move to another one.</li>
            <li> Wonderful fresh scent that isn&#x27;t too musky. It doesn&#x27;t last really long, so you need to reapply in the afternoon if going out later.</li>
            <li> Never had a problem with colognes until I sprayed this once on my wrist and within one minute my whole arm broke out in a rash.  Waited a few days until the rash cleared and sprayed it in the palm of my hand.  Same thing, my whole arm.  Decided to throw it out but i liked the bottle, so I unscrewed the top and dumped it out but got some on my bathroom floor.  Went to clean the floor a minute later and it had permanently discolored the bathroom tile.  And we&#x27;re putting that on our skin?  The scent is just okay and a bit generic to me. Stick with Nautica Voyage or another brand, esp. if you know you might be sensitive to harsh chemicals.</li>
            <li> I like it, it will very light but very pleasant</li>
            <li> Great price. Nice sent</li>
            <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.  The scent is very clean and fresh smelling, however, it does not last very long.  He still wears it, just not that often since it doesn&#x27;t have the staying power as some of his other colognes.</li>
            <li> So, I haven&#x27;t actually sampled this I have just seen lots of good reviews so it was a shot in the dark so completely my fault.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, This smells great I like the idea of it, it smells very aquatic which I definitly like.  I feel as though I am a pirate chilling on the deck all day with this!  Now, I only mark it down one star because *and note it could just be me I havent tried wearing it again yet* but the time I wore it, it kinda gave me a headache.  Havent had this problem with any other cologne I&#x27;ve worn then again maybe this one requires less and is more potent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, I will try it again perhaps with less and will most likely change my rating.  But I totally recommend this.  It smells great!</li>
            <li> I bought this cologne after receiving a sample from the department store.  I wore the cologne 2x before deciding I need to buy the full bottle, the staying power is impressive and I have received comments about how good I smell every time I have worn it.  If you are looking for a fresh scent at a good price point this is it.</li>
            <li> This is the second best Nautica fragrance, behind Voyage. The scent is like a lemony, zesty version of A&amp;F Fierce. It&#x27;s pretty new, but you always get your money&#x27;s worth from Nautica.</li>
            <li> Great smell.  Great price, half of department stores!  Why didn&#x27;t I look here before buying it previously in big name stores?  I won&#x27;t be doing that again.  Got to love Amazon!</li>
            <li> this perfume don&#x27;t really a really one, I spent my money from this one for no reason</li>
            <li> Fast service, smells great</li>
            <li> With scents being subjective and what you smell first and what intermixes with your skin is another thing.  Between this on one arm and Guess Obsession on the other; I found equally interesting responses from the women who gave their opinions (some described what situation they were best suited for and others described what thought they would be doing if their boyfriend was wearing them).  Either cologne is a winner, but the Aqua Rush had the most immediate responses on what was associated with the person wearing it, where they wanted to be smelling it and what would happen afterwards.</li>
            <li> It did not wow me as expected.</li>
            <li> GREAT scent. Lots of compliments.</li>
            <li> This is a very good scent. Highly recommended, I&#x27;ve gotten many complements. The smell is very similar to Polo branded colognes.</li>
            <li> My son gets lots of compliments on this scent.  I was afraid that for such a good price it might be fake.  I compared it to a smaller bottle purchased in a retail store and everything matched up.  I purchased this item directly from Amazon.</li>
            <li> Bought this cologne for my husband, I had found a sample of it in a magazine, but had a hard time finding it in stores. Glad to have gotten it for a great price!</li>
            <li> Awesome - nice big bottle for a great value</li>
            <li> Smells amazing. Recieved a sample in a sephora package and ordered the bottle for my hubby. Very Inexspensive . Only downfall is the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last long.</li>
            <li> satisfied with product, nice delivery service thank you</li>
            <li> I feel like I am sailing on the open waters in the Caribbean with the wind in my face and the ocean breeze flowing through my loose linen cloths. The scent of mint fused with coriander warms the heart as you set your voyage for new beginnings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay whatever; it&#x27;s awesome, it smells good and it&#x27;s not overbearing.</li>
            <li> This and Nautica voyage are my signature colognes. I use aqua rush more often as it is more manly and clean, however I use them together frequently also. You can&#x27;t beat the price on Amazon, retail at department store is more than double. Women will ask you what you are wearing and your girlfriend or wife will love how you smell.</li>
            <li> It smells VERY manly.  I was looking for something that didn&#x27;t smell piney or like citrus for my husband.  It has that VERY sexy, clean, out of the shower aroma.  My man is already VERY sexy, but when he wears this... yeah, it just adds that something that I simply can not describe.</li>
            <li> Ulta rep recommended this one for my husband since I was looking for a nice, clean scent, nothing musky.  This is a good spring cologne and bears a freshly showered scent.  My husband liked it too.</li>
            <li> Some people knock it for being unoriginal, and I cannot really rebut that argument.  The longevity is spotty, no doubt about it.  However, this does smell GOOD.  It has a nice, tart yuzu note, and a soapy fresh backbone.  If you just want to freshen up, this is a good choice.  I like it for going to the gym, playing golf, playing tennis, going to the beach, etc.  It is invigorating, and makes me feel &amp;#34;active.&amp;#34;  It is a cheap cologne, but it really does not smell cheap.  It kind of reminds me of a simpler version of Issey Miyake L&#x27;eau D&#x27;Issey, without the woods and florals.  Just a nice, simple go-to when you want to smell clean and fresh.  Excellent summer fragrance, and does well indoors in the colder months too.</li>
            <li> my husband loves this and aqua di gio. great vaule for this product. Will buy again as it is a wonderful scent for a man.</li>
            <li> Liked it at first but eventually made me sneeze. otherwise nice fragrance</li>
            <li> My teenage son put this on to go to a dance.  Our teenage neighbor girl came over and asked about the cologne because it smelled so good!</li>
            <li> Cheap and smells great.</li>
            <li> Smells great! Best Nautica cologne I&#x27;ve had!</li>
            <li> This cologne is awesome. One of my wife&#x27;s first choices.</li>
            <li> Son loves the fragrance</li>
            <li> When ever its time to go balls deep, I put this stuff one. If you&#x27;re trying to nail that booty, you need this, man. Smells great. girls think its yummy</li>
            <li> My dad was so happy when he opened this. He announced it at our family gathering that I got him this right before we opened presents and when he did open it, his face lit up then he jumped and hugged me for like five minutes. He said it&#x27;s a better deal than in stores</li>
            <li> When you give the spray, the scent might be a little bit strong, but it&#x27;ll soon become weak. The smell is definitely good when it&#x27;s weak. And by the way, &amp;#34;eau de toilette&amp;#34; means the smell can only last about 3-4 hrs.</li>
            <li> everything when ok with my order</li>
            <li> The cologne smells nice, but doesnt last long</li>
            <li> Perhaps its just me, but I am biased toward the blue colored scents/perfumes/deodorants. The scent is very soothing and not offensive at all. More so, it lasts reasonably long and doesnt hold on the clothes like some other. Nautica products are good quality, and for something that may make contact with your skin, I&#x27;d say buy the better prouduct.</li>
            <li> For the price the cologne is great and the smell is good too especially for a fresh and cool smell.</li>
            <li> smells so good and the price is great</li>
            <li> I bought these for myself, my wife is not too crazy about it, but like I said I love it! The price I paid cannot be beaten, I am sure!!!</li>
