    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>&quot; in the perfect shape of the strip on my leg.</li>
            <li>These are normally excellent</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen, Moujan and these Nad&#x27;s strips, and Nad&#x27;s are the best for ME.  </li>
            <li>These strips are WONDERFUL!  </li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>Wonderful product.  </li>
            <li>These strips are the best for legs!  </li>
            <li>The smell is pleasant and soothing effect is perfect.</li>
            <li>Works beautifully.</li>
            <li>Then I found beeswax strips in The Body Shop, and it worked beautifully, but they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li>I cannot tell you how HAPPY I AM.  </li>
            <li>these aren&#x27;t great for armpits.</li>
            <li>When you buy this product from a pharmacy, it works great.  </li>
            <li>I use this for my bikini and even for that tender of an area it works great.</li>
            <li>Maybe one day I&#x27;ll brave up and try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>They smell great, too.</li>
            <li>Like many of us, I have tried everything under the sun to see what works best to get rid of hair and keep it away.</li>
            <li>I always run out of the Nad&#x27;s baby oil wipes (which are very good also, but I need more quantity.</li>
            <li>Absolutely loved them.  </li>
            <li>This looked like a good idea at the time and the concept is good..</li>
            <li>This is a good product for beginners to try.</li>
            <li>great!!they smell good</li>
            <li>I do not recommend this item at all and will keep search for something better!</li>
            <li>I love them and they worked for me!</li>
            <li>I literally have to wear wool onesies to stay warm.</li>
            <li>However, the price of these on amazon is 3 times that on nad&#x27;s own website.  </li>
            <li>Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li>Today I realized that my biggest mistake was getting the wax TOO warm.</li>
            <li>More preferable over Veet which is also one of the good products.  </li>
            <li>I bought this stuff because I had used Nads in the jar and really liked it.</li>
            <li>I couldn&#x27;t find that kind at my walmart, so I had to buy this stuff.</li>
            <li>don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a perfect product out there, and no matter what, brazillian waxing (all waxing, really)</li>
            <li>Honestly?</li>
            <li>I bought them to use in my underams, so I&#x27;m hoping they are as effective there as they are on my legs.</li>
            <li>I did as the box instructed and rubbed the strips between my hands to warm them, when I pulled them apart</li>
            <li>Smells good, easy to use.  </li>
            <li>Money wise --a huge difference.     </li>
            <li>You have to warm the wax between your hands, which is fine unless you cut the strips.</li>
            <li>I love Nad&#x27;s strips, and now have them on a recurring order.  </li>
            <li>Did I mention I love these?</li>
            <li>it could be reused(note: with each re-use, there would be more and more wax residue, so it got messier and messier).</li>
            <li>I love these.</li>
            <li>They&#x27;re definitely the best wax strips out</li>
            <li>the fabric-like strips are so much better than the Sally Hansen plastic ones.</li>
            <li>For some reason that works much better for armpits.</li>
            <li>Most of the wax sticks and stays on my leg.  </li>
            <li>Nad&#x27;s needs to pay close attention because their customers will (and have) found better products.</li>
            <li>I have been around the block and continue to look for something better.  </li>
            <li>The pain is gone now, but I&#x27;m wondering when I&#x27;ll be able to leave the house.  </li>
            <li>I tried many strips.  </li>
            <li>Sure, it says you can re-use the strips</li>
            <li>You&#x27;ll spend more time applying and reapplying strips than you would shaving, but we&#x27;ll see if the hair doesn&#x27;t regrow too soon.</li>
            <li>I am sure the company will refund your money if you send the UPC and copy of the receipt.</li>
            <li>Favorite drug store waxing kit.</li>
            <li>The more you lift upward (perpendicular to skin)</li>
            <li>The oil removes the leftover wax residue and soothes your skin after yanking out your hair. :)</li>
            <li>/&gt;Since CVS bought Longs, they don&#x27;t have my fav brand, Moujan 2000, which worked really well for me before I discovered the joy of epilators.</li>
            <li>This is one of my favorite products of all time.</li>
            <li>I have not tested these on underarm hair because I have given up on being able to wax my armpits at home</li>
            <li>Now, I really feel they were a good investment because they did a great job at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li>Nad&#x27;s strips remove a pretty good amount of hair when you follow the directions.</li>
            <li>I prefer the paper as i feel it&#x27;s most contouring and easy to deal with.  </li>
            <li>They mold to your skin really well, the wax smells somewhat pleasant, and most importantly, it takes off all the hair.    </li>
            <li>The ingrowths have completely stopped -- which is great</li>
            <li>I thought these would be a better approach than playing with hot wax and spatulas... and after some tweaking, they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to rub them between your hands to warm them up...  </li>
            <li>I love the original product and would go for that in prepackaged strips in a heartbeat</li>
            <li>Easy to use, portable, and for my legs, they didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li>And they are easy to cut to size.</li>
            <li>I figured it would be easy since the strips already had the wax on them.</li>
            <li>I rubbed the strips between my hands for a while, and they peeled apart easily.</li>
            <li>The nads wax was so strong and sticky</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t tried it on more sensitive lower-bikini / Brazilian areas where I can&#x27;t get a good angle to pull the strips.  </li>
            <li>Never shaved as my leg hair is fine &amp; hubby did not want to feel his legs when he touched mine</li>
            <li>I need to reapply another strip or if the hair is of the fine type, I use my epillator.     </li>
            <li>They&#x27;re easy to use, easy to clean up (just throw away the strips), and easy to wash away.</li>
            <li>The original NADs was soluble in warm water; the substance on these strips is not although it can be melted off with extremely hot water &amp; baby oil.  </li>
            <li>I had to because they were huge</li>
            <li>I have huge bruises and irritation.</li>
            <li>Now that I was brave enough to try Nad&#x27;s beeswax strips -</li>
            <li>I could see my smooth skin in the magnifying mirror, I could feel it with my fingertips.  </li>
            <li>this product does not leave and odor and is easy to clean up.</li>
            <li>Overall - a great product.</li>
            <li>as good as professional</li>
            <li>Quick and easy.</li>
            <li>Stick with the original stuff.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my hair&#x27;s super fine or what</li>
            <li>love that these strips are ready to go!</li>
            <li>They like using the product because its clean and there are no liquid wax to deal with.</li>
            <li>I clean the area, rub the strip between my hands</li>
            <li>because of the many positive reviews for it.</li>
            <li>this products are awesome very easy, fast, gets all the hairs out and not messy like regular was... it does not hurt unless you do it for the first tie</li>
            <li>My house is at a cool 60 degrees to save on fossil fuels.</li>
            <li>The only good part?  </li>
            <li>Overall good product will buy again.</li>
            <li>It removed the hair from my back fairly well.</li>
            <li>The only nice thing about it is that when the strips are at room temp, they are easy to cut.</li>
            <li>I have a wax warmer at home which I love and use regularly, but I am looking for something that is faster and more convenient and even good for when I&#x27;m traveling, and this is definitely not it.</li>
            <li>I could have quickly counted the number of hairs the strips pulled out when I was all done.</li>
            <li>Of course they do not tell you this before hand, luckily I had some AVON gelled body oil that seemed to do the trick, but</li>
            <li>The smaller pieces are much more manageable, and they get out more hair.</li>
            <li>There are many negative reviews, but from my point of view, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li>Nad&#x27;s was fantastic when it first came out with this product a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li>I originally placed this order under subscription, but after receiving this first delivery, I will not purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li>After I was done, I applied the oil wipe as directed to get rid of the wax &amp; made my legs feel really silky smooth.    </li>
            <li>So on the plus side, you get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li>Sure it will leave you feeling smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but you&#x27;ll look like Rudolph the red sacked reindeer.</li>
            <li>So far this is my top choice for a wax strip.</li>
            <li>I love this product...works better than any other prepared wax strip I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>Just the right thickness of wax.</li>
            <li>I put them in the microwave for 30 seconds, they still slid right off my skin.</li>
            <li>Just cut the stripe to the right size and your in business.</li>
            <li>right</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used Nad&#x27;s strips in the past with great success.  </li>
            <li>out of a full pack i got 2 strips to work the rest did absolutely nothing except leave the \\&quot;wax\\</li>
            <li>Its easy to use and not messy like hot wax is.</li>
            <li>The strips are very easy to cut to size, and the aftercare wipes really get any extra wax off.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love this product normally, but the packages that were sent to me from this vendor were completely unusable.</li>
            <li>This is the first time I&#x27;ve waxed my legs &amp; I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li>It worked, I was able to use only these 2 strips for both my lower legs.</li>
            <li>Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with these wax strips.</li>
            <li>The desensitizing wipes did not serve its purpose at all, and seems more likely just a skin prep to remove any oil or residue on the skin.</li>
            <li>This is the first wax strip I&#x27;ve used that I could re-use.  </li>
            <li>Hot wax, wax strips, Zoulla, epilators, shavers, cream depilatories, foam depilatories, Veet, etc.  </li>
            <li>From my understanding, the first couple of cycles hurt but it is suppose to get easier and hair should get softer after while.</li>
            <li>Since I&#x27;d never waxed my legs before, the first time I tried these</li>
            <li>First off the desensitizing wipes</li>
            <li>If you can muster up the courage it is so much cheaper than going to the salon!</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve tried many different types.</li>
            <li>like as much as my husbands!</li>
            <li>I was skeptical about using them after reading the reviews, but they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li>They are the first waxing strips I&#x27;ve ever used, but I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li>I love them and would definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li>but when I did, they worked very well!</li>
            <li>If these can work on coarser male hair, they surely can work for a woman who wants to be well</li>
            <li>Not only did it warm the wax enough to peel the strips from one another, the wax pulled off all my hair on the first \\&quot;pull\\&quot; and did not stick to my skin!  </li>
            <li>Let me start by being bewildered at the lack of positive reviews.</li>
            <li>But anyways, the Nads Wax was super sticky, so much so that I used the same strip 4 or 5 times, each time pulling up hair cleanly.  </li>
            <li>I took a shower, made sure everything was dry, even put on some baby powder</li>
            <li>The paper isn&#x27;t strong enough to carry away the wax and hair when you pull on it.  </li>
            <li>So smart.  </li>
            <li>the mess you make with a spatula, or having to wash out muslin strips from some kind of sugaring type of hair removal.  </li>
            <li>Same stirips i picked up from CVS, they were fine.</li>
            <li>some fine, some coarse, etc.)  </li>
            <li>(Just as a note, I&#x27;m a female with light skin and very course hair).</li>
            <li>The strips come out of the box and they are huge, you could really do your legs and a hairy back with them, no problem.</li>
            <li>Although I am left with a HUGE pile of wax all over my leg.  </li>
            <li>1)Cheap and fast.</li>
            <li>I did follow another reviewers suggestion to use a blowdryer to heat them and they came apart very easilly, but that is where my satisfaction with this product ended.</li>
            <li>Without giving you too much information, lets just say I had body parts sticking together that should NOT be sticking together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I think the whole point of waxing is that you don&#x27;t have to shave.</li>
            <li>I did notice it ripped out hairs straight from the root.  </li>
            <li>I really like Nads body wax strips.  </li>
            <li>I will be really upset if this goes off the market.</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave as much residue on the skin.</li>
            <li>Much faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Very ouchy.</li>
            <li>Save the money and trouble and go for a warm wax.</li>
            <li>When first introduced they were an absolute god-send as an alternative to hot wax and the other things available at the time.  </li>
            <li>First of all, I live in Michigan.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve experimented, because the other types were quite a bit inferior.</li>
            <li>They work better than any other brand</li>
            <li>Also, on the second or third time that I use a strip, I use the blowdryer to warm it up and melt the wax onto the hairs to get a little more use out of the strip.</li>
            <li>The first couple times, I didn&#x27;t follow the directions exactly, but on the 3rd try I certainly did.</li>
            <li>pads\\&quot; they give you are actually oil based - so it glides right off!</li>
            <li>I have being waxing for the last 4 years and be paying about $76 for full leg and bikini area</li>
            <li>the finishing wipe appears dry to the look and touch, but once applied you will get a lightly greasy finish on your skin.</li>
            <li>the more it hurts, and the less hair it picks</li>
            <li>It actually felt just like yanking a band-aid off quickly.</li>
            <li>The quality has not kept up, the last pack I bought I was only able to use one of the strips.</li>
            <li>Most of the time only removes some of the hair and doesn&#x27;t always have enough \\&quot;goo\\&quot; on the strip.  </li>
            <li>but they really only work the very first time you apply them.</li>
            <li>Nads strips worked okay, took off most hair, but not all, and it says you can re-use a strip a few times, but the 2nd, 3rd times don&#x27;t work as well, not like the Moujan which you could re-use 2-3 times each and each time still worked well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I followed the directions and tried all the tips on waxing I could find and always with the same result: A fair amount of wax and most of the hair left behind.</li>
            <li>So I thought, \\&quot;Okay, maybe I need to let the hair grow a little longer before I do it.\\</li>
            <li>No blemishes, no missing chunks of skin, and best of all - no hair left behind!</li>
            <li>I know Nad&#x27;s offers a brazillian wax kit, but I really like these strips.</li>
            <li>Then I rubbed 1 strip vigorously between my palms, warming it up (or at least I felt the warm friction caused by rubbing in my hands).</li>
            <li>I try every few days just hoping that it&#x27;ll magically work, haa.</li>
            <li>I cut the strips into quarters and use about 2-3 full strips each bikini wax so the box lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>They last longer by far than the others, and they do the trick, quickly.  </li>
            <li>New trick</li>
            <li>My most expensive waxes have always left me with a burning bright red color on my sensitive for 3+ hours after waxing.</li>
            <li>I braced myself for the pain but was very surprised that I didn&#x27;t feel the pain that Steve Carrell felt in the 40-yr-old virgin.</li>
            <li>They really snag all of the hair in the area, and are gentle enough to use in, ahem, sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li>The first time I tried strips, the wax never warmed enough to stick.</li>
            <li>I lay the strips out on a small towel on a heat safe surface like my microfiber foot stool.</li>
            <li>At first I thought my hair was just too short</li>
            <li>I switched back to hot sugar wax, and while it was acceptable, the ingrowths didnt go away, and I was paying a ton of money to the salon to get it done \\&quot;right\\&quot;.     </li>
            <li>I switched to the Veet strips and they removed the hair completely!</li>
            <li>I got the Nads body wax strips because I thought it would be more convenient for vacation waxing than the usual tub of wax.</li>
            <li>I just couldn&#x27;t get them hot enough, so I microwaved them.</li>
            <li>It took time to figure out how thick/thin to put it on, and it was hard for me to heat it to the right consistency consistently. ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li>try the technique on your legs first,   before removing hair from   sensitive areas such as bikini and face.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin and tried multiple things for getting hair out: since hot wax used to cause rashes, i tried using an epillator.</li>
            <li>At first, I didn&#x27;t feel like it was sticking properly as I was able to slowly pull it off &amp; nothing happed.</li>
            <li>My only con was that i was left super sticky pre-finishing wipes.</li>
            <li>Holding the strip up to my eyes, I could see the fine hairs sticking up from the wax strip, and could even see a few darker ones.</li>
            <li>, no messy, comes with the wipes to clean up after and they really take off the stickiness right away, for those who say it does not work take into consideration how long is the hair and how hard are you pulling the strip?</li>
            <li>and it didn&#x27;t even pull off all the hair which wasn&#x27;t even much, just stray coarse hair here &amp; there.</li>
            <li>I got the packs that were 10+ years old.  </li>
            <li>I am far from a wax rookie.  </li>
            <li>it&#x27;s a completely ineffective wax that sticks to skin and doesn&#x27;t come off with the strip.  </li>
            <li>Wax strips aren&#x27;t for everyone, but you might be surprised.</li>
            <li>I tried heating in microwave, i tried the old \\&quot;iron on\\&quot; method my grandma likes, i tried the rubbing, no matter was done the wax stuck to my leg and not the strip when i pulled it away.  </li>
            <li>This is way better than the sally hansen which is a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li>If you get the strips too warm or not warm enough, you will not remove hair and may leave sticky residue.  </li>
            <li>The one con is that it took more than one time over the same area to remove the hair, which is expected from something not professional (and not boiling hot!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>No mess.  </li>
            <li>no mess.</li>
            <li>About twenty seconds was enough to get them hot enough.</li>
            <li>(Sally Hansen, even $18 an armpit downtown Spa treatments) remove my hair so quickly, painlessly, and without a drop of mess.</li>
            <li>I bought Nads Body Wax Strips as a last resort (as the wax strips I normally buy</li>
            <li>Used a new strip &amp; followed same directions &amp; YEOW!</li>
            <li>I gingerly washed with a gentle cream oil cleanser, blotted dry, and applied aloe vera gel.    </li>
            <li>Not sure how well it would work on men as they tend to have more coarse hair, but I definitely think this is a stronger-than-average wax strip.    </li>
            <li>I have large red patches throughout the treated area, which is tight, drawn and slightly crusty, have lot of tiny scab-ettes, and have actual wounds in parts where a top layer of skin seems to have been ripped off.  </li>
            <li>like I said, I can feel my jeans sticking to my leg now that the oil has apparently soaked into my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Does not work nearly as well to remove facial hair.  </li>
            <li>My sister is a professional beautician and she waxes my back for me (embarrassing, I know).</li>
            <li>One time she used these because it was all that was left (the professional wax was gone), and I wanted to go to the beach.</li>
            <li>and i can look forward to scar free legs in the next few years after the current ones fade away (hopefully).</li>
            <li>far my hair keeps growing back.</li>
            <li>I have only used them on my legs so far, but they removed the hair competely.</li>
            <li>I bought these on a whim, having only ever gotten professional waxing done before and never tried it myself.</li>
            <li>I have very fine to medium thickness hair and this product did not remove it, it just left a sticky residue behind.  </li>
            <li>For sure, though, over time it will hurt less as the regrowth is typically finer and not all hairs will regrow at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li>(I wiped same time as my legs but did this area last), or if I&#x27;m just really sensitive there.</li>
            <li>The handy dandy \\&quot;desensitizing wipe\\&quot; doesnt work worth a crap.  </li>
            <li>This really helps keep the cost down of each session.</li>
            <li>The wax strips I received were old and dry.</li>
            <li>and i had to go over every spot twice, but at the same time it only hurts about half as much.</li>
            <li>And as another reviewer noted, the little oil pads to use after really does get the excess off.</li>
            <li>in all, I find this product to be significantly easier, quicker, and less messy than wax or Nad&#x27;s from the tub.  </li>
            <li>Sally Hansen was good, but I once had a bad reaction to the strip.</li>
    </ol>


    <h2>Negative Reviews</h2>
    <ol>
            <li> &quot; in the perfect shape of the strip on my leg.</li>
            <li> These are normally excellent</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen, Moujan and these Nad&#x27;s strips, and Nad&#x27;s are the best for ME.  </li>
            <li> These strips are WONDERFUL!  </li>
            <li> Great product!</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  </li>
            <li> These strips are the best for legs!  </li>
            <li> The smell is pleasant and soothing effect is perfect.</li>
            <li> Works beautifully.</li>
            <li> Then I found beeswax strips in The Body Shop, and it worked beautifully, but they stopped selling it.</li>
            <li> I cannot tell you how HAPPY I AM.  </li>
            <li> these aren&#x27;t great for armpits.</li>
            <li> When you buy this product from a pharmacy, it works great.  </li>
            <li> I use this for my bikini and even for that tender of an area it works great.</li>
            <li> Maybe one day I&#x27;ll brave up and try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> They smell great, too.</li>
            <li> Like many of us, I have tried everything under the sun to see what works best to get rid of hair and keep it away.</li>
            <li> I always run out of the Nad&#x27;s baby oil wipes (which are very good also, but I need more quantity.</li>
            <li> Absolutely loved them.  </li>
            <li> This looked like a good idea at the time and the concept is good..</li>
            <li> This is a good product for beginners to try.</li>
            <li> great!!they smell good</li>
            <li> I do not recommend this item at all and will keep search for something better!</li>
            <li> I love them and they worked for me!</li>
            <li> I literally have to wear wool onesies to stay warm.</li>
            <li> However, the price of these on amazon is 3 times that on nad&#x27;s own website.  </li>
            <li> Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> Today I realized that my biggest mistake was getting the wax TOO warm.</li>
            <li> More preferable over Veet which is also one of the good products.  </li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because I had used Nads in the jar and really liked it.</li>
            <li> I couldn&#x27;t find that kind at my walmart, so I had to buy this stuff.</li>
            <li> don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a perfect product out there, and no matter what, brazillian waxing (all waxing, really)</li>
            <li> Honestly?</li>
            <li> I bought them to use in my underams, so I&#x27;m hoping they are as effective there as they are on my legs.</li>
            <li> I did as the box instructed and rubbed the strips between my hands to warm them, when I pulled them apart</li>
            <li> Smells good, easy to use.  </li>
            <li> Money wise --a huge difference.     </li>
            <li> You have to warm the wax between your hands, which is fine unless you cut the strips.</li>
            <li> I love Nad&#x27;s strips, and now have them on a recurring order.  </li>
            <li> Did I mention I love these?</li>
            <li> it could be reused(note: with each re-use, there would be more and more wax residue, so it got messier and messier).</li>
            <li> I love these.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re definitely the best wax strips out</li>
            <li> the fabric-like strips are so much better than the Sally Hansen plastic ones.</li>
            <li> For some reason that works much better for armpits.</li>
            <li> Most of the wax sticks and stays on my leg.  </li>
            <li> Nad&#x27;s needs to pay close attention because their customers will (and have) found better products.</li>
            <li> I have been around the block and continue to look for something better.  </li>
            <li> The pain is gone now, but I&#x27;m wondering when I&#x27;ll be able to leave the house.  </li>
            <li> I tried many strips.  </li>
            <li> Sure, it says you can re-use the strips</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll spend more time applying and reapplying strips than you would shaving, but we&#x27;ll see if the hair doesn&#x27;t regrow too soon.</li>
            <li> I am sure the company will refund your money if you send the UPC and copy of the receipt.</li>
            <li> Favorite drug store waxing kit.</li>
            <li> The more you lift upward (perpendicular to skin)</li>
            <li> The oil removes the leftover wax residue and soothes your skin after yanking out your hair. :)</li>
            <li> /&gt;Since CVS bought Longs, they don&#x27;t have my fav brand, Moujan 2000, which worked really well for me before I discovered the joy of epilators.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products of all time.</li>
            <li> I have not tested these on underarm hair because I have given up on being able to wax my armpits at home</li>
            <li> Now, I really feel they were a good investment because they did a great job at a reasonable price.</li>
            <li> Nad&#x27;s strips remove a pretty good amount of hair when you follow the directions.</li>
            <li> I prefer the paper as i feel it&#x27;s most contouring and easy to deal with.  </li>
            <li> They mold to your skin really well, the wax smells somewhat pleasant, and most importantly, it takes off all the hair.    </li>
            <li> The ingrowths have completely stopped -- which is great</li>
            <li> I thought these would be a better approach than playing with hot wax and spatulas... and after some tweaking, they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to rub them between your hands to warm them up...  </li>
            <li> I love the original product and would go for that in prepackaged strips in a heartbeat</li>
            <li> Easy to use, portable, and for my legs, they didn&#x27;t hurt at all.</li>
            <li> And they are easy to cut to size.</li>
            <li> I figured it would be easy since the strips already had the wax on them.</li>
            <li> I rubbed the strips between my hands for a while, and they peeled apart easily.</li>
            <li> The nads wax was so strong and sticky</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t tried it on more sensitive lower-bikini / Brazilian areas where I can&#x27;t get a good angle to pull the strips.  </li>
            <li> Never shaved as my leg hair is fine &amp; hubby did not want to feel his legs when he touched mine</li>
            <li> I need to reapply another strip or if the hair is of the fine type, I use my epillator.     </li>
            <li> They&#x27;re easy to use, easy to clean up (just throw away the strips), and easy to wash away.</li>
            <li> The original NADs was soluble in warm water; the substance on these strips is not although it can be melted off with extremely hot water &amp; baby oil.  </li>
            <li> I had to because they were huge</li>
            <li> I have huge bruises and irritation.</li>
            <li> Now that I was brave enough to try Nad&#x27;s beeswax strips -</li>
            <li> I could see my smooth skin in the magnifying mirror, I could feel it with my fingertips.  </li>
            <li> this product does not leave and odor and is easy to clean up.</li>
            <li> Overall - a great product.</li>
            <li> as good as professional</li>
            <li> Quick and easy.</li>
            <li> Stick with the original stuff.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my hair&#x27;s super fine or what</li>
            <li> love that these strips are ready to go!</li>
            <li> They like using the product because its clean and there are no liquid wax to deal with.</li>
            <li> I clean the area, rub the strip between my hands</li>
            <li> because of the many positive reviews for it.</li>
            <li> this products are awesome very easy, fast, gets all the hairs out and not messy like regular was... it does not hurt unless you do it for the first tie</li>
            <li> My house is at a cool 60 degrees to save on fossil fuels.</li>
            <li> The only good part?  </li>
            <li> Overall good product will buy again.</li>
            <li> It removed the hair from my back fairly well.</li>
            <li> The only nice thing about it is that when the strips are at room temp, they are easy to cut.</li>
            <li> I have a wax warmer at home which I love and use regularly, but I am looking for something that is faster and more convenient and even good for when I&#x27;m traveling, and this is definitely not it.</li>
            <li> I could have quickly counted the number of hairs the strips pulled out when I was all done.</li>
            <li> Of course they do not tell you this before hand, luckily I had some AVON gelled body oil that seemed to do the trick, but</li>
            <li> The smaller pieces are much more manageable, and they get out more hair.</li>
            <li> There are many negative reviews, but from my point of view, this is a great product.  </li>
            <li> Nad&#x27;s was fantastic when it first came out with this product a couple of years ago.  </li>
            <li> I originally placed this order under subscription, but after receiving this first delivery, I will not purchase from this vendor again.</li>
            <li> After I was done, I applied the oil wipe as directed to get rid of the wax &amp; made my legs feel really silky smooth.    </li>
            <li> So on the plus side, you get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
            <li> Sure it will leave you feeling smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but you&#x27;ll look like Rudolph the red sacked reindeer.</li>
            <li> So far this is my top choice for a wax strip.</li>
            <li> I love this product...works better than any other prepared wax strip I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
            <li> right?</li>
            <li> Just the right thickness of wax.</li>
            <li> I put them in the microwave for 30 seconds, they still slid right off my skin.</li>
            <li> Just cut the stripe to the right size and your in business.</li>
            <li> right</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nad&#x27;s strips in the past with great success.  </li>
            <li> out of a full pack i got 2 strips to work the rest did absolutely nothing except leave the \\&quot;wax\\</li>
            <li> Its easy to use and not messy like hot wax is.</li>
            <li> The strips are very easy to cut to size, and the aftercare wipes really get any extra wax off.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love this product normally, but the packages that were sent to me from this vendor were completely unusable.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve waxed my legs &amp; I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> It worked, I was able to use only these 2 strips for both my lower legs.</li>
            <li> Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with these wax strips.</li>
            <li> The desensitizing wipes did not serve its purpose at all, and seems more likely just a skin prep to remove any oil or residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> This is the first wax strip I&#x27;ve used that I could re-use.  </li>
            <li> Hot wax, wax strips, Zoulla, epilators, shavers, cream depilatories, foam depilatories, Veet, etc.  </li>
            <li> From my understanding, the first couple of cycles hurt but it is suppose to get easier and hair should get softer after while.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;d never waxed my legs before, the first time I tried these</li>
            <li> First off the desensitizing wipes</li>
            <li> If you can muster up the courage it is so much cheaper than going to the salon!</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve tried many different types.</li>
            <li> like as much as my husbands!</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about using them after reading the reviews, but they&#x27;re great!</li>
            <li> They are the first waxing strips I&#x27;ve ever used, but I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
            <li> I love them and would definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> but when I did, they worked very well!</li>
            <li> If these can work on coarser male hair, they surely can work for a woman who wants to be well</li>
            <li> Not only did it warm the wax enough to peel the strips from one another, the wax pulled off all my hair on the first \\&quot;pull\\&quot; and did not stick to my skin!  </li>
            <li> Let me start by being bewildered at the lack of positive reviews.</li>
            <li> But anyways, the Nads Wax was super sticky, so much so that I used the same strip 4 or 5 times, each time pulling up hair cleanly.  </li>
            <li> I took a shower, made sure everything was dry, even put on some baby powder</li>
            <li> The paper isn&#x27;t strong enough to carry away the wax and hair when you pull on it.  </li>
            <li> So smart.  </li>
            <li> the mess you make with a spatula, or having to wash out muslin strips from some kind of sugaring type of hair removal.  </li>
            <li> Same stirips i picked up from CVS, they were fine.</li>
            <li> some fine, some coarse, etc.)  </li>
            <li> (Just as a note, I&#x27;m a female with light skin and very course hair).</li>
            <li> The strips come out of the box and they are huge, you could really do your legs and a hairy back with them, no problem.</li>
            <li> Although I am left with a HUGE pile of wax all over my leg.  </li>
            <li> 1)Cheap and fast.</li>
            <li> I did follow another reviewers suggestion to use a blowdryer to heat them and they came apart very easilly, but that is where my satisfaction with this product ended.</li>
            <li> Without giving you too much information, lets just say I had body parts sticking together that should NOT be sticking together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I think the whole point of waxing is that you don&#x27;t have to shave.</li>
            <li> I did notice it ripped out hairs straight from the root.  </li>
            <li> I really like Nads body wax strips.  </li>
            <li> I will be really upset if this goes off the market.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave as much residue on the skin.</li>
            <li> Much faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Very ouchy.</li>
            <li> Save the money and trouble and go for a warm wax.</li>
            <li> When first introduced they were an absolute god-send as an alternative to hot wax and the other things available at the time.  </li>
            <li> First of all, I live in Michigan.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve experimented, because the other types were quite a bit inferior.</li>
            <li> They work better than any other brand</li>
            <li> Also, on the second or third time that I use a strip, I use the blowdryer to warm it up and melt the wax onto the hairs to get a little more use out of the strip.</li>
            <li> The first couple times, I didn&#x27;t follow the directions exactly, but on the 3rd try I certainly did.</li>
            <li> pads\\&quot; they give you are actually oil based - so it glides right off!</li>
            <li> I have being waxing for the last 4 years and be paying about $76 for full leg and bikini area</li>
            <li> the finishing wipe appears dry to the look and touch, but once applied you will get a lightly greasy finish on your skin.</li>
            <li> the more it hurts, and the less hair it picks</li>
            <li> It actually felt just like yanking a band-aid off quickly.</li>
            <li> The quality has not kept up, the last pack I bought I was only able to use one of the strips.</li>
            <li> Most of the time only removes some of the hair and doesn&#x27;t always have enough \\&quot;goo\\&quot; on the strip.  </li>
            <li> but they really only work the very first time you apply them.</li>
            <li> Nads strips worked okay, took off most hair, but not all, and it says you can re-use a strip a few times, but the 2nd, 3rd times don&#x27;t work as well, not like the Moujan which you could re-use 2-3 times each and each time still worked well.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I followed the directions and tried all the tips on waxing I could find and always with the same result: A fair amount of wax and most of the hair left behind.</li>
            <li> So I thought, \\&quot;Okay, maybe I need to let the hair grow a little longer before I do it.\\</li>
            <li> No blemishes, no missing chunks of skin, and best of all - no hair left behind!</li>
            <li> I know Nad&#x27;s offers a brazillian wax kit, but I really like these strips.</li>
            <li> Then I rubbed 1 strip vigorously between my palms, warming it up (or at least I felt the warm friction caused by rubbing in my hands).</li>
            <li> I try every few days just hoping that it&#x27;ll magically work, haa.</li>
            <li> I cut the strips into quarters and use about 2-3 full strips each bikini wax so the box lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> They last longer by far than the others, and they do the trick, quickly.  </li>
            <li> New trick</li>
            <li> My most expensive waxes have always left me with a burning bright red color on my sensitive for 3+ hours after waxing.</li>
            <li> I braced myself for the pain but was very surprised that I didn&#x27;t feel the pain that Steve Carrell felt in the 40-yr-old virgin.</li>
            <li> They really snag all of the hair in the area, and are gentle enough to use in, ahem, sensitive areas.  </li>
            <li> The first time I tried strips, the wax never warmed enough to stick.</li>
            <li> I lay the strips out on a small towel on a heat safe surface like my microfiber foot stool.</li>
            <li> At first I thought my hair was just too short</li>
            <li> I switched back to hot sugar wax, and while it was acceptable, the ingrowths didnt go away, and I was paying a ton of money to the salon to get it done \\&quot;right\\&quot;.     </li>
            <li> I switched to the Veet strips and they removed the hair completely!</li>
            <li> I got the Nads body wax strips because I thought it would be more convenient for vacation waxing than the usual tub of wax.</li>
            <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get them hot enough, so I microwaved them.</li>
            <li> It took time to figure out how thick/thin to put it on, and it was hard for me to heat it to the right consistency consistently. ;)&lt;br</li>
            <li> try the technique on your legs first,   before removing hair from   sensitive areas such as bikini and face.\\&quot;    </li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tried multiple things for getting hair out: since hot wax used to cause rashes, i tried using an epillator.</li>
            <li> At first, I didn&#x27;t feel like it was sticking properly as I was able to slowly pull it off &amp; nothing happed.</li>
            <li> My only con was that i was left super sticky pre-finishing wipes.</li>
            <li> Holding the strip up to my eyes, I could see the fine hairs sticking up from the wax strip, and could even see a few darker ones.</li>
            <li> , no messy, comes with the wipes to clean up after and they really take off the stickiness right away, for those who say it does not work take into consideration how long is the hair and how hard are you pulling the strip?</li>
            <li> and it didn&#x27;t even pull off all the hair which wasn&#x27;t even much, just stray coarse hair here &amp; there.</li>
            <li> I got the packs that were 10+ years old.  </li>
            <li> I am far from a wax rookie.  </li>
            <li> it&#x27;s a completely ineffective wax that sticks to skin and doesn&#x27;t come off with the strip.  </li>
            <li> Wax strips aren&#x27;t for everyone, but you might be surprised.</li>
            <li> I tried heating in microwave, i tried the old \\&quot;iron on\\&quot; method my grandma likes, i tried the rubbing, no matter was done the wax stuck to my leg and not the strip when i pulled it away.  </li>
            <li> This is way better than the sally hansen which is a total waste of time and money.</li>
            <li> If you get the strips too warm or not warm enough, you will not remove hair and may leave sticky residue.  </li>
            <li> The one con is that it took more than one time over the same area to remove the hair, which is expected from something not professional (and not boiling hot!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> No mess.  </li>
            <li> no mess.</li>
            <li> About twenty seconds was enough to get them hot enough.</li>
            <li> (Sally Hansen, even $18 an armpit downtown Spa treatments) remove my hair so quickly, painlessly, and without a drop of mess.</li>
            <li> I bought Nads Body Wax Strips as a last resort (as the wax strips I normally buy</li>
            <li> Used a new strip &amp; followed same directions &amp; YEOW!</li>
            <li> I gingerly washed with a gentle cream oil cleanser, blotted dry, and applied aloe vera gel.    </li>
            <li> Not sure how well it would work on men as they tend to have more coarse hair, but I definitely think this is a stronger-than-average wax strip.    </li>
            <li> I have large red patches throughout the treated area, which is tight, drawn and slightly crusty, have lot of tiny scab-ettes, and have actual wounds in parts where a top layer of skin seems to have been ripped off.  </li>
            <li> like I said, I can feel my jeans sticking to my leg now that the oil has apparently soaked into my skin.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Does not work nearly as well to remove facial hair.  </li>
            <li> My sister is a professional beautician and she waxes my back for me (embarrassing, I know).</li>
            <li> One time she used these because it was all that was left (the professional wax was gone), and I wanted to go to the beach.</li>
            <li> and i can look forward to scar free legs in the next few years after the current ones fade away (hopefully).</li>
            <li> far my hair keeps growing back.</li>
            <li> I have only used them on my legs so far, but they removed the hair competely.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim, having only ever gotten professional waxing done before and never tried it myself.</li>
            <li> I have very fine to medium thickness hair and this product did not remove it, it just left a sticky residue behind.  </li>
            <li> For sure, though, over time it will hurt less as the regrowth is typically finer and not all hairs will regrow at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
            <li> (I wiped same time as my legs but did this area last), or if I&#x27;m just really sensitive there.</li>
            <li> The handy dandy \\&quot;desensitizing wipe\\&quot; doesnt work worth a crap.  </li>
            <li> This really helps keep the cost down of each session.</li>
            <li> The wax strips I received were old and dry.</li>
            <li> and i had to go over every spot twice, but at the same time it only hurts about half as much.</li>
            <li> And as another reviewer noted, the little oil pads to use after really does get the excess off.</li>
            <li> in all, I find this product to be significantly easier, quicker, and less messy than wax or Nad&#x27;s from the tub.  </li>
            <li> Sally Hansen was good, but I once had a bad reaction to the strip.</li>
            <li> I use the numbing cloth first, let it dry for a few minutes while I cut the strip, and follow up with the soothing pad.  </li>
            <li> These strips really do work, but only if the strips are not old or dried out.  </li>
            <li> you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend on being VERY careful.</li>
            <li> In my quest to find a new, quicker hair removal product, I purchased a few different things today and one of them was the Nads body hair removal strips.</li>
            <li> It stayed too soft so it left a gooey mess on my legs instead of sticking to the paper.</li>
            <li> I used these on my arms and when getting to sensitive areas like the inner elbow and wrist, the force of removing the strips actually burst some blood vessels and heavily bruised my skin.</li>
            <li> like they put gel on a piece of toilet paper.  </li>
            <li> But after a few tries I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s me.</li>
            <li> Did the same on the other leg/strip, same effect.</li>
            <li> I thought it went rather well - not too painful, and effective.  </li>
            <li> , he doesn&#x27;t care as long as I&#x27;m not in pain.     </li>
            <li> However, these strips left minimal residue and the \\&quot;remover</li>
            <li> I have been waxing various body parts for years, so I&#x27;ve tried a wide variety of wax products.  </li>
            <li> I could never reuse those strips, probably due to the lesser amount of wax on the strip.</li>
            <li> I can see from other reviews that they&#x27;ve had similar experiences.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll never go back to the other.  </li>
            <li> it didnt work at all and left a gross stinky substance on my body and the little pads</li>
            <li> Followed directions by rubbing the desensitizing wipes all over my lower legs &amp; bikini area &amp; letting it dry.</li>
            <li> Using wax strips for legs is so much easier and less of a mess than using the pot of wax, but I agree with the other reviewer-</li>
            <li> After reading the instructions and following them to a T, all I got was a lot of pain (and I&#x27;ve been professionally waxed), a sticky mess, and pinched skin with even a few blood blisters from the pulling.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my package was old, but I just opened it up</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m left with unbelievably tender armpits and only about 1/3 of the hair gone.</li>
            <li> An hour later, as my skin bloomed an awful pink and the mild stinging flared into true hurt.  </li>
            <li> haven&#x27;t used these strips on other areas yet, but if you&#x27;re having difficulty on other areas you may want to try cutting the strips into halves or quarters to see if you get better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> If their dry when you open them, a few drops of water revives them).</li>
            <li> Once you split the two strips apart, you can fold each half in the middle of itself to put it back under the heating pad and use at least a second time.</li>
            <li> So having had \\&quot;wax experience\\&quot; as the directions noted, yesterday afternoon after carefully reading the directions, I did my chin area to get rid of the stragglers.  </li>
            <li> Once the strips are applied you are in really big trouble.  </li>
            <li> ABSOLUTELY DO NOT buy this product.  </li>
            <li> Total waste of time.  </li>
            <li> I tried using it as directed as I normally do, after the product failed in this usage, I tried heating it with a hair dryer, which led to the same results.</li>
            <li> It leaves so much wax behind that moving your arms up and down</li>
            <li> The wax completely separated from the strip, what a mess!!!  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to the desensitizing wipe&#x27;s effectiveness wearing out before I tried to wax my bikini area by my thighs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for wax on paper strips as opposed to the plastic strips you&#x27;ll find with sally hansen or some other brands.  </li>
            <li> They stuck to each other and the adhesive side was not useable.  </li>
            <li> enough for an amateur</li>
            <li> I usually use a different brand but thought I would try NADS because they were cheaper.</li>
            <li> I used to use the other brand of wax, but then heard about Nads.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried some other waxing strips, I believe it was Sally Hansen.</li>
            <li> I should note that I&#x27;ve been waxing for years and have used this type of wax strip before from other brands and had no problem.</li>
            <li> and I have not tried this on bikini/brazil areas due to their size.</li>
            <li> My skin may bleed a little and stays pink and tender for about a day afterwards</li>
            <li> Not fun.</li>
            <li> I boiled water for the express purpose of holding the strips against the outside of the pot to heat them, this level of heat made the strip at least stick to me...</li>
            <li> like that it is natural &amp; in strip form, convenient, but not great.</li>
            <li> It took a few tries to get the angle</li>
            <li> Only a few hairs got left behind.</li>
            <li> Pulled strip apart &amp; laid each strip on each leg rubbing down until it stuck.     </li>
            <li> has gone WAY DOWN</li>
            <li> The box said the strip can be folded in half, rubbing it between my palms &amp; reusing again.</li>
            <li> And the after care wipes were slightly oily and seem to sooth well.</li>
            <li> it works half way</li>
            <li> So I&#x27;ve fussed a bit to figure what I could do to make it less</li>
            <li> It seems slightly softer and its growth pattern is a bit patchy.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately if you don&#x27;t pull them off quickly enough, the wax sticks to your skin, and I&#x27;ve tried three different ways to wash it off and it just won&#x27;t seem to.&lt;br</li>
            <li> My husband&#x27;s away on business for a week, so he&#x27;s not here to see the mess I&#x27;ve become.  </li>
            <li> When I applied a wax strip to my leg, it ripped, leaving a sticky mess of wax without even removing any hair.</li>
            <li> If you like tons of goopy mess, tons of hassle with virtually no hair removal this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> It is a cheap and inefficient way to wax legs and ends up being a waste of money instead :(</li>
            <li> I had to use both \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; wet wipe things to try and pry this crap off my leg and it left the hair behind.  </li>
            <li> The strips removed some of the hair, but so little that I had to tweeze afterward.</li>
            <li> A little tip to maximizing the use of these strips.</li>
            <li> Other than that, don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
            <li> But with their plastic strips it just felt like putting packaging tape on and ripping it off with little to no results.</li>
            <li> 4)Minimal residue left behind - wax remover pads in box are oil based and remove any residue like a dream.  </li>
            <li> WASTE OF MONEY ..</li>
            <li> &quot; part were dried out (2 out of the 12 strips were useable).  </li>
            <li> and the strips are so dried out.  </li>
            <li> This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, yet my hair is stubborn and difficult to remove.  </li>
            <li> I like Veet a lot, but it leaves a lot of messy residue.</li>
            <li> What a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve never had trouble with skin ripping.  </li>
            <li> I was about to be disappointed but then followed the directions by holding skin taut &amp; quickly yanking the strip upwards toward me (against the root).</li>
            <li> Instead the paper shreds and leaves you with the wax still stuck to your hair/body and no easy way to remove it.  </li>
            <li> yesterday I did some grooming by myself (on my upper arms), and hated them at first, until I figured out that you rip the strips off against the growth.</li>
            <li> , I&#x27;m a little nervous with their hard wax in the brazillian kit.</li>
            <li> I have had my brows waxed professionally for 15 years, and always either had hair left behind or had a bad skin reaction.  </li>
            <li> What I&#x27;m disappointed in is that it only came with 2 pkts each of the desensitizing &amp; oil wipes, &amp; I only used 3 out of the 17 strips!</li>
            <li> I have always loathed wax strips, because they are usually warmed by briskly rubbing in the palm.</li>
            <li> I usually have to take 15 minutes after waxing just to get bits of wax off of my skin with baby oil.</li>
            <li> (mind you strips always have been my most hated!)</li>
            <li> I have also noticed the redness I usually experience after waxing at home is already gone after 15 minutes.</li>
            <li> Also included are 4 small packages containing 2 each of desensitizing wipes and after wax soothing wipes.</li>
            <li> You&#x27;ll ruin several of these (fairly expensive) strips before you get one pair to work.  </li>
            <li> when I pulled the strip off, no more than five hairs came off on one strip, some had none.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s always uncomfortable to wax, this experience was no different.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, when I pulled the strip back all of the wax was still on my leg.</li>
            <li> I am not sure why the 1 star reviews are warming them up at all.  </li>
            <li> This product is very messy too.</li>
            <li> am now sticky, broke, and confused as I contemplate other hair removal options.</li>
            <li> They are MESSY and the wax is EXTREMELY HARD TO REMOVE!</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s also less painful if you tear it off as parrallel and as close to your skin as possible.</li>
            <li> I learned the hard way...</li>
            <li> (hard wax)...</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions so far.</li>
            <li> The areas I waxed were my underarm and bikini, and the wax strips were not effective at all.</li>
            <li> I am returning them to the store in hopes of a refund or at least store credit to try another brand.</li>
            <li> My biggest complaint was the wax.</li>
            <li> (at least that.)</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there is so much negative feedback on this product.</li>
            <li> I can use one strip at least twice on my legs</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly trying the strips.</li>
            <li> Just peel apart (very slowly), apply to area, rub your hand across it a few times, and voila!  </li>
            <li> On the negative side, they DO NOT WORK!  </li>
            <li> : Take a cold water bottle and use that to rub the strip down.</li>
            <li> used to bleach them but got tired of it &amp; wanted to try waxing.</li>
            <li> Now I was skeptical that warming this suckers with my bone-thin freezing palms was going to do anything.</li>
            <li> Not happy and will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> So that you end up with approximately 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch square waxing surface.</li>
            <li> Really, a painful mess.  </li>
            <li> I will neverpay expensive spa prices or buy messy honey-wax(every time I buy those expensive wax tubs they end up spilling in my drawers!</li>
            <li> I had previously used Nads wand type product and thought I&#x27;d give this a try as it seemed to be easier to use; however, was disappointed.  </li>
            <li> but then the hot wax is worst and risky painful.</li>
            <li> Painful and not very good at removing hair.</li>
            <li> but this wax is useless to me.</li>
            <li> I figured I&#x27;d done something wrong.</li>
            <li> I had tried sally henson before and found the thing to be useless.</li>
            <li> This product is useless.</li>
            <li> Compared to Nair which smells terrible all day long (and people may know what you have been upto)</li>
            <li> Very frustrating, painful ordeal.</li>
            <li> The bad: bikini area.</li>
            <li> I know there are a lot of bad reviews on this product, but give these waxing strips a chance.</li>
            <li> 2)Minimally painful.</li>
            <li> I think it would be way too painful to epilate after just shaving all winter.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Nad&#x27;s body wax strips and was disappointed.</li>
            <li> Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> I, rather stupidly, decided to try another strip to pull the wax off and then had 2 layers of wax stuck to my leg.</li>
            <li> If you hate it</li>
            <li> my epilator broke, so I needed something (I hate shaving) until I got it replaced.&lt;br</li>
            <li> These strips didn&#x27;t make me break out, burn or turn ugly colors!</li>
            <li> I hated the nair wax strips-it did not remove any hair.</li>
            <li> words cant express how badly i hated this item</li>
            <li> i hated it and will never suggest this product to anyone</li>
            <li> Very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> These strips are horrible.</li>
            <li> They are absolutely HORRIBLE.  </li>
            <li> and they are horrible!  </li>
            <li> This product is horrible.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible!</li>
            <li> yeah very expensive!!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I have tried a lot of different types of waxing products, and need it to multitask-- legs, underarms and bikini zone.  I had also tried strips before, and they just didn&#x27;t seem to work that well.  I love Nad&#x27;s strips, and now have them on a recurring order.  They really snag all of the hair in the area, and are gentle enough to use in, ahem, sensitive areas.  There is no comparison to heating up a tub of wax and the mess you make with a spatula, or having to wash out muslin strips from some kind of sugaring type of hair removal.  No mess.  The strips are very easy to cut to size, and the aftercare wipes really get any extra wax off.&lt;br /&gt;Quick tip:  I keep my hair dryer out when I am waxing, and use that to heat up the strips, rather than rubbing them between my hands forever.  Also, on the second or third time that I use a strip, I use the blowdryer to warm it up and melt the wax onto the hairs to get a little more use out of the strip.</li>
            <li> I love this product normally, but the packages that were sent to me from this vendor were completely unusable. No matter how I tried to use it the wax stuck only to my skin and was not removed when pulling the strip off the skin. Instead the strips would rip or would come off leaving the wax remaining on the skin. I tried using it as directed as I normally do, after the product failed in this usage, I tried heating it with a hair dryer, which led to the same results. Very frustrating, painful ordeal. I originally placed this order under subscription, but after receiving this first delivery, I will not purchase from this vendor again. Very, very disappointed.</li>
            <li> This is the first time I&#x27;ve waxed my legs &amp; I&#x27;m in my mid-30&#x27;s. Never shaved as my leg hair is fine &amp; hubby did not want to feel his legs when he touched mine (his words); used to bleach them but got tired of it &amp; wanted to try waxing. Found this in Target yesterday, 10 pcs/20 strips, comes with 2 pkts of desensitizing wipes &amp; 2 pks of oil wipes. Tried it out last night.    Followed directions by rubbing the desensitizing wipes all over my lower legs &amp; bikini area &amp; letting it dry. Then I rubbed 1 strip vigorously between my palms, warming it up (or at least I felt the warm friction caused by rubbing in my hands). Pulled strip apart &amp; laid each strip on each leg rubbing down until it stuck.     At first, I didn&#x27;t feel like it was sticking properly as I was able to slowly pull it off &amp; nothing happed. I was about to be disappointed but then followed the directions by holding skin taut &amp; quickly yanking the strip upwards toward me (against the root). I braced myself for the pain but was very surprised that I didn&#x27;t feel the pain that Steve Carrell felt in the 40-yr-old virgin. It actually felt just like yanking a band-aid off quickly. Did the same on the other leg/strip, same effect. Yes! It took off 99% of the hair!     The box said the strip can be folded in half, rubbing it between my palms &amp; reusing again. It worked, I was able to use only these 2 strips for both my lower legs. After I was done, I applied the oil wipe as directed to get rid of the wax &amp; made my legs feel really silky smooth.    The bad: bikini area. Says not for genitals but works for bikini line. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s due to the desensitizing wipe&#x27;s effectiveness wearing out before I tried to wax my bikini area by my thighs (I wiped same time as my legs but did this area last), or if I&#x27;m just really sensitive there. Used a new strip &amp; followed same directions &amp; YEOW! It hurt! and it didn&#x27;t even pull off all the hair which wasn&#x27;t even much, just stray coarse hair here &amp; there. Tried again &amp; it hurtmore, this time the skin was red. I stopped, rubbed the oil wipe, &amp; hubby told me not to do it again, he doesn&#x27;t care as long as I&#x27;m not in pain.     Overall, I&#x27;m satisfied with these wax strips. Easy to use, portable, and for my legs, they didn&#x27;t hurt at all. I wouldn&#x27;t use it again on my bikini area, I&#x27;ll stick to shaving or tweezing (if I can bear it) for that. What I&#x27;m disappointed in is that it only came with 2 pkts each of the desensitizing &amp; oil wipes, &amp; I only used 3 out of the 17 strips! Box says to use baby oil if out of oil wipes but doesn&#x27;t give an alternative for the desensitizing wipes, so I&#x27;m gonna search if that&#x27;s being sold separately. I don&#x27;t know how my leg hair will grow later but I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that it won&#x27;t be coarse.</li>
            <li> Let me start by being bewildered at the lack of positive reviews. I have tried EVERYTHING under the sun to remove hair from my arms. I have even tried wax strips before (never these!). I have always loathed wax strips, because they are usually warmed by briskly rubbing in the palm. The first time I tried strips, the wax never warmed enough to stick. The second time, the wax stuck to my skin but didn&#x27;t peel off. Now that I was brave enough to try Nad&#x27;s beeswax strips - I cannot tell you how HAPPY I AM.  First of all, I live in Michigan. It&#x27;s mid-January and there is 3 inches of snow on the ground. My house is at a cool 60 degrees to save on fossil fuels. I literally have to wear wool onesies to stay warm. Now I was skeptical that warming this suckers with my bone-thin freezing palms was going to do anything. But somehow, it did! Not only did it warm the wax enough to peel the strips from one another, the wax pulled off all my hair on the first \\&quot;pull\\&quot; and did not stick to my skin!  I have never had a product (Sally Hansen, even $18 an armpit downtown Spa treatments) remove my hair so quickly, painlessly, and without a drop of mess. I usually have to take 15 minutes after waxing just to get bits of wax off of my skin with baby oil. However, these strips left minimal residue and the \\&quot;remover pads\\&quot; they give you are actually oil based - so it glides right off! So smart.  I didn&#x27;t even buy these off Amazon, but I just had to leave a review because I was so amazed. I will never buy anything else again.  To sum it all up:  1)Cheap and fast. Not even my $18 per armpit spa treatments can compare.  2)Minimally painful. I didn&#x27;t even flinch!  3)Wax heats well between palms (even in my 60 degree winter household!)  4)Minimal residue left behind - wax remover pads in box are oil based and remove any residue like a dream.  5)Out of the 25+ products I have tried (mind you strips always have been my most hated!) these turned out to be a grocery-store clearance miracle. I will neverpay expensive spa prices or buy messy honey-wax(every time I buy those expensive wax tubs they end up spilling in my drawers! and applying them is a nightmare) again! I am 100% hooked and 100% thankful.  Did I mention I love these? I have also noticed the redness I usually experience after waxing at home is already gone after 15 minutes. My most expensive waxes have always left me with a burning bright red color on my sensitive for 3+ hours after waxing. These strips didn&#x27;t make me break out, burn or turn ugly colors! Thank you, Ned&#x27;s!</li>
            <li> In my quest to find a new, quicker hair removal product, I purchased a few different things today and one of them was the Nads body hair removal strips. (Just as a note, I&#x27;m a female with light skin and very course hair). Included in the box were 24 strips which each cover about the area of one side of your bikini line. Also included are 4 small packages containing 2 each of desensitizing wipes and after wax soothing wipes. The desensitizing wipes did not serve its purpose at all, and seems more likely just a skin prep to remove any oil or residue on the skin. And the after care wipes were slightly oily and seem to sooth well. The areas I waxed were my underarm and bikini, and the wax strips were not effective at all. I could have quickly counted the number of hairs the strips pulled out when I was all done. I did follow another reviewers suggestion to use a blowdryer to heat them and they came apart very easilly, but that is where my satisfaction with this product ended. I have a wax warmer at home which I love and use regularly, but I am looking for something that is faster and more convenient and even good for when I&#x27;m traveling, and this is definitely not it. I do not recommend this item at all and will keep search for something better!</li>
            <li> I love this product...works better than any other prepared wax strip I&#x27;ve used.  However, the price of these on amazon is 3 times that on nad&#x27;s own website.  $4 for a pack of 12!!</li>
            <li> So I just used these strips (they were on sale at Target for about $6). They include pre-wipes, wax strips, and post-wipes.     I&#x27;ve been looking for wax on paper strips as opposed to the plastic strips you&#x27;ll find with sally hansen or some other brands.  I prefer the paper as i feel it&#x27;s most contouring and easy to deal with.  Plastic strips seem too rigid for my tastes.  But anyways, the Nads Wax was super sticky, so much so that I used the same strip 4 or 5 times, each time pulling up hair cleanly.  This is the first wax strip I&#x27;ve used that I could re-use.  Sally hansen used to have a paper wax strip, but I think they discontinued it.  I could never reuse those strips, probably due to the lesser amount of wax on the strip. The nads wax was so strong and sticky it could be reused(note: with each re-use, there would be more and more wax residue, so it got messier and messier). I followed the instructions and just a note:  the finishing wipe appears dry to the look and touch, but once applied you will get a lightly greasy finish on your skin. They worked well enough in dissolving the stickiness.    All in all, I definitely recommend this product.  Not sure how well it would work on men as they tend to have more coarse hair, but I definitely think this is a stronger-than-average wax strip.    My only con was that i was left super sticky pre-finishing wipes.</li>
            <li> I love these. They&#x27;re definitely the best wax strips out there- the fabric-like strips are so much better than the Sally Hansen plastic ones. They mold to your skin really well, the wax smells somewhat pleasant, and most importantly, it takes off all the hair.    Using wax strips for legs is so much easier and less of a mess than using the pot of wax, but I agree with the other reviewer- these aren&#x27;t great for armpits. In that case, I would recommend using regular heated wax. For some reason that works much better for armpits.</li>
            <li> These strips are horrible. Most of the wax sticks and stays on my leg.  My skin got red because while removing the wax was staying back on my legs instead of sticking to the strip.  Same stirips i picked up from CVS, they were fine.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used Nad&#x27;s strips in the past with great success.  Absolutely loved them.  But the strips I got are either A)Quality control has gone WAY DOWN HILL or B) I got the packs that were 10+ years old.  The wax sticks to your face and doesn&#x27;t come off with the pull so you are left with globs of strip on your face that you have to painstakingly rub off with rubbing alcohol.  I can see from other reviews that they&#x27;ve had similar experiences.  Nad&#x27;s needs to pay close attention because their customers will (and have) found better products.</li>
            <li> Smells good, easy to use.  You can cut these into smaller pieces for smaller areas (like on the face).  At times they leave sticky stuff on your face, so do it before you shower.</li>
            <li> Yes, I know it&#x27;s sold as a body hair remover.    Quoting from the back of the box:     \\&quot;If you have no wax experience,   try the technique on your legs first,   before removing hair from   sensitive areas such as bikini and face.\\&quot;    I was emboldened.  I am far from a wax rookie.  Like many of us, I have tried everything under the sun to see what works best to get rid of hair and keep it away. Hot wax, wax strips, Zoulla, epilators, shavers, cream depilatories, foam depilatories, Veet, etc.  I&#x27;ve visited professionals for electrolysis and laser.  I have been around the block and continue to look for something better.  My hair&#x27;s not all that hideous, it&#x27;s just one thing I would like done well.    So having had \\&quot;wax experience\\&quot; as the directions noted, yesterday afternoon after carefully reading the directions, I did my chin area to get rid of the stragglers.  I thought it went rather well - not too painful, and effective.  I could see my smooth skin in the magnifying mirror, I could feel it with my fingertips.  Holding the strip up to my eyes, I could see the fine hairs sticking up from the wax strip, and could even see a few darker ones. I used one of the (only two) provided oily \\&quot;soothing and finishing wipes\\&quot; which helps take off any stray wax and thought it was a job well done, until...    An hour later, as my skin bloomed an awful pink and the mild stinging flared into true hurt.  I thought perhaps the irritation source was remaining wax so I went over the treated area again with one of those soothing and finishing wipes, and patiently waited.  Bedtime came and my lower face looked as though I&#x27;d been napalmed.  I gingerly washed with a gentle cream oil cleanser, blotted dry, and applied aloe vera gel.    This morning, and up til now, almost 24 hours later, my face has descended into skin hell and shows no signs of ascending.  I have large red patches throughout the treated area, which is tight, drawn and slightly crusty, have lot of tiny scab-ettes, and have actual wounds in parts where a top layer of skin seems to have been ripped off.  I&#x27;m so redly blotchy that from a distance, you&#x27;d think I had cystic acne. Up close, you&#x27;d wonder who threw acid in my face.     The pain is gone now, but I&#x27;m wondering when I&#x27;ll be able to leave the house.  The only good part?  My husband&#x27;s away on business for a week, so he&#x27;s not here to see the mess I&#x27;ve become.  Oh, and by the way... I still see some hairs that the devil&#x27;s goop missed.    Grades:  Hair removal: 4.0  Skin integrity post-wax: 0</li>
            <li> I have heard about Nad&#x27;s for years and finally bought a box of these strips. After reading the instructions and following them to a T, all I got was a lot of pain (and I&#x27;ve been professionally waxed), a sticky mess, and pinched skin with even a few blood blisters from the pulling. The strips removed some of the hair, but so little that I had to tweeze afterward. What&#x27;s the point of using these, then? I am returning them to the store in hopes of a refund or at least store credit to try another brand.</li>
            <li> This looked like a good idea at the time and the concept is good.. the product is NOT.  I thought this was going to be the same \\&quot;sugar\\&quot; product as the nads in a tub.  It&#x27;s NOT.. it&#x27;s a completely ineffective wax that sticks to skin and doesn&#x27;t come off with the strip.  WASTE OF MONEY .. I had to use both \\&quot;clean up\\&quot; wet wipe things to try and pry this crap off my leg and it left the hair behind.  I love the original product and would go for that in prepackaged strips in a heartbeat but this wax is useless to me.</li>
            <li> These strips really do work, but only if the strips are not old or dried out.  I received the pack of 2 from this vendor and the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; part were dried out (2 out of the 12 strips were useable).  They stuck to each other and the adhesive side was not useable.  When you buy this product from a pharmacy, it works great.  I would not recommend buying this product from the current vendor.  Buy at your own risk.</li>
            <li> it works half way and i had to go over every spot twice, but at the same time it only hurts about half as much.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use this, its for the women in the family. These wax strip works. From my understanding, the first couple of cycles hurt but it is suppose to get easier and hair should get softer after while. They like using the product because its clean and there are no liquid wax to deal with.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using NAD&#x27;s products since the mid 1990&#x27;s.  When first introduced they were an absolute god-send as an alternative to hot wax and the other things available at the time.  Since then, NAD&#x27;s products have been declining in quality and they hit rock-bottom with these strips.  They are absolutely HORRIBLE.  The strips are supposed to activate by warming them between your hands.  In fact, you need to use a hair-dryer to melt them enough so the strips separate without tearing the cheezy paper that has replaced the cloth applicator.  You&#x27;ll ruin several of these (fairly expensive) strips before you get one pair to work.  Once the strips are applied you are in really big trouble.  The paper isn&#x27;t strong enough to carry away the wax and hair when you pull on it.  Instead the paper shreds and leaves you with the wax still stuck to your hair/body and no easy way to remove it.  The original NADs was soluble in warm water; the substance on these strips is not although it can be melted off with extremely hot water &amp; baby oil.  In short, this is a rotten, ROTTEN product.  Stick with the original stuff.</li>
            <li> OH MY GOSH!  I just got done \\&quot;using\\&quot; these and they are horrible!  The strips come out of the box and they are huge, you could really do your legs and a hairy back with them, no problem. So on the plus side, you get your money&#x27;s worth.  And they are easy to cut to size. On the negative side, they DO NOT WORK!  They are MESSY and the wax is EXTREMELY HARD TO REMOVE! Without giving you too much information, lets just say I had body parts sticking together that should NOT be sticking together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I clean the area, rub the strip between my hands (watch out if you cut them to size because now the wax gets on your hands when rubbing), place it on my bikini line, rub, and rip. NOTHING HAPPENED! Although I am left with a HUGE pile of wax all over my leg.  The handy dandy \\&quot;desensitizing wipe\\&quot; doesnt work worth a crap.  It is supposed to help in the \\&quot;after care\\&quot; of removing the left over wax.  It doesn&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t remove any wax residue at all.  So now I sit here with my jeans sticking to whats left after trying to remove it all with my oil.  Oh yeah, baby oil.  You will need it.  Of course they do not tell you this before hand, luckily I had some AVON gelled body oil that seemed to do the trick, but like I said, I can feel my jeans sticking to my leg now that the oil has apparently soaked into my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now sticky, broke, and confused as I contemplate other hair removal options.</li>
            <li> A little tip to maximizing the use of these strips. I lay the strips out on a small towel on a heat safe surface like my microfiber foot stool. Then I lay my heating pad on a medium heat over them to heat them. Works beautifully. Once you split the two strips apart, you can fold each half in the middle of itself to put it back under the heating pad and use at least a second time. My daughter gets even a third heating and use out of each strip. This really helps keep the cost down of each session. And as another reviewer noted, the little oil pads to use after really does get the excess off. Give it a shot. Wax strips aren&#x27;t for everyone, but you might be surprised.</li>
            <li> out of a full pack i got 2 strips to work the rest did absolutely nothing except leave the \\&quot;wax\\&quot; in the perfect shape of the strip on my leg. I tried heating in microwave, i tried the old \\&quot;iron on\\&quot; method my grandma likes, i tried the rubbing, no matter was done the wax stuck to my leg and not the strip when i pulled it away.  ABSOLUTELY DO NOT buy this product.  This product has also caused me hives all over especially where i tried to use it.</li>
            <li> Since I&#x27;d never waxed my legs before, the first time I tried these I figured I&#x27;d done something wrong. But after a few tries I really don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s me. I followed the directions and tried all the tips on waxing I could find and always with the same result: A fair amount of wax and most of the hair left behind. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my hair&#x27;s super fine or what but these didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
            <li> I purchased the Nad&#x27;s body wax strips and was disappointed. First off the desensitizing wipes don&#x27;t work, it still hurts...a lot. My biggest complaint was the wax. You cannot get it off with soap and water. In fact I couldn&#x27;t get if off for a couple of showers. It gets on your clothes when you get dressed. Not happy and will not buy this product again.</li>
            <li> These are normally excellent but I bought two boxes and they are either defective or were stored improperly.  I ordered in winter, so I doubt it was shipping conditions.  The wax completely separated from the strip, what a mess!!!  I tried many strips.  Some separated when the strips were pulled apart prior to use, some after applied to skin.  Really, a painful mess.  Not fun.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been slowly trying the strips. At first I thought my hair was just too short so it wasn&#x27;t ripping any out. I try every few days just hoping that it&#x27;ll magically work, haa. Today I realized that my biggest mistake was getting the wax TOO warm. It stayed too soft so it left a gooey mess on my legs instead of sticking to the paper. New trick: Take a cold water bottle and use that to rub the strip down. Even though this helped a lot, it still only rips about 50% of my hair off.     Save the money and trouble and go for a warm wax.</li>
            <li> Nad&#x27;s was fantastic when it first came out with this product a couple of years ago.  The quality has not kept up, the last pack I bought I was only able to use one of the strips. Total waste of time.  Never again!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried Sally Hansen, Moujan and these Nad&#x27;s strips, and Nad&#x27;s are the best for ME.  (I know everyone has different types of leg hair -- some fine, some coarse, etc.)  They last longer by far than the others, and they do the trick, quickly.  I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;ve experimented, because the other types were quite a bit inferior.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my package was old, but I just opened it up and the strips are so dried out.  I tried warming them between my hands and they are not sticky at all.  I even put them into the microwave for 30 seconds and they still are not sticky.  I can&#x27;t get them to stick on my legs at all.  This was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> No matter what product you use you need to have guts to wax yourself. I use this for my bikini and even for that tender of an area it works great. If you can muster up the courage it is so much cheaper than going to the salon! This product is the best of any I&#x27;ve tried and the least painful. I cut the strips into quarters and use about 2-3 full strips each bikini wax so the box lasts a long time. Each strip is about 2\\&quot;x4\\&quot;. Compared to Nair which smells terrible all day long (and people may know what you have been upto) this product does not leave and odor and is easy to clean up. My skin may bleed a little and stays pink and tender for about a day afterwards but that is the same for any waxing product I use, even if I go to the salon. Just be prepared if you choose to wax to schedule it for a stay at home day!</li>
            <li> Do not, do not, DO NOT buy this. This product is horrible. After using about 3 strips, I was STILL left with patches of hair here and there. So I thought, \\&quot;Okay, maybe I need to let the hair grow a little longer before I do it.\\&quot; Did that work? Nope! Only 1/4 of the hair was gone, and my skin was very red and irritated. This product is very messy too. I repeat, DO NOT BUY THIS. You&#x27;ll be wasting your time and your money. Yesterday, I ordered [[ASIN:B0000691JH Moom Organic Hair Removal Kit, Tea Tree, 6-Ounce Package]] because of the many positive reviews for it. Let&#x27;s hope that works, unlike THIS product.</li>
            <li> I think the whole point of waxing is that you don&#x27;t have to shave. right? well, there&#x27;s a reason this is a listing for a two pack and it is that one pack is not enough. Sure, it says you can re-use the strips but they really only work the very first time you apply them. You&#x27;ll spend more time applying and reapplying strips than you would shaving, but we&#x27;ll see if the hair doesn&#x27;t regrow too soon. I did notice it ripped out hairs straight from the root.  (at least that.)</li>
            <li> The wax strips I received were old and dry. When I applied a wax strip to my leg, it ripped, leaving a sticky mess of wax without even removing any hair.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin, yet my hair is stubborn and difficult to remove.  I have had my brows waxed professionally for 15 years, and always either had hair left behind or had a bad skin reaction.  Well all that has changed.  These strips remove EVERY hair on my brows (even the super-fine blonde fuzzies) without any reaction from my skin.  I use the numbing cloth first, let it dry for a few minutes while I cut the strip, and follow up with the soothing pad.  No blemishes, no missing chunks of skin, and best of all - no hair left behind!</li>
            <li> I had previously used Nads wand type product and thought I&#x27;d give this a try as it seemed to be easier to use; however, was disappointed.  Does not work nearly as well to remove facial hair.  Most of the time only removes some of the hair and doesn&#x27;t always have enough \\&quot;goo\\&quot; on the strip.  Not for me.  I&#x27;ll stay with the regular Nads even if it is a bit messier to use.</li>
            <li> This product is horrible! I used this on my underarms and after using about 8 one-half size strips (using them several times as the directions say) I&#x27;m left with unbelievably tender armpits and only about 1/3 of the hair gone. It leaves so much wax behind that moving your arms up and down hurts because they stick together.    The only nice thing about it is that when the strips are at room temp, they are easy to cut. Other than that, don&#x27;t waste your time!</li>
            <li> These are the cheapest strips I ever used.  Its like they put gel on a piece of toilet paper.  I placed the Nad strip on my leg, pulled it off and the gel and a then layer of the tissue remained stuck on my leg!  After pulling back the strip, I had in my hand a blank strip, with no gel and NO HAIR!!!! DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT!!!</li>
            <li> This is a good product for beginners to try. works gr8 if u do it patiently.I got it done for my underarms by my husband and the results are wonderfull though he has no practice for this task.This is way better than the sally hansen which is a total waste of time and money.More preferable over Veet which is also one of the good products.  The smell is pleasant and soothing effect is perfect.No hassel at all.Overall good product will buy again.</li>
            <li> I bought this stuff because I had used Nads in the jar and really liked it. I couldn&#x27;t find that kind at my walmart, so I had to buy this stuff. I figured it would be easy since the strips already had the wax on them. You have to warm the wax between your hands, which is fine unless you cut the strips. I had to because they were huge and I was doing my bikini line. When you rub the cut strips, the wax comes out the sides...messy. I followed the instructions, when I pulled the strip off, no more than five hairs came off on one strip, some had none. It&#x27;s always uncomfortable to wax, this experience was no different. I will NOT be buying these again. I bought the sally hansen lavender wax kit, so we&#x27;ll see how that works.</li>
            <li> I am a male who happens to use these and I like them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, I am no stranger to waxing. My sister is a professional beautician and she waxes my back for me (embarrassing, I know). One time she used these because it was all that was left (the professional wax was gone), and I wanted to go to the beach. It removed the hair from my back fairly well. The one con is that it took more than one time over the same area to remove the hair, which is expected from something not professional (and not boiling hot!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just yesterday I did some grooming by myself (on my upper arms), and hated them at first, until I figured out that you rip the strips off against the growth. Now, I really feel they were a good investment because they did a great job at a reasonable price. If these can work on coarser male hair, they surely can work for a woman who wants to be well groomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy enough for an amateur&lt;br /&gt;-Inexpensive alternative to a salon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:&lt;br /&gt;-Not as good as professional&lt;br /&gt;-Takes practice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Pick up a box. If you hate it I am sure the company will refund your money if you send the UPC and copy of the receipt.</li>
            <li> I usually use a different brand but thought I would try NADS because they were cheaper. Big mistake.  I have huge bruises and irritation. Painful and not very good at removing hair.</li>
            <li> I really like Nads body wax strips.  They work better than any other brand and I&#x27;ve tried many different types.</li>
            <li> Even if you follow the instructions on the box to a tee, these wax strips do NOT remove ANY hair! All they do is leave a a sticky goo on your skin. Very disappointing...</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin and tried multiple things for getting hair out: since hot wax used to cause rashes, i tried using an epillator. This cuased a lot of deep ingrowths and began to scar my skin all over. I switched back to hot sugar wax, and while it was acceptable, the ingrowths didnt go away, and I was paying a ton of money to the salon to get it done \\&quot;right\\&quot;.     I had tried sally henson before and found the thing to be useless. Then I found beeswax strips in The Body Shop, and it worked beautifully, but they stopped selling it. Looking for alternatives, i finally found this one at my local Target store. Now I dont use anything else. The ingrowths have completely stopped -- which is great and i can look forward to scar free legs in the next few years after the current ones fade away (hopefully). Its easy to use and not messy like hot wax is. Money wise --a huge difference.     It doesnt remove 100% of my hair - -but 90% it does at one shot. The remaining 10% I need to reapply another strip or if the hair is of the fine type, I use my epillator.     Overall - a great product. I will be really upset if this goes off the market.</li>
            <li> Trust me guys. You do not want to use this on your gonads. Sure it will leave you feeling smooth as a baby&#x27;s bottom, but you&#x27;ll look like Rudolph the red sacked reindeer.</li>
            <li> I used to use the other brand of wax, but then heard about Nads.  I&#x27;ll never go back to the other.  These strips are WONDERFUL!  And I&#x27;ll continue to purchase them.</li>
            <li> So far this is my top choice for a wax strip. I hated the nair wax strips-it did not remove any hair. Sally Hansen was good, but I once had a bad reaction to the strip. I like Veet a lot, but it leaves a lot of messy residue. Nad&#x27;s strips remove a pretty good amount of hair when you follow the directions. It doesn&#x27;t leave as much residue on the skin. I haven&#x27;t had any bad reactions so far.</li>
            <li> Great product! no mess. no pain. no ingrown hairs. Favorite drug store waxing kit. I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I know Nad&#x27;s offers a brazillian wax kit, but I really like these strips. I used to use Nad&#x27;s in the jar on my legs and underarms back in the day. It took time to figure out how thick/thin to put it on, and it was hard for me to heat it to the right consistency consistently. ;)&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m a little nervous with their hard wax in the brazillian kit. Maybe one day I&#x27;ll brave up and try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyhow, I&#x27;ve been using these strips to do Brazillian waxing on myself for about 9 months now. (About once a month) So I&#x27;ve fussed a bit to figure what I could do to make it less painful.&lt;br /&gt;I find that the key to using these in the bikini area is to cut the strips into eighths. So that you end up with approximately 1 inch to 1 1/2 inch square waxing surface. The smaller pieces are much more manageable, and they get out more hair. It&#x27;s also less painful if you tear it off as parrallel and as close to your skin as possible. The more you lift upward (perpendicular to skin) the more it hurts, and the less hair it picks up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used these strips on other areas yet, but if you&#x27;re having difficulty on other areas you may want to try cutting the strips into halves or quarters to see if you get better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried some other waxing strips, I believe it was Sally Hansen. But with their plastic strips it just felt like putting packaging tape on and ripping it off with little to no results. I appreciate the softness of the Nad&#x27;s cloth that conforms to your skin, and the gentleness of their wax formula. I did however like the finishing oil that came with Sally Hansen and I still use it. I always run out of the Nad&#x27;s baby oil wipes (which are very good also, but I need more quantity. If their dry when you open them, a few drops of water revives them). The oil removes the leftover wax residue and soothes your skin after yanking out your hair. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like Nad&#x27;s desensitising wipes. (Use BEFORE you wax. Not after. I learned the hard way...Yowsers! I should have read the label haha!)&lt;br /&gt;I love that these strips are ready to go! Just the right thickness of wax. No microwave! Much faster!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a perfect product out there, and no matter what, brazillian waxing (all waxing, really) just hurts.&lt;br /&gt;So far my hair keeps growing back. It seems slightly softer and its growth pattern is a bit patchy. I hope it will stop growing back all together! For now, I&#x27;ll keep dreaming, and I&#x27;ll keep using these waxing strips.</li>
            <li> Does not work properly. Had to reapply strips to one area several times before hair was waxed from spot. Even then some hair was not removed</li>
            <li> my epilator broke, so I needed something (I hate shaving) until I got it replaced.&lt;br /&gt;Since CVS bought Longs, they don&#x27;t have my fav brand, Moujan 2000, which worked really well for me before I discovered the joy of epilators. And my legs get Hairy! like as much as my husbands! I guess it&#x27;s the northern European heritage.&lt;br /&gt;The Nads strips worked okay, took off most hair, but not all, and it says you can re-use a strip a few times, but the 2nd, 3rd times don&#x27;t work as well, not like the Moujan which you could re-use 2-3 times each and each time still worked well.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is natural &amp; in strip form, convenient, but not great.</li>
            <li> If you like tons of goopy mess, tons of hassle with virtually no hair removal this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> words cant express how badly i hated this item it didnt work at all and left a gross stinky substance on my body and the little pads the give you dont work...alcohol works after a while but all in all i hated it and will never suggest this product to anyone</li>
            <li> I have very fine to medium thickness hair and this product did not remove it, it just left a sticky residue behind.  I switched to the Veet strips and they removed the hair completely!</li>
            <li> I bought Nads Body Wax Strips as a last resort (as the wax strips I normally buy were not in stock). Honestly? What a waste of money. You are supposed to rub the strips briskly between your hands to \\&quot;warm\\&quot; the strips and then pull them apart. I rubbed 3 different strips for about a minute, and each time I pulled them apart, the wax stayed on one strip only. So, I took a strip and warmed it in the microwave for a minute. When I pulled them apart, they both had wax on them. I then put a strip on my lower leg and rubbed the 3-4 times (per the directions) and pulled the strip off my leg. The strip came off, but the wax stayed on my leg!     Do not buy this product. It is a cheap and inefficient way to wax legs and ends up being a waste of money instead :(</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know why there is so much negative feedback on this product. I love them and they worked for me! I chose these, because they were the cheapest ones at Ulta. I got one 24-pack for $7. I was skeptical about using them after reading the reviews, but they&#x27;re great! They are the first waxing strips I&#x27;ve ever used, but I can&#x27;t complain. I have only used them on my legs so far, but they removed the hair competely. I let the hair grow in to 4-5 mm before using them. I am Italian, so a product that can remove my body hair should work for anyone. They smell great, too. I bought them to use in my underams, so I&#x27;m hoping they are as effective there as they are on my legs. I know there are a lot of bad reviews on this product, but give these waxing strips a chance. You can&#x27;t beat the price! I love them and would definitely recommend them!</li>
            <li> I have being waxing for the last 4 years and be paying about $76 for full leg and bikini area (hard wax)...yeah very expensive!!! I just tried the strips and let me tell you they are great!!they smell good, no messy, comes with the wipes to clean up after and they really take off the stickiness right away, for those who say it does not work take into consideration how long is the hair and how hard are you pulling the strip? you have to have patience and of course know how to do it, it&#x27;s very simple and it only cost $7.99!!!</li>
            <li> There are many negative reviews, but from my point of view, this is a great product.  Here&#x27;s the deal:&lt;br /&gt;1.  You are pulling hairs out of your body.  It will hurt.  For sure, though, over time it will hurt less as the regrowth is typically finer and not all hairs will regrow at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;2.  You need to follow the directions.  If you get the strips too warm or not warm enough, you will not remove hair and may leave sticky residue.  This can be removed with their wipes or baby oil.&lt;br /&gt;3. I&#x27;ve never had trouble with skin ripping.  I&#x27;ve used the strips on my legs, bikini area, and upper lip.  I haven&#x27;t tried it on more sensitive lower-bikini / Brazilian areas where I can&#x27;t get a good angle to pull the strips.  I leave that to the professionals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I find this product to be significantly easier, quicker, and less messy than wax or Nad&#x27;s from the tub.  After removing hair in the spring with the strips, I maintain in the summer with an epilator.  I think it would be way too painful to epilate after just shaving all winter.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work on my leg hair.</li>
            <li> I got the Nads body wax strips because I thought it would be more convenient for vacation waxing than the usual tub of wax. This was definitely not the case. I did as the box instructed and rubbed the strips between my hands to warm them, when I pulled them apart they had no adhesive properties whatsoever. I put them in the microwave for 30 seconds, they still slid right off my skin. I boiled water for the express purpose of holding the strips against the outside of the pot to heat them, this level of heat made the strip at least stick to me...Unfortunately, when I pulled the strip back all of the wax was still on my leg. I, rather stupidly, decided to try another strip to pull the wax off and then had 2 layers of wax stuck to my leg. I ended up spending about 20 minutes peeling wax off of my leg. I should note that I&#x27;ve been waxing for years and have used this type of wax strip before from other brands and had no problem. This product is useless. Does Nads give refunds?</li>
            <li> this products are awesome very easy, fast, gets all the hairs out and not messy like regular was... it does not hurt unless you do it for the first tie but then the hot wax is worst and risky painful.</li>
            <li> This is one of my favorite products of all time. I used to use Nad&#x27;s wax that you had to microwave and then apply with a stick -- man, that was cumbersome. But when I discovered this, my life changed! They&#x27;re easy to use, easy to clean up (just throw away the strips), and easy to wash away.</li>
            <li> I bought these strips at a local drugstore, as they were the cheapest form of wax on the shelves. The first couple times, I didn&#x27;t follow the directions exactly, but on the 3rd try I certainly did. I took a shower, made sure everything was dry, even put on some baby powder so the wax would stick to the hair, not my skin. I rubbed the strips between my hands for a while, and they peeled apart easily. What I ended up with was 1 or 2 hairs removed (max), sticky skin, PAIN, and a sticky razor after I had to shave when these didn&#x27;t work. The wax wouldn&#x27;t come off my skin or my razor or my clothes. I&#x27;ll have to try a different type of wax.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product.  Just cut the stripe to the right size and your in business. Quick and easy. No heating, no burning.  Must try.</li>
            <li> I bought these on a whim, having only ever gotten professional waxing done before and never tried it myself. I thought these would be a better approach than playing with hot wax and spatulas... and after some tweaking, they are!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to rub them between your hands to warm them up...  I just couldn&#x27;t get them hot enough, so I microwaved them. About twenty seconds was enough to get them hot enough. It took a few tries to get the angle right (I was waxing my arms) but when I did, they worked very well! Only a few hairs got left behind. Unfortunately if you don&#x27;t pull them off quickly enough, the wax sticks to your skin, and I&#x27;ve tried three different ways to wash it off and it just won&#x27;t seem to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin, I&#x27;d recommend on being VERY careful. I used these on my arms and when getting to sensitive areas like the inner elbow and wrist, the force of removing the strips actually burst some blood vessels and heavily bruised my skin. Very ouchy.</li>
            <li> I have been waxing various body parts for years, so I&#x27;ve tried a wide variety of wax products.  These strips are the best for legs!  I am not sure why the 1 star reviews are warming them up at all.  Just peel apart (very slowly), apply to area, rub your hand across it a few times, and voila!  I can use one strip at least twice on my legs so it takes about 6 total to do both bottom legs.  I have not tested these on underarm hair because I have given up on being able to wax my armpits at home and I have not tried this on bikini/brazil areas due to their size.</li>
