            <li>It works amazingly.  </li>

            <li>Even my 23 year old says it is the best lotion she has ever used.  </li>
            <li>Most amazing hand/heal/elbow cream I have EVER found</li>
            <li>By far this is the best skin lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>and I really love it.  </li>
            <li>I was given some of this lotion from a skin care nurse in the hospital, and feel in love with it.</li>
            <li>More specifically, I was looking for something that had around 10% Urea and a lower percentage of AHA</li>
            <li>(I&#x27;ve tried many things).</li>
            <li>I almost quit working in my yard since it would take 3 days for my hands to be OK.  </li>
            <li>Glad I found this cream.</li>
            <li>Better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li>Love this lotion.</li>

            <li>I have used so many products for my cracked heels and nothing worked.</li>
            <li>So far, so good for him too!</li>
            <li>This is the best hand cream, It&#x27;s strong so only use on feet, elbows, hands.</li>
            <li>Repaired the damage to my skin from knee to toes.&lt;br /&gt;Looked good after first night.</li>
            <li>Totally worth what ever it costs!!</li>
            <li>This is a wonderful product for getting rid of dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Wonderful product for severely dry skin.</li>
            <li>Happy Soft Feet!</li>
            <li>/&gt;So far, this seems to be a wonderful cream that is priced right.</li>
            <li>The BEST cream ever for dry skin!</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the difference this product has made!</li>
            <li>Very quickly they improved.</li>
            <li>This stuff is too strong to put on your face, so don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li>I have seen this cream available at other locations but Amazon has been offering it for the best price I&#x27;ve seen anywhere.  </li>
            <li>40% urea creams cost $40-50, but this is considerably less, so, to me, this is a good value for a good product.</li>
            <li>This lotion is so good for smoothing out the bumps that formed under my skin from the venus veins and now my legs are smooth and soft and do not ache as they used</li>
            <li>Great facial results.</li>
            <li>I use it every morning and my feet are so smooth.</li>
            <li>It is fabulous.  </li>
            <li>It makes your skin feel so smooth and silky</li>
            <li>I liked it so much I bought some for my Mom</li>
            <li>This cream is fabulous.</li>
            <li>and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li>product makes my skin smooth and hydrates all day.</li>
            <li>Extremely happy with the purchase will use it again next winter.</li>
            <li>God samples from my vasular surgeon.it is such good cream love it.</li>
            <li>No bad smells, easy to apply.</li>
            <li>The first morning I felt a difference, and it gets better every day.  </li>
            <li>It works like pure magic and my heels were so smooth in like just 3 days.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve bought so many creams and lotions over the years and this is THE ONLY one that has been truly effective.</li>
            <li>its great for dry diabetic  feet.</li>
            <li>Great moisturizer in these dry winter months.  </li>
            <li>It soaks in great on dry skin and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li>Works great on very dry, calloused feet.</li>
            <li>nothing has ever had this quick and substaintial results.</li>
            <li>The ideal treatment usually includes creams and lotions with prescription levels of urea and AHA.</li>
            <li>Living in the desert and wearing sandals all the time this cream keeps my feet looking good especially when it is really hot out.</li>
            <li>I cut the toes off a pair of cotton socks (can&#x27;t sleep in socks they make my feet hot!), used my foot file in the shower, slathered my heels with cream and put my socks on.</li>
            <li>If you have dry, cracked feet in the winter time, this is totally the BEST solution!</li>
            <li>I have used a tiny bit around my nose for dry flakiness resulting from a cold...works awesome there too!</li>
            <li>This moisturizer is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.  </li>
            <li>Pricey and worth it.</li>
            <li>and it is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li>and I need to be more attentive and use it daily,</li>
            <li>Worth the price.</li>
            <li>It works instantly to make your skin feel and look healthy and smooth and rubs in very well!</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin on my face and thus haven&#x27;t been able to use many of the face creams that contain AHA without getting all red and splotchy</li>
            <li>I have such dry hands and this works so good!</li>
            <li>Most creams get absorbed so quickly that my skin looks dry within an hour</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much &amp; it healed my cracked skin quickly.</li>
            <li>so I was ecstatic when I discovered that this was effective at keeping dry, flaky skin at bay and very gentle on my face.</li>
            <li>and my feet are so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li>I very highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li>Absolutely amazing for dry feet!</li>
            <li>It heals almost in the first 48 hours.</li>
            <li>I am so pleased and totally totally recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li>Thanks!</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>I first got this cream in the hospital to use to treat a wound on my leg.  </li>
            <li>After doing lots of research I found that this product used to only be found at wound clinics and hospitals and there are many people that have diabetes that use it on their feet and rave about the results.  </li>
            <li>However, I wear sandals a lot and like to keep my feet looking pretty.  </li>
            <li>My sister likes it so much she is passing tubes out to friends like Johnny Appleseed!</li>
            <li>It definitely moisturized my feet, but my heels still need some more help.</li>
            <li>It is perfect for my dry feet and more importantly it is essential to the health of extra dry skin of someone with psoriasis.  </li>
            <li>Now, like my feet, my legs look healthy with not a hint of dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Oh Wow! I started using it right away.</li>
            <li>excellent emollient, particularly for feet and hands,  a little goes a long way,  neutral smell, i.e., not any......recommended to me by medical staff at wound care clinic.....a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li>It really does attract and retain moisture.</li>
            <li>I say that because there is a distinctly real tingling sensation on the insteps of my feet when applying this product.</li>
            <li>and I have found this to work very well.</li>
            <li>Shipping is fast as well.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>My hands are also much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li>Highly recommended!</li>
            <li>I use it sparingly, but it really does the job.</li>
            <li>None really works that well.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m very scent sensative</li>
            <li>Heals up skin with no steroid - does not thin the skin.</li>
            <li>Fast shipping.</li>
            <li>works great on keeping my hands soft and is slowly helping my calluses on my feet</li>
            <li>It does a great job hydrating areas that usually get dry over the course of a day, and extends the time in between pedicures.  </li>
            <li>Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it</li>
            <li>So I highly recommend both this product and the seller.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>THIS IS JUST A LOTION SORT OF HIGH PRICED</li>
            <li>I was instructed by my doctor to used this product to help keep my skin softer due to skin problems caused by my primary lymphedema.  </li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin and alot of things irritate me.</li>
            <li>Four months later, my heels are soft and smooth and I only apply the cream as needed.</li>
            <li>Wow!</li>
            <li>After a couple days my feet were almost completely heeled!</li>
            <li>Within 2 days my hands were soft and looked normal.</li>
            <li>Before starting to use it, I did a Listerine feet soak ( 4 cups of warm water, 2 cups of original yellow Listerine and two cups of vinegar) and afterwards used the pumice stone to get rid of all the rough dead skin.</li>
            <li>use it on the tips of my fingers at bed time and it completely prevents cracking.</li>
            <li>WOW</li>
            <li>WOW WOW WOW WOW.</li>
            <li>I also have seen a marked improvement in my skin since using it.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li>It is the only really healing handcream that I would ever buy.  </li>
            <li>I completely understand that this is no miracle</li>
            <li>It keeps them soft and moisturized and it&#x27;s something I will always have to use.</li>
            <li>they are almost as soft as baby feet.</li>
            <li>So, with hope but no real expectation, I started applying this right before bed</li>
            <li>I have started making my hubby use it also, he has super dry cracked feet (especially in the winter!).</li>
            <li>This cream brought my skin back to normal after being in a cast for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>My partner got relief for a cracked finger tip after the very first application and it was closed the next day.</li>
            <li>Although I live in a large city, I have only found it in tiny tubes, if at all, in local drug stores.  </li>
            <li>Very cracked and dry feet and nothing worked except this lotion.</li>
            <li>I use it daily mostly at night and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li>Recommended by our wound care specialist after a major injury.</li>
            <li>but I&#x27;ve used other less intense creams that have not required daily use after the original problem area is resolved.</li>
            <li>IT WILL TAKE ALL THE DRY SKIN OFF IN A MATTER OF DAYS AND LEAVE NEW BABY SOFT SKIN.</li>
            <li>I am using it on my legs, mainly below the knees as they looked like they were covered in a whitish powder from chronic dry skin.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m guessing that would translate into an actual burning sensation on even more delicate facial skin.  </li>
            <li>That night I started using the cream an a week later my feet feel incredibly soft.</li>
            <li>This worked really quick on my dry dry dry hands.  </li>
            <li>Noticed a lot of healing within the first few days.  </li>
            <li>Normally during Summer time when I use flip flops and Birkenstocks every day, my feet get very dry, but I believe this Summer will be different, I found the solution!</li>
            <li>The container is mess proof and the lotion is nice and thick and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li>It makes my dry skin soft and hydrated.</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It works amazingly.  </li>
            <li> So far the best I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
            <li> Even my 23 year old says it is the best lotion she has ever used.  </li>
            <li> Most amazing hand/heal/elbow cream I have EVER found</li>
            <li> By far this is the best skin lotion I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> and I really love it.  </li>
            <li> I was given some of this lotion from a skin care nurse in the hospital, and feel in love with it.</li>
            <li> More specifically, I was looking for something that had around 10% Urea and a lower percentage of AHA</li>
            <li> (I&#x27;ve tried many things).</li>
            <li> I almost quit working in my yard since it would take 3 days for my hands to be OK.  </li>
            <li> Glad I found this cream.</li>
            <li> Better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
            <li> Love this lotion.</li>
            <li> My hands and feet feel much softer and nourished with this great product.</li>
            <li> Love it.  </li>
            <li> You will want more.</li>
            <li> I have used so many products for my cracked heels and nothing worked.</li>
            <li> So far, so good for him too!</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream, It&#x27;s strong so only use on feet, elbows, hands.</li>
            <li> Repaired the damage to my skin from knee to toes.&lt;br /&gt;Looked good after first night.</li>
            <li> Totally worth what ever it costs!!</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for getting rid of dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Wonderful product for severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Happy Soft Feet!</li>
            <li> /&gt;So far, this seems to be a wonderful cream that is priced right.</li>
            <li> The BEST cream ever for dry skin!</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the difference this product has made!</li>
            <li> Very quickly they improved.</li>
            <li> This stuff is too strong to put on your face, so don&#x27;t.  </li>
            <li> I have seen this cream available at other locations but Amazon has been offering it for the best price I&#x27;ve seen anywhere.  </li>
            <li> 40% urea creams cost $40-50, but this is considerably less, so, to me, this is a good value for a good product.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so good for smoothing out the bumps that formed under my skin from the venus veins and now my legs are smooth and soft and do not ache as they used</li>
            <li> Great facial results.</li>
            <li> I use it every morning and my feet are so smooth.</li>
            <li> It is fabulous.  </li>
            <li> It makes your skin feel so smooth and silky</li>
            <li> I liked it so much I bought some for my Mom</li>
            <li> This cream is fabulous.</li>
            <li> and this fit the bill.</li>
            <li> product makes my skin smooth and hydrates all day.</li>
            <li> Extremely happy with the purchase will use it again next winter.</li>
            <li> God samples from my vasular surgeon.it is such good cream love it.</li>
            <li> No bad smells, easy to apply.</li>
            <li> The first morning I felt a difference, and it gets better every day.  </li>
            <li> It works like pure magic and my heels were so smooth in like just 3 days.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many creams and lotions over the years and this is THE ONLY one that has been truly effective.</li>
            <li> its great for dry diabetic  feet.</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer in these dry winter months.  </li>
            <li> It soaks in great on dry skin and is not greasy at all.</li>
            <li> Works great on very dry, calloused feet.</li>
            <li> nothing has ever had this quick and substaintial results.</li>
            <li> The ideal treatment usually includes creams and lotions with prescription levels of urea and AHA.</li>
            <li> Living in the desert and wearing sandals all the time this cream keeps my feet looking good especially when it is really hot out.</li>
            <li> I cut the toes off a pair of cotton socks (can&#x27;t sleep in socks they make my feet hot!), used my foot file in the shower, slathered my heels with cream and put my socks on.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, cracked feet in the winter time, this is totally the BEST solution!</li>
            <li> I have used a tiny bit around my nose for dry flakiness resulting from a cold...works awesome there too!</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent.  </li>
            <li> Pricey and worth it.</li>
            <li> and it is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> and I need to be more attentive and use it daily,</li>
            <li> Worth the price.</li>
            <li> It works instantly to make your skin feel and look healthy and smooth and rubs in very well!</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face and thus haven&#x27;t been able to use many of the face creams that contain AHA without getting all red and splotchy</li>
            <li> I have such dry hands and this works so good!</li>
            <li> Most creams get absorbed so quickly that my skin looks dry within an hour</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much &amp; it healed my cracked skin quickly.</li>
            <li> so I was ecstatic when I discovered that this was effective at keeping dry, flaky skin at bay and very gentle on my face.</li>
            <li> and my feet are so smooth and soft!</li>
            <li> I very highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing for dry feet!</li>
            <li> It heals almost in the first 48 hours.</li>
            <li> I am so pleased and totally totally recommend it to everyone.</li>
            <li> Thanks!</li>
            <li> Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> I first got this cream in the hospital to use to treat a wound on my leg.  </li>
            <li> After doing lots of research I found that this product used to only be found at wound clinics and hospitals and there are many people that have diabetes that use it on their feet and rave about the results.  </li>
            <li> However, I wear sandals a lot and like to keep my feet looking pretty.  </li>
            <li> My sister likes it so much she is passing tubes out to friends like Johnny Appleseed!</li>
            <li> It definitely moisturized my feet, but my heels still need some more help.</li>
            <li> It is perfect for my dry feet and more importantly it is essential to the health of extra dry skin of someone with psoriasis.  </li>
            <li> Now, like my feet, my legs look healthy with not a hint of dry skin.  </li>
            <li> Oh Wow! I started using it right away.</li>
            <li> excellent emollient, particularly for feet and hands,  a little goes a long way,  neutral smell, i.e., not any......recommended to me by medical staff at wound care clinic.....a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> It really does attract and retain moisture.</li>
            <li> I say that because there is a distinctly real tingling sensation on the insteps of my feet when applying this product.</li>
            <li> and I have found this to work very well.</li>
            <li> Shipping is fast as well.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> My hands are also much softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> I use it sparingly, but it really does the job.</li>
            <li> None really works that well.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m very scent sensative</li>
            <li> Heals up skin with no steroid - does not thin the skin.</li>
            <li> Fast shipping.</li>
            <li> works great on keeping my hands soft and is slowly helping my calluses on my feet</li>
            <li> It does a great job hydrating areas that usually get dry over the course of a day, and extends the time in between pedicures.  </li>
            <li> Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> So I highly recommend both this product and the seller.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> THIS IS JUST A LOTION SORT OF HIGH PRICED</li>
            <li> I was instructed by my doctor to used this product to help keep my skin softer due to skin problems caused by my primary lymphedema.  </li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin and alot of things irritate me.</li>
            <li> Four months later, my heels are soft and smooth and I only apply the cream as needed.</li>
            <li> Wow!</li>
            <li> After a couple days my feet were almost completely heeled!</li>
            <li> Within 2 days my hands were soft and looked normal.</li>
            <li> Before starting to use it, I did a Listerine feet soak ( 4 cups of warm water, 2 cups of original yellow Listerine and two cups of vinegar) and afterwards used the pumice stone to get rid of all the rough dead skin.</li>
            <li> use it on the tips of my fingers at bed time and it completely prevents cracking.</li>
            <li> WOW</li>
            <li> WOW WOW WOW WOW.</li>
            <li> I also have seen a marked improvement in my skin since using it.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin soft and not greasy.</li>
            <li> It is the only really healing handcream that I would ever buy.  </li>
            <li> I completely understand that this is no miracle</li>
            <li> It keeps them soft and moisturized and it&#x27;s something I will always have to use.</li>
            <li> they are almost as soft as baby feet.</li>
            <li> So, with hope but no real expectation, I started applying this right before bed</li>
            <li> I have started making my hubby use it also, he has super dry cracked feet (especially in the winter!).</li>
            <li> This cream brought my skin back to normal after being in a cast for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> My partner got relief for a cracked finger tip after the very first application and it was closed the next day.</li>
            <li> Although I live in a large city, I have only found it in tiny tubes, if at all, in local drug stores.  </li>
            <li> Very cracked and dry feet and nothing worked except this lotion.</li>
            <li> I use it daily mostly at night and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Recommended by our wound care specialist after a major injury.</li>
            <li> but I&#x27;ve used other less intense creams that have not required daily use after the original problem area is resolved.</li>
            <li> IT WILL TAKE ALL THE DRY SKIN OFF IN A MATTER OF DAYS AND LEAVE NEW BABY SOFT SKIN.</li>
            <li> I am using it on my legs, mainly below the knees as they looked like they were covered in a whitish powder from chronic dry skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m guessing that would translate into an actual burning sensation on even more delicate facial skin.  </li>
            <li> That night I started using the cream an a week later my feet feel incredibly soft.</li>
            <li> This worked really quick on my dry dry dry hands.  </li>
            <li> Noticed a lot of healing within the first few days.  </li>
            <li> Normally during Summer time when I use flip flops and Birkenstocks every day, my feet get very dry, but I believe this Summer will be different, I found the solution!</li>
            <li> The container is mess proof and the lotion is nice and thick and goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> It makes my dry skin soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference in my heels (which is what I bought it for), but they aren&#x27;t really too bad right now.  </li>
            <li> Amazing product and so much less expensive than prescription topicals.</li>
            <li> Urea acid draws moisture from the environment and provides needed moisture: feet dry out in the low moisture Midwestern winter</li>
            <li> This moisturizing cream is the only cream I&#x27;ve found that will relieve the cracking on my feet that I get during the dry winter.  </li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has cleared up my dry elbows.  </li>
            <li> This is the only cream that works for my very dry skin here in Colorado.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Since then I have used it on my legs and face to keep my sensitive skin supple and moist instead of dried out and cracked.  </li>
            <li> I MEAN REALLY SEVERE....</li>
            <li> My hands and feet are usually really dry and cracked in the winter months</li>
            <li> it addresses those dry, cracked heels and scaly skin areas.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting,didn&#x27;t do anything to my dry feet</li>
            <li> I battle dry cracked hands</li>
            <li> It is the solution for my dry feet.  </li>
            <li> you have severely dry, flaky skin</li>
            <li> A must for dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> Using it on cracked and dry feet at night.  </li>
            <li> CHAPPED, DRY SKIN.</li>
            <li> With my husbands job he washes his hands a minimum of 40 times a day this cream helps soothe his dry skin.</li>
            <li> rough dryed heels clear up in a few weeks</li>
            <li> But I am allergic to propylene glycol, which is in ever single prescription lotion for the condition.</li>
            <li> In 4 days - count them, F O U R days - my dry, cracked to the bloody dermal layer, heels are HEALED and pink like a baby&#x27;s behind:) !!!!  </li>
            <li> My feet were so dry and rough.</li>
            <li> I plan to buy again and suggest giving this a try if you have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> and my skin was always very dry.</li>
            <li> I have icthyosis vulgaris, a genetic skin condition that results in very dry flaky skin.</li>
            <li> I have rough cracked heels.</li>
            <li> Helps heal cracks and rough spots.  </li>
            <li> Atrac-Tain., just two applications and my feet are smoother, the rough heels already softening.</li>
            <li> I have tried a lot of products for my rough heels over the years and came across this stuff and figured why not try it since I&#x27;ve bought everything else out there.</li>
            <li> The only minor complaint that I have is that I find it needs to be applied every day.</li>
            <li> This lotion does not feel greasy and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> Well....the other reviewers were NOT exaggerating - this is a miracle for me.  </li>
            <li> Unlike other creams, this has one staying power.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried just about every Gold Bond product out there along with other skin lotions.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry skin for decades and my hospital provided this cream to when I was in for a few days.</li>
            <li> If you have hard, cracked heels the only thing that is going to work is urea which softens the skin and allows the moisture to penetrate.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it for everyday use, but following any type of heavy manual labor there is just nothing else like it!</li>
            <li> I have used all kinds of other OTC creams, balms and lotions in the past...</li>
            <li> After a week, I no longer needed to pumice off dead skin and a few days after that, I dropped the morning application.</li>
            <li> I have been using it for a few weeks.  </li>
            <li> The cream itself is not greasy or too heavy and absorbs well.</li>
            <li> Used it only three times on some sad cracked heels.</li>
            <li> When my Mom was in the hospital they gave her a small tube of this.</li>
            <li> ...I didn&#x27;t have the dramatic results that other users/reviewers did.  </li>
            <li> The lotion is insanely thick, so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot and it lasts for days.</li>
            <li> Worked well, a bit pricey, but slightly less expensive at Amazon.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a serious skin condition requiring this cream.  </li>
            <li> heals those really bad deep cracks on feet and hands.</li>
            <li> I had deep painful cracks in my heels and had tried all kinds of creams that promised to fix my heels.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything on my dry, cracked, painful heels: pumice stones, petroleum products, bees wax products, graters, etc.</li>
            <li> This cream is a little greasy feeling which I don&#x27;t think is a bad thing in a moisturizing cream.  </li>
            <li> I purchased it for rough, cracked heels after a brutal Minnesota winter to prep for summer sandal weather.</li>
            <li> I used on feet for awful, dry toe areas &amp; heels.</li>
            <li> I do lots of gardening, pruning, and cutting, then afterward my hands are terribly dry and just awful.  </li>
            <li> So preventive use is recommended in cold weather.</li>
            <li> Seriously HEALS even terribly dry/cracked skin...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had cracked, painful heels for years.</li>
            <li> and they are no longer painful and bleeding.</li>
            <li> If you get those painful skin cracks on the tips of your fingers or on your feet in the winter, this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I have horrible cracked feet.</li>
            <li> I will apply it on the corners of my fingers where I get the worst cracking.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Recommended by our wound care specialist after a major injury. Worked well, a bit pricey, but slightly less expensive at Amazon. Will purchase again.</li>
            <li> My RN daughter taught us to use this. Great facial results. No bad smells, easy to apply. Highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This cream was recommended by a friend who is a nurse and it is amazing.</li>
            <li> This lotion is so good for smoothing out the bumps that formed under my skin from the venus veins and now my legs are smooth and soft and do not ache as they used to.&lt;br /&gt;best cream of all. God samples from my vasular surgeon.it is such good cream love it. best price from the seller too.</li>
            <li> An incredible moisturizer. The best I&#x27;ve ever tried. Immediate results. I used on feet for awful, dry toe areas &amp; heels. I will be buying this product again &amp; probably again &amp; giving it to people I like.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had dry skin for decades and my hospital provided this cream to when I was in for a few days. It has 10% urea, which is what my dermatologist recommends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, this seems to be a wonderful cream that is priced right. 40% urea creams cost $40-50, but this is considerably less, so, to me, this is a good value for a good product. It gets the job done fro me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on the tips of my fingers at bed time and it completely prevents cracking. I plan to buy again and suggest giving this a try if you have very dry skin.</li>
            <li> If you suffer from psoriasis or eczemia this is the best OTC you can get. It heals almost in the first 48 hours. Amazing product and so much less expensive than prescription topicals.</li>
            <li> This cream is a little greasy feeling which I don&#x27;t think is a bad thing in a moisturizing cream.  I like that it is unscented.  I haven&#x27;t noticed too much of a difference in my heels (which is what I bought it for), but they aren&#x27;t really too bad right now.  My hands and feet are usually really dry and cracked in the winter months so I will see how it works this winter.</li>
            <li> I have gotten this lotion numerous times now and I really love it.  My feet look wonderful.  I use it every morning and my feet are so smooth.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizer!  It doesnt have some flowery obnoxious scent - essentially non at all.  It is perfect for my dry feet and more importantly it is essential to the health of extra dry skin of someone with psoriasis.  So far the best I&#x27;ve ever found. Ordering again for the 3rd time - a must have for our family</li>
            <li> Very pleased product arrived on time! !!!</li>
            <li> Works great on very dry, calloused feet.</li>
            <li> rough dryed heels clear up in a few weeks</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything on my dry, cracked, painful heels: pumice stones, petroleum products, bees wax products, graters, etc. Some products provided temporary relief, but nothing lasting. So, with hope but no real expectation, I started applying this right before bed (I pulled on a pair of socks after application.) I also applied this in the morning after my shower and pumicing.  After four days, my heels were transformed. No longer did I had deep, discolored fissures on my heels. After a week, I no longer needed to pumice off dead skin and a few days after that, I dropped the morning application. Four months later, my heels are soft and smooth and I only apply the cream as needed. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about the difference this product has made!</li>
            <li> Finally, a truly moisturizing product that works.... it addresses those dry, cracked heels and scaly skin areas. This product is a winner... it is affordable and feels great on my skin. I purchased two tubes as I do not want to exhaust my inventory of it any time soon.</li>
            <li> This moisturizer is worth the money. It really does attract and retain moisture. I use it daily during the heating season. It has been the ONLY moisturizer which works so well that my cuticles do not crack and sting. Guys, this is for you...no odor. Also it is hypoallergenic.</li>
            <li> Used this after being in a cast for 6 weeks. Repaired the damage to my skin from knee to toes.&lt;br /&gt;Looked good after first night. Amazing results after two nights.</li>
            <li> I have rough cracked heels. For years I have tried everything on my heels- prescription salicylic creams, heel balm, cetaphil...the list goes on.  My father&#x27;s vascular surgeon told him to use this cream on his feet.  So I bought a tube for me.  It is fabulous.  I apply it 2-3 times a day and put my socks on. I have been using it for a few weeks.  My feet have never looked better!</li>
            <li> Well....the other reviewers were NOT exaggerating - this is a miracle for me.  I have tried product after product, year after year, and NEVER found anything that worked like this stuff!  In 4 days - count them, F O U R days - my dry, cracked to the bloody dermal layer, heels are HEALED and pink like a baby&#x27;s behind:) !!!!  I kid you NOT.  I am using it on my legs, mainly below the knees as they looked like they were covered in a whitish powder from chronic dry skin. Now, like my feet, my legs look healthy with not a hint of dry skin.  This stuff is too strong to put on your face, so don&#x27;t.  I say that because there is a distinctly real tingling sensation on the insteps of my feet when applying this product. I&#x27;m guessing that would translate into an actual burning sensation on even more delicate facial skin.  BTW, I apply Atrac-Tain once in the morning and before going to bed, just twice a day. I LOVE THIS STUFF!!</li>
            <li> After reading the reviews and my son telling me how great this cream was for your skin I decided to give it a try.  It makes your skin feel so smooth and silky and my skin was always very dry.</li>
            <li> Wow! This worked. I&#x27;ve had cracked, painful heels for years. Using once a day for a week and they are no longer painful and bleeding. I&#x27;ve bought so many creams and lotions over the years and this is THE ONLY one that has been truly effective. Worth every penny.</li>
            <li> I have horrible cracked feet. I&#x27;ve tried just about everything on the market. Pedicures only band-aided my problem. So,  I came across this cream and read the reviews and promptly ordered a tube. I put it on at night and put socks on. WOW WOW WOW WOW WOW. What amazing stuff.  The fissures are healing and my feet look and feel 100 % better!!  Buy this cream. Totally worth what ever it costs!!</li>
            <li> I was instructed by my doctor to used this product to help keep my skin softer due to skin problems caused by my primary lymphedema.  Skin care is very important for a person with lymphedema and the product has done a great job.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever bought. It&#x27;s worth every penny. I liked it so much I bought some for my Mom and she loves it too.</li>
            <li> Not what I was expecting,didn&#x27;t do anything to my dry feet</li>
            <li> this stuff is awesome...</li>
            <li> This cream is the only thing that works! A doctor recommended this cream and it works! I have told my friends and they agree.</li>
            <li> This is the best cream ever!</li>
            <li> Oh my God! This is the best stuff i have ever bought. It works like pure magic and my heels were so smooth in like just 3 days. I am so pleased and totally totally recommend it to everyone. Thanks!</li>
            <li> I battle dry cracked hands and I have found this to work very well. I use it daily mostly at night and a little goes a long way. I will apply it on the corners of my fingers where I get the worst cracking.</li>
            <li> Im very happy with this product, I have one week using and I can see the results. I recommend this cream</li>
            <li> This is a wonderful product for getting rid of dry skin.  Use it all the time!  I highly recommend it</li>
            <li> I have icthyosis vulgaris, a genetic skin condition that results in very dry flaky skin. The ideal treatment usually includes creams and lotions with prescription levels of urea and AHA. But I am allergic to propylene glycol, which is in ever single prescription lotion for the condition. I was given some of this lotion from a skin care nurse in the hospital, and feel in love with it. So I was thrilled to find it at Amazon for a good price. The lotion is insanely thick, so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot and it lasts for days. I also have seen a marked improvement in my skin since using it. So I highly recommend both this product and the seller. Thank you so much!</li>
            <li> Excellent moisturizering cream. It leaves skin soft and not greasy. Great for the feet too.</li>
            <li> its great for dry diabetic  feet.</li>
            <li> This cream is fabulous. Before starting to use it, I did a Listerine feet soak ( 4 cups of warm water, 2 cups of original yellow Listerine and two cups of vinegar) and afterwards used the pumice stone to get rid of all the rough dead skin. That night I started using the cream an a week later my feet feel incredibly soft. Normally during Summer time when I use flip flops and Birkenstocks every day, my feet get very dry, but I believe this Summer will be different, I found the solution!</li>
            <li> The BEST cream ever for dry skin! I would highly recommend this product. Have been using for several years now.</li>
            <li> I first got this cream in the hospital to use to treat a wound on my leg.  Since then I have used it on my legs and face to keep my sensitive skin supple and moist instead of dried out and cracked.  I have seen this cream available at other locations but Amazon has been offering it for the best price I&#x27;ve seen anywhere.  Shipping is fast as well.</li>
            <li> I but this over and over.  It is the solution for my dry feet.  I have been trying for years to find a solution.  This is it.</li>
            <li> I was looking for a product that had both Urea and Alpha Hydroxy Acid in it and this fit the bill. More specifically, I was looking for something that had around 10% Urea and a lower percentage of AHA so was very happy when I found this formulation. After doing lots of research I found that this product used to only be found at wound clinics and hospitals and there are many people that have diabetes that use it on their feet and rave about the results.  I, however, use it on my feet AND face !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have severely dry, flaky skin like I do this product is awesome !! I have very sensitive skin on my face and thus haven&#x27;t been able to use many of the face creams that contain AHA without getting all red and splotchy so I was ecstatic when I discovered that this was effective at keeping dry, flaky skin at bay and very gentle on my face. It is a bit heavier than what I would use for a day cream though so I put it on at bedtime.</li>
            <li> This is the best skin cream ever and I&#x27;ve bought multiples of these for family members.  If you have hard, cracked heels the only thing that is going to work is urea which softens the skin and allows the moisture to penetrate.  The container is mess proof and the lotion is nice and thick and goes a long way.  Even my 23 year old says it is the best lotion she has ever used.  I&#x27;m even using it on my face because it has AHA in it as well---hard to find a good lotion with both  urea and AHA.  You can&#x27;t miss with this one, it&#x27;s a winner.</li>
            <li> I will buy this cream over and over again. Its a great consistency, it dissolves into skin perfectly and is working wonders on my skin....a brilliant cream.</li>
            <li> This is an excellent moisturizer!!! It works instantly to make your skin feel and look healthy and smooth and rubs in very well! I love that it is unscented! I very highly recommend this product!</li>
            <li> Best hand cream on the market.  Moisturizes, soothes, calms and smooths your skin.  Leaves no sticky traces.  Lasts for hours.  Helps heal cracks and rough spots.  It is the only really healing handcream that I would ever buy.  Worth every cent.  Stock up for the winter.</li>
            <li> I will never be without this cream. I&#x27;ve never used anything like it! I had deep painful cracks in my heels and had tried all kinds of creams that promised to fix my heels. I read the reviews online and tried this one. I cut the toes off a pair of cotton socks (can&#x27;t sleep in socks they make my feet hot!), used my foot file in the shower, slathered my heels with cream and put my socks on. I noticed a big difference the next morning. After a couple days my feet were almost completely heeled! This is my 2nd tube. Love it! Order it. It works!</li>
            <li> This is the best hand cream, It&#x27;s strong so only use on feet, elbows, hands.</li>
            <li> This is the only cream that works for my very dry skin here in Colorado.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes my skin smooth and hydrates all day. If I apply in the morning, my skin still feels and looks great even in the evening. Most creams get absorbed so quickly that my skin looks dry within an hour or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> good stuff! use it at work and bought some for home. Husband who is a diabetic uses it on his feet and loves it.</li>
            <li> Absolutely amazing for dry feet!</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have a serious skin condition requiring this cream.  However, I wear sandals a lot and like to keep my feet looking pretty.  Unlike other creams, this has one staying power.  I put it on each evening at bedtime and again in the morning when I am dressing for the day. It does a great job hydrating areas that usually get dry over the course of a day, and extends the time in between pedicures.  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Excellent.  Works like nothing else I have tried.</li>
            <li> Great hospital grade moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I read about this lotion through Pintrest! Oh Wow! I started using it right away. I just use about a dime size drop and rub it into my heels and all over my feet. Then I put on a pair of fuzzy socks and go on about my business. The results after using it just one time are phenomenal! I&#x27;ve been using it for over a week now and my feet are so smooth and soft! I have started making my hubby use it also, he has super dry cracked feet (especially in the winter!). So far, so good for him too! If you have dry, cracked feet in the winter time, this is totally the BEST solution! I have used all kinds of other OTC creams, balms and lotions in the past...nothing has ever had this quick and substaintial results. My hands are also much softer and smoother. I have very sensitive skin and alot of things irritate me. I have used a tiny bit around my nose for dry flakiness resulting from a cold...works awesome there too! Try it! Happy Soft Feet!</li>
            <li> Used it only three times on some sad cracked heels. Very quickly they improved. Almost like a miracle (I&#x27;ve tried many things).</li>
            <li> My favorite lotion in the world! So glad I found it on here! I have such dry hands and this works so good! Thank you!</li>
            <li> Purchased it for cracked feet. Did work as intended. Extremely happy with the purchase will use it again next winter.</li>
            <li> I love this moisturizing cream! It makes my dry skin soft and hydrated. A must for dry hands and feet.</li>
            <li> I do lots of gardening, pruning, and cutting, then afterward my hands are terribly dry and just awful.  I almost quit working in my yard since it would take 3 days for my hands to be OK.  Now I play in the dirt all I like and use Atrac-Tain afterward.  It works amazingly.  I don&#x27;t use it for everyday use, but following any type of heavy manual labor there is just nothing else like it!</li>
            <li> This cream brought my skin back to normal after being in a cast for 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> Using it on cracked and dry feet at night.  The first morning I felt a difference, and it gets better every day.  Glad I found this cream.</li>
            <li> best that i have ever tried!!!!</li>
            <li> heals those really bad deep cracks on feet and hands.</li>
            <li> excellent emollient, particularly for feet and hands,  a little goes a long way,  neutral smell, i.e., not any......recommended to me by medical staff at wound care clinic.....a bit pricey but worth it.</li>
            <li> Very cracked and dry feet and nothing worked except this lotion. Must continue to put it on nightly, but you will see a difference.</li>
            <li> Urea acid draws moisture from the environment and provides needed moisture: feet dry out in the low moisture Midwestern winter and this prevents and heals the inevitable heel cracks that develop. Better than any product I&#x27;ve ever used. Pricey and worth it.</li>
            <li> I have tried every lotion, moisturizer, prescription cream you can imagine with no relief. Within 2 days my hands were soft and looked normal. This lotion does not feel greasy and a little goes a long way. Love this lotion. Highly recommended!</li>
            <li> Great moisturizer in these dry winter months.  My hands and feet feel much softer and nourished with this great product.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing cream is the only cream I&#x27;ve found that will relieve the cracking on my feet that I get during the dry winter.  It&#x27;s pricey, so I use it sparingly, but it really does the job.</li>
            <li> Love it.  It truly works on cracked skin.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to my sister by a wound care specialist, and it is wonderful. Although I live in a large city, I have only found it in tiny tubes, if at all, in local drug stores.  You will want more. It soaks in great on dry skin and is not greasy at all. My sister likes it so much she is passing tubes out to friends like Johnny Appleseed!</li>
            <li> This is the only thing that has cleared up my dry elbows.  Works so good.  This size is also a great deal.</li>
            <li> Ordered this after using it at work.. Excellent!</li>
            <li> Most amazing hand/heal/elbow cream I have EVER found/used!!!  Seriously HEALS even terribly dry/cracked skin...I WILL be buying more!!!</li>
            <li> GREAT FOR SEVERLY...I MEAN REALLY SEVERE.... CHAPPED, DRY SKIN. IT WILL TAKE ALL THE DRY SKIN OFF IN A MATTER OF DAYS AND LEAVE NEW BABY SOFT SKIN.</li>
            <li> The best lotion I have found</li>
            <li> My feet were so dry and rough. I&#x27;ve tried just about every Gold Bond product out there along with other skin lotions. None really works that well. Atrac-Tain., just two applications and my feet are smoother, the rough heels already softening. I wear socks after applying Atrac-Tain. Even wear the socks to bed. This seems to speed up the healing. By far this is the best skin lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I also like that it has no scent and it is easily absorbed into the skin.</li>
            <li> ...I didn&#x27;t have the dramatic results that other users/reviewers did.  It definitely moisturized my feet, but my heels still need some more help.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great! I purchased it for rough, cracked heels after a brutal Minnesota winter to prep for summer sandal weather. I&#x27;m very scent sensative but this is truly scent free--no odor at all, not even a medicinal smell that some &amp;#34;odorless&amp;#34; products have. The cream itself is not greasy or too heavy and absorbs well. The only minor complaint that I have is that I find it needs to be applied every day. If I skip even one day, I notice that my skin dries out rapidly again. I completely understand that this is no miracle and I need to be more attentive and use it daily, but I&#x27;ve used other less intense creams that have not required daily use after the original problem area is resolved. Again, I reiterate that&#x27;s my problem not the creams lol.</li>
            <li> If you get those painful skin cracks on the tips of your fingers or on your feet in the winter, this is the product for you. I am a certified wound nurse and have recommended this to patients and friends with unanimously great results. My partner got relief for a cracked finger tip after the very first application and it was closed the next day. He stopped using it and, of course, the crack returned but another couple of applications of Atrac-Tain and it healed again. So preventive use is recommended in cold weather.</li>
            <li> My wound care doctor prescribed this for me.  It relieves the itching and burning on my lower legs.  It keeps them soft and moisturized and it&#x27;s something I will always have to use.</li>
            <li> Wonderful product for severely dry skin.</li>
            <li> Works well.  Heals up skin with no steroid - does not thin the skin.</li>
            <li> My feet feel like they&#x27;re supposed to again. I&#x27;m so grateful to have found this product.</li>
            <li> Great product. Good price. Fast shipping. Well packed. Would buy it again</li>
            <li> works great on keeping my hands soft and is slowly helping my calluses on my feet</li>
            <li> With my husbands job he washes his hands a minimum of 40 times a day this cream helps soothe his dry skin. My daughters and I use it on our feet especially during sandal season.</li>
            <li> I have used so many products for my cracked heels and nothing worked. This product has gotten rid of the cracks in 2 weeks! Love it!!</li>
            <li> Living in the desert and wearing sandals all the time this cream keeps my feet looking good especially when it is really hot out.Great for hands as well.</li>
            <li> It works great! The hospitals use it. AND This is a great price to boot! A little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> THIS IS JUST A LOTION SORT OF HIGH PRICED</li>
            <li> This worked really quick on my dry dry dry hands.  Noticed a lot of healing within the first few days.  I even think my fingernails are growing quicker?</li>
            <li> this stuff is amazing!! I have tried a lot of products for my rough heels over the years and came across this stuff and figured why not try it since I&#x27;ve bought everything else out there. This is the only stuff i have found to work on my feet. they are almost as soft as baby feet. Best product i have found on the market!</li>
            <li> When my Mom was in the hospital they gave her a small tube of this. My wife tried it and made me get her some. Worth the price. You don&#x27;t need much &amp; it healed my cracked skin quickly. Great stuff; plan to keep using it through these northern winters.</li>
