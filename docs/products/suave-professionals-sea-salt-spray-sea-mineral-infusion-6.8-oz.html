    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>It also smells wonderful.</li>
            <li>spray has a pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>The texturizing spray has a pleasant smell that is not overpowering.  </li>
            <li>I loved how it worked and have used it since.  </li>
            <li>The good thing about Suave products is that you can experiment because they are affordable.  </li>
            <li>Suave makes some good dupe-type products, but this one didn&#x27;t impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>it provides good body and lift to the hair.  </li>
            <li>A good price I may or may not use again.</li>
            <li>I love this product!</li>
            <li>and I love it!</li>
            <li>I was replacing Sexy Hair Healthy Soy Renewal Beach Spray which works great, so I thought I would try this Suave version (which is alternative to Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s spray), but honestly it doesn&#x27;t work as well or smell as good as the Sexy Hair brand.  </li>
            <li>- maybe this is why she thought the smell of this Suave product was nice.  </li>
            <li>You know the kind</li>
            <li>Liked the scent which is very light and not overpowering.</li>
            <li>The natural tussle of a night sleep gives it the &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; effect the bottle recommends for best results.</li>
            <li>with the conditioner the hair with layers got better results.  </li>
            <li>I tried it over about 8-10 days in varying degrees of humidity and never once felt pleased with the results.</li>
            <li>have also tried just twisting each piece after I sprayed it and it works a bit better that way, but it still gets crunchy as well.  </li>
            <li>(mostly beachy frizz because of the salt</li>
            <li>Mostly-</li>
            <li>but I still used it more than once on those days.</li>
            <li>Just wish it held up better.</li>
            <li>This spray makes it more in waves</li>
            <li>and you get that lovely wavy hair.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an okay product but not anything that I would purchase in the future.nse.</li>
            <li>best way for me to achieve that look was with a technique where you put your hair into curls using your fingers then take a flat iron to press the curl into a curl.</li>
            <li>like the application, it&#x27;s easy to spray on the roots when my hair is damp and then tousle it through.  </li>
            <li>It does not leave the hair sticky, and makes the hair easy to style.</li>
            <li>Wish I had stuck with it, because now I have a large bottle of this stuff which honestly does nothing for my hair.  </li>
            <li>B00HTT6QWG L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Hairstyle</li>
            <li>There wasn’t anything special about it that makes hair wave.</li>
            <li>So I just try to be sure not to use too much, and that seems to help.</li>
            <li>I will give it a star for a pleasant smell, and another star because it does hold the hair in place and make it look okay, but when I touch it my hair feels stiff and straw like.</li>
            <li>- I like how my hair feels after a day at the beach, but if I want that effect without actually going for swim in the Atlantic, surely it would make more sense to put my head in a sink full of salted water.</li>
            <li>Although I like the smooth light weight weather proof cream by Suave, I don&#x27;t really care for this Sea Salt Texture spray.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not quite sure what natural looking texture is as opposed to what it would look like without this product.</li>
            <li>pretty cute.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I will absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li>There are many products out there to give you that same look including DIY recipes.</li>
            <li>, I straighten it first.</li>
            <li>/&gt;This is an okay product but not anything that I would purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice, easy look, but it amazes me how hard it is to replicate it with a product intended for that effect.</li>
            <li>I wanted to try the Suave version because I have liked some of the other Suave products I&#x27;ve tried</li>
            <li>Usually works best for me when I spray it in, let it air dry for a bit, then get to bed.</li>
            <li>The fragrance is nice, not very strong to me.  </li>
            <li>and she said it didn&#x27;t seem to make that much difference</li>
            <li>- I asked &amp;#34;that much difference compared to what?&amp;#34; and she said &amp;#34;compared to not using anything.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>Now on a normal day it holds pretty well</li>
            <li>It really adds texture and helps my hair maintain whatever style I&#x27;m going for.</li>
            <li>On further reflection she thought it smelled nice and that maybe it allowed her to go an extra day without shampooing her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I was disappointed because it smells so good and claimed to be just the kind of product I wanted.</li>
            <li>The current price is right also!  </li>
            <li>but I particularly don&#x27;t like the tacky feel of it.</li>
            <li>A decent product</li>
            <li>I have fine hair, and while I have a lot of it, there&#x27;s not much body to it.  </li>
            <li>IT Tousle Wave Spray]] for body and to create more of a messy look.  </li>
            <li>Normally, I straightened it, even when I curl it</li>
            <li>Twisting and fluffing just made my hair look like it does normally.</li>
            <li>Not a bad product- more or less what I expected.</li>
            <li>Otherwise there is not too much difference between using this product and what you could accomplish with twisting strands of your hair and letting them dry naturally or for even more curl braid your hair let it dry then undo the braids and your hair will really be curly.</li>
            <li>I personally don’t care for that scent but the scent isn’t strong enough to be off putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I personally don’t care for that scent but the scent isn’t strong enough to be off putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Maybe next time, Suave will get it right.</li>
            <li>It is packed with the new super-saturated &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;</li>
            <li>I saw a lot of new products this Spring and Summer for that beach style hair.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s possible I didn&#x27;t use enough of the product to get the full effect</li>
            <li>My dry straight mom hair didn&#x27;t notice much in the way of results.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m near salt water.</li>
            <li>This stuff also left this really gooey residue on my neck and shoulders.  </li>
            <li>Suave offers “Sea Mineral Infusion” to a variety of their hair and body products.</li>
            <li>The directions on the bottle say that it will create natural looking texture and waves.</li>
            <li>I get from having naturally wavy/curly hair.</li>
            <li>But my hair seemed particularly lank and yet also coarsely textured.</li>
            <li>I have long straight hair</li>
            <li>, it’s not wavy enough to be pretty, just looks like I’ve not fixed my hair.</li>
            <li>This is not due to my hair, because I&#x27;ve noticed if I don&#x27;t use this before drying my hair, the ends do not have this look.  </li>
            <li>is that my hair was less frizzy with the high high humidity.</li>
            <li>The only difference I&#x27;ve seen with the Suave is that the ends tend to look quite dry and frizzy if I apply too much.  </li>

            <li> It smells great, but failed the basic standard I have: my hair looks worse with this product than it does with nothing.</li>
            <li> This spray adds lots of texture to the roots, so my hair doesn&#x27;t just flop flat against my head after drying/</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product several ways: twist and air dry; as a replacement for gel.....</li>
            <li> The Sauve sea salt mineral spray left my hair sticky and dry.</li>
            <li> and she has long hair that has layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I do not expect a product like this to be so loaded with fragrance that it would be an issue, but Suave has decided that all of their products must stink to the nth degree, so I am not really surprised.</li>
            <li> Never really thought it actually smelled like the beach.</li>
            <li> No beachy waves, even after scrunching until the hair was dry</li>
            <li> I let it air dry.</li>
            <li> It does create waves if you twist the strands of your hair and let them dry and not brush or comb your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The problem with a lot of them is that salt can dry your hair</li>
            <li> Life is busy enough without my senses being forced to work overtime, too.</li>
            <li> A most unpleasant experience.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried adding this spray to my hair before twisting it up, but it didn&#x27;t give my hair any extra wave and made the hair slightly crunchy.  </li>
            <li> Applied to wet hair and then blow-dried</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair that is long.  </li>
            <li> After my hair is dried, I&#x27;ll style with my flat iron</li>
            <li> do like the smell, but I tried this both on slightly damp and dry hair and nothing happened.</li>
            <li> It has other added ingredients which balance that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Beach hair is that messy, loose wavy curls.</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair, so I get &#x27;beachy&#x27; waves anytime</li>
            <li> The previously stated brand did help with all that.  </li>
            <li> My hair feels a little crunchy afterwards like it is just a setting</li>
            <li> The sea mineral spray did give a little added boost to my curls but nothing to write home about.</li>
            <li> It does nothing for mine hard to style thick, coarse</li>
            <li> you will have stiff strands of hair.</li>
            <li> I shampooed my hair as usual, then towel dried it and sprayed it with this texturizing sea salt spray.</li>
            <li> it helps with controlling frizz without giving it a hard gel/mousse feel.</li>
            <li> and it&#x27;s really hard to deal with.</li>
            <li> It does make your hair look wind blown with the hair forming groups yet doesn&#x27;t help at least not me with the frizz</li>
            <li> you spray it on thickly</li>
            <li> It gives my hair a dry tacky feel that almost feels dirty.</li>
            <li> It leaves my hair feeling weighed down and dirty, like spending a day in the salty breeze on the beach.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Paul Mitchell sea salt spray, and this compares poorly.</li>
            <li> They usually prompt a nasty headache.</li>
            <li> I hate the smell of Febreze</li>
    </ol>

            <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product several ways: twist and air dry; as a replacement for gel..... I have to say that it isn&#x27;t much different from using a &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; gel/mousse</li>
            <li> I have fine hair, and while I have a lot of it, there&#x27;s not much body to it.  Since my haircut is shorter &amp; layered, last year a friend from work recommended trying [[ASIN:B00HTT6QWG L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Hairstyle TXT IT Tousle Wave Spray]] for body and to create more of a messy look.  I loved how it worked and have used it since.  I wanted to try the Suave version because I have liked some of the other Suave products I&#x27;ve tried lately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the application, it&#x27;s easy to spray on the roots when my hair is damp and then tousle it through.  The fragrance is nice, not very strong to me.  After my hair is dried, I&#x27;ll style with my flat iron and I&#x27;m done.  This spray adds lots of texture to the roots, so my hair doesn&#x27;t just flop flat against my head after drying/styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are basically the same as what I have with the L&#x27;Oreal product.  The only difference I&#x27;ve seen with the Suave is that the ends tend to look quite dry and frizzy if I apply too much.  This is not due to my hair, because I&#x27;ve noticed if I don&#x27;t use this before drying my hair, the ends do not have this look.  So I just try to be sure not to use too much, and that seems to help.</li>
            <li> I purchased this (elsewhere) to go with the Suave Sea Mineral Conditioner which my daughter and I tried.  I have long straight hair and she has long hair that has layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with the conditioner the hair with layers got better results.  Or it might have to do with the texture and condition of our hair.  My dry straight mom hair didn&#x27;t notice much in the way of results.  My daughters layered hair had shine and waves and looked pretty cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me it &#x27;s a toss up as to whether you are going to get the results you want.  The good thing about Suave products is that you can experiment because they are affordable.  One thing I did notice, which I forgot to mention is that my hair was less frizzy with the high high humidity.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used the Paul Mitchell sea salt spray, and this compares poorly. It smells great, but failed the basic standard I have: my hair looks worse with this product than it does with nothing. I have thin wavy hair, and hoped this would add light texture an volume, as it describes. But my hair seemed particularly lank and yet also coarsely textured. I was disappointed because it smells so good and claimed to be just the kind of product I wanted. I tried it over about 8-10 days in varying degrees of humidity and never once felt pleased with the results.</li>
            <li> This doesn&#x27;t work as well as I had hoped it would.  I have slightly wavy hair that is long.  I often will put my hair up in a twisted bun at night to help it gain more wave.  I tried adding this spray to my hair before twisting it up, but it didn&#x27;t give my hair any extra wave and made the hair slightly crunchy.  I am not a fan of the crunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also tried just twisting each piece after I sprayed it and it works a bit better that way, but it still gets crunchy as well.  The scent is pleasing and has a beachy smell to it.</li>
            <li> I have slightly wavy hair, so I get &#x27;beachy&#x27; waves anytime I&#x27;m near salt water. It&#x27;s a nice, easy look, but it amazes me how hard it is to replicate it with a product intended for that effect. Suave makes some good dupe-type products, but this one didn&#x27;t impress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the smell, but I tried this both on slightly damp and dry hair and nothing happened. No beachy waves, even after scrunching until the hair was dry (mostly beachy frizz because of the salt content.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice try, though. Maybe next time, Suave will get it right.</li>
            <li> I would have given it no stars if I could. I have no idea if this works or not. It is packed with the new super-saturated &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; (STINK), that I had to wash it out of my hair immediately. I have a problem with fragrances. They usually prompt a nasty headache. I do not expect a product like this to be so loaded with fragrance that it would be an issue, but Suave has decided that all of their products must stink to the nth degree, so I am not really surprised. I do hope this fad of super-scented products (concentrated dryer beads, etc) goes away soon. Life is busy enough without my senses being forced to work overtime, too.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again.  I was replacing Sexy Hair Healthy Soy Renewal Beach Spray which works great, so I thought I would try this Suave version (which is alternative to Bumble &amp; Bumble&#x27;s spray), but honestly it doesn&#x27;t work as well or smell as good as the Sexy Hair brand.  Wish I had stuck with it, because now I have a large bottle of this stuff which honestly does nothing for my hair.  There&#x27;s no hold, there&#x27;s no volume, nothing for my waves/curls.  The previously stated brand did help with all that.  Bummer!</li>
            <li> Not a bad product- more or less what I expected. Usually works best for me when I spray it in, let it air dry for a bit, then get to bed. The natural tussle of a night sleep gives it the &amp;#34;twist&amp;#34; effect the bottle recommends for best results. Mostly- it helps with controlling frizz without giving it a hard gel/mousse feel.</li>
            <li> My wife and I have had somewhat different reactions to this product.  I asked her what she thought of it and she said it didn&#x27;t seem to make that much difference - I asked &amp;#34;that much difference compared to what?&amp;#34; and she said &amp;#34;compared to not using anything.&amp;#34;  On further reflection she thought it smelled nice and that maybe it allowed her to go an extra day without shampooing her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My reaction was that it was like spraying Febreze in my hair.  I hate the smell of Febreze and I subsequently realized that on occasion my wife uses some hairspray that smells to me like Febreze - maybe this is why she thought the smell of this Suave product was nice.  This stuff also left this really gooey residue on my neck and shoulders.  A most unpleasant experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the idea of a product that would give my hair the effect of having gone swimming in ocean - I like how my hair feels after a day at the beach, but if I want that effect without actually going for swim in the Atlantic, surely it would make more sense to put my head in a sink full of salted water.</li>
            <li> This product works for me somewhat. It does not only give me the air blown, wavy beach hair look but also the tacky feel that I get after a day at the beach. I shampooed my hair as usual, then towel dried it and sprayed it with this texturizing sea salt spray. I let it air dry. The results have the beach hair look but I particularly don&#x27;t like the tacky feel of it. It leaves my hair feeling weighed down and dirty, like spending a day in the salty breeze on the beach. It is just not for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray has a pleasant scent. It fades away after a couple of hours but during that time people would notice it.</li>
            <li> The texturizing spray has a pleasant smell that is not overpowering.  It does not take a lot of the spray to get results.  Applied to wet hair and then blow-dried it provides good body and lift to the hair.  It does not leave the hair sticky, and makes the hair easy to style. This is a product that I would purchase and use on a regular basis.  The current price is right also!  Suave offers “Sea Mineral Infusion” to a variety of their hair and body products.</li>
            <li> The Sauve sea salt mineral spray left my hair sticky and dry. I will give it a star for a pleasant smell, and another star because it does hold the hair in place and make it look okay, but when I touch it my hair feels stiff and straw like. Not something I&#x27;d use again or buy.</li>
            <li> A decent product but it does not hold well throughout the day if it is windy or colder-you will have to use it several times a day-which I did. Now on a normal day it holds pretty well but I still used it more than once on those days. Liked the scent which is very light and not overpowering. A good price I may or may not use again. Just wish it held up better.</li>
            <li> I love this product! It really adds texture and helps my hair maintain whatever style I&#x27;m going for. It also smells wonderful. I will absolutely buy this again!</li>
            <li> I know it will say that I did not purchase the product; however, I did. I bought it at Walmart. I have frizzy, curly hair and it&#x27;s really hard to deal with. This spray makes it more in waves and I love it! Totally recommend it.</li>
            <li> The directions on the bottle say that it will create natural looking texture and waves. I&#x27;m not quite sure what natural looking texture is as opposed to what it would look like without this product. It does create waves if you twist the strands of your hair and let them dry and not brush or comb your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you spray it on thickly you will have stiff strands of hair. Otherwise there is not too much difference between using this product and what you could accomplish with twisting strands of your hair and letting them dry naturally or for even more curl braid your hair let it dry then undo the braids and your hair will really be curly.</li>
            <li> I saw a lot of new products this Spring and Summer for that beach style hair. Beach hair is that messy, loose wavy curls. You spend the day at the beach and in the ocean and you get that lovely wavy hair. There are many products out there to give you that same look including DIY recipes. The problem with a lot of them is that salt can dry your hair out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave Sea Mineral Infusion Texturizing Sea Salt Spray contains actual sea salt but it is listed as the last ingredient. I didn’t find that it was drying to my hair. It has other added ingredients which balance that out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair already. You know the kind, it’s not wavy enough to be pretty, just looks like I’ve not fixed my hair. Normally, I straightened it, even when I curl it, I straighten it first. I thought that I would embrace my inner waviness and try the beach wave look. I even watched tons of videos online to help me achieve that wavy look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this product alone did nothing for my hair. Twisting and fluffing just made my hair look like it does normally. The directions say that I can use this product and just twist hair by section to give me waves. There are a lot of the videos showing that technique. It does nothing for mine hard to style thick, coarse hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best way for me to achieve that look was with a technique where you put your hair into curls using your fingers then take a flat iron to press the curl into a curl. Now release the curl. The girl doing that video just uses heat protectant for her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thats basically what I found with this product. There wasn’t anything special about it that makes hair wave. My hair feels a little crunchy afterwards like it is just a setting spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It says it has a sea inspired fragrance. It does have that scent that companies use for lotions and candles that are water or beach inspired. Never really thought it actually smelled like the beach. Just a blue scent to me if that makes sense. All the lotions and candles like that are blue in color. I personally don’t care for that scent but the scent isn’t strong enough to be off putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an okay product but not anything that I would purchase in the future.nse. All the lotions and candles like that are blue in color. I personally don’t care for that scent but the scent isn’t strong enough to be off putting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an okay product but not anything that I would purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> The sea mineral spray did give a little added boost to my curls but nothing to write home about. The scent was a drawback, didn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s possible I didn&#x27;t use enough of the product to get the full effect but the scent caused me to stop spraying. I won&#x27;t be using the this again.</li>
            <li> Although I like the smooth light weight weather proof cream by Suave, I don&#x27;t really care for this Sea Salt Texture spray. It gives my hair a dry tacky feel that almost feels dirty. It does make your hair look wind blown with the hair forming groups yet doesn&#x27;t help at least not me with the frizz I get from having naturally wavy/curly hair. It just not for my hair type so I have to rate it a two star as I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
