            <li> Excellent, excellent hairspray.</li>
            <li> Product itself is fine how it was shipped not so good! The cap was broke and the sprayer was off thank god it worked. You night think of packaging it better. Just a thought.</li>
            <li> Best finishing spray ever!! Especially with the humidity!</li>
            <li> Great product arrived on time.</li>
            <li> I love this hairspray, but recently the sprayer breaks down and will not spray after, maybe, having used only a quarter of the can. Nothing seems to work to clear/fix the sprayer. I am wasting money with each purchase. Please, someone help</li>
            <li> Love this line, and the hairspray, too. Just a light mist does the trick. Brushes out very easily, with no weird white residue.</li>

            <li> this is great hairspray.  It is not heavy and sticky.  Does not require a lot to hold hair in place.  My hairdresser told me to hold my hair up and spray at the root . . she is right.  This gives the hair nice lift without feeling heavy and sprayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aquage products are really really good altho expensive.</li>
            <li> The gal who cuts my hair recommended this hair spray.  It holds with a light spray that does not make my hair sticky or hard.&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job with my fine hair!</li>
            <li> It was fine, no problems</li>
            <li> This is my favorite hair spray.  Never sticky or hard, yet holds very well.</li>
            <li> Love it, have no complaints, just can&#x27;t find it in any where else</li>
            <li> Received on time.  It was a reasonable price to pay for two bottles of Aquage Hair Spray.  I will enjoy it.</li>
            <li> I love this product.  My hairdresser turned me on to it 3-4 years ago, and I re-order anytime I&amp;#34;m getting low.  Holds great without any stickiness or tackiness -- leaves hair feeling like there&#x27;s no spray at all, but holds well.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended by my stylist, who also uses it. I love the flexibility that comes with such good hold.</li>
            <li> My favorite hair spray!  Great to be able to purchase it online.  Not always available through stylist.</li>
            <li> Absolutely the only harspray that I can use!  It holds well and doesn&#x27;t make my head itch.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s getting harder and harder to find Aquage Spray.  Hope you have it forever!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff!!!! Have been an Aquage customer for years.  The quality never wanes, the scent remains fresh and light.  This hair spray definitely does the job!</li>
            <li> Love this hairspray.  In the humid south, this product is a necessity for fine hair!</li>
            <li> The best ever hair spray!</li>
            <li> My wife has used the product for many years and it works very well for her and her texture of hair.</li>
            <li> Who wouldn&#x27;t love this spray?  I have a lot of hair and I love the application and hold!</li>

            <li> This finishing spray works like a hair spray in it&#x27;s control, but it is so light, one doesn&#x27;t know they have it on.  No build-up or stickiness.</li>
            <li> Product came timely and was just what I ordered.  I really like this product, it&#x27;s a flex hold so when used it doesn&#x27;t feel like I have a bunch of sticky hair spray on.  I can still run my fingers through my hair, it feels very natural.</li>
            <li> Love this spray and it&#x27;s a great price!!</li>
            <li> this hairspray works best on my fine, difficult hair.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the best hair spray I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> Regularly use this hair spray as it holds well with little smell.</li>
            <li> Love this hair spray. I wash my hair every other day so I need a spray that allows me to use a straightener the following morning after having had it in the day before. This spray is fine with that.</li>
