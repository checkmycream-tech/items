            <li>Fits perfect.</li>
            <li>Very happy</li>
            <li>It works wonderfully.</li>
            <li>Great elastics that keeps it in place, even if you roll around the bed it wont move.</li>
            <li>Great for room darkening.</li>
            <li>This is a good mask for the price.</li>
            <li>Love this!</li>
            <li>The material has a nice silky feel and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin or eye area.</li>
            <li>I have grand kids with autism and they have sensory issues, good size</li>
            <li>The eye mask is a nice eyemask for the price.</li>
            <li>No, it isn&#x27;t perfect, but I absolutely can not complain for the price I paid.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s so nice to wear, and cheap!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m pretty picky, and these made me happy.  </li>
            <li>works great really blocks out</li>
            <li>It is silk through and through, unlike many sleep masks these days.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice and soft and covers everything great.</li>
            <li>I have found over the years that if I sleep with an eye mask on that I am awake much more rested and refreshed.</li>
            <li>Two straps rather than one made sure it stayed on my head.  </li>
            <li>Shipping is slower than most of the online stuff I order, but it did arrive within the time-frame promised.</li>
            <li>:)</li>
            <li>Spend a buck or two more and get one that works</li>
            <li>in all, it&#x27;s wonderful for occasional use to block out light for a headache.</li>
            <li>Filling is minimal at best.</li>
            <li>I got it 20 days after ordering... but for $2 and free shipping was easy to risk.</li>
            <li>light well.</li>
            <li>It does the job in protecting your eyes from light and it is as comfy as these things can get.</li>
            <li>Shield out 99% of the light.  </li>
            <li>and they do block out light</li>
            <li>Nice eye mask, fits very well.</li>
            <li>But if you use a sleep mask every night and/or want every bit of light out, keep looking.</li>
            <li>that&#x27;s why i gave it 4 stars but its not and overall its good if you like to sleep with the light on but don&#x27;t like having light in your eyes while trying to fall asleep.</li>
            <li>Love this so much</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s pretty cheaply made.</li>
            <li>With the silk masks, the product is allowed to be absorbed by the skin and not the mask.  </li>
            <li>The eyemask feels so soft and is strechable.:)</li>
            <li>That, to me, is worth it.</li>
            <li>This fits just right for me.</li>
            <li>its soft and is easy to wear.</li>
            <li>a cheap, soft, flimsy product that is almost worth the price.</li>
            <li>It works for me because I&#x27;m not one of those people that needs 0% visibility and 100% of light out, but depending on your facial shape it might let some light get</li>
            <li>Really good product, it&#x27;s not too tight which I like.</li>
            <li>For the price, it is good, but next time I think I will go with something a little more long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This is exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I thought it smelled funny when I opened it</li>
            <li>It took awhile to get here since it was from China, but other than that love it!</li>
            <li>Nice silk but a little stuff.</li>
            <li>There is no edging around the outside, so the straps just hold the middle part to your eyes and the top and bottom are open letting in light.  </li>
            <li>Planning to get a few more for travel &amp; home use.</li>
            <li>Love my black eye mask!</li>
            <li>A lot of masks place a cotton lining on the inside, which is what rests directly on your eyes.  </li>
            <li>Really helps getting you to that deep relaxing sleep.</li>
            <li>Soft -</li>
            <li>Worth buying two so one can be used and the other washed, by hand only.</li>
            <li>so you can sleep peacefully in the dark.</li>
            <li>I was considering getting black out curtains but figured I&#x27;d try this first as it was just a couple of bucks vs $40+ for curtains.</li>
            <li>This mask took a long time to get to me and it is cheap and the packaging was cheap and dirty.</li>

            <li> More expensive one were cumbersome and a lot of trouble because they were  bulky.  </li>
            <li> soft silk mask, headband a little too tight.</li>
            <li> Soft and comfy but A little thin, elastic won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> Maybe it might become a little loose.</li>
            <li> the tightness makes the mask press down on my eyes</li>

            <li> But, it&#x27;s not something that I&#x27;ll be using everyday.</li>
            <li> Never again dont waste your time with this.</li>
            <li> I let it sit out for a few hours before I went to sleep.  </li>
            <li> I work nights and hate any light.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
            <li> I have a small head and they are tight.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s tiny, it&#x27;s useless, it&#x27;s poorly made.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t use it as often as I thought I would because the sensation of something over your eyes and nose is uncomfortable despite the elastic band not being too tight.</li>
            <li> Sooooo slow to arrive!</li>
            <li> I was expecting something lke the cheap-o ones you get at the drug store, but these are even much worse than that.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not perfect, but it helps me sleep every day.</li>
            <li> Completely worthless.  </li>
            <li> One thing about ordering is that it is shipped from Hong Kong, so expect a 3-4 week wait for it, which is very annoying.</li>

            <li> More expensive one were cumbersome and a lot of trouble because they were  bulky.  This fits just right for me.</li>
            <li> works great really blocks out light well. it can be a little itchy that&#x27;s why i gave it 4 stars but its not and overall its good if you like to sleep with the light on but don&#x27;t like having light in your eyes while trying to fall asleep.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my hubby and he loves it. its soft and is easy to wear. He had no complaints</li>
            <li> This is exactly what I was looking for.  It is silk through and through, unlike many sleep masks these days.  A lot of masks place a cotton lining on the inside, which is what rests directly on your eyes.  If you&#x27;re like me and use a serum/special moisturizer on your eyes at night, the cotton lining just absorbs the product.  With the silk masks, the product is allowed to be absorbed by the skin and not the mask.  One thing about ordering is that it is shipped from Hong Kong, so expect a 3-4 week wait for it, which is very annoying.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s pretty cheaply made. But, it&#x27;s not something that I&#x27;ll be using everyday. All in all, it gets the job  done.</li>
            <li> Great mask! It&#x27;s nice and soft and covers everything great. I&#x27;m worried about the elastics, though, they don&#x27;t seem like they will last...</li>
            <li> There is no edging around the outside, so the straps just hold the middle part to your eyes and the top and bottom are open letting in light.  Completely worthless.  I threw them in the trash.  I was expecting something lke the cheap-o ones you get at the drug store, but these are even much worse than that.</li>
            <li> I was ordering these masks as part of a party favor bag. Everything else I ordered came well before the event and well within the month window I had allowed- these came two weeks after the event! Sooooo slow to arrive!</li>
            <li> It does the job in protecting your eyes from light and it is as comfy as these things can get. I don&#x27;t use it as often as I thought I would because the sensation of something over your eyes and nose is uncomfortable despite the elastic band not being too tight.</li>
            <li> a cheap, soft, flimsy product that is almost worth the price. Inexpensive enough to say &amp;#34;no harm, no foul&amp;#34;. bbbbb</li>
            <li> Love my black eye mask! I have found over the years that if I sleep with an eye mask on that I am awake much more rested and refreshed. The material has a nice silky feel and doesn&#x27;t irritate the skin or eye area.</li>
            <li> Shield out 99% of the light.  Light-weight.  Two straps rather than one made sure it stayed on my head.  Fits perfect. I&#x27;m pretty picky, and these made me happy.  I&#x27;ll buy a couple spares.  Shipping is slower than most of the online stuff I order, but it did arrive within the time-frame promised. Very happy</li>
            <li> This is a Very basic mask. Filling is minimal at best. Not enough substance to stay across the eyes when it is worn.</li>
            <li> Nice silk but a little stuff. I have grand kids with autism and they have sensory issues, good size and they do block out light</li>
            <li> I purchased this for my bf and he has got some use from it.The eye mask is a nice eyemask for the price.:) The eyemask feels so soft and is strechable.:)</li>
            <li> I have a small head and they are tight. they don&#x27;t keep their form either, bunching up over my eyes. I&#x27;m still looking.</li>
            <li> Nice eye mask, fits very well.</li>
            <li> This mask took a long time to get to me and it is cheap and the packaging was cheap and dirty.Never again dont waste your time with this.</li>
            <li> nothing but a flimsy piece of material and elastic that came apart before I could put it on. Spend a buck or two more and get one that works</li>
            <li> I was considering getting black out curtains but figured I&#x27;d try this first as it was just a couple of bucks vs $40+ for curtains. It works wonderfully. If you have someone watching TV in the door (lights off) this will block out that &#x27;glow&#x27; so you can sleep peacefully in the dark.</li>
            <li> Love this so much I got one for each of my co-workers on the  night shift.!!!  Really helps getting you to that deep relaxing sleep.</li>
            <li> Great elastics that keeps it in place, even if you roll around the bed it wont move. Planning to get a few more for travel &amp; home use.</li>
            <li> My husband uses this and likes it alot.</li>
            <li> Really good product, it&#x27;s not too tight which I like.</li>
            <li> Great for room darkening. Was hoping for something a little thicker,  but they work.</li>
            <li> soft silk mask, headband a little too tight. the tightness makes the mask press down on my eyes so i have to keep it on my nose which hurts after a bit. Maybe it might become a little loose.</li>
            <li> As a 2nd shift worker it&#x27;s helped me out. No, it isn&#x27;t perfect, but I absolutely can not complain for the price I paid. It&#x27;s not perfect, but it helps me sleep every day. For a couple bucks I get another hour of sleep. That, to me, is worth it.</li>
            <li> I thought it smelled funny when I opened it but that went away. I let it sit out for a few hours before I went to sleep.  I work nights and hate any light. I did have to adjust it a bit but it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It ships from china so can&#x27;t track it.  I got it 20 days after ordering... but for $2 and free shipping was easy to risk.</li>
            <li> Soft - but the straps tore in about 2 weeks.  Short lived sleep pleasure.</li>
            <li> Light weight silk blocks light without being annoying.  Worth buying two so one can be used and the other washed, by hand only.</li>
            <li> Soft and comfy but A little thin, elastic won&#x27;t last long</li>
            <li> This is a good mask for the price. It works for me because I&#x27;m not one of those people that needs 0% visibility and 100% of light out, but depending on your facial shape it might let some light get in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still works well for me after several months of use, but it looks like one of the strings is frayed and will break off soon. For the price, it is good, but next time I think I will go with something a little more long-lasting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, it&#x27;s wonderful for occasional use to block out light for a headache. But if you use a sleep mask every night and/or want every bit of light out, keep looking.</li>
            <li> Love this! It&#x27;s so nice to wear, and cheap! It took awhile to get here since it was from China, but other than that love it!</li>
            <li> Just a piece of silk with non adjustable elastic bands. It&#x27;s tiny, it&#x27;s useless, it&#x27;s poorly made. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
