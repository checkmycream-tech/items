            <li> My only problem was that I expected flat surface bottles not bottles with a spiral design on them.</li>
            <li> I ordered about 500 bottles and almost half of them leaked.</li>
            <li> They are thick and durable.</li>
            <li> I also order the device that helps insert the filament into the glass bottle and it was poorly made.</li>
            <li> The company is very hard to contact and their website is difficult to use.</li>
            <li> Seriously if you need a lot of rollers this is the way to go!!</li>
            <li> I tried leaving feedback on their website but it&#x27;s impossible.</li>

            <li> These roll on bottles are great for mixing essential oils with carrier oils and apply to skin easily. The sky is the limit. Mixing thieves oil with a carrier oil and apply to hands, then rub together, the cup your hands over your nose to inhale this awesome mixture for flu prevention. Very effective. Very fast delivery. I will use this company again.</li>
            <li> Came fast, great price, great bottles.</li>
            <li> Packaging sucks, but the quality of the rollers are great! Hold up well, rollers work well with essential oils.</li>
            <li> The bottles are deformed and I requested a replacement. Nothing have arrive.</li>
            <li> Exactly like they were described</li>
            <li> I ordered about 500 bottles and almost half of them leaked. I found this out after I filled them all. It cost me about $1000 of time and expenses. The company is very hard to contact and their website is difficult to use. I tried leaving feedback on their website but it&#x27;s impossible. I also order the device that helps insert the filament into the glass bottle and it was poorly made. The bolts become lose after a few uses and it&#x27;s mounted on plastic which already started braking after the first use. Overall I would not recommend this company.</li>
            <li> Product works great! There were a few broken glass pieces when I received but overall happy with my purchase!</li>
            <li> I absolutely love these bottles. They are thick and durable. After filling closing the bottles (assembly) is easy. If by chance you need to take them apart it is doable. I like that feature a lot. I have nothing but rave reviews of this item!!!!!</li>
            <li> Very nicely packaged and great product.</li>
            <li> These 10 ml roller bottles, ship quickly and no issues with the rollers and caps fitting!&lt;br /&gt;Will be purchasing again!</li>
            <li> These rollers were such a great price couldn&#x27;t beat it plus free shipping!! They were packaged so great!! Foam on the bottom of box the glad was in a box sealed shut, bubbled wrapped and then everything else in sperate packages. Then it had fragile so over the box I was so impressed!!  Seriously if you need a lot of rollers this is the way to go!!</li>
            <li> These are great the rollers are not too stiff but they don&#x27;t fall out like some other brands either.  The lids have a flat top making labeling much easier.  And the price is right and the shipment was on time.  Great all the way around.</li>
            <li> Thank you, Great price, work well, great communication, fast shipping, packed well. Highly Recommend :)</li>
            <li> Pleased. I prefer the metal roller balls but for the price this was a great find. Packaged and shipped well. No issues there. I make essential oil roller bottles and these are just the ticket for the large size bottles.</li>
            <li> The shipping was fast and the roll on tops fit perfectly... And glide well. I&#x27;ve purchased others where the roller top lids were hard to put on (even using the caps)</li>
            <li> GREAT Bottles!  Quick Shipping! I bought to fill with my doTERRA esencial oils and top off with FCO! Glad to have good bottles to share...! THANKS ...Blessings &amp;#60;&amp;#62;&amp;#60;</li>
            <li> The bottles seems very good and fit well. My only problem was that I expected flat surface bottles not bottles with a spiral design on them. This prevents me from using my current labels.</li>
            <li> These bottles were exactly what I needed and expected. They were also priced right. That was the best thing was the price. What a value!</li>
            <li> Affordable and quality and worth the purchase.  I will be purchasing again without any doubt.  No problems with the rollers gliding smoothly either.</li>
            <li> These were an excellent investment for me.  Good quality.  Rollers are plastic but roll smoothly.  I make essential oil combinations for myself and others.  The bottles are exactly what I needed!</li>
