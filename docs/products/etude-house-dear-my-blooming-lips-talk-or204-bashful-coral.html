            <li>Such a beautiful color!</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s why I love it.</li>
            <li>Over all love it and the seller</li>
            <li>i&#x27;m glad it matched my skin color when i applied it on my lips.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The packing is beautiful, Etude House is a high rated well known cosmetics company in Korea and all of their products I&#x27;ve tried have been great so far.</li>
            <li>just a cute bottle nothing really special</li>
            <li>Love it, the packaging is super cute and the color payoff is really nice; much lighter than what you see on the tube, but still pretty nice.</li>
            <li>/&gt;i will be ordering from the seller more often because it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>Etude House never fail to impress me!!</li>
            <li>The color is very flattering and the formula isn&#x27;t cakey or dry and keeps my lips moisturized and looking great all day!</li>
            <li>Its pretty, cute, and when using it, it has a beautiful pink color on my lips.</li>
            <li>The packaging is so adorable and was definitely the main selling feature for me, but the quality is also great.</li>
            <li>I love the color and it glides on easily came with two trial products which I love will definitely buy from them again</li>
            <li>All étude house products I&#x27;ve tried so far have worked great, highly recommended.</li>
            <li>The lipstick has a sweet smell to it, like peaches maybe, and no bad taste.</li>
            <li>A very pretty coral color</li>
            <li>Pretty color, but you need perfectly smooth lips.</li>
            <li>It shows up more of a corally light pink on me.</li>
            <li>It lasted a reasonable amount of time (including a nap!).</li>
            <li>This is such a cute lipstick.</li>
            <li>A lot pinker than coral, but its such a cute pastel color</li>
            <li>so I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li>I was really looking forward to wearing it.</li>
            <li>This is not a coral color, more like Barbie pink.</li>
            <li>(I am African American a light caramel complexion).</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t think it moisturize my lipstick very well, and the color isn&#x27;t what I expected, it&#x27;s more like a pink color than coral.</li>
            <li>soft and</li>
            <li>i suggest chapstick, or possibly scubbing you lips gently with a toothbrush beforehand</li>
            <li>I do love the cute appearance of the lipstick, but i am a bit disappointed with the product.</li>
            <li>This is a very soft and color saturated lipstick, this color is a bit orange but with a brown or red liner looks natural and coralish.</li>
            <li>The lipstick is a little more toward the pink side then the coral side</li>

            <li> If your lips tend to be dry this will accentuate any dry cracked areas.</li>
            <li> you have dry lips</li>
            <li> As far as how long it&#x27;s wearable for I&#x27;m not sure</li>
            <li> It also made my lips feel very dry.</li>
            <li> Arrived on time and was just how i expected it.</li>
            <li> it came faster than expected and it came in one piece,&lt;br /&gt;smells</li>
            <li> I gave it a 4/5 because it does need to be reapplied every few hours</li>
            <li> (then again all lipstick needs to be reapplied every few hours).</li>
            <li> and i&#x27;m quite pale.</li>
            <li> AND the little bow on the lipstick can come off and is a ring!</li>
            <li> I thought coral weird be a weird color for me but oddly its a very flattering shade</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this lipstick makes my lips look dry.</li>
            <li> But it emphasized any dryness in my lips, which was weird because it is a creamy formula.</li>

            <li> After seeing all the great reviews on this lipstick, I decided to give it a try. I do love the cute appearance of the lipstick, but i am a bit disappointed with the product.

            <li> A very pretty coral color</li>
            <li> Nice! I do need to use a lip liner with it. It lasted a reasonable amount of time (including a nap!). But it emphasized any dryness in my lips, which was weird because it is a creamy formula. I would purchase another shade if I wasn&#x27;t already a lipstick hoarder.</li>
            <li> Love it, the packaging is super cute and the color payoff is really nice; much lighter than what you see on the tube, but still pretty nice. It&#x27;s got a nice scent to it, would purchase more colours for sure.</li>

            <li> I REALLY LOVE THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its soft and the packaging is so cute!~&lt;br /&gt;Also its a great color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will buy more of this product.</li>

The packing is beautiful, Etude House is a high rated well known cosmetics company in Korea and all of their products I&#x27;ve tried have been great so far. The lipstick has a sweet smell to it, like peaches maybe, and no bad taste. As far as how long it&#x27;s wearable for I&#x27;m not sure yet but I would recommend using a lip primer/base coat with it :) Enjoy!</li>

            <li> Cute and nice quality</li>
            <li> A lot pinker than coral, but its such a cute pastel color and I love it dearly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dry lips i suggest chapstick, or possibly scubbing you lips gently with a toothbrush beforehand so it doesnt look dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise its amazing!</li>
            <li> love the color, always a fan of etude house.</li>
            <li> Etude House never fail to impress me!! I always get my cosmetics from etude house. and this lipstick just made my day. Its a great one. I love the color not to, its perfect color for me.</li>

            <li> I recommend you look up swatches of the lipsticks before buying to see how they look on skin. The lipstick is a little more toward the pink side then the coral side but that&#x27;s why I love it. I also suggest moisturizing your lips before putting in on so lines on the lips don&#x27;t show. I gave it a 4/5 because it does need to be reapplied every few hours (then again all lipstick needs to be reapplied every few hours). Over all love it and the seller so I will be buying more in the future.</li>
            <li> it came faster than expected and it came in one piece,&lt;br /&gt;smells really good even tastes good too&lt;br /&gt;Really beautiful color i&#x27;m glad it matched my skin color when i applied it on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;i will be ordering from the seller more often because it&#x27;s worth it. *w*</li>
