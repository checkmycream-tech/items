    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>one downside is that the bottle construction isn&#x27;t the greatest, it is quite leaky, and when I bring it with me to travel I need to keep it in a sealed plastic bag.</li>

            <li>glad Amazon is carrying this miracle oil.</li>
            <li>I love this and buy it in bulk, it smells like almond essence</li>
            <li>(Just saying, hopefully no one ever tried). : )</li>
            <li>I love this product.  </li>
            <li>Delicious and worth paying a little more for!</li>
            <li>product does contain Wheat germ oil, so anyone with a strong wheat allergy or Gluten intolerance may want to look elsewhere.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It smells wonderful, and it feels nice on sensitive skin, especially if you&#x27;re prone to allergies.</li>
            <li>Has Avocado oil, apricot oil, sweet almond oil and more...</li>
            <li>I use it every night and believe I see a softening of some of the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li>My wife has had very good results with this product, she is currently 8.5 months pregnant</li>
            <li>Very high quality and mixes in nicely.</li>
            <li>I have even started using a dab around my eyes at night and have noticed a huge difference in how the skin looks when I get up.</li>
            <li>I use this oil in lieu of moisturizing lotion after my shower in the morning, and it keeps my skin feeling moist and comfortable all day.</li>
            <li>the product is fantastic.</li>
            <li>I looked up all the oils contained in this product and was surprised to see how good they are for my skin.</li>
            <li>We love it that much!</li>
            <li>It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin silky smooth.  </li>
            <li>It feels nice and soft after about 1 week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update</li>
            <li>It smooths on nicely in the shower, and leaves skin feeling moisturized far longer than just lotion.  </li>
            <li>*, tocopheryl acetate, tocopherol, oryza sativa (rice) bran oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) seed oil, purnus armeniaca (apricot)</li>
            <li>I used to buy it from the Whole Foods (at list 10 times), but price on Amazon was better.</li>
            <li>Obsorbs quickly</li>
            <li>I find that it soaks in rather quickly, but sometimes when my skin is saturated I&#x27;ll have to wipe off the excess oil to avoid that</li>
            <li>It works great as a daily application for skin health as well as has many uses for skin issues medically.  </li>
            <li>After i applied oil on the skin, at first it smelled like almond, but then started to smell like cheap cooking oil.</li>
            <li>It feels very much like our own natural secretions.</li>
            <li>It keeps my skin nourished and moisturized all day long and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent which is also great.</li>
            <li>Another plus is that it has a fresh smelling aroma to it like baby powder and vanilla, and the top is a leak free press to open style.  </li>
            <li>It really does provide a fantastic glow.</li>
            <li>So far I love this product.</li>
            <li>As a female, I&#x27;m also able to insert this into my special area with a couple of fingers just before bed</li>
            <li>I put the oil on and then socks right before bed.</li>
            <li>it is either oil or my good genes that helped me to get my skin back to normal.</li>
            <li>Super fast shipping.  </li>
            <li>cuz when u stop the skin dry up and u c them again, i used every kind of coco/ shee butter cream there is, this is the one</li>
            <li>Great product and just recently ordered more since the small 4</li>
            <li>The product goes on smoothly and is not messy on clothes.  </li>
            <li>Very watery!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve converted my whole family to users of this!</li>
            <li>This makes me skin so soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>This is a good product for those with dry skin, it has a nice scent that is not overwhelming.</li>
            <li>Though this is a good natural product, it is not straight E as I was wishing for.</li>
            <li>&#x27;n Easy Born Blonde, Maxi (Pack of 3)]].  </li>
            <li>but i certainly returned these oils.</li>
            <li>I use this product liberally when pregnant - an idea passed along to me from a nutrition professor whose wife, after 4 children, claimed that her stretch-mark free belly was due to vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>They are much softer.</li>
            <li>so it takes a minute to really soak in</li>
            <li>Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li>Also, the bottle lasts us at least a good 6 months.  </li>
            <li>I bought mine for making my own eye cream with coconut oil, turned over the package and found half the ingredients I wanted to add seperately to the cream were already in the mix!</li>
            <li>This is despite the fact that my hair seemed to be becoming dry and brittle two weeks before I decided I wanted to punk my hair.  </li>
            <li>Jason product also has a naturally fresh odor due to the sweet almond oil, which many other Vitamin E oils lack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>br /&gt;it was to high of a concentration for me.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>and I add other oils such as rose hip seed and tea tree oil.</li>
            <li>If you don&#x27;t shampoo most of it out, then your hair will look a little greasy.  </li>
            <li>It really works and does not have anything that irritates my sensitive nose.</li>
            <li>, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any difference in my wrinkles or baby marks, but my skin does feel better.  </li>
            <li>If they have a dry hands in the winter or a rash from sun/chlorine in the summer, we slather this on and the next morning the skin looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li>And it is natural!</li>
            <li>anything &amp;#34;tocopherol&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Tocotrienol&amp;#34; are the compounds that make up vitamin e, the other ingredients are the natural sources vitamin e is found in and add even greater benifits of different vitamins to your skin!</li>
            <li>I have sensitive skin prone to break outs, and I use this on my face and everywhere.  </li>
            <li>is natural and rated well on the EWG.org website.  </li>
            <li>Makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li>The oil does not burn or irritate our sensitive areas, and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>a  day early .</li>
            <li>To whomever said they don&#x27;t understand the ingredients in this product, the ingredients are all natural sources of the vitamin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li>I will give it three stars, because of the scent and that they give you three bottles, but I will not purchase this product again, because it isn&#x27;t natural 100% vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li>at least i was kind enough to wrap it twice in plastic bags so that the leaking bottles would be contained for the return shipment.</li>
            <li>Very delicate scent that compliments your fragrance of choice or without for a fresh clean natural aroma.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m curious what the deal is with it since it says vitamin E right on the front of the bottle.</li>
            <li>Previously purchased this for all my aunts as a small Christmas present and one aunt in particular really liked it.</li>
            <li>Now I have to figure out what to do with 3 whole bottles as this product has a very long laundry list of ingredients.</li>
            <li>so the oil doesn&#x27;t get onto my clothes, but I personally don&#x27;t mind losing a few tank tops in order to have a stretch-mark free belly.</li>
            <li>I have very sensitive skin prone to dryness and itching, and I have found that after a few days of consistent use, my skin craves the moisture.</li>
            <li>Just keep in mind this oil is not 100% Vit E oil, it&#x27;s mixed with other oils such as sweet almond, Avocado, wheat germ...</li>
            <li>I prefer lotions to oils, but this product was recommended by my physical therapist to help soft and drain the lymph areas in my lower legs.  </li>
            <li>I am now 7 months pregnant with baby #2 and have yet to acquire any stretch marks (however, I am petite and did not gain an excessive amount of weight with either pregnancy).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using Kiss My Face A&amp;E lotion for my daily hydration for a while and found an old bottle of this oil that i had used a while back.</li>

            <li> I use this product liberally when pregnant - an idea passed along to me from a nutrition professor whose wife, after 4 children, claimed that her stretch-mark free belly was due to vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> They are much softer.</li>
            <li> so it takes a minute to really soak in</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping.</li>
            <li> Also, the bottle lasts us at least a good 6 months.  </li>
            <li> I bought mine for making my own eye cream with coconut oil, turned over the package and found half the ingredients I wanted to add seperately to the cream were already in the mix!</li>
            <li> This is despite the fact that my hair seemed to be becoming dry and brittle two weeks before I decided I wanted to punk my hair.  </li>
            <li> Jason product also has a naturally fresh odor due to the sweet almond oil, which many other Vitamin E oils lack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> br /&gt;it was to high of a concentration for me.</li>
            <li> I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> and I add other oils such as rose hip seed and tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> If you don&#x27;t shampoo most of it out, then your hair will look a little greasy.  </li>
            <li> It really works and does not have anything that irritates my sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> , I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any difference in my wrinkles or baby marks, but my skin does feel better.  </li>
            <li> If they have a dry hands in the winter or a rash from sun/chlorine in the summer, we slather this on and the next morning the skin looks and feels better.  </li>
            <li> And it is natural!</li>
            <li> anything &amp;#34;tocopherol&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Tocotrienol&amp;#34; are the compounds that make up vitamin e, the other ingredients are the natural sources vitamin e is found in and add even greater benifits of different vitamins to your skin!</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin prone to break outs, and I use this on my face and everywhere.  </li>
            <li> is natural and rated well on the EWG.org website.  </li>
            <li> Makes your skin so soft.</li>
            <li> The oil does not burn or irritate our sensitive areas, and I do have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> a  day early .</li>
            <li> To whomever said they don&#x27;t understand the ingredients in this product, the ingredients are all natural sources of the vitamin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /</li>
            <li> I will give it three stars, because of the scent and that they give you three bottles, but I will not purchase this product again, because it isn&#x27;t natural 100% vitamin E oil.</li>
            <li> at least i was kind enough to wrap it twice in plastic bags so that the leaking bottles would be contained for the return shipment.</li>
            <li> Very delicate scent that compliments your fragrance of choice or without for a fresh clean natural aroma.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m curious what the deal is with it since it says vitamin E right on the front of the bottle.</li>
            <li> Previously purchased this for all my aunts as a small Christmas present and one aunt in particular really liked it.</li>
            <li> Now I have to figure out what to do with 3 whole bottles as this product has a very long laundry list of ingredients.</li>
            <li> so the oil doesn&#x27;t get onto my clothes, but I personally don&#x27;t mind losing a few tank tops in order to have a stretch-mark free belly.</li>
            <li> I have very sensitive skin prone to dryness and itching, and I have found that after a few days of consistent use, my skin craves the moisture.</li>
            <li> Just keep in mind this oil is not 100% Vit E oil, it&#x27;s mixed with other oils such as sweet almond, Avocado, wheat germ...</li>
            <li> I prefer lotions to oils, but this product was recommended by my physical therapist to help soft and drain the lymph areas in my lower legs.  </li>
            <li> I am now 7 months pregnant with baby #2 and have yet to acquire any stretch marks (however, I am petite and did not gain an excessive amount of weight with either pregnancy).</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kiss My Face A&amp;E lotion for my daily hydration for a while and found an old bottle of this oil that i had used a while back.</li>
            <li> It has replaced lotions and other oils that don&#x27;t work nearly as well.  </li>
            <li> i mean REALLY less visible that i started forgetting about the fine ones on my arms, but u have to use it as often as possible</li>
            <li> I have such dry skin that I use this daily after my shower and then slather on body lotion.</li>
            <li> once bottle doesn&#x27;t last me too long.</li>
            <li> The product is still the same, but this time someone did not properly shut the lid and oil leaked all over the packaging and onto my other purchases.</li>
            <li> For super dry skin or lips, put this on and cover with a thin layer of vaseline.</li>
            <li> Even more disappointing it that NO ONE at the company cares ;-(</li>
            <li> In just a few days I noticed a considerable difference in how my feet looked.</li>
            <li> and I mix it with other essential oils.</li>
            <li> My skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, oily nor dry.  </li>
            <li> Works well for dry skin</li>
            <li> It last long also, very little amount is enough per use.</li>
            <li> Non of this happened with my previous purchases of the same oil, so</li>
            <li> It came 3 to a bag, the bag had been torn opened and lids were off the oil equals ONE BIG MESS.  </li>
            <li> I combined this with cocoa butter everyday and put in on religiously.  </li>
            <li> I use this in homemade lotions and a little goes a long way.</li>
            <li> I mix this with other oils and use it on my scalp and hair, it works</li>
            <li> Helps with breakouts on my face and blackheads also due to the healing properties of the Vitamin E oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> i didn&#x27;t bother to return the other items because they were greasy</li>
            <li> i was also dissapointed that it contained all those other ingredients.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s what we reach for instead of neosporin or other skin creams.  </li>
            <li> It beats all the other $$$$ stuff out there.</li>
            <li> Plus it was never absorbed by the skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s thick enough to hold itself in place for a few seconds to give you time to rub it in while massaging.</li>
            <li> and i use it all over, my stretch marks are less visible,</li>
            <li> On my tummy, the stretch marks seem to be fading a little bit.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this contain other ingredients as well.  </li>
            <li> On my face, my forehead wrinkles have softened and don&#x27;t look as harsh.  </li>
            <li> I used this everyday and never got one stretch mark.  </li>
            <li> but I had side affects after a few months of use and stopped I may use it ocassionaly</li>
            <li> In my opinion, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for an affordable Vitamin E oil, but some might find it off-putting.</li>
            <li> I bouhgt this one second time and something is weird about the smell.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not too water or too thick.</li>
            <li> Very poorly packed, oil leaked out, damaged other items.</li>
            <li> are some of the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat scars or burns, use on stretch marks, treatment of eczema and psoriasis, use on dry nails and cuticles, treatment of chapped lips and cold sores, use as a skin moisturizer, has anti-aging benefits, treatment of sunburn, treatment of brown spots, under eye treatment and Make-up Remover, stimulates hair growth, repairs split ends.</li>
            <li> I decided to try it out as the cold winter dry skin had started to settle in.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from horrible dry skin on his hands because he works outside in harsh conditions.</li>

            <li> and do not receive these nasty packages!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> The oil bottles were leaking oil. The card board Box containing the 6 bottles was soaked with oil.</li>
            <li> This is a good product for those with dry skin, it has a nice scent that is not overwhelming. I keep this product in stock because I don&#x27;t like to be without it.</li>
            <li> I have sensitive skin prone to break outs, and I use this on my face and everywhere.  It smells lovely and never causes pimples.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t go on too greasy, smells great, is natural and rated well on the EWG.org website.  I will continue using this product on my skin!</li>
            <li> I prefer lotions to oils, but this product was recommended by my physical therapist to help soft and drain the lymph areas in my lower legs.  The product goes on smoothly and is not messy on clothes.  And I am starting to see results as well.</li>
            <li> I use this oil daily. Love it. Obsorbs quickly and I mix it with other essential oils. Great product and just recently ordered more since the small 4 once bottle doesn&#x27;t last me too long. Higly recommend. Just keep in mind this oil is not 100% Vit E oil, it&#x27;s mixed with other oils such as sweet almond, Avocado, wheat germ... etc. Don&#x27;t mind it since they are all good for the skin.</li>
            <li> I LOVE this oil! Ordered it because I&#x27;m prego and heard Vitamin E oil helps prevent stretchmarks. Here&#x27;s hoping! :) The oil smells soooo good and it rubs on really smooth. I leave my shirt off for a few minutes to let my skin really absorb it. Makes your skin so soft. Really love this oil! Would use as massage oil after pregnancy!</li>
            <li> I purchased the 3 pack because I know I won&#x27;t run out.  I have used this oil for over a decade.  Love it.</li>
            <li> I use vitamin e oil on my face, skin, scalp and hair. This is perfect to mix in your favorite lotion or cream - or make your own beauty mix! Vitamin E oil has so many uses. I mix this with other oils and use it on my scalp and hair, it works wonderfully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are some of the benefits!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Treat scars or burns, use on stretch marks, treatment of eczema and psoriasis, use on dry nails and cuticles, treatment of chapped lips and cold sores, use as a skin moisturizer, has anti-aging benefits, treatment of sunburn, treatment of brown spots, under eye treatment and Make-up Remover, stimulates hair growth, repairs split ends.</li>
            <li> I like oil on my skin and my face.</li>
            <li> I used this product to prepare my hair for bleaching 4-3 days prior.  I know this is a skin care product, yet based on the ingredients list, it seemed like it would be good for my hair.  I believe using this combined with not washing my hair for the 1-2 days prior to bleaching it, prevented my hair from breakage.  This is despite the fact that my hair seemed to be becoming dry and brittle two weeks before I decided I wanted to punk my hair.  I used [[ASIN:B001E95G6Y Clairol Nice &#x27;n Easy Born Blonde, Maxi (Pack of 3)]].  I have never bleached it before, so you could say my hair was virgin.  I thought based on the perceived dryness two weeks before I bleached it, that I needed to prep my hair to prevent it from breaking.  It seems to have worked.  Note this is not advertised as a hair care product, so your hair will look greasy while it is in.  If you don&#x27;t shampoo most of it out, then your hair will look a little greasy.  I can&#x27;t stand greasy hair, but I put up with it and it seems to have paid off.  Also it did practically remove frizz in my hair the two days after I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the skin care front, I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see any difference in my wrinkles or baby marks, but my skin does feel better.  I use it on my face, neck and tummy.  My skin doesn&#x27;t feel greasy, oily nor dry.  It feels nice and soft after about 1 week of use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: About 20 days later, there is a definite difference in my face and tummy.  On my face, my forehead wrinkles have softened and don&#x27;t look as harsh.  On my tummy, the stretch marks seem to be fading a little bit.</li>
            <li> I use this oil in lieu of moisturizing lotion after my shower in the morning, and it keeps my skin feeling moist and comfortable all day. I have very sensitive skin prone to dryness and itching, and I have found that after a few days of consistent use, my skin craves the moisture. Helps with breakouts on my face and blackheads also due to the healing properties of the Vitamin E oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Jason product also has a naturally fresh odor due to the sweet almond oil, which many other Vitamin E oils lack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does contain Wheat germ oil, so anyone with a strong wheat allergy or Gluten intolerance may want to look elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside is that the bottle construction isn&#x27;t the greatest, it is quite leaky, and when I bring it with me to travel I need to keep it in a sealed plastic bag. I also noticed one of the three bottles that came in this package had already started leaking prior to my opening it. In my opinion, it&#x27;s a small price to pay for an affordable Vitamin E oil, but some might find it off-putting.</li>
            <li> My husband and I use this on our face every night.  Love it.</li>
            <li> Very poorly packed, oil leaked out, damaged other items. please fix, so we can order in the future!!! and do not receive these nasty packages!</li>
            <li> I used this everyday and never got one stretch mark.  I combined this with cocoa butter everyday and put in on religiously.  I would recommend it to every mom to be.</li>
            <li> I use this product liberally when pregnant - an idea passed along to me from a nutrition professor whose wife, after 4 children, claimed that her stretch-mark free belly was due to vitamin E oil. I am now 7 months pregnant with baby #2 and have yet to acquire any stretch marks (however, I am petite and did not gain an excessive amount of weight with either pregnancy). Now, I do have to wear undershirts, etc. so the oil doesn&#x27;t get onto my clothes, but I personally don&#x27;t mind losing a few tank tops in order to have a stretch-mark free belly.</li>
            <li> Made me sick after awhile, I do not have any issues with Vitamin E but this stuff made me feel ill after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;It worked as it should but I had side affects after a few months of use and stopped I may use it ocassionaly but on a regular bases&lt;br /&gt;it was to high of a concentration for me.</li>
            <li> Not sure if this contain other ingredients as well.  Very watery!  Well still use it, but I will not reorder it.</li>
            <li> Great price, great product.  Super fast shipping.  I am very happy and will order from you again.</li>
            <li> My husband suffers from horrible dry skin on his hands because he works outside in harsh conditions. I figured I would give this a try. I figured I would also try it on my feet and hands. In just a few days I noticed a considerable difference in how my feet looked. They are much softer. I put the oil on and then socks right before bed. It has also made my hands softer. I looked up all the oils contained in this product and was surprised to see how good they are for my skin. I have even started using a dab around my eyes at night and have noticed a huge difference in how the skin looks when I get up. So far I love this product.</li>
            <li> Love it!!! Great Product!</li>
            <li> It came 3 to a bag, the bag had been torn opened and lids were off the oil equals ONE BIG MESS.  If you order this product I would suggest order it ALONE very disappointing.  Even more disappointing it that NO ONE at the company cares ;-(</li>
            <li> This is the best E Oil in the world.  We use it for all kinds of DIY stuff and works great.  Smells nice too.</li>
            <li> My husband and I have been using this as a pleasure oil for 6 months now. It&#x27;s not too water or too thick. It&#x27;s thick enough to hold itself in place for a few seconds to give you time to rub it in while massaging. It has the consistency of Wesson vegetable oil. We are also able to use this during intimacy. The oil does not burn or irritate our sensitive areas, and I do have sensitive skin. It feels very much like our own natural secretions. As a female, I&#x27;m also able to insert this into my special area with a couple of fingers just before bed and he does not know the difference between me naturally getting wet or not. This can also be used during oral sex if needed, so don&#x27;t worry if you accidentally apply it too soon and your partner decides they want to perform oral on you. Another plus is that it has a fresh smelling aroma to it like baby powder and vanilla, and the top is a leak free press to open style.  Also, if you spill some on you sheets, it dries up just like nothing happened. Please vote below whether or not this review was helpful to you.</li>
            <li> This vitamin E oil is everything! I mix it with my body and hair oils! I would recommend this item to others!</li>
            <li> very poorly packaged. the bottles leaked all over my entire order - 6 items total. i didn&#x27;t bother to return the other items because they were greasy but i certainly returned these oils. at least i was kind enough to wrap it twice in plastic bags so that the leaking bottles would be contained for the return shipment. i was also dissapointed that it contained all those other ingredients. i guess i should have paid more attention to the product listing. it did smell great, though, so i am dissapointed because i wanted to make some body butter with it for stocking stuffers.</li>
            <li> I have such dry skin that I use this daily after my shower and then slather on body lotion. It really works and does not have anything that irritates my sensitive nose.</li>
            <li> Very poorly packed, oil leaked out!!!, damaged my clothes. Please change this!! I would order the oil again if they changed the packaging</li>
            <li> Works well for dry skin</li>
            <li> This is a great product</li>
            <li> Amazon is always delivered quickly and in perfect condition.  Use lots of Vit. # oil for cut healing, burns and rashes.  Need lots for shingles to keep it from scarring.  Love this stuff.</li>
            <li> The  product  is  as  advertised. I  received  the  shipment  a  day early .</li>
            <li> I bouhgt this one second time and something is weird about the smell. But better that all the moisturizers I ever used</li>
            <li> Plenty here.  3 bottles of vitamin e oil and did the trick for the project i was working on.</li>
            <li> I love this oil.  It smooths on nicely in the shower, and leaves skin feeling moisturized far longer than just lotion.  The smell is heavenly--like Amaretto or almonds.  Delicious and worth paying a little more for!</li>
            <li> I love, love, love this oil!  It works great as a daily application for skin health as well as has many uses for skin issues medically.  It&#x27;s what we reach for instead of neosporin or other skin creams.  I&#x27;ve converted my whole family to users of this!</li>
            <li> My wife has had very good results with this product, she is currently 8.5 months pregnant and we have noticed quite a differance in her stretch marks since she started using this product.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is great. It smells wonderful, and it feels nice on sensitive skin, especially if you&#x27;re prone to allergies.</li>
            <li> I would like to give a good review,but ordered this in Aug2011 and have yet to receive it. I have left messages and they said they sent out another package a couple weeks later but have not received that one either.</li>
            <li> Have bought this vitamin E oil for years.  Excellent for skin.</li>
            <li> I love it, got here on time just vitamin like they said. Great product</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Kiss My Face A&amp;E lotion for my daily hydration for a while and found an old bottle of this oil that i had used a while back. I decided to try it out as the cold winter dry skin had started to settle in. I forgot how great this oil makes my skin feel. I also love the smell of it. It really does provide a fantastic glow. I find that it soaks in rather quickly, but sometimes when my skin is saturated I&#x27;ll have to wipe off the excess oil to avoid that shiny-face look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So glad Amazon is carrying this miracle oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this oil at night for years (face). It beats all the other $$$$ stuff out there.</li>
            <li> I use this in homemade lotions and a little goes a long way. Very high quality and mixes in nicely.</li>
            <li> the product is fantastic. that&#x27;s what i&#x27;m rating 5 stars for. however, the shipping is awful. two bottles opened up and leaked everywhere.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m confused about this product becuase It says Vitamin E oil, but when I received  this in the mail I read the ingredients list and nowhere on the ingredients does it say it has Vitamin E in it. I&#x27;m curious what the deal is with it since it says vitamin E right on the front of the bottle.</li>
            <li> I love this and buy it in bulk, it smells like almond essence and i use it all over, my stretch marks are less visible, i mean REALLY less visible that i started forgetting about the fine ones on my arms, but u have to use it as often as possible cuz when u stop the skin dry up and u c them again, i used every kind of coco/ shee butter cream there is, this is the one the works! finally!</li>
            <li> This makes me skin so soft and smooth. It has the wonderful almond scent which is not overpowering.</li>
            <li> This has been my go to oil for years and years. It has replaced lotions and other oils that don&#x27;t work nearly as well.  I literally use this oil for my face,hair and body.  It keeps my skin nourished and moisturized all day long and doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent which is also great.</li>
            <li> It is my fault for not searching for added ingredients. Though this is a good natural product, it is not straight E as I was wishing for. Now I have to figure out what to do with 3 whole bottles as this product has a very long laundry list of ingredients. I have recently started a business called Foxen Organics and there is no way I can add their list to my list of ingredients on one label. This has been a lesson in scouring information about products offered on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I replaced all my body skin care products with this oil. It doesn&#x27;t leave heave greasy feeling on my skin, smells very nice ( like almond), absorbs well, my skin looks shiny and moistures after oil was applied. It has vitamin E, which repairs skin. I noticed improvements. I used this oil during and after pregnancy to get back in shape and I can tell you- it is either oil or my good genes that helped me to get my skin back to normal. I was applying it  twice daily. It last long also, very little amount is enough per use. And it is natural! So, if I will put together: price, quality and effect, I will give it 5 stars!</li>
            <li> I use this as a face/body lotion daily.  It absorbs quickly and leaves my skin silky smooth.  And the smell is out of this world!  It is an oil so it takes a minute to really soak in but I like that about it. I even use it on my face and it gives me a nice glow.  People are constantly asking me what I use for my face because my complexion is so even.  I swear it is because of this stuff.</li>
            <li> Live for this oil...the best! Perfect blend of oils that leave skin nourished and petal soft. Very delicate scent that compliments your fragrance of choice or without for a fresh clean natural aroma. Happy to find this oil on Amazon.</li>
            <li> u s e it for e v er y t h i n g hair a n d skin !</li>
            <li> This smells awesome. I am using this as my base oil and I add other oils such as rose hip seed and tea tree oil.</li>
            <li> To whomever said they don&#x27;t understand the ingredients in this product, the ingredients are all natural sources of the vitamin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Ingredients: Helianthus annuus (sunflower) seed oil*, carthamus tinctorius (safflower) seed oil*, tocopheryl acetate, tocopherol, oryza sativa (rice) bran oil, prunus amygdalus dulcis (sweet almond) seed oil, purnus armeniaca (apricot) kernel oil, persea gratissima (avocado) oil, triticum vulgare (wheat) germ oil, lecithin *Certified Organic Ingredient&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- anything &amp;#34;tocopherol&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Tocotrienol&amp;#34; are the compounds that make up vitamin e, the other ingredients are the natural sources vitamin e is found in and add even greater benifits of different vitamins to your skin! Amazing! This stuff is great! I bought mine for making my own eye cream with coconut oil, turned over the package and found half the ingredients I wanted to add seperately to the cream were already in the mix! Like I hit the lottery! Great for scars or stretch marks, wrinkles, fine lines, etc. Do not ingest this kind though. (Just saying, hopefully no one ever tried). : )</li>
            <li> Previously purchased this for all my aunts as a small Christmas present and one aunt in particular really liked it. I repurchased for her and my mom. The product is still the same, but this time someone did not properly shut the lid and oil leaked all over the packaging and onto my other purchases. I hope they improve on their packaging but I have no complaints about the product.</li>
            <li> Fast Shipping. Great product</li>
            <li> I love this product.  I use it every night and believe I see a softening of some of the fine lines on my face.</li>
            <li> I will give it three stars, because of the scent and that they give you three bottles, but I will not purchase this product again, because it isn&#x27;t natural 100% vitamin E oil. But the way this product smelled, was so heavenly when I would use it. LOL... I did like the way it would feel on my skin, but if they were more honest and not misleading, I believe I would&#x27;ve continued to purchase this product.</li>
            <li> Oil is good. Smells gross. But works. And arrived damaged. One of the six bottles was not sealed properly and had spilled througout the box</li>
            <li> Super moisturizing and smells so great, even the kids love it.  If they have a dry hands in the winter or a rash from sun/chlorine in the summer, we slather this on and the next morning the skin looks and feels better.  For super dry skin or lips, put this on and cover with a thin layer of vaseline.</li>
            <li> love Jason Vitamin E oil 5,000 IU, but this one was fake. I used to buy it from the Whole Foods (at list 10 times), but price on Amazon was better. I ordered and was really disappointed. It was not the same formula!!!! After i applied oil on the skin, at first it smelled like almond, but then started to smell like cheap cooking oil. Plus it was never absorbed by the skin. Non of this happened with my previous purchases of the same oil, so I assuming that it is fake.</li>
            <li> My baby has had baby acne, cradle cap, etc.  His skin has had a rash and become scabby and so on...  I use this day and night on his skin and every time I use it, his skin clears up within HOURS.  I use it on my face every day and age spots, sun spots have started to fade and wrinkles too.  I even make my husband use it.  It smells like a DREAM.  WOW it smells amazing!!!  Has Avocado oil, apricot oil, sweet almond oil and more...it&#x27;s wonderful.  Also, the bottle lasts us at least a good 6 months.  I signed up for Subscribe and Save and had 3 bottles delivered, one for each of us!  We love it that much!</li>
