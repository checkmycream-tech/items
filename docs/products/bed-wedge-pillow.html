    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Otherwise it is awesome.</li>
            <li>Excellent product....</li>
            <li>And, Brookstone has an excellent return policy.  </li>
            <li>I am getting another one because it is perfect for my legs and after my recovery the wife can have one for lounging.</li>
            <li>The best part of this purchase was when the package arrived.  </li>
            <li>However, now that I&#x27;ve been using it a while, it is amazing!!!!</li>
            <li>This was the best deal I could find</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s perfect for putting under the knees, or for sitting up in bed.</li>
            <li>It is the perfect height for elevated sleep.  </li>
            <li>and it fits perfectly on my side.</li>

            <li>I love the cover!  </li>
            <li>and I actually own three of them.  </li>
            <li>, it is nice</li>
            <li>Great shipping (although the communication needs to be more accurate) speed.</li>
            <li>very comfortable and does what it claims.</li>
            <li>I am so glad I bought this pillow.  </li>
            <li>so I put a pillow in front of it for more comfort while reading and watching television</li>
            <li>I love this pillow.  </li>
            <li>So glad I bought it.  </li>
            <li>I love these</li>
            <li>I totally love this.</li>
            <li>I didn&#x27;t realize the cover is just like my Brookstone NAP blanket that I love.  </li>
            <li>I have seen a lot of inprovement from my illnesses and my fiance also love it too.</li>
            <li>Love it - got the support I was looking for</li>
            <li>I do use a pillow on top of it because I like the feel of a pillow.</li>
            <li>Love the versatility.</li>
            <li>so the angle is a bit better.</li>
            <li>In any case, you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Perfect for bed or for the floor only.</li>
            <li>Very comfortable, lightweight, so easy to take off and on the bed...</li>
            <li>For me, it&#x27;s more comfortable if I put a pillow under my head</li>
            <li>I love this wedge and it is so worth every penny!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 5&#x27;9&amp;#34; and I have a temperpedic bed, so I tend to slide down at night, but I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
            <li>and now it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li>This one is wider (which is nice), higher (nice sometimes) and much firmer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m recovering from lumbar surgery, and this pillow is a huge help.</li>
            <li>Of course, then it&#x27;s important to switch to the &amp;#34;reclining&amp;#34; position before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My lady stole it away from me to use as a comfortable foot-rest under her desk.</li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t have been comfortable without it during recovery.</li>
            <li>This a great pillow I suffer from back pain and GERD.</li>
            <li>I actually like the first one I got best as it has a slightly contoured shape which is especially comfortable for sitting up in bed.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a very good firm pillow for support if you want to sit up comfortably in bed while sleeping, watching t.v. etc</li>
            <li>Good support for the back!</li>
            <li>As others have remarked, it does have a smell, but it is really not bad at all and does not bother me at all.</li>
            <li>nice in the winter, but might be a little warm in the summer months.  </li>
            <li>I have been looking for a good pillow wedge for a long time.</li>
            <li>While there certainly was a smell, it wasn&#x27;t THAT strong, and it disappeared within a week or so.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Funny thing, the pillow smelled like brownie mix too!  </li>
            <li>and it is worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li>(She finds it&#x27;s the most comfortable position for her back.)</li>
            <li>I was researching many other options and so glad went with this one.</li>
            <li>It shipped quickly and after the first night, I knew I&#x27;d made the right</li>
            <li>It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do</li>
            <li>A month later, I love it.  </li>
            <li>&quot; I wish most products were larger.  </li>
            <li>It was pretty pricy and at first I questioned why he purchased it.</li>
            <li>Great for late nite activities.</li>
            <li>so you probably won&#x27;t be able to travel with it unless you have a big suitcase.</li>
            <li>Yes, it had a smell when first unpacked.</li>
            <li>/&gt;After shopping around and reading positive reviews on this Bed Wedge Pillow</li>
            <li>But the two I recent purchased are exactly like the photo, not contoured and they are still quite comfortable.  </li>
            <li>It is super soft.</li>
            <li>The handle is very helpful for moving the pillow.</li>
            <li>Comfortable with an added pillow on the back rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very bulky</li>
            <li>and it&#x27;s held up very well.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;d wake up multiple times during the night trying to get comfortable (besides the shoulder pain).&lt;br</li>
            <li>She loves it so much that she totes it around the house, using it to watch television and read in bed.</li>
            <li>But it won&#x27;t fit on a regular chair or on a sofa.</li>
            <li>I completely agree with the reviewer that suggested that this product should have some kind of pillowy soft cover - even if it were an extra cost option.</li>
            <li>Before I bought this wedge pillow, I read many of the other reviews.</li>
            <li>it dosen&#x27;t crush into nothing like most of the other \\&quot;foams\\&quot; out there.  </li>
            <li>the smell left quickly).  </li>
            <li>The packaging was small with the air all removed, it was fun to watch it bloom up to full size once opened!</li>
            <li>The covering is also high quality and very soft!  </li>
            <li>It would be nice if they added a squishy outer layer over the hard foam wedge.</li>
            <li>You could probably find other bed wedge foam pillows with good support that cost much less.  </li>
            <li>I gave it only four because it is very high!</li>
            <li>This is the second brand that I have used (the first was the [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>nothing more to say other than it worked for me to help recover from broken ribsfinally was able to sleep</li>
            <li>The major complaint was a strong chemical smell at first use.</li>
            <li>It is so soft.  </li>
            <li>It is extremely firm, however, and I haven&#x27;t found a way to make it comfortable.  </li>
            <li>However, NO regrets!!!</li>
            <li>But still think it&#x27;s worth it as I can finally sit up with adequate back support during the night when I&#x27;m so exhausted.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s OK, but a little too firm for me.  </li>

            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but a little too firm for me.  </li>
            <li> The old one crushed down to un-usefulness in about 18 months of daily use - this one looks and feels like it will last a lot longer.</li>
            <li> My back pain is completely gone, and when I read or use the computer in bed (which I spend a few hours a day doing), I never even notice the wedge (and</li>
            <li> Much too hard.</li>
            <li> I found this to be smaller than I expected</li>
            <li> The cover is soft and the texture helps prevent slipping g down.  </li>
            <li> It adjusts to two difference angles just by flipping that little section, which makes different sitting angle for your back.</li>
            <li> I have vertigo when I lay down flat on a bed.</li>
            <li> Fwiw, if you&#x27;re using it to sit up I&#x27;d recommend also using a pillow as it&#x27;s a little hard, but it&#x27;s still very comfy.</li>
            <li> There should be more color options offered for this foam pillow because the fabric color is sort of an ugly beige.</li>
            <li> This wedge is what i expected and i would recommend this anyone that&#x27;s considering a wedge purchase.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and feel it&#x27;s too bulky and wide for me.</li>
            <li> When I first brought this Wedge home, I was a little disappointed because I&#x27;d paid a lot of money, and it made me sit so straight up</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found that I have a tendency to roll to one side or the other.</li>
            <li> The other review is UNTRUE.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just a little too stiff for me and not quite wide enough for my arms not to fall off of the side.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t sell other covers for it.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, very versatile.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 82 year-old mom after she complained of back pain and discomfort reading in bed.</li>
            <li> I found it not very comfortable.</li>
            <li> or I would slide down or fall off the sides.</li>
            <li> My only real issue is the $100 pricetag, painful.</li>
            <li> I had hope the surface was just a little softer</li>
            <li> There were no directions, so it took a little effort to get the cover off (the zipper was a bit tricky and needed a paperclip).  </li>
            <li> Also, when you first open it up from the shrinked wrapped plastic, you&#x27;ll need to let it air out for a week or less because of the unpleasant odor on the thin fabric on the pillow.</li>
            <li> Definitely not a comfortable wedge for sleeping;</li>
            <li> Would recommend this item to any having trouble sleeping without a bit of an angle.</li>
            <li> It stays firm and does not smell.</li>
            <li> I opted for a plain wedge that does not fold.</li>
            <li> I can usually sleep all night with this</li>
            <li> It is sturdy and it should help my back problems, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t.</li>

            <li> I am so glad I bought this pillow.  It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do and it is worth every penny.  I can&#x27;t think of anything else to say.  It&#x27;s a very wise purchase if you like to sit up in bed and read or write or watch TV or whatever.  A+</li>
            <li> Sturdy, good quality and does not collapse under weight. Definitely not a comfortable wedge for sleeping; just good for sitting up in bed and watching TV or reading.  Much too hard. Would not buy again knowing what I know now.</li>
            <li> I like it but it&#x27;s really hard so I put a pillow in front of it for more comfort while reading and watching television</li>
            <li> I love this pillow.  I use it to sit up to nurse my baby in bed at night.  My only complaint is that they don&#x27;t sell other covers for it.  Not a big fan of furry beige.  But still think it&#x27;s worth it as I can finally sit up with adequate back support during the night when I&#x27;m so exhausted.</li>
            <li> I have been looking for a good pillow wedge for a long time. Something that would not give me backache. I have vertigo when I lay down flat on a bed. So I had to limit my traveling because everything I tried would not work. I&#x27;d either wake up with back pain or I would slide down or fall off the sides. So I tried this one out and I am extremely happy. Now I have no issues with staying in hotel rooms or going on cruises. I can usually sleep all night with this and I wake up on trips well rested. I am also 6\\&quot; tall and 200lbs but this works like a champ.</li>
            <li> Very comfortable, lightweight, so easy to take off and on the bed...the only drawback is the warmth of the material covering the wedge...nice in the winter, but might be a little warm in the summer months.  Good support for the back!</li>
            <li> I love my bed wedge pillow it is perfect for me.  I was disappointed in how long it took me to get my wedge.  Otherwise it is awesome.</li>
            <li> When I first brought this Wedge home, I was a little disappointed because I&#x27;d paid a lot of money, and it made me sit so straight up that it felt uncomfortable, and it did smell a little out of the bag.  I thought I would never get used to it.  A month later, I love it.  My back pain is completely gone, and when I read or use the computer in bed (which I spend a few hours a day doing), I never even notice the wedge (and the smell left quickly).  But I notice if I&#x27;m NOT using it!!  So glad I bought it.  It was worth every penny.</li>
            <li> Excellent product....very comfortable and does what it claims. Great shipping (although the communication needs to be more accurate) speed.</li>
            <li> I do a lot of reading in bed and always have back issues with pillow arm chairs. So not the case with the bed wedge pillow. I read for hours without any issues. I love this wedge and it is so worth every penny!</li>
            <li> I am happy with the purchase and am sleeping at lot better. Would recommend this item to any having trouble sleeping without a bit of an angle.</li>
            <li> Just simply love the pillow! I was researching many other options and so glad went with this one. It adjusts to two difference angles just by flipping that little section, which makes different sitting angle for your back. The lower angle is what I was looking for my back&#x27;s support when sitting on the bed and this product is all what I needed.</li>
            <li> Before I bought this wedge pillow, I read many of the other reviews. The major complaint was a strong chemical smell at first use. While there certainly was a smell, it wasn&#x27;t THAT strong, and it disappeared within a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the pillow has definitely helped my back. However, I still have some pain in my hips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the ability to use the wedge in the &amp;#34;upright&amp;#34; position to read in bed. Of course, then it&#x27;s important to switch to the &amp;#34;reclining&amp;#34; position before going to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also found that I have a tendency to roll to one side or the other. That puts a twist in my neck, which isn&#x27;t great. However, if I can get through the night sleeping on my back, the results are wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I share my home with several cats, so I put the pillow in the closet during the day. The handle is very helpful for moving the pillow.</li>
            <li> I love these and I actually own three of them.  I use two instead of a headboard in the master bedroom and I have another in the guest room.  I actually like the first one I got best as it has a slightly contoured shape which is especially comfortable for sitting up in bed.  But the two I recent purchased are exactly like the photo, not contoured and they are still quite comfortable.  The cover is soft and the texture helps prevent slipping g down.  I like that these are adjustable as sometimes I use them to raise my head and chest when sleeping and sometimes I use one to elevate my legs.</li>
            <li> I totally love this. It&#x27;s cheaper here on Amazon than in the stores, I looked. My lady stole it away from me to use as a comfortable foot-rest under her desk. Needless to say, very versatile. Totally a good purchase.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK, but a little too firm for me.  I like to sleep with my head elevated because of GERD.  It&#x27;s just a little too stiff for me and not quite wide enough for my arms not to fall off of the side.  So, not the best choice for me, but better than nothing.</li>
            <li> nothing more to say other than it worked for me to help recover from broken ribsfinally was able to sleep</li>
            <li> I like the pillow, don&#x27;t get me wrong. It is sturdy and it should help my back problems, but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t. It just is a bit overpriced.</li>
            <li> I found this to be smaller than I expected and I do not like the way it folds out. I found it not very comfortable. I opted for a plain wedge that does not fold. This is too pricey for what it is.</li>
            <li> The other review is UNTRUE.  NO smell at all!  And, Brookstone has an excellent return policy.  I bought mine at a mall store in W Washington.  I just wish it was a bit larger although I am 6&#x27;5\\&quot; I wish most products were larger.  Be prepaired, it is very firm, tho I had hope the surface was just a little softer, it is nice that it dosen&#x27;t crush into nothing like most of the other \\&quot;foams\\&quot; out there.  The covering is also high quality and very soft!  I am getting another one because it is perfect for my legs and after my recovery the wife can have one for lounging. My only real issue is the $100 pricetag, painful.</li>
            <li> I bought this pillow wedge to keep myself propped up during the night to minimize my acid reflux issues.  The pillow is helpful, but the sleeping position takes some getting used to.  I like how the pillow is adjustable.  I love the cover!  It is so soft.  I didn&#x27;t realize the cover is just like my Brookstone NAP blanket that I love.  There were no directions, so it took a little effort to get the cover off (the zipper was a bit tricky and needed a paperclip).  The best part of this purchase was when the package arrived.  My kids said it looked like a big bag of brownie mix.  Then to their amazement, the pillow exploded in size once I cut the bag open.  Funny thing, the pillow smelled like brownie mix too!  I washed the cover and now it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> My husband got this for me b/c I watch movies and read in bed a lot. It was pretty pricy and at first I questioned why he purchased it. However, now that I&#x27;ve been using it a while, it is amazing!!!! You can sit up in 2 different angles based on how you position the pillow. Thankfully I had this pillow after my surgery. Couldn&#x27;t have been comfortable without it during recovery.</li>
            <li> Great product and great value</li>
            <li> This a great pillow I suffer from back pain and GERD. Works great I have seen a lot of inprovement from my illnesses and my fiance also love it too. Great for late nite activities.</li>
            <li> This wedge is what i expected and i would recommend this anyone that&#x27;s considering a wedge purchase. The wedge was delivered about four days after i ordered it online. This was the best deal I could find</li>
            <li> Sturdy ..firm...use it every night.</li>
            <li> Overpriced &amp; uncomfortable.  Returning to Brookstone was a nightmare.</li>
            <li> This bed wedge pillow is made well.  It is extremely firm, however, and I haven&#x27;t found a way to make it comfortable.  It would be nice if they added a squishy outer layer over the hard foam wedge.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m recovering from lumbar surgery, and this pillow is a huge help. It&#x27;s perfect for putting under the knees, or for sitting up in bed. Fwiw, if you&#x27;re using it to sit up I&#x27;d recommend also using a pillow as it&#x27;s a little hard, but it&#x27;s still very comfy.</li>
            <li> too clumsy .&lt;br /&gt;Hard to store in a small space.&lt;br /&gt;Well made and sturdy. Comfortable with an added pillow on the back rest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good for raising legs.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a very good firm pillow for support if you want to sit up comfortably in bed while sleeping, watching t.v. etc but I think it&#x27;s overpriced. My tall 6&#x27;3 husband has back problems and uses it for sleeping upright in bed. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;3 and feel it&#x27;s too bulky and wide for me. You could probably find other bed wedge foam pillows with good support that cost much less.  There should be more color options offered for this foam pillow because the fabric color is sort of an ugly beige. Also, when you first open it up from the shrinked wrapped plastic, you&#x27;ll need to let it air out for a week or less because of the unpleasant odor on the thin fabric on the pillow. It&#x27;s very bulky so you probably won&#x27;t be able to travel with it unless you have a big suitcase. I gave this pillow four stars for its comfort and firmness but want to give it two stars because I don&#x27;t like the price.</li>
            <li> Love it - got the support I was looking for and it&#x27;s held up very well.</li>
            <li> Ingenius design.  The packaging was small with the air all removed, it was fun to watch it bloom up to full size once opened!</li>
            <li> This is the second brand that I have used (the first was the [[ASIN:B00064S4DK Hermell Products Dual Position Bed Wedge without Cover]]). This one is wider (which is nice), higher (nice sometimes) and much firmer. The old one crushed down to un-usefulness in about 18 months of daily use - this one looks and feels like it will last a lot longer. The sleep surface on this product is VERY firm memory foam. I&#x27;m not sure what it remembers as the surface seems to stay very firm. As others have remarked, it does have a smell, but it is really not bad at all and does not bother me at all. I completely agree with the reviewer that suggested that this product should have some kind of pillowy soft cover - even if it were an extra cost option.</li>
            <li> It is the perfect height for elevated sleep.  I do use a pillow on top of it because I like the feel of a pillow.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s OK works great for copd.....</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a Brookstone fan! Yes, it had a smell when first unpacked. It is super soft. Love the versatility. I&#x27;m 5&#x27;9&amp;#34; and I have a temperpedic bed, so I tend to slide down at night, but I&#x27;m very happy with it. I gave it only four because it is very high! However, NO regrets!!!</li>
            <li> Had shoulder surgery and need to sleep reclined. I tried stacking pillows, a chair pillow, etc. but those options either left my back hurting or lost rigidity during the night or over time and I&#x27;d wake up multiple times during the night trying to get comfortable (besides the shoulder pain).&lt;br /&gt;After shopping around and reading positive reviews on this Bed Wedge Pillow I bit the bullet and tried it. It shipped quickly and after the first night, I knew I&#x27;d made the right decision.&lt;br /&gt;We have a Queen bed and it fits perfectly on my side. It stays firm and does not smell. For me, it&#x27;s more comfortable if I put a pillow under my head so the angle is a bit better. In any case, you&#x27;ll be pleased with the results.&lt;br /&gt;I would&#x27;ve given it 5 stars but can&#x27;t quite figure out why it has to be $100.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my 82 year-old mom after she complained of back pain and discomfort reading in bed. She loves it so much that she totes it around the house, using it to watch television and read in bed. She even took it on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beware: This pillow is BIG. Much bigger than you may expect. It&#x27;s not a problem for my mom because she watches television while sitting on the floor, propped against the pillow. (She finds it&#x27;s the most comfortable position for her back.) But it won&#x27;t fit on a regular chair or on a sofa. Perfect for bed or for the floor only.</li>
