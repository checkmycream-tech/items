    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>Excellent staying power.  </li>
            <li>This is the best BB cream out there.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s the best!  </li>
            <li>excellent product, excellent shipping</li>
            <li>I have very fair skin and the Medium color is perfect.  </li>
            <li>great skin smoother and moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>A great product for in the go.</li>
            <li>If you want more coverage or don&#x27;t take great care of your skin, you might not be as happy with this.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something to cover up a bunch of flaws on your face, this isn&#x27;t the product for you, but if you&#x27;re looking for light coverage this is perfect.  </li>
            <li>This won&#x27;t give you full flawless coverage like a foundation</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a perfect primer if you want to put a mineral powder over the top for a bit more coverage.  </li>
            <li>looks like i have nothing on but better!</li>
            <li>Love this product!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this stuff!  </li>
            <li>love it!</li>
            <li>I absolutely love this product!</li>
            <li>I love this product, I use a bit of concealer where needed and a pea sized bit of MST.  </li>
            <li>I LOVE</li>
            <li>LOVE LOVE this miracle skin transformer for my BB cream.</li>
            <li>Best facial primer</li>
            <li>will, but is a great alternative when you want a more natural look and feeling without the heaviness.</li>
            <li>Goes in smooth, covers flawlessly and last all day!</li>
            <li>I have hyper-sensitive skin, and I can use this just fine, so although it has its flaws, I really love it.</li>
            <li>Getting the illuminator with the original product also was appealing.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;No difference in size of pores, ruddiness, fine lines</li>
            <li>It covers well and feels smooth and light.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t wear foundation, opting in stead for tinted moisturizer because it feels good and looks good without the hassle and annoyance of foundation, which I find heavy.</li>
            <li>I just got so excited seeing this on Amazon</li>
            <li>The value is much better on Amazon then in the higher end department stores.</li>
            <li>If you want to even things out and cover minor stuff, this is great.</li>
            <li>All I can say is that no matter how much I put on, I noticed no difference at all -- it was more like a light moisturizer than anything</li>
            <li>It also would make an excellent primer for those of you that don&#x27;t mind a thick coating of foundation.  </li>
            <li>This is the first that I&#x27;ve been able to wear, even on a hot day.  </li>
            <li>I love the natural finish to this product.</li>
            <li>Totally worth the money and totally worth trying.</li>
            <li>I bought this product because of good reviews I had read on Amazon and other sites.  </li>
            <li>If you want the light feel but more coverage, I sometimes use a little concealer on top and find it does the trick, especially after I apply powder.</li>
            <li>and I didn&#x27;t pay attention to see if it was the real deal.</li>
            <li>It really is like airbrushing.  </li>
            <li>It is very silky going on but did not offer the coverage I was looking for.  </li>
            <li>I am really unsure of the quality of this product.  </li>
            <li>This product runs very light as the other reviews have mentioned.  </li>
            <li>I will stick with either my L&#x27;Oreal BB cream or the Hard Candy CC cream -- both of which do a fantastic job of giving you a matte finish that is not too heavy, blurring fine lines and wrinkles and reducing the appearance of large pores -- all for a price of $8 - $10.</li>
            <li>The small one, &amp;#34;Face Spotlight&amp;#34; is fine.</li>
            <li>I use to buy the original at sephora but when I went they longer carry the product so that&#x27;s when I came on Amazon and got so excited that I found my holy grail sad thing</li>
            <li>It goes on so smooth and you only need a little.  </li>
            <li>I have been using it for several years and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
            <li>It provides just enough coverage to blend in any spots on my face, while still looking natural.  </li>
            <li>When they stopped making my old product I tried several replacements but nine worked the way I wanted until I found this.</li>

            <li> great skin smoother and moisturizer.  looks like i have nothing on but better!</li>
            <li> I love this product, I use a bit of concealer where needed and a pea sized bit of MST.  I have very fair skin and the Medium color is perfect.

            <li> Well I&#x27;m very disappointed in myself. I just got so excited seeing this on Amazon and I didn&#x27;t pay attention to see if it was the real deal. I bought this thinking it was Sarah McNamaras miracle skin transformation all I seen was the writing and didn&#x27;t think twice... This one is a fake it definitely does not do the same as Sarah McNamaras product.  I&#x27;m so disappointed in myself wasted30sum bucks on a product that is horrible does not leave your skin smooth and pore less like Sarah McNamaras. I use to buy the original at sephora but when I went they longer carry the product so that&#x27;s when I came on Amazon and got so excited that I found my holy grail sad thing it&#x27;s not who&#x27;s I thought it was.... If I could I would not give any stars</li>

            <li> I didn&#x27;t notice the results I was expecting and hoping for</li>
            <li> This is the best BB cream out there.  I&#x27;ve tried others but none even come close.  It goes on so smooth and you only need a little.  It&#x27;s the best!  It really is like airbrushing.  A+</li>
            <li> A great product for in the go. 3 steps in one</li>
            <li> excellent product, excellent shipping</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t wear foundation, opting in stead for tinted moisturizer because it feels good and looks good without the hassle and annoyance of foundation, which I find heavy. I LOVE LOVE LOVE this miracle skin transformer for my BB cream. It covers well and feels smooth and light. If you want to even things out and cover minor stuff, this is great.

            <li> It is very silky going on but did not offer the coverage I was looking for.  It just goes on sheer like a moisturizer.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this stuff!  Best facial primer I&#x27;ve used....where it with or without foundation....love it!</li>
            <li> I have used this make-up before and like it.</li>
            <li> I am really unsure of the quality of this product.  I ordered it thinking I was ordering &amp;#34;Sarah Mcnamara&amp;#34; Miracle Skin Transformer.&amp;#34;  The name of the product I ordered is the same, but &amp;#34;Sarah McNamara&amp;#34; is not above the name of the product.  The format and color of the words on product tube  I ordered are the same as the &amp;#34;McNamara&amp;#34; product. This is bound to cause the mistake I made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Since I haven&#x27;t yet used the product, I can&#x27;t say the quality is the same, but I decided to keep both tubes. The small one, &amp;#34;Face Spotlight&amp;#34; is fine.</li>
            <li> I absolutely love this product! When they stopped making my old product I tried several replacements but nine worked the way I wanted until I found this. Goes in smooth, covers flawlessly and last all day!</li>
