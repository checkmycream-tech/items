            <li>Love it!</li>
            <li>Good that I was able to get on Amazon.</li>
            <li>This stuff is the Aston Martin DBS of citrus scents -- quietly powerful, exquisitely rich, perfectly proportioned.</li>
            <li>Love this sent.</li>
            <li>This happens to be one of my favorite colognes and I have been using it for years now.</li>
            <li>You can&#x27;t buy a better fragrance for men and this price is unbeatable.</li>
            <li>Ordered this for my boyfriend, he loves it, so do I :)</li>
            <li>I love it.  </li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>My favorite cologne of all time has been discontinued.</li>
            <li>Better stock up.  </li>
            <li>I am glad I found it.</li>
            <li>Very unique</li>
            <li>Got an older version of this juice (made in US batch) and I am extremely happy that I added it to my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance fades very quickly.  </li>
            <li>Good quality for a somewhat reformalated old school fume!</li>
            <li>Is it possible to loathe a great citrus scent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
            <li>and I used to buy it at the duty free at airport</li>
            <li>Exactly as reviewed on many websites.</li>
            <li>Not like the original.</li>
            <li>wearing for so many years and it doent get old, love the scent</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s one of those colognes he uses for special occasions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is light and may be suited for those buyers interested in a light day scent.</li>
            <li>I sold it on Ebay and now glad I came across the older batch.</li>
            <li>I was able to find it at what I consider a decent price.</li>
            <li>The shipping was quick too.</li>
            <li>and I got my item quickly.</li>
            <li>and it is just as I remember it and worth every penny</li>
            <li>They were very fast and delivered exactly what I ordered.  </li>
            <li>Just for the record, I have been using Dunhill Edition since it first came into existence during the 80&#x27;s.  </li>
            <li>I used to use this many years back.</li>
            <li>The citrus accord on top has a whopping dose of lavender, which makes it nearly as much a fougere as a citrus chypre, and the later notes of spice and cedar give this a strength and depth most such scents don&#x27;t have.</li>
            <li>He loved it then and now.&lt;br /&gt;Dunhill discontinued the cologne some years ago and we where never able to find it until we went&lt;br</li>
            <li>Sweet lemony, soft aroma.</li>
            <li>There are fine differences in the bottle and definitely a big difference in the quality of the fragrance.  </li>
            <li>The service was fast and efficient after I purchased this product.</li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>I doubt that this is the real thing.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this one to be ready- supplied).</li>
            <li>One can either try another vendor or just contact the NYC store and spring for the real thing.  </li>
            <li>Thanks</li>
            <li>But the smell is the real deal.</li>
            <li>It has a such a sophisticated and classy fragrance.</li>
            <li>My friend loved it and will never go back to the other!</li>
            <li>but this classic delivers.</li>
            <li>This particular vendor appears to sell what does not match up with what is sold in the Dunhill store in Manhattan.  </li>
            <li>It has a great lemon and herb top notes and woody base notes</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a classic scent.</li>
            <li>At first is is a very fresh scent, which dries down spicy and woody.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this cologne.</li>
            <li>Very sensual and masculine.</li>
            <li>Great for work or casual.</li>
            <li>The whole discontinue issue is moot because it has been back on the market for over a year - certainly at the Dunhill store.  </li>
            <li>(I had a bottle that I purchased from Dunhill that was a third filled left over.  </li>
            <li>Honestly though, it has a subtle, classy fragrance with a hint of fruitiness.  </li>
            <li>Further, the longevity is immense -- I can get 6-8 hours out of this; that&#x27;s a mark of true quality perfumery.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried a number of Dunhill&#x27;s more recent offerings, and they&#x27;ve all been toxic waste, to put the matter politely.</li>
            <li>and it is just as I remember it and worth every penny spent.</li>
            <li>After such a long time looking for this at last it arrived yesterday and straight using it!</li>
            <li>Nice barbershop vibe to a not so expensive cologne.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t really know how to describe it other</li>
            <li>I had the real thing sprayed on one wrist - this one sprayed on the other before I went to bed.  </li>

            <li> Don&#x27;t really know how to describe it other</li>
            <li> I had the real thing sprayed on one wrist - this one sprayed on the other before I went to bed.  </li>
            <li> The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long.</li>
            <li> However I&#x27;m not entirely sure that this is the real thing.</li>
            <li> The scent does not last like other products have at the same price</li>
            <li> but it is not the same product, it has been changed from it&#x27;s original formulation and has that fake smell to it</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s hard to describe, but i really like it.</li>
            <li> I used this product a long time ago and was told it was discontinued - so it was a surprise to see it again -</li>
            <li> The next morning this product was gone on the wrist it was sprayed, and on the other the fragrance held on well.  </li>
            <li> Big let - down.</li>
            <li> , oh, also it stays in your garments for a couple of days, just a little scent, but enough to realize this is a quality product.</li>
            <li> Hard to find masculine scents anymore</li>
            <li> spent.  </li>
            <li> It disappeared from the stores (at least in California) and could find it online only in the UK.</li>
            <li> had a newer version before that was made in Germany and had a slightly greener liquid inside...</li>
            <li> That was slightly inferior to this.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not sweet or musky.  </li>
            <li> I checked this out in order to perhaps save a few bucks.  </li>
            <li> This is a hard to find scent</li>
            <li> Have not used this since the late 80&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> However this scent to me was absolutely horrid, had a very bad scent to me.</li>
            <li> He used to wear it years ago but it&#x27;s difficult to find.  </li>
            <li> I can heartily recommend this as a blind buy to anyone.</li>
            <li> Until I found out that Amazon was selling this item, this cologne is very difficult to find in the U.S.</li>
            <li> Until I found out that Amazon was selling this item, this cologne is very difficult to find in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt; was worried this would be a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; and smell nothing like it should but took the risk</li>
            <li> for the bad news.</li>
            <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this choice!!</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Yes I loved it. I got it for my son who bought it in 1989 in Hong Kong. He loved it then and now.&lt;br /&gt;Dunhill discontinued the cologne some years ago and we where never able to find it until we went&lt;br /&gt;to Dunhill.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon was efficient and on time for his birthday.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
            <li> At last I found what I was craving for...&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for Dunhill Edition Eau De Toilette at the Dunhill shop in London.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for it at the London Harrods&lt;br /&gt;But I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere&lt;br /&gt;I almost gave up&lt;br /&gt;so thank you Amazon for this great Eau De Toilette.</li>
            <li> Love this sent. Have not used this since the late 80&#x27;s. Just as remembered.</li>
            <li> This happens to be one of my favorite colognes and I have been using it for years now. You can&#x27;t go wrong with this choice!!</li>
            <li> After such a long time looking for this at last it arrived yesterday and straight using it! The smell is still there until the next morning. The best perfume I ever have. Will buy this again!</li>
            <li> One of the all time great colognes from the legendary house of Dunhill. You can&#x27;t buy a better fragrance for men and this price is unbeatable. Hard to find masculine scents anymore but this classic delivers. Highest recommendation.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this cologne. At first is is a very fresh scent, which dries down spicy and woody. Very sensual and masculine. I bought it as a substitute for the Liz Claiborne cologne Soul by Curve, which my friend wanted for Christmas. The Dunhill Edition is a higher-quality cologne for basically the same price. My friend loved it and will never go back to the other!</li>
            <li> The scent does not last like other products have at the same price point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is light and may be suited for those buyers interested in a light day scent.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for my boyfriend, he loves it, so do I :)</li>
            <li> Until I found out that Amazon was selling this item, this cologne is very difficult to find in the U.S. The service was fast and efficient after I purchased this product.</li>
            <li> Got an older version of this juice (made in US batch) and I am extremely happy that I added it to my collection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a newer version before that was made in Germany and had a slightly greener liquid inside... That was slightly inferior to this. I sold it on Ebay and now glad I came across the older batch.</li>
            <li> A very nice smelling fragrance! Exactly as reviewed on many websites. Has a spicy opening that lasts! However I&#x27;m not entirely sure that this is the real thing. Only because it leaked quite a bit when I tilted the bottle after I opened it.</li>
            <li> I used this product a long time ago and was told it was discontinued - so it was a surprise to see it again - but it is not the same product, it has been changed from it&#x27;s original formulation and has that fake smell to it</li>
            <li> Nice barbershop vibe to a not so expensive cologne. Good quality for a somewhat reformalated old school fume!</li>
            <li> The best men&#x27;s fragrance ever.  I love it.  I get a lot of compliments.  Thanks</li>
            <li> Not like the original.</li>
            <li> Love it! Don&#x27;t really know how to describe it other than it smells really good, oh, also it stays in your garments for a couple of days, just a little scent, but enough to realize this is a quality product.</li>
            <li> Great fragrance.  Order came as advertized.</li>
            <li> I love it. So does my wife.</li>
            <li> I bought this for my husband. He used to wear it years ago but it&#x27;s difficult to find.  It has a such a sophisticated and classy fragrance. It&#x27;s one of those colognes he uses for special occasions.</li>
            <li> My favorite cologne of all time has been discontinued. I was able to find it at what I consider a decent price.</li>
            <li> great price and a great cologne for men.</li>
            <li> This particular vendor appears to sell what does not match up with what is sold in the Dunhill store in Manhattan.  There are fine differences in the bottle and definitely a big difference in the quality of the fragrance.  The whole discontinue issue is moot because it has been back on the market for over a year - certainly at the Dunhill store.  The fragrance fades very quickly.  I doubt that this is the real thing.  I had the real thing sprayed on one wrist - this one sprayed on the other before I went to bed.  The next morning this product was gone on the wrist it was sprayed, and on the other the fragrance held on well.  (I had a bottle that I purchased from Dunhill that was a third filled left over.  I purchased this one to be ready- supplied). One can either try another vendor or just contact the NYC store and spring for the real thing.  Just for the record, I have been using Dunhill Edition since it first came into existence during the 80&#x27;s.  I checked this out in order to perhaps save a few bucks.  Big let - down.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s not sweet or musky.  it&#x27;s hard to describe, but i really like it.</li>
            <li> wearing for so many years and it doent get old, love the scent</li>
            <li> This stuff is the Aston Martin DBS of citrus scents -- quietly powerful, exquisitely rich, perfectly proportioned. The citrus accord on top has a whopping dose of lavender, which makes it nearly as much a fougere as a citrus chypre, and the later notes of spice and cedar give this a strength and depth most such scents don&#x27;t have. Further, the longevity is immense -- I can get 6-8 hours out of this; that&#x27;s a mark of true quality perfumery.  I can heartily recommend this as a blind buy to anyone. Is it possible to loathe a great citrus scent?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for the bad news. I gather from various posts on Basenotes that this has been discontinued, though I can&#x27;t vouch for that. Better stock up.  I&#x27;ve tried a number of Dunhill&#x27;s more recent offerings, and they&#x27;ve all been toxic waste, to put the matter politely. If Dunhill doesn&#x27;t want my business, oh well -- others do. There&#x27;s Paco Rabanne...YSL Jazz...Pino Silvestre...Le Troisieme Homme...</li>
            <li> They were very fast and delivered exactly what I ordered.  Dunhill Edition is a great men&#x27;s spray.  It was recommended by my wife and she loves it.  Thanks</li>
            <li> I like it and my wife loves it....i guess that says it all.  Honestly though, it has a subtle, classy fragrance with a hint of fruitiness.  Great for work or casual.</li>
            <li> Ordered this for the hubs who&#x27;s from England and bought this regularly. He loved it. Smells great and great price. The shipping was quick too. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 instead of 5 stars is that the smell doesn&#x27;t seem to last that long. Perhaps it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s the eau de toilette. But the smell is the real deal.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using Dunhill Edition for 8 years . Until I found out that Amazon was selling this item, this cologne is very difficult to find in the U.S.&lt;br /&gt; was worried this would be a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; and smell nothing like it should but took the risk and it is just as I remember it and worth every penny spent. Seller was great to deal with  and  Respond to my questions  in time  fair thank you amazon</li>
            <li> I am a big fan of Dunhill cologne.  However this scent to me was absolutely horrid, had a very bad scent to me. I actually threw the bottle away.</li>
            <li> I used to use this many years back. It disappeared from the stores (at least in California) and could find it online only in the UK. Good that I was able to get on Amazon. It has a great lemon and herb top notes and woody base notes</li>
            <li> This is a hard to find scent and I used to buy it at the duty free at airport but it must have been discontinued or something.  I was worried this would be a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; and smell nothing like it should but took the risk and it is just as I remember it and worth every penny spent.  Seller was great to deal with and I got my item quickly.</li>
            <li> Great smell. I am glad I found it. Sweet lemony, soft aroma. It&#x27;s a classic scent. Very unique</li>
