            <li>I&#x27;m happy to find this product here for a reasonable price with free and fast shipping!</li>
            <li>I haven&#x27;t found the equivalent in the USA that is free of unwanted additives.</li>
            <li>I enjoy using E45 because its odorless and light.</li>
            <li>It makes my skin feel silky smooth.</li>
            <li>IT IS FANTASTIC for my face too.  </li>
            <li>Yah, i would say i love this product even though it did not meet my skin specific need that i wanted which is to even my skin tone, however its a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li>I love this cream very much......</li>
            <li>bought it this year for my daughter-inlaw,  who is expecting her first baby :)</li>
            <li>I just love it, my son first purchased for me while he was in England</li>
            <li>This is great cream for dry skin.  </li>
            <li>Great product for dry and dermatological problems skin.</li>
            <li>So my vote is go with something else being this is not sold in the US and has proven to be nothing special.  </li>
            <li>Works great for very dry skin.  </li>
            <li>He hasn&#x27;t had a significant flare up that wasn&#x27;t quickly remedied with an increase in E45 cream.  </li>
            <li>Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product and much cheaper than buying the products in the dermatologists office.</li>
            <li>It has just about as much paraffin content as you can have without turning it into something most people would be reluctant to put on their hands if they plan to shake any hands that day.</li>
            <li>For my son, we gave him a quick 10 minute bleach bath (Google the protocol) one time upfront and then began the E45 treatments.  </li>
            <li>It is odorless and absorbs quickly with no sticky residue.</li>
            <li>I love E45 products, highly recommend them.</li>
            <li>Best kept secret in the world.</li>
            <li>Worth every penny or pence.</li>
            <li>that I happen to be in the UK, but even at $15, the stuff is worth a try.</li>
            <li>E45 has exactly the right balance, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>I first saw this cream when I was in England</li>
            <li>I am 20% or so through my first jar and never want to be without this again.  </li>
            <li>Within a week I could tell a huge difference and have been using this for several months now.</li>
            <li>FAST  SHIPPING,  </li>
            <li>Nothing helped much.  </li>
            <li>The key though, for us, is to make sure it is applied liberally several times a day at first and then once a day as symptoms diminish.  </li>
            <li>The most calming cream for sensitive skin took a little time to ship from England but worth the wait.</li>
            <li>Highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li>Far better than any other product we tried.</li>
            <li>The one and only one worth buying...</li>
            <li>/&gt;The immediate competition for this stuff are Eucerin, Cetaphil, and Aquaphor &amp;#34;creams&amp;#34; (not the much thinner &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34;), which in the US sell for about the same price as this stuff anyway.</li>
            <li>The cream is thick and has a nice feeling....not sticky.</li>
            <li>Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Quite thick, but so effective.</li>
            <li>I used this cream both times I was pregnant, and I don&#x27;t have a single stretch</li>
            <li>Sure, it&#x27;s only Â£5.05 on British Amazon, and I&#x27;m definitely taking a bunch of these in my luggage now</li>
            <li>This is such rich cream to use on dry skin.</li>
            <li>Keeps my skin moist and soft without being greasy and has a neutral scent.</li>
            <li>My skin soaked it right up and 2 hours later my skin was just as dry.</li>
            <li>I have dry patches on my legs and this product has really helped to soften and lighten them.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a little pricey at times, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li>It gives me a lot of relief with skin problems, and helps symptoms clear up a LOT faster than if I left them untreated.  </li>
            <li>I developed Palmoplantar pustulosis several years ago.  </li>
            <li>As any decent doctor will tell you, the best long-term treatment for eczema (and various other conditions caused by dry skin) is big gobs of thick, greasy moisturizing cream, at least twice a day.</li>
            <li>Extremely disappointed, reviews said this cream was incredible for dry skin.</li>
            <li>THe reason I even gave it two stars is that I like that its thick and initially feels very moisturizing, while not irritating my skin, however the moisture doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li>Other than that its like any normal moisturizer you could buy here.</li>

            <li> Have excessive dry skin.</li>
            <li> I have had half a dozen prescriptions that did less than nothing.  </li>
            <li> A little goes along way.</li>
            <li> It also contains 1% lanolin, which imparts on the cream a faint odor of wet sheep that I personally happen to like, though I suppose there&#x27;s no accounting for taste.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> Most reviews say that this is amazing. It is NO different from Eucerin or others at drug store. I have average dry skin, nothing crazy, and I saw no difference after using for 4 weeks. In fact I see more results with Eucerin Eczema relief. Even though I don&#x27;t have Eczema it is non greasy and works great. So my vote is go with something else being this is not sold in the US and has proven to be nothing special.  Save the trouble.</li>
            <li> Thank you. Good product !</li>
            <li> Best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used...and I&#x27;ve used everything! Works great for acne prone skin and eczema!</li>
            <li> I used this cream both times I was pregnant, and I don&#x27;t have a single stretch mark!&lt;br /&gt;I bought it this year for my daughter-inlaw,  who is expecting her first baby :)</li>
            <li> When I went to visit my family in the UK this past spring my mum gave me a tube of this for my psoriasis. Though it&#x27;s not a cure, it&#x27;s the best soothing cream that I&#x27;ve ever used for this. I haven&#x27;t found the equivalent in the USA that is free of unwanted additives. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;m happy to find this product here for a reasonable price with free and fast shipping!</li>
            <li> I will contnue using this cream because my kids skin look and feels soft after the long battle with dry dkin eczema.</li>
            <li> Kudos to the seller who sent this within a week from the UK to Chicago. Other than that its like any normal moisturizer you could buy here. Extremely disappointed, reviews said this cream was incredible for dry skin. My skin soaked it right up and 2 hours later my skin was just as dry. THe reason I even gave it two stars is that I like that its thick and initially feels very moisturizing, while not irritating my skin, however the moisture doesn&#x27;t stay.</li>
            <li> Good product. I enjoy using E45 because its odorless and light. I will continue to use this product. Thank you.</li>
            <li> Have excessive dry skin. This cream is great. Keeps my skin moist and soft without being greasy and has a neutral scent.</li>
            <li> My children have eczema that flares up pretty badly from time to time.  I read about E45 online and decided to give it a try.  It has been a savior for my kids!  It&#x27;s worked better than any of the creams I can get in the states.  The key though, for us, is to make sure it is applied liberally several times a day at first and then once a day as symptoms diminish.  For my son, we gave him a quick 10 minute bleach bath (Google the protocol) one time upfront and then began the E45 treatments.  He hasn&#x27;t had a significant flare up that wasn&#x27;t quickly remedied with an increase in E45 cream.  Highly, highly recommend this product.</li>
            <li> great product.  It makes my skin feel silky smooth. It&#x27;s Non greasy and oily it solves my dry skin problem.</li>
            <li> The best...The one and only one worth buying...</li>
            <li> I required this out in provincial N E Thailand which doesn&#x27;t seem overly endowed with quality dermatological products.&lt;br /&gt;Not for me but for my son. Seems to be working a treat. Other than ordering over the internet the only option&lt;br /&gt;would have been a 900 kilometre round trip to Bangkok where there are a number of Boots stores. So it was a great relief to be able to order through Amazon and avoid the hassle. I know about the quality of the product from being a UK citizen.</li>
            <li> This cream is really good. It does the job when you are having extra dry skin. It the best product I have ever found.</li>
            <li> Very good product for dry skin.  This cream does not have in chemicals or perfumes.  I can feel the difference in my skin.  My doctor recommended it.  I just luv it.</li>
            <li> I love it!  Used it while in England....so, very happy to be able to receive it here in the States.  Thank you.</li>
            <li> I love this cream very much......no fragrance and works on extremly dry skin.  The cream is thick and has a nice feeling....not sticky.</li>
            <li> This cream is the best for very dry skin</li>
            <li> So does this cream works the same stops the itch&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
            <li> I first saw this cream when I was in England and I loved it. We can&#x27;t get it here. It is smooth and effective. It is odorless and absorbs quickly with no sticky residue.</li>
            <li> Best kept secret in the world. It took someone from Ireland to introduce this product to us. Far better than any other product we tried. Makers would profit greatly by marketing this in the US.</li>
            <li> This cream works great!  I have dry patches on my legs and this product has really helped to soften and lighten them.  I will definitely reorder!</li>
            <li> Works great for very dry skin.  Used it on my son&#x27;s feet and legs, He  has Cancer and edema on both of his legs</li>
            <li> This is such rich cream to use on dry skin. A little goes along way. Its great for feet and hands.</li>
            <li> Fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;Quite thick, but so effective. Worth every penny or pence.</li>
            <li> Best cream for babies with dry skin</li>
            <li> only hand cream I use</li>
            <li> My best friend that lives in England sent this to me to help with the Keratosis pilaris I have on my arms and for my nephew that has Eczema on his face. Within a week I could tell a huge difference and have been using this for several months now. My sister now uses for the Keratosis pilaris she has on her arms and the eczema that my nephew has. Couldn&#x27;t ask for a better product and much cheaper than buying the products in the dermatologists office.</li>
            <li> The most calming cream for sensitive skin took a little time to ship from England but worth the wait. Good stuff</li>
            <li> Yah, i would say i love this product even though it did not meet my skin specific need that i wanted which is to even my skin tone, however its a really good moisturizer.</li>
            <li> The only cream I&#x27;ve ever used, and I&#x27;ve used a lot, that stops my itchy skin in the winter!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream since before I can remember.  It&#x27;s a great way to soothe irritated, sore and/or chapped skin.  It gives me a lot of relief with skin problems, and helps symptoms clear up a LOT faster than if I left them untreated.  It&#x27;s a little pricey at times, but well worth the money.</li>
            <li> had used E45 a few years ago after purchasing in UK. Still as great as ever.Too bad not able to purchase off the shelf here.</li>
            <li> perfect if you have Psoriasis</li>
            <li> I love E45 products, highly recommend them.</li>
            <li> As any decent doctor will tell you, the best long-term treatment for eczema (and various other conditions caused by dry skin) is big gobs of thick, greasy moisturizing cream, at least twice a day. But you don&#x27;t want to get something that is so greasy that you end up not using it in practice; that would be counterproductive. E45 has exactly the right balance, in my opinion. It has just about as much paraffin content as you can have without turning it into something most people would be reluctant to put on their hands if they plan to shake any hands that day. It also contains 1% lanolin, which imparts on the cream a faint odor of wet sheep that I personally happen to like, though I suppose there&#x27;s no accounting for taste. The stuff is widely recommended as an eczema treatment in the UK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The immediate competition for this stuff are Eucerin, Cetaphil, and Aquaphor &amp;#34;creams&amp;#34; (not the much thinner &amp;#34;lotions&amp;#34;), which in the US sell for about the same price as this stuff anyway. Sure, it&#x27;s only Â£5.05 on British Amazon, and I&#x27;m definitely taking a bunch of these in my luggage now that I happen to be in the UK, but even at $15, the stuff is worth a try.</li>
            <li> Greasy, not worth the price.</li>
            <li> FAST  SHIPPING,  GREAT  QUALITY</li>
            <li> I used E45 cream when I lived in Scotland 40 years ago. Am so pleased to able to order it through Amazon. It is the best, don&#x27;t want to be without it!</li>
            <li> This is great cream for dry skin.  I just love it, my son first purchased for me while he was in England and I&#x27;m glad to find it on Amazon</li>
            <li> Great product for dry and dermatological problems skin. You will love it! I will purchase it again, for my family and me!</li>
            <li> Makes my skin feel an looks great</li>
            <li> Great cream may buy another</li>
            <li> I was introduced to this product by a friend who lived in England after she&lt;br /&gt;and I had a conversation about dry, cracked, bleeding skin in the winter.&lt;br /&gt;About 10 years ago she mailed me a jar and I have spent the time since&lt;br /&gt;then trying to convince anyone who would listen to bring it back to me&lt;br /&gt;when they traveled to England.&lt;br /&gt;I was so happy to find it on Amazon.  You will not be disappointed</li>
            <li> I developed Palmoplantar pustulosis several years ago.  I&#x27;ve tried argon oils, shea butters, coconut based products - you name it.  Nothing helped much.  I have had half a dozen prescriptions that did less than nothing.  I am 20% or so through my first jar and never want to be without this again.  I am back to order two of the 500G pump bottles, one for upstairs one for downstairs.  At night I slather this on the problem areas, rub on the rest of my hands and put on cotton gloves.  Apply again in the  morning.  In just a couple of days the improvement was noticeable.  In a week it was shockingly better.&lt;br /&gt;My face is also quite dry and I figured hey, why not give it a shot?  IT IS FANTASTIC for my face too.  Does a much better job that the stuff I pay $40 an ounce for.  Or rather what I USED to pay.  From now on I will be using this on my face and everything else as well.&lt;br /&gt;If you have a problem give this a shot.  You might get lucky too  :)</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to moisturize well.</li>
