            <li>It&#x27;s not even worth my time to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

            <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
            <li>since I broke the first (my fault).  </li>
            <li>I wanted a no frills locker mirror with no silly frame.</li>
            <li>exactly where I place</li>
            <li>magnet hold isn&#x27;t superior, but i&#x27;ve got to say after it&#x27;s fallen off a few times</li>
            <li>Magnet is strong enough to hold it while it hangs from only the top one.</li>
            <li>Good size for small desk</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a nice sturdy little mirror.</li>
            <li>If I don&#x27;t close the door gently, it falls off inside the cabinet when I close the door.  </li>
            <li>Its a real mirror not a film or anything.</li>
            <li>This mirror is pretty tiny but perfect for my wall locker here overseas, since I have such a small space.</li>
            <li>Its real glass...</li>
            <li>In a locker this would really work well.  </li>
            <li>Mirror appears to be made of real glass --</li>
            <li>Shipped fast and were not broken.</li>
            <li>First off, this product page is completely misleading.</li>
            <li>The only thing I can complain about, is the Postage fee of $4.99, is more than the actual postage fee of $2.24, that it took to mail it to me, which included being oversized.  </li>
            <li>There is no distortion, my image appears clear as day, even looks real, although the description states  otherwise.  </li>
            <li>I would rather pay more for the item, as long as the Postage reflects the actual cost of shipping and supplies.</li>
            <li>A review I read said it was cheap and the edges were sharp.</li>
            <li>The mirror itself is pretty tiny.</li>
            <li>This small mirror is a nice addition to a teen&#x27;s school locker.  </li>
            <li>The two magnetics located on the back of the mirror are very wide and provide a strong attachment.  </li>
            <li>Clear mirror</li>
            <li>I really love this small mirror, but refuse to pay double postage, each time I order.  </li>
            <li>Sellers need to invest in a Postage Scale, so these high shipping fees, can be reduce to actual cost.  </li>
            <li>Clear mirror but barely stays up.</li>
            <li>would fall of every time the door was closed no matter how gentle you were.</li>
            <li>It does stick, but barely.</li>
            <li>I barely touched it and it would fall.</li>
            <li>A small mirror for cubicle desk was exactly what I was looking for!</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s  a great mirror, but difficult to hang where there is no easy way to hang it on a non-metal wall.</li>

            <li> I will put tape around the edges and let my daughter use in her locker since she is a teen, but this product is definitely not what I expected based on the product description.</li>
            <li> I have never had such an unimportant device irritate me so much.</li>
            <li> However, the mirror had several small chips along the edge of the glass - not a big deal since it&#x27;s being used in a garage.</li>
            <li> This mirror was what I expected.</li>
            <li> I have mine on a small cabinet about 1/3 the size of an actual school locker.  </li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t imagine it staying on in a row of lockers with other folks slamming them.  </li>
            <li> so there is nothing sharp about it.</li>
            <li> It has sharp edges and</li>
            <li> Other than the product description</li>
            <li> So I will give this a 4 Star, due to the postage overcharge.  </li>
            <li> These magnets are a joke, they couldn&#x27;t even support the weight of the mirror, without sliding down the cabinet door.</li>
            <li> the edges are sharp and not &amp;#34;safe for little hands&amp;#34; as the product description says.</li>
            <li> Very sharp of course.</li>
            <li> Edges are slightly rounded at tips</li>
            <li> At first I thought it was just dirty but after cleaning, I noticed it was in the product itself.  </li>
            <li> Chipping off little pieces of the glass.</li>
            <li> If that picture is to be believed, the green locker would have to be two feet tall.</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money since trash bags.</li>
            <li> I needed a magnetic mirror for my tack room door of my horse trailer and was having trouble finding one.  </li>
            <li> the edges are sharp, the magnet is weak and it doesn&#x27;t hold.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Small mirror</li>
            <li> Magnet hardly worked.</li>
            <li> Not worth $6!!!</li>
            <li> but I was disappointing in the overall experience.</li>
            <li> Absolute crap.</li>
            <li> Packaging is a little sloppy and dirty, mirror came with small scratches and chips.</li>
            <li> Did not work well magnet was weak and would not hold mirror to the door</li>
            <li> This mirror is thin, so does not stick out and get hung-up on my sleeve, which I like.</li>
            <li> Junk &amp; poor packaging for shipping.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this item except for the description.  </li>
            <li> It has a hazy background that I find annoying.  </li>

    <ol>
            <li> It is a great size and very clear mirror which is great. I didn&#x27;t have issues with it at first, but what others said about the magnets not holding is true.  I have mine on a small cabinet about 1/3 the size of an actual school locker.  If I don&#x27;t close the door gently, it falls off inside the cabinet when I close the door.  I can&#x27;t imagine it staying on in a row of lockers with other folks slamming them.  I&#x27;ll probably glue on extra magnets when I remember to do so, then it will be find.</li>
            <li> Did not work well magnet was weak and would not hold mirror to the door would fall of every time the door was closed no matter how gentle you were.</li>
            <li> Clear mirror but barely stays up.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a nice sturdy little mirror.</li>
            <li> A small mirror for cubicle desk was exactly what I was looking for! This works just perfect. 2 magnets on back let it hang perfectly from the wall of my desk. Magnet is strong enough to hold it while it hangs from only the top one. A review I read said it was cheap and the edges were sharp. Edges are slightly rounded at tips so there is nothing sharp about it. Clear mirror w/ no scratches. For the price, it was just perfect for what it&#x27;s used for! Good size for small desk and I would assume a locker as well.</li>
            <li> Excellent. Thank you.</li>
            <li> It is something that you can buy at the dollar store. Absolute crap. The first time I opened my locker it fell and smashed on the ground. Not worth $6!!!</li>
            <li> This item is much smaller than I anticipated...my fault for not reading the dimensions. I was looking for something around 8x10.  It has a hazy background that I find annoying.  At first I thought it was just dirty but after cleaning, I noticed it was in the product itself.  I gave it three stars for the hazy appearance but it&#x27;s still a mirror and I can still see myself.  I&#x27;ll use it because it&#x27;s here but I was disappointing in the overall experience.</li>
            <li> First off, this product page is completely misleading. The mirror is glass, not acrylic. It has sharp edges and the mirror backing was peeling while still in the packaging. The mirror itself is pretty tiny. Yes there is a picture on the page that has it&#x27;s dimensions written on it, but the picture is also scaled to look like it is much larger. If that picture is to be believed, the green locker would have to be two feet tall. This fits in the palm of my hand. Do not pay $8.99 for this. The magnets on the back are stick on magnets, and not even quality ones at that. It does stick, but barely. You can get a much better and larger mirror from anywhere else. Do not give these people your money till they reduce the cost to represent the quality of the product. I&#x27;d say $1.99 would be fair.</li>
            <li> This mirror is just perfect for my needs. Positioned by the door to the garage, it gives a last minute check on appearance before leaving the house.</li>
            <li> There is nothing wrong with this item except for the description.  If you want a real mirror that looks great- buy this item.  However, this item is listed as &amp;#34;reflective acrylic.&amp;#34; It&#x27;s NOT acrylic-it&#x27;s REAL GLASS that can break easily.  I thought I was purchasing a safe mirror that will be used by children, and this mirror, if dropped or if it is on the inside of a locker that is slammed, will break.  Other than the product description, it appears to be a well made product.</li>
            <li> I got it for my daughter (she started 6th grade) and she loves it. It is well made and stays put on her locker door.</li>
            <li> This mirror is exactly what I was looking for.  The size is perfect, and the magnets are strong enough that the mirror stays where I put it.</li>
            <li> the edges are sharp, the magnet is weak and it doesn&#x27;t hold.&lt;br /&gt;this thing ended up dropping 1 foot from my metal cubical wall to my wooden desk and cracked.&lt;br /&gt;Its like someone just cut the glass and glued some cheap magnets to it&#x27;s back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend.</li>
            <li> The item arrived chipped and scratched, with gouges on two sides.  Although the packaging was intact, it was creased and worn.  The plastic holding the mirror to the card was crooked and looked like it had been re-glued to the cardboard.  If I had seen this on a store shelf, I never would have bought it.  It&#x27;s not even worth my time to return.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine a version in good shape would be adequate.</li>
            <li> Shipping was fast, and packaging was appropriate.  It has two strong Magnetic Strips on the back, which keep this mirror on my refrigerator door, perfectly.  It does NOT slide down the door, and I open it frequently.  There is no distortion, my image appears clear as day, even looks real, although the description states  otherwise.  This mirror is thin, so does not stick out and get hung-up on my sleeve, which I like. The only thing I can complain about, is the Postage fee of $4.99, is more than the actual postage fee of $2.24, that it took to mail it to me, which included being oversized.  Even if I figure in the cost of the bubble envelope, the postage charged to me,  still did NOT reflect the actual postage cost.  So I will give this a 4 Star, due to the postage overcharge.  AND, I will NOT being two more, like I had plan.  I wanted to see if the image was clear, before I order more.  I really love this small mirror, but refuse to pay double postage, each time I order.  Sellers need to invest in a Postage Scale, so these high shipping fees, can be reduce to actual cost.  I would rather pay more for the item, as long as the Postage reflects the actual cost of shipping and supplies.</li>
            <li> Its a real mirror not a film or anything. Packaging is a little sloppy and dirty, mirror came with small scratches and chips.</li>
            <li> just an ok cheap little mirror, handy to have around, stick on the fridge or locker or anywhere you want to have a quick look</li>
            <li> This mirror is pretty tiny but perfect for my wall locker here overseas, since I have such a small space. Love it!</li>
            <li> magnet hold isn&#x27;t superior, but i&#x27;ve got to say after it&#x27;s fallen off a few times it has held up and i&#x27;m impressed.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for</li>
            <li> Biggest waste of money since trash bags. I buy trash bags just to throw away, and thats exactly what I ended up doing with the cheap item. Magnet hardly worked. I barely touched it and it would fall. Chipping off little pieces of the glass. Very sharp of course. I have never had such an unimportant device irritate me so much. So I finally just threw it away.</li>
            <li> Save your money and look for a product like this in a local discount store.</li>
            <li> It was not damaged during postage transit or transit to my deployment.  It is a durable mirror; great for use.</li>
            <li> Does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Perfect for my needs.</li>
            <li> nice clean mirror, no frills. Magnets work well</li>
            <li> This mirror is made of glass, not acrylic and the edges are sharp and not &amp;#34;safe for little hands&amp;#34; as the product description says. I will put tape around the edges and let my daughter use in her locker since she is a teen, but this product is definitely not what I expected based on the product description.</li>
            <li> Exactly what I was looking for. Works great and would recommend.</li>
            <li> Small but perfect for my daughters locker</li>
            <li> This small mirror is a nice addition to a teen&#x27;s school locker.  I gave this to a niece who is always worried about her hair.  Her only concern was that it could have been bigger.</li>
            <li> Great for what it&#x27;s worth! It does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do! Small mirror great reflection. I love it</li>
            <li> I needed a magnetic mirror for my tack room door of my horse trailer and was having trouble finding one.  This one works well, but is smaller than I thought it was going to be.</li>
            <li> As always this item arrived on time and was well packaged from Amazon. However, the mirror had several small chips along the edge of the glass - not a big deal since it&#x27;s being used in a garage. However, my plan was to mount this to a steel cabinet using the magnets glued to the back of the glass. These magnets are a joke, they couldn&#x27;t even support the weight of the mirror, without sliding down the cabinet door.</li>
            <li> The magnetic did not hold &amp; fell off my sons locker and broke the very first day, I would not recommend this!</li>
            <li> Junk &amp; poor packaging for shipping.</li>
            <li> This mirror is perfect size and such great quality for the price.  Its real glass...and this is my second one since I broke the first (my fault).  If you are looking for a nice mirror that is not overly big and fits great in your and...get this.</li>
            <li> i thoug ht it would be bigger but i guess thats my fault , got my moneys worth thought thxx</li>
            <li> Bought this for my son&#x27;s locker. He said it is just perfect. Magnet on the back is real strong. Shouldn&#x27;t fall off.</li>
            <li> This mirror was what I expected. It&#x27;s a simple mirror that does the job and it was a cheap price. It works.</li>
            <li> The magnet is underpowered - mirror fell from the locker door and broke almost immediately</li>
            <li> In a locker this would really work well.  It&#x27;s  a great mirror, but difficult to hang where there is no easy way to hang it on a non-metal wall.</li>
            <li> I wanted a no frills locker mirror with no silly frame. Mirror appears to be made of real glass -- so no distortion even when viewed from a distance. Corners are nicely rounded for safety. The two magnetics located on the back of the mirror are very wide and provide a strong attachment.  It was worth paying the price of shipping.</li>
            <li> Great addition to my work locker. The mirro is big enough for me to get the job done and fulfill my needs. It has a good magnet that keeps it posted  exactly where I place it.&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for an inexpensive yet good quality locker mirror then this is the product for you.</li>
            <li> I needed some mirrors at work to do my makeup. These were the perfect size. Shipped fast and were not broken. They have square magnets stuck to the back of them though. I thought the entire back of the mirror would be magnetic</li>
            <li> There is nothing fancy about these mirrors, but they serve their purpose as designed to be a locker mirror.</li>
