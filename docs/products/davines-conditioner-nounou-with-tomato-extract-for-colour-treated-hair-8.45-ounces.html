            <li>I want to continue growing it out but felt that if I did so, I would need a better conditioner.  </li>
            <li>Love this product.</li>
            <li>Love this product because it helps with breakage and texture.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t let the conditioner sit for more than a minute</li>
            <li>I LOVE this line.  </li>
            <li>I have used NouNou Illuminating for a couple of years and love what I have achieved with this product.</li>
            <li>I still love the oil, but my hair does better if I skip the Moroccan Oil conditioner and use the Davines conditioner followed by the M Oil after blow drying.</li>
            <li>I love the smell the containers are reusable biodegradable.</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li>My curly/frizzy hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li>In 4 days, my beautiful new color was GONE.</li>
            <li>It goes on like whipped cream and rinses out clean, too!  </li>
            <li>it smells CLEAN!  </li>
            <li>Its easy to use.</li>
            <li>It is very good for my hair, increases ability to style it , and the product lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li>HOWEVER the 2 stars are given because the jar was about 2/3 to at most 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>I am very sensitive to musky or flowery scents) and it does feel good</li>
            <li>I was getting ready to just chop off my almost waist-length hair because I was so fed up with the snarls and yanking my own hair out when trying to comb it.</li>
            <li>You hair will look fabulous and it will smell divine.</li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t have time to always stop there to restock, so this site is always my backup in finding my products and free shipping and returns.</li>
            <li>Hair is much more healthy and shiny and the product ingredients are gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li>and this is the first conditioner that has made my hair look smooth and healthy all over.</li>
            <li>I am glad I was able to get the same top quality product through the mail.</li>
            <li>I originally bought this conditioner from my hair salon based on my stylist&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li>For those who say the product isn&#x27;t filled up all the way - that isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li>It smells great and you will notice significant different on the first use!</li>
            <li>Great for over processed dry hair.  </li>
            <li>I usually do not think of products for color treated hair to be this amazing.</li>
            <li>Your hair immediately calms down, and it smells so good!  </li>
            <li>A curly, color dyed head is very particular :-)</li>
            <li>received container 2/3 full-should have known if i looked at photo;nothing special for price, used twice</li>
            <li>While this conditioner nourishes my hair and makes it super soft, it never weigh my hair down which is awesome because I have super fine hair that can easily lose its volume and lays</li>
            <li>this conditioner is amazing - leaves your hair soft, shiny, and without buildup.</li>
            <li>the jar was full.</li>
            <li>I love the whole line of products.  </li>
            <li>My absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li>The price was much better and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad by any means</li>
            <li>These conditioners are very rich and are helping my hair feel much &amp;#34;younger.&amp;#34; :&amp;#62;</li>
            <li>The conditioner works wonderful on my fine, thin hair...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been trying various shampoos and conditioners throughout the years, and most have been okay.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner completely transformed the texture of my hair to smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li>If you have never tried the shampoo, conditioner and oil, you are missing out on some beautiful results.  </li>
            <li>But as a First time customer I immediately felt the difference and how soft my hair was, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li>They leave my color-treated hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li>I have healthy hair again like when I was 10 yrs old -</li>
            <li>I love this conditioner and found it to make my hair deliciously soft.</li>
            <li>The smell seems more \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; to me than I prefer.</li>
            <li>Of course it takes time for your hair to improve but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>It really is worth the money.</li>
            <li>Worth every cent.</li>
            <li>Worth it and</li>
            <li>It is pricey but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li>it looks thicker and stays soft and smooth with no fly-aways!  </li>
            <li>It is worth the money</li>
            <li>Been using it for 3 weeks now and would highly recommend for people with highlights and fine hair.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m going to out myself right now: I dye my hair, and have been doing it for years.  </li>
            <li>He was right.  </li>
            <li>I have fine hair with some loose waves on top layers.</li>
            <li>I found that the curl enhancing conditioner from Davine&#x27;s works just as well - if not better - and has a pleasant, sweet, citrusy scent.</li>
            <li>Mother Nature gave me dishwater blonde hair, which was obviously a mistake, since my skin is much more suited to a nice auburn.      </li>
            <li>The price is reasonable,  larger sizes are available thank you !!</li>
            <li>My hair smells wonderful and I only need a little bit to work into my hair.  </li>
            <li>I whole-heartedly recommend this to any guy who wants soft, healthy hair.</li>
            <li>Even better, it helps keep my red from fading.  </li>
            <li>Davines, please go back to the screw top containers.</li>
            <li>It  allows the color to last longer and your hair stays healthy.  </li>
            <li>LOVE this stuff after discovering at my local salon.</li>
            <li>I use it as a leave in conditioner and it leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li>;-)</li>
            <li>This is the real deal!  </li>
            <li>This company really knows have to save hair!  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not bad, just strong and masculine - like Old Spice.</li>
            <li>(Just a quick note that I don&#x27;t need to use more of its matching shampoo, but the conditioner really goes a long way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My hair was brittle after going blonde (professionally in a salon) and this helped keep it from breaking off more!</li>
            <li>Davines products are high quality and really work!!</li>
            <li>This conditioner leaves my hair feeling full, soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li>many of you, I have tried many other (expensive, cheap, professional, natural, you name it) brands, but this is the best conditioner I have had so far.</li>
            <li>I wish I could find a body gel with the same, clean fragrance!  </li>
            <li>it uses up pretty fast.</li>
            <li>So if you&#x27;re going to take a chance on a salon conditioner, let this be it - the tub is going to work better and last longer than buying several bottles of cheap</li>
            <li>Full, shiny, and buttery soft- even without any styling products.</li>
            <li>and they both provide amazing softness without feeling weighted down.</li>
            <li>I expected a little more from all the wonderful reviews, but found that this works as any other conditioner.</li>
            <li>so I can save a few $ from the salon which charges so much more!</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m what colorists call a \\&quot;high maintenance blonde\\&quot;---I color every 6-8 weeks (and blow dry 2x a week) and the Davines nou nou line has been the only to extend the life of my highlights and successfully soften my strands.</li>
            <li>Great product for making your color last longer, as well as conditioning your hair without leaving it limp.  </li>
            <li>I find my highlights last so much longer when I use this stuff versus the cheap stuff</li>
            <li>A real plus is that the products don&#x27;t strip color.</li>
            <li>this one conditioned maybe even too much.</li>
            <li>Really keeps the tangles out.</li>
            <li>I really struggle with keeping my hair moisturized for some reason.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend!</li>
            <li>You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li>I was a longtime user of Wen, but I never found it did much for my hair aside from keeping my haircolor intact.</li>
            <li>I really like it.  </li>
            <li>Really like this.</li>
            <li>Could this stuff be a knock off as opposed to the real thing?</li>
            <li>DO NOT THINK IT REALLY</li>
            <li>Highly recommend!</li>
            <li>Conditions my super fine hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>Works great for dry, color-treated, black (as in Afro-textured) hair.</li>
            <li>: I use this with the Nounou Nourishing Shampoo for color-treated hair, which makes my hair overall very lightweight and clean.</li>
            <li>It has this earthy, lovely smell that other conditioner tou might call too muddy.  </li>
            <li>other thing I love about this product</li>
            <li>I prefer other brands better, I still felt as though my ends weren&#x27;t moisturized, even after leaving it in for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Now I have healthy, soft, silky hair, which is hard to get when you have fine hair that is color-treated.</li>
            <li>The price is much too high.</li>
            <li>Secondly, the product was 3/4 full.</li>
            <li>I have lots of fairly fine chin-length hair and live in very humid summers and very dry winters.  </li>
            <li>The conditioner has always come in a round container and smells lovely not to mention that my long hair is always fabulous condition.  </li>
            <li>This conditioner is nice, but pretty heavy, and I&#x27;ll just use it for deep conditioning days.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this for anyone who colors their hair and wants silky, soft hair!</li>
            <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>little bit of this creamy magic does wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li>So even though a few days have passed since I used it, my hair still smells fresh and clean, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li>I usually use pretty high end product to keep that glossy healthy look, despite frequent coloring and highlights.  </li>
            <li>Don&#x27;t waste your money - Pantene from the drug store works much better.</li>
            <li>My hair is very fine, straight and thick.</li>
            <li>I have tried many other brands but always come back to Davines because my hear is so much healthier when I use it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is kind of an slippery product, so you may want to be careful for the first few times until you master it</li>
            <li>but I do live in a sunshine state</li>
            <li>but something new is the square container.  </li>
            <li>Is this new  from Davines or do you know?  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners of all price points and this brand beats them all hands down!!</li>
            <li>Wow!  </li>
            <li>Soft shiny hair!</li>
            <li>I left the conditioner on for 10 minutes for the first week and what a difference.</li>
            <li>I have thick fine straight hair.</li>
            <li>to the point that it was too soft and flyaway looking.</li>
            <li>This is the ONLY conditioner I&#x27;ve found that really makes a difference.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t even mind the masculine smell.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re concerned about ingredients, it&#x27;s all natural without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Supple, shiny, soft, hair with</li>
            <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li>Gives my hair body, shine and is so soft.  </li>
            <li>but if it is not the real thing I want my money back!  </li>
            <li>It smells like an old man&#x27;s aftershave.  </li>
            <li>I seriously doubt that I was given the 8.45 ounces promised and in that way this is probably NOT such a good deal financially.</li>
            <li>but this was between half and 3/4 full of conditioner and not what I am used to getting in the store.  </li>
            <li>I would highly recommend all the Davines products, they are a terrific brand and produce a high-quality product.</li>
            <li>This conditioner does absolute wonders for dry hair that has been color treated.</li>
            <li>My 36 year old head of hair, which is constantly colored to hide my grays, is lush and silky.</li>
            <li>Super shiny results that did not weigh my hair down at all - it brought it back to life.  </li>
            <li>I can barely stand it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>Worth noting that it has a very heavy fragrance which would bother someone who is sensitive to that,</li>
            <li>By not having to wash my hair so much, I don&#x27;t have to blow dry and flat iron it.</li>
            <li>It leaves my long hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li>The container is smaller than ones I have purchased in the past, and it&#x27;s only about 2/3 full.</li>
            <li>The product works very well and for me, in less than the 5 minutes advised.  </li>
            <li>My hair was getting so dry and damaged and this product has turned that completely around.</li>
            <li>The shampoo gave me an itchy and dry scalp, but the conditioner does make hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li>Since moving to Florida it has been difficult finding a really good conditioner that leaves my hair feeling silky and smoothe without weighing it down.</li>
            <li>I have short, fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li>and I use it in small amounts, in a squirt bottle for a quick fix if my hair feels dry (here in the desert).</li>

            <li> I LOVE this line.  </li>
            <li> I have used NouNou Illuminating for a couple of years and love what I have achieved with this product.</li>
            <li> I still love the oil, but my hair does better if I skip the Moroccan Oil conditioner and use the Davines conditioner followed by the M Oil after blow drying.</li>
            <li> I love the smell the containers are reusable biodegradable.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  </li>
            <li> My curly/frizzy hair has never looked better.</li>
            <li> In 4 days, my beautiful new color was GONE.</li>
            <li> It goes on like whipped cream and rinses out clean, too!  </li>

            <li> It is very good for my hair, increases ability to style it , and the product lasts a long time.  </li>
            <li> HOWEVER the 2 stars are given because the jar was about 2/3 to at most 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> I am very sensitive to musky or flowery scents) and it does feel good</li>
            <li> I was getting ready to just chop off my almost waist-length hair because I was so fed up with the snarls and yanking my own hair out when trying to comb it.</li>
            <li> You hair will look fabulous and it will smell divine.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t have time to always stop there to restock, so this site is always my backup in finding my products and free shipping and returns.</li>
            <li> Hair is much more healthy and shiny and the product ingredients are gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> and this is the first conditioner that has made my hair look smooth and healthy all over.</li>
            <li> I am glad I was able to get the same top quality product through the mail.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this conditioner from my hair salon based on my stylist&#x27;s recommendation.</li>
            <li> For those who say the product isn&#x27;t filled up all the way - that isn&#x27;t true.</li>
            <li> It smells great and you will notice significant different on the first use!</li>
            <li> Great for over processed dry hair.  </li>
            <li> I usually do not think of products for color treated hair to be this amazing.</li>
            <li> Your hair immediately calms down, and it smells so good!  </li>
            <li> A curly, color dyed head is very particular :-)</li>
            <li> received container 2/3 full-should have known if i looked at photo;nothing special for price, used twice</li>
            <li> While this conditioner nourishes my hair and makes it super soft, it never weigh my hair down which is awesome because I have super fine hair that can easily lose its volume and lays</li>
            <li> this conditioner is amazing - leaves your hair soft, shiny, and without buildup.</li>
            <li> the jar was full.</li>
            <li> I love the whole line of products.  </li>
            <li> My absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner.</li>
            <li> The price was much better and fast delivery.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad by any means</li>
            <li> These conditioners are very rich and are helping my hair feel much &amp;#34;younger.&amp;#34; :&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> The conditioner works wonderful on my fine, thin hair...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been trying various shampoos and conditioners throughout the years, and most have been okay.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner completely transformed the texture of my hair to smooth and healthy.</li>
            <li> If you have never tried the shampoo, conditioner and oil, you are missing out on some beautiful results.  </li>
            <li> But as a First time customer I immediately felt the difference and how soft my hair was, the smell is amazing.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s worth the money.</li>
            <li> They leave my color-treated hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking.</li>
            <li> I have healthy hair again like when I was 10 yrs old -</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and found it to make my hair deliciously soft.</li>
            <li> The smell seems more \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; to me than I prefer.</li>
            <li> Of course it takes time for your hair to improve but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> It really is worth the money.</li>
            <li> Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> Worth it and</li>
            <li> It is pricey but worth every penny.  </li>
            <li> it looks thicker and stays soft and smooth with no fly-aways!  </li>
            <li> It is worth the money</li>
            <li> Been using it for 3 weeks now and would highly recommend for people with highlights and fine hair.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to out myself right now: I dye my hair, and have been doing it for years.  </li>
            <li> He was right.  </li>
            <li> I have fine hair with some loose waves on top layers.</li>
            <li> I found that the curl enhancing conditioner from Davine&#x27;s works just as well - if not better - and has a pleasant, sweet, citrusy scent.</li>
            <li> Mother Nature gave me dishwater blonde hair, which was obviously a mistake, since my skin is much more suited to a nice auburn.      </li>
            <li> The price is reasonable,  larger sizes are available thank you !!</li>
            <li> My hair smells wonderful and I only need a little bit to work into my hair.  </li>
            <li> I whole-heartedly recommend this to any guy who wants soft, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> Even better, it helps keep my red from fading.  </li>
            <li> Davines, please go back to the screw top containers.</li>
            <li> It  allows the color to last longer and your hair stays healthy.  </li>
            <li> LOVE this stuff after discovering at my local salon.</li>
            <li> I use it as a leave in conditioner and it leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> ;-)</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!  </li>
            <li> This company really knows have to save hair!  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not bad, just strong and masculine - like Old Spice.</li>
            <li> (Just a quick note that I don&#x27;t need to use more of its matching shampoo, but the conditioner really goes a long way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My hair was brittle after going blonde (professionally in a salon) and this helped keep it from breaking off more!</li>
            <li> Davines products are high quality and really work!!</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair feeling full, soft and pretty.  </li>
            <li> many of you, I have tried many other (expensive, cheap, professional, natural, you name it) brands, but this is the best conditioner I have had so far.</li>
            <li> I wish I could find a body gel with the same, clean fragrance!  </li>
            <li> it uses up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> So if you&#x27;re going to take a chance on a salon conditioner, let this be it - the tub is going to work better and last longer than buying several bottles of cheap</li>
            <li> Full, shiny, and buttery soft- even without any styling products.</li>
            <li> and they both provide amazing softness without feeling weighted down.</li>
            <li> I expected a little more from all the wonderful reviews, but found that this works as any other conditioner.</li>
            <li> so I can save a few $ from the salon which charges so much more!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m what colorists call a \\&quot;high maintenance blonde\\&quot;---I color every 6-8 weeks (and blow dry 2x a week) and the Davines nou nou line has been the only to extend the life of my highlights and successfully soften my strands.</li>
            <li> Great product for making your color last longer, as well as conditioning your hair without leaving it limp.  </li>
            <li> I find my highlights last so much longer when I use this stuff versus the cheap stuff</li>
            <li> A real plus is that the products don&#x27;t strip color.</li>
            <li> this one conditioned maybe even too much.</li>
            <li> Really keeps the tangles out.</li>
            <li> I really struggle with keeping my hair moisturized for some reason.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need much.</li>
            <li> I was a longtime user of Wen, but I never found it did much for my hair aside from keeping my haircolor intact.</li>
            <li> I really like it.  </li>
            <li> Really like this.</li>
            <li> Could this stuff be a knock off as opposed to the real thing?</li>
            <li> DO NOT THINK IT REALLY</li>
            <li> Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> Conditions my super fine hair without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> Works great for dry, color-treated, black (as in Afro-textured) hair.</li>
            <li> : I use this with the Nounou Nourishing Shampoo for color-treated hair, which makes my hair overall very lightweight and clean.</li>
            <li> It has this earthy, lovely smell that other conditioner tou might call too muddy.  </li>
            <li> other thing I love about this product</li>
            <li> I prefer other brands better, I still felt as though my ends weren&#x27;t moisturized, even after leaving it in for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Now I have healthy, soft, silky hair, which is hard to get when you have fine hair that is color-treated.</li>
            <li> The price is much too high.</li>
            <li> Secondly, the product was 3/4 full.</li>
            <li> I have lots of fairly fine chin-length hair and live in very humid summers and very dry winters.  </li>
            <li> The conditioner has always come in a round container and smells lovely not to mention that my long hair is always fabulous condition.  </li>
            <li> This conditioner is nice, but pretty heavy, and I&#x27;ll just use it for deep conditioning days.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this for anyone who colors their hair and wants silky, soft hair!</li>
            <li> I highly recommend it.</li>
            <li> I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> little bit of this creamy magic does wonders on my hair.</li>
            <li> So even though a few days have passed since I used it, my hair still smells fresh and clean, but not overpowering.</li>
            <li> I usually use pretty high end product to keep that glossy healthy look, despite frequent coloring and highlights.  </li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - Pantene from the drug store works much better.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, straight and thick.</li>
            <li> I have tried many other brands but always come back to Davines because my hear is so much healthier when I use it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is kind of an slippery product, so you may want to be careful for the first few times until you master it</li>
            <li> but I do live in a sunshine state</li>
            <li> but something new is the square container.  </li>
            <li> Is this new  from Davines or do you know?  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners of all price points and this brand beats them all hands down!!</li>
            <li> Wow!  </li>
            <li> Soft shiny hair!</li>
            <li> I left the conditioner on for 10 minutes for the first week and what a difference.</li>
            <li> I have thick fine straight hair.</li>
            <li> to the point that it was too soft and flyaway looking.</li>
            <li> This is the ONLY conditioner I&#x27;ve found that really makes a difference.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t even mind the masculine smell.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re concerned about ingredients, it&#x27;s all natural without all the chemicals.</li>
            <li> Supple, shiny, soft, hair with</li>
            <li> I have naturally curly hair</li>
            <li> Gives my hair body, shine and is so soft.  </li>
            <li> but if it is not the real thing I want my money back!  </li>
            <li> It smells like an old man&#x27;s aftershave.  </li>
            <li> I seriously doubt that I was given the 8.45 ounces promised and in that way this is probably NOT such a good deal financially.</li>
            <li> but this was between half and 3/4 full of conditioner and not what I am used to getting in the store.  </li>
            <li> I would highly recommend all the Davines products, they are a terrific brand and produce a high-quality product.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does absolute wonders for dry hair that has been color treated.</li>
            <li> My 36 year old head of hair, which is constantly colored to hide my grays, is lush and silky.</li>
            <li> Super shiny results that did not weigh my hair down at all - it brought it back to life.  </li>
            <li> I can barely stand it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Worth noting that it has a very heavy fragrance which would bother someone who is sensitive to that,</li>
            <li> By not having to wash my hair so much, I don&#x27;t have to blow dry and flat iron it.</li>
            <li> It leaves my long hair so soft and silky.</li>
            <li> The container is smaller than ones I have purchased in the past, and it&#x27;s only about 2/3 full.</li>
            <li> The product works very well and for me, in less than the 5 minutes advised.  </li>
            <li> My hair was getting so dry and damaged and this product has turned that completely around.</li>
            <li> The shampoo gave me an itchy and dry scalp, but the conditioner does make hair shiny and soft.</li>
            <li> Since moving to Florida it has been difficult finding a really good conditioner that leaves my hair feeling silky and smoothe without weighing it down.</li>
            <li> I have short, fine, thin hair.</li>
            <li> and I use it in small amounts, in a squirt bottle for a quick fix if my hair feels dry (here in the desert).</li>
            <li> Thankfully, the smell fades and is pretty imperceptible by the time I dry my hair, so I&#x27;m not left smelling like a bowl of potpourri all day.  </li>
            <li> Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for, &amp; with long hair, you need to take extra care!!  </li>
            <li> It did take a few weeks for my hair to get used to this new combo</li>
            <li> I learned this after the first day, when I used a lot and let it sit for a couple minutes like with usual conditioners (and like the instructions said) - the result was the bottom of my hair was so moisturized that it looked wet and greasy all day.</li>
            <li> When my hair is dry and over processed, I leave it on just a little longer and instant soft &amp; shiny</li>
            <li> I will be going back to the other conditioner next time around.</li>
            <li> was on the shelf too long.</li>
            <li> My hair always comes out soft and shiny, and i don&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s buildup where I need to switch conditioners every few months.</li>
            <li> I would crawl on my hands and knees for long distances to get this.  </li>
            <li> Thirdly, the shampoo and conditioner did not volumize, or give shine to my hair as I expected.  </li>
            <li> When I had long hair, I used to section my hair and then rubbing each section between my palms going toward</li>
            <li> You only need a little to last a long way.</li>
            <li> I opened it up and the smell is totally different then all the other nounou conditioners by Davines.  </li>
            <li> Does nothing for my color treated somewhat dry hair.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting crispy and dry like straw.  </li>
            <li> For anyone with dry hair or over processed hair.</li>
            <li> I have really dry hair that I color</li>
            <li> It lasts a long time as you only need to use a little each time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to try the shampoos from this line now.</li>
            <li> It is a testament to how much I love the shampoo/conditioner combo that I&#x27;m willing to give it 4 stars and stick with it even though it&#x27;s gone through a terrible fragrance puberty of some</li>
            <li> My hair is very dry</li>
            <li> MY HAIR IS STILL VERY DRY AFTER USING YOUR PRODUCT.</li>
            <li> You only need a little bit and it goes along way.  </li>
            <li> However, now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve already switched to a different shampoo/conditioner set.</li>
            <li> Yes, it is a bit expensive but totally worth the splurge.</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair which I subject to bayalage about every 3 months, and it&#x27;s prone to dryness and split ends.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s a little odd because I can&#x27;t find a spot in my shower where I can dip my fingers in it, but I definitely recommend it.  </li>
            <li> The new containers are difficult to open, close and DO NOT TRAVEL well.  </li>
            <li> The look of the actual product looks the same but the smell is not pleasant.  </li>
            <li> It lasts forever because you only need a small amount</li>
            <li> I know other reviewers warned me, but I don&#x27;t care, I just dump out the excess water at the end of my shower.</li>
            <li> I have purchased it in the past from Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salon.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not a big complaint, and certainly not something that I&#x27;d lower the rating for (well, maybe from 5 stars to 4.998 stars), but I do wish that the manufacturer would do something about that.</li>
            <li> My only complaint about the conditioner is about the package.  </li>
            <li> My only complaint is Davines changed the container for conditioners about 6 months ago.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is this product, the shampoo, or my vitamins, but suddenly my normal/thick hair feels thick and luscious-- way thicker than when I started using it.  </li>
            <li> Better than drugstore crap..</li>
            <li> It shines and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Slight downside--</li>
            <li> To me, it&#x27;s subtle, but constant.</li>
            <li> When I buy the product from my salon, the container is not completely full</li>
            <li> This conditioner is thick so just a dab does the job--even for long hair.</li>
            <li> Any other shampoo and conditioner would make me wash my hair every other day at the least.</li>
            <li> However, like other reviewers, I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell.</li>
            <li> I have used Davines products for a little over 2 yrs now.</li>
            <li> This product has a paste-like texture and a little of it goes a loooong way.</li>
            <li> I normally have horrible tangles after washing my hair, but with this stuff any brush or comb slides right through.</li>
            <li> but I think it is a little heavy for my hair.  </li>
            <li> The ends are smoothed but the hair does not go limp.</li>
            <li> , I have tried several shampoos and Conditioners but it would make my hair worse.</li>
            <li> switch between Nounou and Melu conditioner every few months.</li>
            <li> Over the years my hair has become dull and frizzy due to coloring, blow drying etc.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the lid was totally cracked and the product leaked all over the other items in my order.</li>
            <li> I have fairly thick wavy hair and it does not weigh it down</li>
            <li> I just have to use a little bit of the conditioner on my thick hair.  </li>
            <li> will probably stick to my usual</li>
            <li> Every morning, I have to pour out the old cold water from yesterday&#x27;s shower.  </li>
            <li> I gave the tub to my husband after using it once, so at least it&#x27;s not going to waste.</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner, (which was not cheap!), my hair was frizzy and unruly with no shine.</li>
            <li> The product may seem expensive but I have used it for 11 months and am just finishing my second purchase.  </li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t so expensive I would use this daily.</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t usually order through Amazon as I can get it from my stylist, but this time I needed to save time and ordered online.  </li>
            <li> Not sure I&#x27;ll be ordering it online again.</li>
            <li> Personally, I have a difficult time getting the lid off.</li>
            <li> Ugh, like an old lady and I&#x27;m no spring chicken.</li>
            <li> Not sure I like the container, though...</li>
            <li> Not sure if it prolongs my color job though</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner for years and then tried less expensive products for a few years to save money</li>
            <li> My hair isn&#x27;t hard to comb out when I get out of the shower after I use this product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used other expensive brands like Kerastase in the past but nothing even comes close to this.</li>
            <li> Made in Italy and hard to find except on Amazon.</li>
            <li> Seriously, unless you like the smell of rotten tomatoes, save your money.</li>
            <li> Still, it was too expensive for too little product-</li>
            <li> This one is not good.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s particularly frustrating considering the price.  </li>
            <li> I adore this conditioner and will remain faithful to it, but the new fragrance is TERRIBLE.</li>
            <li> The subtle buttery scent has been replaced by a weird artificial floral  one.</li>
            <li> /&gt;And while I&#x27;m at it, the label rebrand is unfortunate.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, I read several reviews on this product which commented on the smell as being \\&quot;pleasant\\&quot;; I found it absolutely disgusting.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical about the &amp;#34;tomato extract&amp;#34; ingredient, but no worries:  </li>
            <li> (I was afraid I would hate it due to the reviews bc</li>
            <li> Do it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> The smell isn&#x27;t bad either :</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad tub or what,</li>
            <li> I am extremely disappointed.  </li>
            <li> HATE</li>
            <li> IT HATE</li>
            <li> IT HATE IT.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed.</li>
            <li> Worst part is the smell.</li>
            <li> After I use the shampoo which strips my hair something awful (won&#x27;t use again)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I will never use a different conditioner. The smell makes me so happy and the results are amazing. I just wish it was in retail&lt;br /&gt;stores like I found it in California at a Target..</li>
            <li> I have long wavy hair which I subject to bayalage about every 3 months, and it&#x27;s prone to dryness and split ends. I adore this conditioner and will remain faithful to it, but the new fragrance is TERRIBLE. The subtle buttery scent has been replaced by a weird artificial floral  one. Thankfully, the smell fades and is pretty imperceptible by the time I dry my hair, so I&#x27;m not left smelling like a bowl of potpourri all day.  It is a testament to how much I love the shampoo/conditioner combo that I&#x27;m willing to give it 4 stars and stick with it even though it&#x27;s gone through a terrible fragrance puberty of some sort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while I&#x27;m at it, the label rebrand is unfortunate. Bring back the sans serif font.</li>
            <li> I can&#x27;t believe how great this product is. A bit pricey but it&#x27;s worth the money. My hair never looked this good before and believe me, I have tried A LOT of products out there.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m sorry, I read several reviews on this product which commented on the smell as being \\&quot;pleasant\\&quot;; I found it absolutely disgusting. I had to wash my hair 2 more times to get the smell of it out. It reminded me of rancid tomato sauce from a can. Seriously, unless you like the smell of rotten tomatoes, save your money.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple of years along with the NouNou shampoo and they&#x27;re amazing. They leave my color-treated hair soft, shiny, and healthy looking. A real plus is that the products don&#x27;t strip color. Davines products are high quality and really work!!</li>
            <li> i have VERY highlighted hair so i was looking for a great conditioner... this one conditioned maybe even too much. to the point that it was too soft and flyaway looking. will probably stick to my usual conditioner-- redken&#x27;s \\&quot;extreme\\&quot;. (but if you already like this product, the seller shipped it perfectly!)</li>
            <li> I adore this conditioner - I have healthy hair again like when I was 10 yrs old - and not my 40 something overprocessed mop.  I usually use pretty high end product to keep that glossy healthy look, despite frequent coloring and highlights.  I received Davines as a gift.  I had never heard of it before.  The product works very well and for me, in less than the 5 minutes advised.  Super shiny results that did not weigh my hair down at all - it brought it back to life.  Worth noting that it has a very heavy fragrance which would bother someone who is sensitive to that, but I find it very pleasant and luxurious.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner!  It smells wonderful and leaves my hair looking healthy.  Definitely give this product a try.</li>
            <li> AMAZING softness for bleached hair, makes it feel like it was never dyed. I&#x27;m able to use it once a week and still get excellent results, very effective.</li>
            <li> This conditioner leaves my hair feeling full, soft and pretty.  I use it with the Davines NouNou shampoo. Works on color treated hair.</li>
            <li> I just received the container. I have bought this in the hair salons before and davines is a good product and this would seem like a good price. HOWEVER the 2 stars are given because the jar was about 2/3 to at most 3/4 full. I seriously doubt that I was given the 8.45 ounces promised and in that way this is probably NOT such a good deal financially. When i bought this in the hair salon the jar was full. I don&#x27;t like to be taken advantage of.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m going to out myself right now: I dye my hair, and have been doing it for years.  Mother Nature gave me dishwater blonde hair, which was obviously a mistake, since my skin is much more suited to a nice auburn.      I&#x27;ve been trying various shampoos and conditioners throughout the years, and most have been okay.  When my salon started carrying this, my colourist recommended it to me.  He&#x27;s never recommended a product for me before, but he said that I&#x27;d love this.  He was right.  This conditioner and its matching shampoo ([[ASIN:B000TKH6CG Davines Nourishing Illuminating Shampoo]]) are perfect for my hair.  They leave my hair feeling great and easy to manage.  Even better, it helps keep my red from fading.  I just have to use a little bit of the conditioner on my thick hair.  When my salon stopped carrying this, my colourist gave me the address of another nearby salon where he knew they had it.  Then I discovered that I could buy it here, and for a much better price than the salon!    My only complaint about the conditioner is about the package.  The lid of the tub is concave, which means that water from the shower pools in it.  Every morning, I have to pour out the old cold water from yesterday&#x27;s shower.  It&#x27;s not a big complaint, and certainly not something that I&#x27;d lower the rating for (well, maybe from 5 stars to 4.998 stars), but I do wish that the manufacturer would do something about that.</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner and found it to make my hair deliciously soft. However, like other reviewers, I couldn&#x27;t get past the smell. It&#x27;s not bad, just strong and masculine - like Old Spice. Still, since scent is so subjective, I won&#x27;t take any stars from the product. I gave the tub to my husband after using it once, so at least it&#x27;s not going to waste. I whole-heartedly recommend this to any guy who wants soft, healthy hair. Ladies, it&#x27;s up to you. I found that the curl enhancing conditioner from Davine&#x27;s works just as well - if not better - and has a pleasant, sweet, citrusy scent.</li>
            <li> I have colored my hair for years to cover the gray and this conditioner along with the Nounou shampoo is amazing. My hair was getting so dry and damaged and this product has turned that completely around. My hair is now softer, shinier and more manageable without messing with the color.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used, by far.  I normally have horrible tangles after washing my hair, but with this stuff any brush or comb slides right through.</li>
            <li> Really keeps the tangles out.</li>
            <li> After using this conditioner, (which was not cheap!), my hair was frizzy and unruly with no shine. Don&#x27;t waste your money - Pantene from the drug store works much better.</li>
            <li> This conditioner does absolute wonders for dry hair that has been color treated. And the best thing is the smell. It is absolutely wonderful. Kind of like baby powder sweet! I am happy to find it at Amazon.com because I have paid much more for it at my hair salon.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I have ever used. I have lots of fairly fine chin-length hair and live in very humid summers and very dry winters.  My hair stylist recommended this and told me to by it from Amazon.  The trick for me is to use about a nickel sized amount and rinse all out except for 1/4 of it.  The product may seem expensive but I have used it for 11 months and am just finishing my second purchase.  I&#x27;d say it is an excellent value.</li>
            <li> Since moving to Florida it has been difficult finding a really good conditioner that leaves my hair feeling silky and smoothe without weighing it down. My hairdresser recommended Davine&#x27;s NouNou and I love it. Would recommend it to anyone in the 50 states..humidity or not!</li>
            <li> Davines Conditioner, NouNou is one of my favorite finds.  It is great for colored hair.  I have also used Davines Love Shampoo and Conditioner.  Great Products!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner,have long,fine,color treated hair,takes the tangles out no problem. The smell isn&#x27;t bad either :-)&lt;br /&gt;You may also want to order the shampoo.</li>
            <li> My fav! Smells wonderful</li>
            <li> I really struggle with keeping my hair moisturized for some reason. This is the ONLY conditioner I&#x27;ve found that really makes a difference. My hair just feels better, softer after I&#x27;ve used it! It&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
            <li> OMG Best hair conditioner ever! It smells great and you will notice significant different on the first use! Love it! Buying more for my mom:)</li>
            <li> This conditioner and the corresponding shampoo are a life saver! I was getting ready to just chop off my almost waist-length hair because I was so fed up with the snarls and yanking my own hair out when trying to comb it. Then my hair stylist told me about Davines and now I&#x27;ll never use anything else. Now I have healthy, soft, silky hair, which is hard to get when you have fine hair that is color-treated. I&#x27;ve tried many shampoos and conditioners of all price points and this brand beats them all hands down!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for years. I highly recommend it. I haven&#x27;t found a conditioner yet to rival it.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is the best ever for processed hair.  The ends are smoothed but the hair does not go limp. It lasts forever because you only need a small amount and I appreciate aroma.  I&#x27;m a convert!</li>
            <li> I encountered this at the home of a friend who&#x27;d been to a top level spa and discovered the wonderful quality of the product there. I am glad I was able to get the same top quality product through the mail. The results are amazing and I am very satisfied.</li>
            <li> Great product for making your color last longer, as well as conditioning your hair without leaving it limp.  I highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m what colorists call a \\&quot;high maintenance blonde\\&quot;---I color every 6-8 weeks (and blow dry 2x a week) and the Davines nou nou line has been the only to extend the life of my highlights and successfully soften my strands. This conditioner is thick so just a dab does the job--even for long hair. Excellent hydration. The scent is gorgeous as well. Must use for great, healthy hair.</li>
            <li> I have purchased this item for years, it is an excellent product and I will order it again. Both conditioner and shampoo.</li>
            <li> Love the scent of this conditioner...leaves my hair shiny...smelling great and very manageable,,.will purchase again...I have fairly thick wavy hair and it does not weigh it down</li>
            <li> Great help in frizzy days too</li>
            <li> I so love this.  It&#x27;s a little odd because I can&#x27;t find a spot in my shower where I can dip my fingers in it, but I definitely recommend it.  I don&#x27;t know if it is this product, the shampoo, or my vitamins, but suddenly my normal/thick hair feels thick and luscious-- way thicker than when I started using it.  It has this earthy, lovely smell that other conditioner tou might call too muddy.  But to me it smells muddy in the most delicious way.  Would definitely suggest it to anyone who would like volume.  Slight downside-- it uses up pretty fast.</li>
            <li> wonderful conditioner, makes every hair wash a spa experience</li>
            <li> I love Davines products and while the NouNou shampoo smells very nice, the conditioner smells like cheap shaving cream. I can barely stand it.&lt;br /&gt;I also don&#x27;t get the shine from this product like I do from OI. I know Davines has redone this line and possibly the conditioner I got was on the shelf too long.</li>
            <li> Good stuff, but I&#x27;m not a fan of the packaging. A pain to open up in the shower.</li>
            <li> Amazing conditioner.  Your hair immediately calms down, and it smells so good!  You only need a little to last a long way.</li>
            <li> This works the best on my hair - great smelling and manageable hair - can&#x27;t ask for much more.</li>
            <li> I bought this after trying a sample and loving it. However, now that I&#x27;ve had it for a few weeks, I&#x27;ve already switched to a different shampoo/conditioner set. This conditioner is nice, but pretty heavy, and I&#x27;ll just use it for deep conditioning days. The shampoo gave me an itchy and dry scalp, but the conditioner does make hair shiny and soft. The smell seems more \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; to me than I prefer.</li>
            <li> Came within two days. It&#x27;s a Great product. My hair loves it. A curly, color dyed head is very particular :-)</li>
            <li> My hair was brittle after going blonde (professionally in a salon) and this helped keep it from breaking off more!</li>
            <li> Great for over processed dry hair.  Definitely not an every day shampoo and conditioner.  More of a once or twice a week product.  Has a nice scent.  My only complaint is Davines changed the container for conditioners about 6 months ago.  The new containers are difficult to open, close and DO NOT TRAVEL well.  Davines, please go back to the screw top containers.</li>
            <li> If it weren&#x27;t so expensive I would use this daily. It smells great and I love the results. I like the packaging. Its easy to use. I get more complements when I use this product.</li>
            <li> Davines hair products are the only item that work with my hair.  I have tried many other brands but always come back to Davines because my hear is so much healthier when I use it.</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner, along with the shampoo, on a recommendation from my manicurist.  Her hair looked and felt amazing, so I thought I&#x27;d try it.  Well it did make my hair feel amazing and I was in love! However, after a few days I realized that my color was fading, fast.  I figured it was just my imagination and since I loved the way it worked, I kept using is.&lt;br /&gt;When I had my hair done again, 2 weeks later, I was hesitant to use the product. So I figured it must have been the shampoo, so I used just the conditioner.  In 4 days, my beautiful new color was GONE. I was back to my basic brown and all the red lowlights had disappeared.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what is in the conditioner, but it obviously doesn&#x27;t work with my color.  I will be showing my stylist the packaging and see if she can figure it out.  I am extremely disappointed.  I love the way this product makes my hair feel.  I don&#x27;t even mind the masculine smell.  I just can&#x27;t use a product that strips the color out of my hair, especially when it is sold for the purpose of being used on color treated hair.</li>
            <li> Love the product and have used this for years.  Don&#x27;t usually order through Amazon as I can get it from my stylist, but this time I needed to save time and ordered online.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad tub or what, but this was between half and 3/4 full of conditioner and not what I am used to getting in the store.  It&#x27;s particularly frustrating considering the price.  Not sure I&#x27;ll be ordering it online again.</li>
            <li> Yes it is pricey that&#x27;s why I kind of hesitated but I&#x27;m glad I purchased it. My hair is very dry and I started to lose a lot of it, I have tried several shampoos and Conditioners but it would make my hair worse. But as a First time customer I immediately felt the difference and how soft my hair was, the smell is amazing. Of course it takes time for your hair to improve but it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> This stuff is from the gods. It smells amazing, makes my hair super soft, and best of all, lasts me around 5 months. I have hair that goes about 5 inches below my shoulder. You don&#x27;t need much. I put it in my hair while i shower and rinse at the end. My hair always comes out soft and shiny, and i don&#x27;t feel like there&#x27;s buildup where I need to switch conditioners every few months. I&#x27;ve been using this for over a year now and plan to continue!</li>
            <li> If you have never tried the shampoo, conditioner and oil, you are missing out on some beautiful results.  I love the whole line of products.  You hair will look fabulous and it will smell divine.</li>
            <li> Just a so-so product. Maybe I was expecting more shine from the conditioner and got nothing exceptional for an exceptional price.</li>
            <li> It is very good for my hair, increases ability to style it , and the product lasts a long time.  I recommend it highly.</li>
            <li> I would crawl on my hands and knees for long distances to get this.  love.</li>
            <li> I originally bought this conditioner from my hair salon based on my stylist&#x27;s recommendation. It leaves my long hair so soft and silky. My hair isn&#x27;t hard to comb out when I get out of the shower after I use this product. It really is worth the money. For those who say the product isn&#x27;t filled up all the way - that isn&#x27;t true. When I buy the product from my salon, the container is not completely full either so this is just the way the product is packaged. I highly recommend this for anyone who colors their hair and wants silky, soft hair!</li>
            <li> Conditions my super fine hair without weighing it down. Makes is silky &amp; shiny.  AND I love the scent!  Yes, it&#x27;s a bit pricey, but you get what you pay for, &amp; with long hair, you need to take extra care!!  I will be repurchasing this again &amp; again!</li>
            <li> Davines is my favorite hair product and I use the conditioner along with the NouNou Shampoo. This line is perfect for anyone with fine hair. If you&#x27;re concerned about ingredients, it&#x27;s all natural without all the chemicals. I would highly recommend all the Davines products, they are a terrific brand and produce a high-quality product.</li>
            <li> As a lady who visits the salon regularly for color/highlights, I was noticing my hair drying out.  A friend recommended this and I ordered it.  Wow!  It goes on like whipped cream and rinses out clean, too!  I was skeptical about the &amp;#34;tomato extract&amp;#34; ingredient, but no worries:  it smells CLEAN!  I wish I could find a body gel with the same, clean fragrance!  Oh, and my hair has never felt better!</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for a year now and works great for color treated hair.  You only need a little bit and it goes along way.  I also use Davines Shampoo for color treated hair.  It  allows the color to last longer and your hair stays healthy.  Best prices on amazon.com</li>
            <li> I was using the Love conditioner but I thought I would try this since I color my hair. I love the smell (I was afraid I would hate it due to the reviews bc I am very sensitive to musky or flowery scents) and it does feel good but I think it is a little heavy for my hair.  I have thick fine straight hair. I will be going back to the other conditioner next time around.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been ordering this product since my hairdresser recommended it. Works great for dry, color-treated, black (as in Afro-textured) hair.</li>
            <li> I have both the NouNou and Love conditioner  by Davines and they both provide amazing softness without feeling weighted down. the price is the best I&#x27;ve found in awhile.</li>
            <li> Strangers have told me my hair is beautiful.  What more do I need to say?  Worth every cent.</li>
            <li> I was very disappointed. It took 3 weeks to get. Secondly, the product was 3/4 full. Thirdly, the shampoo and conditioner did not volumize, or give shine to my hair as I expected.  Will not order this product again.</li>
            <li> Pros: Supple, shiny, soft, hair with a pleasant fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Container shape/ lid. I know other reviewers warned me, but I don&#x27;t care, I just dump out the excess water at the end of my shower. Personally, I have a difficult time getting the lid off. Thank goodness I have some sort of fingernails because I HAVE to use them to pry the lid off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really care about the container though because this stuff is awesome!</li>
            <li> Just like the shampoo, I love this stuff! My absolute favorite shampoo and conditioner. For color treated hair, I have found nothing that preserves the color, softens and still leaves body as well as this brand and type do. Fantastic and smells great too!</li>
            <li> My hair has never felt and looked so great. The smell is okay. It is not too perfumy.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t understand all the awesome reviews. I love Davines copper conditioner. This one is not good. Does nothing for my color treated somewhat dry hair. Feels like I didn&#x27;t use any conditioner at all even when I leave it in for 10 min. Worst part is the smell. Ugh, like an old lady and I&#x27;m no spring chicken. Not a fan.</li>
            <li> I was a longtime user of Wen, but I never found it did much for my hair aside from keeping my haircolor intact. Still, it was too expensive for too little product- and I had to use a ton of it. Then I found this! Oh my goodness, after just the first use, not only was my haircolor perfectly intact, but my hair was gorgeous! Full, shiny, and buttery soft- even without any styling products. Also, before I used it, I was convinced I needed a trim as my hair was looking especially raggedy. Turns out, I didn&#x27;t need a trim, I just needed this conditioner! My 36 year old head of hair, which is constantly colored to hide my grays, is lush and silky. As for the scent that others commented on, I happen to love it. To me, it&#x27;s subtle, but constant. So even though a few days have passed since I used it, my hair still smells fresh and clean, but not overpowering. I will never use anything else.</li>
            <li> Excellent conditioner! Not sure I like the container, though...great price through amazon.  I have wavy hair and it looks healthier since I have been using this conditioner.</li>
            <li> great service i got it exactly on time,very good quality after this conditioner my hair is so easy to manage,complitely satisfaid with this product....thank you,i will order again</li>
            <li> Love this.  My hair has never been softer or shinier.</li>
            <li> this conditioner is amazing - leaves your hair soft, shiny, and without buildup. I have naturally curly hair and I cannot rave about this conditioner enough!</li>
            <li> knock off? received container 2/3 full-should have known if i looked at photo;nothing special for price, used twice don&#x27;t plan on purchasing  again</li>
            <li> Has a man&#x27;s product scent. Works well for conditioning hair. Not sure if it prolongs my color job though but I do live in a sunshine state</li>
            <li> It iis great and i love it</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff. My hair has never been healthier. Not to gross anyone out but I can go a week without washing my hair and it still doesn&#x27;t look greasy. Any other shampoo and conditioner would make me wash my hair every other day at the least. By not having to wash my hair so much, I don&#x27;t have to blow dry and flat iron it. It did take a few weeks for my hair to get used to this new combo but I will never consider using anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve chosen this rating because this hair products are the best, I tried it at the beauty salon and got hooked on it, it enhances my curls and leave them soft and shiny...fast service!</li>
            <li> I LOVE this product. It makes your hair feel like silk. and it has a wonderful clean scent. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff after discovering at my local salon. Don&#x27;t have time to always stop there to restock, so this site is always my backup in finding my products and free shipping and returns. Can&#x27;t beat that. I know the smell and texture of this product, so def know I have legitimate stuff. Better than drugstore crap.. I invest in hair products, especially after you pay A LOT at the salon to look FAB! Worth it and the smell gets lots on compliments.</li>
            <li> Love this conditioner</li>
            <li> I am so glad I discovered this product. Thanks to the great reviews posted on Amazon. Over the years my hair has become dull and frizzy due to coloring, blow drying etc. This conditioner completely transformed the texture of my hair to smooth and healthy. I&#x27;ve used other expensive brands like Kerastase in the past but nothing even comes close to this. Yes, it is a bit expensive but totally worth the splurge. It lasts a long time as you only need to use a little each time.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m tempted to try the shampoos from this line now.</li>
            <li> My hair was getting crispy and dry like straw.  I want to continue growing it out but felt that if I did so, I would need a better conditioner.  I read a lot of reviews and settled on this one.  I really like it.  My hair was immediately softer and felt stronger. It says you need to leave it in for 5 minutes, and while that can be a bit of a hassle, it definitely works.</li>
            <li> This is the only product I have found that works in the Florida humidity.  I use it as a leave in conditioner and it leaves my hair soft and smooth.</li>
            <li> I have used Davines products for a little over 2 yrs now. I have fine hair with some loose waves on top layers. I have gone from down-to-waist highlighted hair to pixie short and my hair is color treated now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many of you, I have tried many other (expensive, cheap, professional, natural, you name it) brands, but this is the best conditioner I have had so far. This product has a paste-like texture and a little of it goes a loooong way. I run out of the matching shampoo sooner than the conditioner for this reason. (Just a quick note that I don&#x27;t need to use more of its matching shampoo, but the conditioner really goes a long way).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is kind of an slippery product, so you may want to be careful for the first few times until you master it ;-) I rub it in my palms and then run my fingers through my hair. When I had long hair, I used to section my hair and then rubbing each section between my palms going toward ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I love about this product: I have pixie short hair now and I stick it up in some areas. While this conditioner nourishes my hair and makes it super soft, it never weigh my hair down which is awesome because I have super fine hair that can easily lose its volume and lays flat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switch between Nounou and Melu conditioner every few months.</li>
            <li> Love this product. I have short, fine, thin hair. I get my hair colored at a salon with Davines also.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT. Gives my hair body, shine and is so soft.  Been using it for about a year or so.</li>
            <li> Davies conditioner nou nou&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love it. For anyone with dry hair or over processed hair. It shines and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
            <li> Best hair product on the market today. Hair is much more healthy and shiny and the product ingredients are gentle on the hair.</li>
            <li> Really like this. I use it alternately with the copper toned conditioner and I use it in small amounts, in a squirt bottle for a quick fix if my hair feels dry (here in the desert). These conditioners are very rich and are helping my hair feel much &amp;#34;younger.&amp;#34; :&amp;#62;</li>
            <li> I usually do not think of products for color treated hair to be this amazing. My hair loves this and the smell is divine!</li>
            <li> This is the real deal!  Love this product because it helps with breakage and texture.  Great for everyone.  Just dont use it everytime you wash.  May make your hair porous.</li>
            <li> My hair is very fine, straight and thick. This is such a quality, concentrated conditioner that I only have to use a dime-sized dollop for the ends of my hair. I don&#x27;t let the conditioner sit for more than a minute and I wash it out thoroughly. I learned this after the first day, when I used a lot and let it sit for a couple minutes like with usual conditioners (and like the instructions said) - the result was the bottom of my hair was so moisturized that it looked wet and greasy all day. So if you&#x27;re going to take a chance on a salon conditioner, let this be it - the tub is going to work better and last longer than buying several bottles of cheap conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alos: I use this with the Nounou Nourishing Shampoo for color-treated hair, which makes my hair overall very lightweight and clean.</li>
            <li> The smell of this alone would make you buy the product. Let alone what it does to your hair.  Do it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
            <li> I just received product on time and packaged perfectly but something new is the square container.  I opened it up and the smell is totally different then all the other nounou conditioners by Davines.  I have never deviated from this product for a minimum 15 years.  The look of the actual product looks the same but the smell is not pleasant.  Is this new  from Davines or do you know?  The conditioner has always come in a round container and smells lovely not to mention that my long hair is always fabulous condition.  It is pricey but worth every penny.  I will try this once but if it is not the real thing I want my money back!  Could this stuff be a knock off as opposed to the real thing?</li>
            <li> I LOVE this line.  My hair smells wonderful and I only need a little bit to work into my hair.  The price is much too high.</li>
            <li> DO NOT THINK IT REALLY WORKS--MY HAIR IS STILL VERY DRY AFTER USING YOUR PRODUCT. I WILL NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AGAIN</li>
            <li> I have used NouNou Illuminating for a couple of years and love what I have achieved with this product. I have recommeded this product to all of my frieds and family. I will definatly use this again.</li>
            <li> I like this stuff, but I don&#x27;t know if I would buy it again. It&#x27;s not bad by any means and I like it&#x27;s eco friendliness...but it&#x27;s like $40 and it&#x27;s not THAT amazing.</li>
            <li> Pretty good product, smells nice - not like tomatoe at all! It&#x27;s just ok, so for the price I will not buy it again, but it does smell nice and has a good consistency and it works to soften my hair.</li>
            <li> This is the best conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used.  I have really dry hair that I color and this is the first conditioner that has made my hair look smooth and healthy all over.</li>
            <li> It is the Best conditioner out there. Soft shiny hair! Made in Italy and hard to find except on Amazon.</li>
            <li> This conditioner and the shampoo is brill.After paying loads on Aveda etc found this the best.My hair was frizzy and brittle. I left the conditioner on for 10 minutes for the first week and what a difference.Been using it for 3 weeks now and would highly recommend for people with highlights and fine hair.Will keep using 5****</li>
            <li> After I use the shampoo which strips my hair something awful (won&#x27;t use again) this seems to repair it but the SMELL IS GROSS.  It smells like an old man&#x27;s aftershave.  HATE IT HATE IT HATE IT.</li>
            <li> The container is smaller than ones I have purchased in the past, and it&#x27;s only about 2/3 full. I feel there is not enough product for the money.</li>
            <li> Unfortunately, the lid was totally cracked and the product leaked all over the other items in my order.</li>
            <li> I love Davines products, and this one did not disappoint!  The conditioner works wonderful on my fine, thin hair... it looks thicker and stays soft and smooth with no fly-aways!  Highly recommend!</li>
            <li> I expected a little more from all the wonderful reviews, but found that this works as any other conditioner. I prefer other brands better, I still felt as though my ends weren&#x27;t moisturized, even after leaving it in for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li> Best conditioner in the universe!</li>
            <li> I used this conditioner for years and then tried less expensive products for a few years to save money and now I&#x27;m back to Nounou.  This company really knows have to save hair!  I find my highlights last so much longer when I use this stuff versus the cheap stuff and my hair is so silky. So happy it&#x27;s avail on amazon so I can save a few $ from the salon which charges so much more!</li>
            <li> My hair&#x27;s best friend!!!&lt;br /&gt;A little bit of this creamy magic does wonders on my hair. When my hair is dry and over processed, I leave it on just a little longer and instant soft &amp; shiny locks.&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff and Amazon has the best pricing!</li>
            <li> I started using this product about a year ago, before all the hype about Moroccan Oil.  I still love the oil, but my hair does better if I skip the Moroccan Oil conditioner and use the Davines conditioner followed by the M Oil after blow drying.</li>
            <li> This conditioner is amazing stopped breakage from over processed color service.. True gem priceless must have.. I love the smell the containers are reusable biodegradable. The price is reasonable,  larger sizes are available thank you !!</li>
            <li> I love this conditioner.  I have purchased it in the past from Elizabeth Arden Red Door Salon.  The price was much better and fast delivery.  Yea.  I will order again.</li>
            <li> This conditioner used with its complimenting shampoo is the best ever.  My curly/frizzy hair has never looked better. It is worth the money and then some!!!!</li>
