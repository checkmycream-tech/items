    <h2> Positive Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li>I was hoping a sunscreen that also said it hydrated would be perfect for this.</li>
            <li>Great product!</li>
            <li>mo29YBNRO2VS3I4]]The best thing about this sunscreen is that it has a moisturizer built-in.</li>
            <li>Great combo!</li>
            <li>The hydration of this sunscreen was perfect.  </li>
            <li>This product is also awesome because it is water resistant for 1.5 hours</li>
            <li>I have always sworn by products containing aloe, and I believe this sunscreen is an excellent choice!</li>
            <li>All in all an excellent product!</li>
            <li>This is the BEST sunscreen.  </li>
            <li>However, I chose to go with the 50 SPF since I have a very fair complexion.</li>
            <li>I loved it!</li>
            <li>Great item.</li>
            <li>But I can say it does a great job protecting, which is what I&#x27;m looking for.  </li>
            <li>We used this for a day at the amusement park and it did great.  </li>
            <li>Great combination product.</li>
            <li>It would also be great for sport type events as well (hence the name).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Of course, it has the added benefit of SPF 30, which is great.</li>
            <li>The lotion is a great skin conditioner, too.</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m happy to report, no burns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>5-stars for this great product.</li>
            <li>Feels good on my skin and smells great.  </li>
            <li>Love it, best ever!</li>
            <li>I have used Banana Boat products for years and associate them with vacations and beaches, in part, because of a pleasant sunscreen smell.</li>
            <li>I think this is a good product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li>Surprisingly my grandson thought the colour of the lotion was \\&quot;icky\\&quot;.</li>
            <li>I was at an outdoor picnic/craft fair</li>
            <li>Those that advertise to do two things well are often good at neither.</li>
            <li>Good sunscreen, I&#x27;ve been using it on and off for 2 months now, it protects well</li>
            <li>It worked well and seemed moisturizing with a good scent.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It has a nice, pleasant scent.</li>
            <li>I liked it , its a good sunscreen and moisturizing too.</li>
            <li>/&gt;We came through the day with no burns, and who knows, maybe we were even more moist as a result!  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll have to keep using the fancy face-only stuff for that, but for the body, this is my favorite in a while!</li>
            <li>Love this stuff!</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue, is easy to rub in, is SPF 30, and feels great.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s becoming extremely important to wear sunscreen these days, and Banana Boat is an awesome choice for you and your family this summer.</li>
            <li>This sunscreen with moisturizer is amazing.</li>
            <li>This product was an effective combatant against both.</li>
            <li>It is like a moisturizer all on its own.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall a nice sunscreen that works well on faces.  </li>
            <li>It lasted most of the afternoon which is about as good as i could expect being in and out of the water.  </li>
            <li>We liked the combination of hydration and protection, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a greasy or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li>This is a really nice sunscreen.</li>
            <li>It leaves my skin nice and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is a pleasant scent and would be fine to use anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The fragrance is very light,</li>
            <li>It smells great, it works great and it has the added benefit of long term skin softening.</li>
            <li>I liked how easily this went on.</li>
            <li>SPF 30 is perfect for good protection and allowing your skin to tan a little.  </li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, everyone in our family has been quite pleased with both the feel and performance of Banana Boat&#x27;s Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion.</li>
            <li>Protect and Hydrate has a bit more of a scent that the Coolzone and smells more like an aloe moisturizing lotion than a sunscreen (if I want to smell like the beach  </li>
            <li>Sunscreen has gotten so much better over the years.</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure what I&#x27;d think of this sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Of course, most sunscreens have a bit of that, but you can feel the thickness of the way it comes out.</li>
            <li>I love the coconut bananna odor of Bannana Boat lotions.  </li>
            <li>It performed much better than the sport version of Banana Boat.  </li>
            <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li>Sadly, most lotions irritate my skin and most sunscreen feels greasy to wear.</li>
            <li>It has a flip top and the product came out without any issues.  </li>
            <li>People that don&#x27;t like fragrances will probably love it.  </li>
            <li>(we&#x27;d been using Banana Boat Sport Performance, which is more smelly).&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s better for a couple of hours than days of camping at a festival.</li>
            <li>it is still cheaper as many products you can buy here.</li>
            <li>He can now enjoy using sunscreen again!</li>
            <li>This works much better than their baseline product.</li>
            <li>They just need to make a better bottle for it.</li>
            <li>Most importantly, my husband reacts very strongly (sneezes all day) to 99% of any scented products except this brand.  </li>
            <li>This is a product worth trying!!</li>
            <li>This is my favorite sunscreen, because it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like sunscreen, just cool and refreshing like a lotion.</li>
            <li>live where both sunscreen and lotion on important during the summer so having something that combines both of those features is great.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall, a good value, great for everyday use or vacations, when you use a lot.</li>
            <li>Sport  Coolzone has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li>It rubs in easily.</li>
            <li>It goes on easily and protects.  </li>
            <li>Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li>This goes on and disappears fairly quickly and seemed to offer pretty good protection.</li>
            <li>It is very light on the skin and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li>First none of us liked the smell; it seemed rather like a chemical than a lotion.  </li>
            <li>The sunscreen seemed to perform just fine - no issues with sunburn and I did not feel the need to reapply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>packaging is fine.  </li>
            <li>It also felt fine on my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It goes on like a lotion product and is easy to smooth out.  </li>
            <li>It really left my skin feeling great and eliminated the after effects of a day out in the sun.</li>
            <li>My skin did not dry out either which is quite remarkable for me.</li>
            <li>The best part is the lotion itself goes on smoothly and does not have the sticky and greasy feeling that turns us off to the sunscreen we&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li>Both my son and I used it many times out in the sun, either swimming or working in the garden, and neither of us had any sunburn at all, though we are very, very fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I really liked how it absorbed readily, was not at all greasy (consistency and absorption like a nice lotion), it really did not have any detectable smell to me and did not make my skin itchy.  </li>
            <li>I assume there are more and/or higher amounts of soothing ingredients  in the Protect and Hydrate as opposed to the Coolzone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I did burn the first time I used this sunscreen, since I sweated it off, but it help up better when I re-applied it as it advises.</li>
            <li>for my shower, which I got here on Amazon, and that is the first step towards softer, more hydrated skin.</li>
            <li>Light not greasy and gives full coverage.</li>
            <li>It also has a clean smell that is not offensive.</li>
            <li>This has scent that was barely noticeable and is great if I am going to party in someone&#x27;s backyard where  I don&#x27;t want smell like I am getting ready to got to the beach.</li>
            <li>The scent is quite light and fresh and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li>It leaves skin incredibly soft and made even my dry knees and elbows feel wonderful.  </li>
            <li>It is lightweight and not greasy, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li>The lotion is also non-greasy and seems to absorb quite quickly.  </li>
            <li>I took a quick look at the ingredients in this and the Coolzone and the Protect &amp; Hydrate seems to have mineral oil and the Coolzone</li>
            <li>As a sunscreen connoisseur, I&#x27;d say this one&#x27;s adequate for the task: not overly greasy or runny.</li>
            <li>The lotion absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li>Banana Boat&#x27;s Protect &amp; Hydrate broad spectrum sunscreen is a nice addition to their line-up</li>
            <li>/&gt;It is very lotion like, it dispenses easily and absorbs quickly leaving skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li>I like the shape of the bottle, it is easy to squeeze and control how much lotion comes</li>
            <li>It absorbed quickly and both of them tanned instead of burning.</li>
            <li>First off, I stared using Dove Winter Care Beauty Bars (not just for winter!)</li>
            <li>use the Protect &amp; Hydrate on my face and find that is goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t very smelly at all.  </li>
            <li>i liked this basic sunscreen.</li>
            <li>Overall, a nice product and I like the scent.</li>
            <li>This is a product worth consideration.</li>
            <li>Overall, we liked it.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It absorbed pretty quickly when I put it on my skin.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not thick, goes on easily, immediately hydrates, and with an SPF of 30, I have everything</li>
            <li>I reapplied every few hours as directed and found that the sunscreen was very effective.</li>
            <li>I first used this on a very hot and sunny day for a 2 hour walk.  </li>
            <li>I got this right before we took our vacation to Galveston, TX.  </li>
            <li>but I put a little more on just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>What a smart idea to combine hydration and protection!</li>
            <li>It did feel moisturizing and went on like a lotion - nice for dry legs.</li>
            <li>This is a pretty standard recommended sunscreen with good broad spectrum protection, but it also has the added benefit of having a lotion.  </li>
            <li>And while it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice for my face, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use it on my face in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is also waterproof for up to 80 minutes, and my son really likes it!</li>
            <li>It has a light neutral smell, neither masculine or feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>It smooths on nicely, leaves no greasy feeling, and works just as expected.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m of Irish/Dutch descent, so they don&#x27;t come much whiter than me!</li>
            <li>Hydrates better then regular lotions.</li>
            <li>I had pretty much accepted that sunscreens would be pretty greasy and smell tropical, of coconuts and pineapple.  </li>
            <li>My two children are fair skinned, blonde hair, blue eyed</li>
            <li>lotion is pretty much odorless.</li>
            <li>It worked and not only was my skin burn free, it was also smooth and soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li>I usually like for things to smell good, and</li>
            <li>It seems like we all easily forget to put it on and then end up paying for it later.</li>
            <li>With SPF of 30 and both UVA and UVB protection, we can feel better about being out in the sun and with the moisturizing lotion, we are having no problems with dry skin.</li>
            <li>It comes out as a light green lotion that rubs in easily, leaving at first a white sheen but quickly fading to transparent.  </li>
            <li>lotion part may be the reason why it &#x27;sinks&#x27; in better and doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on the surface so much.</li>
            <li>Very convenient to carry around.</li>
            <li>I like this sunscreen and my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li>While this is far better than the greasy, stinky sunscreens from days of yore, I wouldn&#x27;t really call it especially hydrating, and it is a bit sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li>He&#x27;s a runner and said even with sweating, he found it protects him very well and has not had any sunburns since he started using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>importantly it seems to work and last.</li>
            <li>and it isn&#x27;t greasy like many other sun lotions.</li>
            <li>/&gt;It does cause a slight build up with regular re-application, so you&#x27;ll want to shower it off in the evening if you are spending hours in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as described, and it&#x27;s a good choice if you need a lotion as well as sunblock.</li>
            <li>There is a wavy pattern that looks kind of slick.</li>
            <li>It has a faint yet pleasant scent and provided just the right amount of moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li>It looks creamy white, but as it was rubbed on (that took more rubbing than most others I have used) there was a slight blue cast.</li>
            <li>I typically use spray on sunscreen, since most sunscreen lotions leave a greasy feeling on my skin.  </li>
            <li>Also, at SPF 30, you are protecting yourself from 97 percent of the UVA/UVB rays, so anything higher then 30 is only giving minimal more benefits.</li>
            <li>So, don&#x27;t get fooled by high SPF numbers, because you need protection from both Ultra-Violet A and B rays, which can both do damage and cause skin cancer.</li>
            <li>(shelf life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary from Vine, but I would purchase in the future.</li>
            <li>and normally that is not a problem with</li>
            <li>Smell is like standard sunscreen and lotion, pretty much what you would expect with the combination of sunscreen and lotion.  </li>
            <li>I transferred some of this to a clear squeeze bottle to take on carryon (the full size bottle is too big).</li>
            <li>No sunburn and no icky sticky sunscreen feeling.</li>
            <li>I put it on after a shower, and within a few minutes, it absorbed into my skin and just looked and felt like moisturizer, and it did that pretty well, too!</li>
            <li>The Protect &amp; Hydrate has a Moisturizer claim - my skin felt softer after application, so, the moisturizer in the product does live up to its claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I liked them both but found subtle differences between the</li>
            <li>Competitor brands may advertise a higher amount of SPF protection, but may only protect against the UVB rays.</li>
            <li>I hope the clear packaging does not cause the product to degrade faster</li>
            <li>This stuff is clearly aimed at hydrating.</li>
            <li>None of the fairer members of my family have had sunburns so far this summer.</li>
            <li>This product is basically odorless which really appeals to my husband and teenage son.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m amazed at how fast the sun will burn my skin, as opposed to when I was younger.</li>
            <li>Using sunscreen will help keep you safer and also prevent early aging.</li>
            <li>Wow, this is not how I remember Banana Boat.</li>
            <li>I have been using this sunscreen for several weeks now and really like it.</li>
            <li>Went to New Orleans and spent hours walking in the hot sun.</li>
            <li>This particular sunscreen is only SPF 30, but it provides protection against both UVA and UVB rays that cause skin cancer.</li>
            <li>The only downside is that my skin is sensitive, so while it worked fine for my body, my face sort of broke out within a few hours.</li>
            <li>It goes and smooth and does seem to add a little extra hydration to your skin.  </li>
            <li>This sunscreen gets four stars from me as one that does what it&#x27;s supposed to yet isn&#x27;t quite outstanding enough to \\&quot;love.\\&quot; While it&#x27;s hard for a consumer to test the SPF, I&#x27;ve used it on a sunny day without noticing tan lines so that tells me it&#x27;s doing its job.</li>
            <li>and I have to stick my nose right down on my skin to smell it.  </li>
            <li>All members of my family are very light skinned and burn easily, but HATE to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li>We have used this sunscreen near the water and while hiking out in the open.</li>
            <li>Makes my skin so soft and totally prevents sunburn!</li>
            <li>On a full day outside, we usually reapply once and are completely protected.</li>
            <li>and I live in a dry area.  </li>
            <li>Their skin did not dry out at all.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m lucky enough to look about 10 years younger than I am, but in the last year or so, I&#x27;ve been getting those little dry age (liver) spots on my arms, so I&#x27;m taking evasive action now.</li>
            <li>This suntan lotion has a slight medicinal scent I&#x27;m not wild about, but I do like it better than the overly sweet fake coconut scent of other suntan</li>
    </ol>

            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue, is easy to rub in, is SPF 30, and feels great.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s becoming extremely important to wear sunscreen these days, and Banana Boat is an awesome choice for you and your family this summer.</li>
            <li> This sunscreen with moisturizer is amazing.</li>
            <li> This product was an effective combatant against both.</li>
            <li> It is like a moisturizer all on its own.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall a nice sunscreen that works well on faces.  </li>
            <li> It lasted most of the afternoon which is about as good as i could expect being in and out of the water.  </li>
            <li> We liked the combination of hydration and protection, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a greasy or sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice sunscreen.</li>
            <li> It leaves my skin nice and soft.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is a pleasant scent and would be fine to use anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The fragrance is very light,</li>
            <li> It smells great, it works great and it has the added benefit of long term skin softening.</li>
            <li> I liked how easily this went on.</li>
            <li> SPF 30 is perfect for good protection and allowing your skin to tan a little.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, everyone in our family has been quite pleased with both the feel and performance of Banana Boat&#x27;s Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion.</li>
            <li> Protect and Hydrate has a bit more of a scent that the Coolzone and smells more like an aloe moisturizing lotion than a sunscreen (if I want to smell like the beach  </li>
            <li> Sunscreen has gotten so much better over the years.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I&#x27;d think of this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Of course, most sunscreens have a bit of that, but you can feel the thickness of the way it comes out.</li>
            <li> I love the coconut bananna odor of Bannana Boat lotions.  </li>
            <li> It performed much better than the sport version of Banana Boat.  </li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  </li>
            <li> Sadly, most lotions irritate my skin and most sunscreen feels greasy to wear.</li>
            <li> It has a flip top and the product came out without any issues.  </li>
            <li> People that don&#x27;t like fragrances will probably love it.  </li>
            <li> (we&#x27;d been using Banana Boat Sport Performance, which is more smelly).&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s better for a couple of hours than days of camping at a festival.</li>
            <li> it is still cheaper as many products you can buy here.</li>
            <li> He can now enjoy using sunscreen again!</li>
            <li> This works much better than their baseline product.</li>
            <li> They just need to make a better bottle for it.</li>
            <li> Most importantly, my husband reacts very strongly (sneezes all day) to 99% of any scented products except this brand.  </li>
            <li> This is a product worth trying!!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen, because it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like sunscreen, just cool and refreshing like a lotion.</li>
            <li> live where both sunscreen and lotion on important during the summer so having something that combines both of those features is great.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Overall, a good value, great for everyday use or vacations, when you use a lot.</li>
            <li> Sport  Coolzone has a very mild scent.</li>
            <li> It rubs in easily.</li>
            <li> It goes on easily and protects.  </li>
            <li> Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> This goes on and disappears fairly quickly and seemed to offer pretty good protection.</li>
            <li> It is very light on the skin and absorbs quickly.  </li>
            <li> First none of us liked the smell; it seemed rather like a chemical than a lotion.  </li>
            <li> The sunscreen seemed to perform just fine - no issues with sunburn and I did not feel the need to reapply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> packaging is fine.  </li>
            <li> It also felt fine on my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It goes on like a lotion product and is easy to smooth out.  </li>
            <li> It really left my skin feeling great and eliminated the after effects of a day out in the sun.</li>
            <li> My skin did not dry out either which is quite remarkable for me.</li>
            <li> The best part is the lotion itself goes on smoothly and does not have the sticky and greasy feeling that turns us off to the sunscreen we&#x27;ve used in the past.</li>
            <li> Both my son and I used it many times out in the sun, either swimming or working in the garden, and neither of us had any sunburn at all, though we are very, very fair.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I really liked how it absorbed readily, was not at all greasy (consistency and absorption like a nice lotion), it really did not have any detectable smell to me and did not make my skin itchy.  </li>
            <li> I assume there are more and/or higher amounts of soothing ingredients  in the Protect and Hydrate as opposed to the Coolzone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I did burn the first time I used this sunscreen, since I sweated it off, but it help up better when I re-applied it as it advises.</li>
            <li> for my shower, which I got here on Amazon, and that is the first step towards softer, more hydrated skin.</li>
            <li> Light not greasy and gives full coverage.</li>
            <li> It also has a clean smell that is not offensive.</li>
            <li> This has scent that was barely noticeable and is great if I am going to party in someone&#x27;s backyard where  I don&#x27;t want smell like I am getting ready to got to the beach.</li>
            <li> The scent is quite light and fresh and doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
            <li> It leaves skin incredibly soft and made even my dry knees and elbows feel wonderful.  </li>
            <li> It is lightweight and not greasy, and it absorbs quickly.</li>
            <li> The lotion is also non-greasy and seems to absorb quite quickly.  </li>
            <li> I took a quick look at the ingredients in this and the Coolzone and the Protect &amp; Hydrate seems to have mineral oil and the Coolzone</li>
            <li> As a sunscreen connoisseur, I&#x27;d say this one&#x27;s adequate for the task: not overly greasy or runny.</li>
            <li> The lotion absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat&#x27;s Protect &amp; Hydrate broad spectrum sunscreen is a nice addition to their line-up</li>
            <li> /&gt;It is very lotion like, it dispenses easily and absorbs quickly leaving skin feeling moisturized.</li>
            <li> I like the shape of the bottle, it is easy to squeeze and control how much lotion comes</li>
            <li> It absorbed quickly and both of them tanned instead of burning.</li>
            <li> First off, I stared using Dove Winter Care Beauty Bars (not just for winter!)</li>
            <li> use the Protect &amp; Hydrate on my face and find that is goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t very smelly at all.  </li>
            <li> i liked this basic sunscreen.</li>
            <li> Overall, a nice product and I like the scent.</li>
            <li> This is a product worth consideration.</li>
            <li> Overall, we liked it.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It absorbed pretty quickly when I put it on my skin.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not thick, goes on easily, immediately hydrates, and with an SPF of 30, I have everything</li>
            <li> I reapplied every few hours as directed and found that the sunscreen was very effective.</li>
            <li> I first used this on a very hot and sunny day for a 2 hour walk.  </li>
            <li> I got this right before we took our vacation to Galveston, TX.  </li>
            <li> but I put a little more on just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> What a smart idea to combine hydration and protection!</li>
            <li> It did feel moisturizing and went on like a lotion - nice for dry legs.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty standard recommended sunscreen with good broad spectrum protection, but it also has the added benefit of having a lotion.  </li>
            <li> And while it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice for my face, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use it on my face in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> It is also waterproof for up to 80 minutes, and my son really likes it!</li>
            <li> It has a light neutral smell, neither masculine or feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> It smooths on nicely, leaves no greasy feeling, and works just as expected.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Irish/Dutch descent, so they don&#x27;t come much whiter than me!</li>
            <li> Hydrates better then regular lotions.</li>
            <li> I had pretty much accepted that sunscreens would be pretty greasy and smell tropical, of coconuts and pineapple.  </li>
            <li> My two children are fair skinned, blonde hair, blue eyed</li>
            <li> lotion is pretty much odorless.</li>
            <li> It worked and not only was my skin burn free, it was also smooth and soft and hydrated.</li>
            <li> I usually like for things to smell good, and</li>
            <li> It seems like we all easily forget to put it on and then end up paying for it later.</li>
            <li> With SPF of 30 and both UVA and UVB protection, we can feel better about being out in the sun and with the moisturizing lotion, we are having no problems with dry skin.</li>
            <li> It comes out as a light green lotion that rubs in easily, leaving at first a white sheen but quickly fading to transparent.  </li>
            <li> lotion part may be the reason why it &#x27;sinks&#x27; in better and doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on the surface so much.</li>
            <li> Very convenient to carry around.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen and my whole family uses it.</li>
            <li> While this is far better than the greasy, stinky sunscreens from days of yore, I wouldn&#x27;t really call it especially hydrating, and it is a bit sticky.&lt;br</li>
            <li> He&#x27;s a runner and said even with sweating, he found it protects him very well and has not had any sunburns since he started using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> importantly it seems to work and last.</li>
            <li> and it isn&#x27;t greasy like many other sun lotions.</li>
            <li> /&gt;It does cause a slight build up with regular re-application, so you&#x27;ll want to shower it off in the evening if you are spending hours in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as described, and it&#x27;s a good choice if you need a lotion as well as sunblock.</li>
            <li> There is a wavy pattern that looks kind of slick.</li>
            <li> It has a faint yet pleasant scent and provided just the right amount of moisture for my skin.</li>
            <li> It looks creamy white, but as it was rubbed on (that took more rubbing than most others I have used) there was a slight blue cast.</li>
            <li> I typically use spray on sunscreen, since most sunscreen lotions leave a greasy feeling on my skin.  </li>
            <li> Also, at SPF 30, you are protecting yourself from 97 percent of the UVA/UVB rays, so anything higher then 30 is only giving minimal more benefits.</li>
            <li> So, don&#x27;t get fooled by high SPF numbers, because you need protection from both Ultra-Violet A and B rays, which can both do damage and cause skin cancer.</li>
            <li> (shelf life).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this complimentary from Vine, but I would purchase in the future.</li>
            <li> and normally that is not a problem with</li>
            <li> Smell is like standard sunscreen and lotion, pretty much what you would expect with the combination of sunscreen and lotion.  </li>
            <li> I transferred some of this to a clear squeeze bottle to take on carryon (the full size bottle is too big).</li>
            <li> No sunburn and no icky sticky sunscreen feeling.</li>
            <li> I put it on after a shower, and within a few minutes, it absorbed into my skin and just looked and felt like moisturizer, and it did that pretty well, too!</li>
            <li> The Protect &amp; Hydrate has a Moisturizer claim - my skin felt softer after application, so, the moisturizer in the product does live up to its claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I liked them both but found subtle differences between the</li>
            <li> Competitor brands may advertise a higher amount of SPF protection, but may only protect against the UVB rays.</li>
            <li> I hope the clear packaging does not cause the product to degrade faster</li>
            <li> This stuff is clearly aimed at hydrating.</li>
            <li> None of the fairer members of my family have had sunburns so far this summer.</li>
            <li> This product is basically odorless which really appeals to my husband and teenage son.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how fast the sun will burn my skin, as opposed to when I was younger.</li>
            <li> Using sunscreen will help keep you safer and also prevent early aging.</li>
            <li> Wow, this is not how I remember Banana Boat.</li>
            <li> I have been using this sunscreen for several weeks now and really like it.</li>
            <li> Went to New Orleans and spent hours walking in the hot sun.</li>
            <li> This particular sunscreen is only SPF 30, but it provides protection against both UVA and UVB rays that cause skin cancer.</li>
            <li> The only downside is that my skin is sensitive, so while it worked fine for my body, my face sort of broke out within a few hours.</li>
            <li> It goes and smooth and does seem to add a little extra hydration to your skin.  </li>
            <li> This sunscreen gets four stars from me as one that does what it&#x27;s supposed to yet isn&#x27;t quite outstanding enough to \\&quot;love.\\&quot; While it&#x27;s hard for a consumer to test the SPF, I&#x27;ve used it on a sunny day without noticing tan lines so that tells me it&#x27;s doing its job.</li>
            <li> and I have to stick my nose right down on my skin to smell it.  </li>
            <li> All members of my family are very light skinned and burn easily, but HATE to wear sunscreen.</li>
            <li> We have used this sunscreen near the water and while hiking out in the open.</li>
            <li> Makes my skin so soft and totally prevents sunburn!</li>
            <li> On a full day outside, we usually reapply once and are completely protected.</li>
            <li> and I live in a dry area.  </li>
            <li> Their skin did not dry out at all.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m lucky enough to look about 10 years younger than I am, but in the last year or so, I&#x27;ve been getting those little dry age (liver) spots on my arms, so I&#x27;m taking evasive action now.</li>
            <li> This suntan lotion has a slight medicinal scent I&#x27;m not wild about, but I do like it better than the overly sweet fake coconut scent of other suntan</li>
            <li> would be another major almost expected</li>
            <li> Overall, it kept us from being affected by the sun (and the only way I can judge that is by tan lines and pink skin).&lt;br</li>
            <li> However, Banana Boat Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion absorbs into my skin very well, without that icky greasy feeling.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;It lasts a long time and seems to make my skin feel nicer than the Coolzone.</li>
            <li> However, if you are in the sun for a long period of time, this might not prevent you from burning.</li>
            <li> They&#x27;re goopy, sticky and leave a film layer on your skin that make you look pale goth chick from the early 2000&#x27;s.</li>
            <li> This blocked worked well for several hours without any additional reddening due to burning.  </li>
            <li> so my skin tends to get dry in addition to sunburned.</li>
            <li> recommend this product for anyone looking to keep from getting dry skin and sunburned.</li>
            <li> The lotion itself has a zip-zappy green streak running through the white lotion, which can be seen through the clear bottle (not sure if that marketing tactic is necessary).  </li>
            <li> Get protected from the sun and from dry skin!</li>
            <li> We always have this sunscreen in our bag or stroller and it stays closed.</li>
            <li> I also like that the smell is extremely minimal, so you won&#x27;t go around smelling like the beach all day.</li>
            <li> It will still sting eyes, so you need to be careful around your eyes.  </li>
            <li> The last thing to round out my spree was this Banana Boat Hydrating Sunscreen.</li>
            <li> , so I&#x27;m middle aged and facing a few reality facts.</li>
            <li> Because it&#x27;s greasy, smells awful and bugs seem to stick or are more attracted to you than normal when you have it on.</li>
            <li> I feel my skin is tight and dry.</li>
            <li> However, it does have parabens and other ingredients you may choose to avoid if that bothers you.</li>
            <li> I love Banana Boat products and am rarely disappointed with them.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t do that any other time though.</li>
            <li> I have never liked using sunscreens but know they are necessary for skin health and comfort (vs. sunburn).  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a spray-on sunscreen girl, but this intrigued me because my skin gets dry from the sun.</li>
            <li> The Sport Coolzone has less of a noticeable scent for me.  </li>
            <li> Once it comes out of the bottle, the lotion turns an ugly light green color.</li>
            <li> He was not happy about reapplying it later</li>
            <li> That green color was not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> sunscreen usually helps a bit but still after a day in the sun</li>
            <li> It hydrates the skin as it says, but doesn&#x27;t feel to heavy!</li>
            <li> it weren&#x27;t for the nasty color, I&#x27;d love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> The sunscreen works no better or worse than any other sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Unlike other suntan lotions, this one didn&#x27;t have that nasty glossy, greasy finish and feel.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very faint</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I hate sunscreens.</li>

            <li> Great item. Very convenient to carry around. Does not leave the oily residue that sunscreens are notorious for.</li>
            <li> I have never liked using sunscreens but know they are necessary for skin health and comfort (vs. sunburn).  I had pretty much accepted that sunscreens would be pretty greasy and smell tropical, of coconuts and pineapple.  This product was different.  I really liked how it absorbed readily, was not at all greasy (consistency and absorption like a nice lotion), it really did not have any detectable smell to me and did not make my skin itchy.  I used it on my face with no issues.  I first used this on a very hot and sunny day for a 2 hour walk.

            <li> The sun can be so drying, sunscreen usually helps a bit but still after a day in the sun I feel my skin is tight and dry. This sunscreen with moisturizer is amazing. It really left my skin feeling great and eliminated the after effects of a day out in the sun. I reapplied every few hours as directed and found that the sunscreen was very effective. It smells great, it works great and it has the added benefit of long term skin softening.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen and my whole family uses it. It is lightweight and not greasy, and it absorbs quickly. The scent is quite light and fresh and doesn&#x27;t linger. We always have this sunscreen in our bag or stroller and it stays closed. On a full day outside, we usually reapply once and are completely protected. I think this is a good product and would purchase again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t know how to measure \\&quot;hydration,\\&quot; so I&#x27;m agnostic how well Banana Boat&#x27;s \\&quot;protect and hydrate\\&quot; lotion hydrates.  But I can say it does a great job protecting, which is what I&#x27;m looking for.  We used this for a day at the amusement park and it did great.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue, is easy to rub in, is SPF 30, and feels great.  The fragrance is very light, which I appreciate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We came through the day with no burns, and who knows, maybe we were even more moist as a result!  Strongly recommended.</li>
            <li> While this is far better than the greasy, stinky sunscreens from days of yore, I wouldn&#x27;t really call it especially hydrating, and it is a bit sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it absorbs well, has a neutral scent (also much different from the Banana Boat products of my youth), does the job. And while it wouldn&#x27;t be my first choice for my face, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to use it on my face in a pinch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a good value, great for everyday use or vacations, when you use a lot.</li>
            <li> We have used this sunscreen near the water and while hiking out in the open. I was hoping a sunscreen that also said it hydrated would be perfect for this. First none of us liked the smell; it seemed rather like a chemical than a lotion.  Surprisingly my grandson thought the colour of the lotion was \\&quot;icky\\&quot;. It looks creamy white, but as it was rubbed on (that took more rubbing than most others I have used) there was a slight blue cast. He was not happy about reapplying it later and normally that is not a problem with him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion worked as a sunscreen, but the smell and the problem of rubbing it in, when it says it absorbs in seconds did not make this a hit with any of us.</li>
            <li> This is a pretty standard recommended sunscreen with good broad spectrum protection, but it also has the added benefit of having a lotion.  The lotion is also non-greasy and seems to absorb quite quickly.  Smell is like standard sunscreen and lotion, pretty much what you would expect with the combination of sunscreen and lotion.  Great combination product.</li>
            <li> This suntan lotion has a slight medicinal scent I&#x27;m not wild about, but I do like it better than the overly sweet fake coconut scent of other suntan lotions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very lotion like, it dispenses easily and absorbs quickly leaving skin feeling moisturized. None of the fairer members of my family have had sunburns so far this summer. This year has been breaking records in Anchorage, Alaska for number of sunny days so it&#x27;s been well tested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does cause a slight build up with regular re-application, so you&#x27;ll want to shower it off in the evening if you are spending hours in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works as described, and it&#x27;s a good choice if you need a lotion as well as sunblock. It hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation for anyone in my family.</li>
            <li> All members of my family are very light skinned and burn easily, but HATE to wear sunscreen. It seems like we all easily forget to put it on and then end up paying for it later. Why? Because it&#x27;s greasy, smells awful and bugs seem to stick or are more attracted to you than normal when you have it on. Well, that was until we tried Banana Boat&#x27;s Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it&#x27;s no longer a chore or hassle to use sunscreen! With SPF of 30 and both UVA and UVB protection, we can feel better about being out in the sun and with the moisturizing lotion, we are having no problems with dry skin. The best part is the lotion itself goes on smoothly and does not have the sticky and greasy feeling that turns us off to the sunscreen we&#x27;ve used in the past. The smell is somewhat chemical but doesn&#x27;t have that overpowering sunscreen smell that others have. It is also waterproof for up to 80 minutes, and my son really likes it! He&#x27;s a runner and said even with sweating, he found it protects him very well and has not had any sunburns since he started using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, everyone in our family has been quite pleased with both the feel and performance of Banana Boat&#x27;s Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion. This is a product worth trying!!</li>
            <li> I chose this sunscreen for my entire family to use when we went on a trip to Lake Erie.  This product is basically odorless which really appeals to my husband and teenage son.  It moisturizes the skin without being greasy which is a big plus for me.  And we all made it back from a day on the lake without any burns!</li>
            <li> This sunscreen gets four stars from me as one that does what it&#x27;s supposed to yet isn&#x27;t quite outstanding enough to \\&quot;love.\\&quot; While it&#x27;s hard for a consumer to test the SPF, I&#x27;ve used it on a sunny day without noticing tan lines so that tells me it&#x27;s doing its job. It did feel moisturizing and went on like a lotion - nice for dry legs. I&#x27;ve used it on myself and my preschooler with no problems or irritation.</li>
            <li> I tried both the Banana Boat Sport Coolzone and Protect and Hydrate SPF-30 sunscreens. I liked them both but found subtle differences between the two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Protect and Hydrate has a bit more of a scent that the Coolzone and smells more like an aloe moisturizing lotion than a sunscreen (if I want to smell like the beach  I will have to look elsewhere.) It is a pleasant scent and would be fine to use anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a long time and seems to make my skin feel nicer than the Coolzone. I took a quick look at the ingredients in this and the Coolzone and the Protect &amp; Hydrate seems to have mineral oil and the Coolzone looks like it does not. I assume there are more and/or higher amounts of soothing ingredients  in the Protect and Hydrate as opposed to the Coolzone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this at a pool party.  It seem to last after I got out of the pool but I put a little more on just to be on the safe side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sport  Coolzone has a very mild scent. I have used Banana Boat products for years and associate them with vacations and beaches, in part, because of a pleasant sunscreen smell. This has scent that was barely noticeable and is great if I am going to party in someone&#x27;s backyard where  I don&#x27;t want smell like I am getting ready to got to the beach. It would also be great for sport type events as well (hence the name).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It absorbed pretty quickly when I put it on my skin. Sunscreen has gotten so much better over the years. It used to greasy and now it is not. It also felt fine on my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most importantly it seems to work and last. I was at an outdoor picnic/craft fair and I put this on at noon and did not put it on again until dinner time.  This goes against the instructions which suggest using every two hours. I did not get any sunburn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like both products. Both protected my skin. I would use both for any outdoor activities. The Sport Coolzone has less of a noticeable scent for me.  The Protect &amp;Hydrate makes my skin feel nicer and has an aloe like scent.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure what I&#x27;d think of this sunscreen. I haven&#x27;t had a ton of luck with 2 in 1 products. Those that advertise to do two things well are often good at neither. That wasn&#x27;t the case with this sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spend a lot of time in the pool so my skin tends to get dry in addition to sunburned. This product was an effective combatant against both. It rubs into your skin quite well. I was worried about that as well since a product that couldn&#x27;t rub in well would be another major almost expected detriment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product for anyone looking to keep from getting dry skin and sunburned. This 2 in 1 worked quite well for me.</li>
            <li> Unlike other suntan lotions, this one didn&#x27;t have that nasty glossy, greasy finish and feel. I put it on after a shower, and within a few minutes, it absorbed into my skin and just looked and felt like moisturizer, and it did that pretty well, too! Of course, it has the added benefit of SPF 30, which is great. The only downside is that my skin is sensitive, so while it worked fine for my body, my face sort of broke out within a few hours. I&#x27;ll have to keep using the fancy face-only stuff for that, but for the body, this is my favorite in a while! Great product!</li>
            <li> [[VIDEOID:mo29YBNRO2VS3I4]]The best thing about this sunscreen is that it has a moisturizer built-in. Of course, most sunscreens have a bit of that, but you can feel the thickness of the way it comes out. See video.</li>
            <li> Good sunscreen, I&#x27;ve been using it on and off for 2 months now, it protects well, just don&#x27;t forget to reapply it regularly. It hydrates the skin as it says, but doesn&#x27;t feel to heavy! For a body* sunscreen, this one is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;*I wouldn&#x27;t recommended for your face, though, use something lighter.</li>
            <li> It works, it protects from getting sun burned. The sunscreen works no better or worse than any other sunscreen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the package, I like the way this looks. There is a wavy pattern that looks kind of slick. Guess that is the sunscreen and the moisturizer layers. Once it comes out of the bottle, the lotion turns an ugly light green color. I transferred some of this to a clear squeeze bottle to take on carryon (the full size bottle is too big). That green color was not pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion is pretty much odorless. It rubs in easily. Once rubbed in it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. I like the shape of the bottle, it is easy to squeeze and control how much lotion comes out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If it weren&#x27;t for the nasty color, I&#x27;d love this sunscreen.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually a spray-on sunscreen girl, but this intrigued me because my skin gets dry from the sun. What a smart idea to combine hydration and protection! It worked and not only was my skin burn free, it was also smooth and soft and hydrated. Great combo!</li>
            <li> I love the coconut bananna odor of Bannana Boat lotions.  The block worked well as I was already burnt and could not tolerate anymore sun.  This blocked worked well for several hours without any additional reddening due to burning.  The lotion is a great skin conditioner, too.</li>
            <li> I typically use spray on sunscreen, since most sunscreen lotions leave a greasy feeling on my skin.  However, Banana Boat Protect and Hydrate Sunscreen Lotion absorbs into my skin very well, without that icky greasy feeling.  It has a light neutral smell, neither masculine or feminine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this well enough that I recently purchased another bottle of it after I ran out.  However, I chose to go with the 50 SPF since I have a very fair complexion.</li>
            <li> The hydration of this sunscreen was perfect.  It performed much better than the sport version of Banana Boat.  It did not feel gross or slimy after you put it on.  It is like a moisturizer all on its own.  I loved it!</li>
            <li> Love this stuff.  Feels good on my skin and smells great.  This summer this product got a lot of use.</li>
            <li> i liked this basic sunscreen. It worked well and seemed moisturizing with a good scent. However, it does have parabens and other ingredients you may choose to avoid if that bothers you.</li>
            <li> I got this right before we took our vacation to Galveston, TX.  My two children are fair skinned, blonde hair, blue eyed pre-teens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually they complain about the smell of sunscreens but I didn&#x27;t hear a peep out of them.  It absorbed quickly and both of them tanned instead of burning. Their skin did not dry out at all.  My skin did not dry out either which is quite remarkable for me. I reapplied it every hour we were in the sun.</li>
            <li> I like this Banana Boat sunscreen because it does what it says - it hydrates the skin while at the same time protecting you from the sun. It also has a clean smell that is not offensive. Banana Boat is a keeper.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m amazed at how fast the sun will burn my skin, as opposed to when I was younger. It&#x27;s becoming extremely important to wear sunscreen these days, and Banana Boat is an awesome choice for you and your family this summer. This particular sunscreen is only SPF 30, but it provides protection against both UVA and UVB rays that cause skin cancer. Competitor brands may advertise a higher amount of SPF protection, but may only protect against the UVB rays. So, don&#x27;t get fooled by high SPF numbers, because you need protection from both Ultra-Violet A and B rays, which can both do damage and cause skin cancer. Also, at SPF 30, you are protecting yourself from 97 percent of the UVA/UVB rays, so anything higher then 30 is only giving minimal more benefits. This product is also awesome because it is water resistant for 1.5 hours and it isn&#x27;t greasy like many other sun lotions. I also like that the smell is extremely minimal, so you won&#x27;t go around smelling like the beach all day. Using sunscreen will help keep you safer and also prevent early aging. I have always sworn by products containing aloe, and I believe this sunscreen is an excellent choice!</li>
            <li> I liked how easily this went on. Some sunscreens leave you with greasy hands and skin. This goes on and disappears fairly quickly and seemed to offer pretty good protection. However, although it worked well on me, it did leave some rosy cheeks on my kids. But in all fairness, they rub their faces a lot when they are swimming so they may have rubbed it off. Overall, it kept us from being affected by the sun (and the only way I can judge that is by tan lines and pink skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion part may be the reason why it &#x27;sinks&#x27; in better and doesn&#x27;t seem to stay on the surface so much. Overall, a nice product and I like the scent.</li>
            <li> I spend a lot of time outside doing various activities and am fair-skinned and prone to burning. I love Banana Boat products and am rarely disappointed with them. This product is no exception. It smooths on nicely, leaves no greasy feeling, and works just as expected. It has a faint yet pleasant scent and provided just the right amount of moisture for my skin. All in all an excellent product!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion/sunscreen combination all summer and I&#x27;m happy to report, no burns!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live where both sunscreen and lotion on important during the summer so having something that combines both of those features is great. Sadly, most lotions irritate my skin and most sunscreen feels greasy to wear. This product didn&#x27;t bother my skin or feel greasy.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff! Makes my skin so soft and totally prevents sunburn!</li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any problems with this packaging.  It has a flip top and the product came out without any issues.  It comes out as a light green lotion that rubs in easily, leaving at first a white sheen but quickly fading to transparent.  It leaves skin incredibly soft and made even my dry knees and elbows feel wonderful.  Both my son and I used it many times out in the sun, either swimming or working in the garden, and neither of us had any sunburn at all, though we are very, very fair.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a smell.  I wouldn&#x27;t call it a fragrance though.  I usually like for things to smell good, and to me, this smells just a bit medicinal.  It&#x27;s very faint and I have to stick my nose right down on my skin to smell it.  People that don&#x27;t like fragrances will probably love it.  I like them a lot though.&lt;br /&gt;One thing I did notice was that one day when I shaved before putting it on, it made me itch a bit.  It didn&#x27;t do that any other time though.</li>
            <li> Banana Boat&#x27;s Protect &amp; Hydrate broad spectrum sunscreen is a nice addition to their line-up (we&#x27;d been using Banana Boat Sport Performance, which is more smelly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the Protect &amp; Hydrate on my face and find that is goes on smoothly and isn&#x27;t very smelly at all.  It goes on like a lotion product and is easy to smooth out.  It will still sting eyes, so you need to be careful around your eyes.  The Protect &amp; Hydrate has a Moisturizer claim - my skin felt softer after application, so, the moisturizer in the product does live up to its claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall a nice sunscreen that works well on faces.  It isn&#x27;t smelly &amp; it does help moisturize.  This is a product worth consideration.</li>
            <li> I have used this sunscreen in my pool multiple times in the last 30 days and I have to say, it doesn&#x27;t disappoint.  It goes and smooth and does seem to add a little extra hydration to your skin.  It lasted most of the afternoon which is about as good as i could expect being in and out of the water.  SPF 30 is perfect for good protection and allowing your skin to tan a little.  I would definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m of Irish/Dutch descent, so they don&#x27;t come much whiter than me! I did burn the first time I used this sunscreen, since I sweated it off, but it help up better when I re-applied it as it advises. As a sunscreen connoisseur, I&#x27;d say this one&#x27;s adequate for the task: not overly greasy or runny. Would definitely purchase and use on my disturbingly white skin.</li>
            <li> I like this sunscreen because it&#x27;s not greasy at all, and it hydrates your skin. However, if you are in the sun for a long period of time, this might not prevent you from burning. It&#x27;s better for a couple of hours than days of camping at a festival. I was definitely burned.</li>
            <li> We got to know this product during our stay in the US. We liked the combination of hydration and protection, and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t leave you with a greasy or sticky feeling. Back home, there was no comparable product, so we now order it at Amazon in the US - and with the costs for customs and shipping to Germany it is still cheaper as many products you can buy here.</li>
            <li> It moisturizes your skin without leaving a white residue.  Most importantly, my husband reacts very strongly (sneezes all day) to 99% of any scented products except this brand.  He can now enjoy using sunscreen again!</li>
            <li> Let me start by saying I hate sunscreens. They&#x27;re goopy, sticky and leave a film layer on your skin that make you look pale goth chick from the early 2000&#x27;s. Sometimes they smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so I&#x27;m middle aged and facing a few reality facts. One is, I&#x27;m not getting any younger, and another is my skin is drying out. I&#x27;m lucky enough to look about 10 years younger than I am, but in the last year or so, I&#x27;ve been getting those little dry age (liver) spots on my arms, so I&#x27;m taking evasive action now. First off, I stared using Dove Winter Care Beauty Bars (not just for winter!) for my shower, which I got here on Amazon, and that is the first step towards softer, more hydrated skin. Then I got CeraVe Moisturizing Cream, again on this site, because of the reviews. The last thing to round out my spree was this Banana Boat Hydrating Sunscreen. Wow, this is not how I remember Banana Boat. My 1st experience with this company was a smelly products. This stuff is clearly aimed at hydrating. It&#x27;s not thick, goes on easily, immediately hydrates, and with an SPF of 30, I have everything I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used this for about 3 days, but it&#x27;s already doing its job. 5-stars for this great product. Get protected from the sun and from dry skin!</li>
            <li> I use all the time for aftershave since I have a tendency toward skin cancer.</li>
            <li> I play tennis and I live in a dry area.  This is the BEST sunscreen.  It goes on easily and protects.  No sticky feeling.</li>
            <li> This is a really nice sunscreen. The lotion absorbs quickly into the skin. It does not leave any whitish hue on the skin. It is non-greasy. It leaves my skin nice and soft.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice, pleasant scent. I have been using this sunscreen for several weeks now and really like it.</li>
            <li> This is my favorite sunscreen, because it doesn&#x27;t feel sticky like sunscreen, just cool and refreshing like a lotion. I use it on my face as well as my body.</li>
            <li> Found this in Wyoming last year. Light not greasy and gives full coverage. Hydrates better then regular lotions. Love it, best ever!</li>
            <li> This works much better than their baseline product.</li>
            <li> I liked it , its a good sunscreen and moisturizing too.</li>
            <li> Went to camp with my son and he hasn&#x27;t had a sunburn yet according to the pictures!</li>
            <li> prevent sunburn, but still tanning, and don&#x27;t cause skin allergies</li>
            <li> Went to New Orleans and spent hours walking in the hot sun. No sunburn and no icky sticky sunscreen feeling. It did, however, sweat into my daughter&#x27;s eyes, which burned. Overall, we liked it.</li>
            <li> I use this as a daily moisturizer.  It is very light on the skin and absorbs quickly.  They just need to make a better bottle for it.</li>
