            <li>I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands of Sculpting foam and this is by far the best.  </li>
            <li>With repeated use, the ummpff isn&#x27;t as great as the first couple of uses</li>
            <li>This product was okay, I guess.  </li>
            <li>Love the coconut scent of this product.</li>
            <li>Better than anything you find among less-expensive hair products.</li>
            <li>I LOVE PAUL MICHELL SCULPTING FOAM</li>
            <li>I REALLY LOVE THIS FOAM</li>
            <li>I love this stuff and if they ever topped making it, I&#x27;d cry my eyes.</li>
            <li>Love this stuff.</li>
            <li>I use this product a lot and love the smell of coconut.</li>
            <li>In my case it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>/&gt;Overall it&#x27;s an okay product.</li>
            <li>I was entirely satisfied with the purchaseand will deal with this seller again.  </li>
            <li>but i won&#x27;t buy it again unless the top is modified.</li>
            <li>Wonderful coconut scent, perfect hold and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry the next day.</li>
            <li>Smells pretty good.</li>
            <li>This was recommended to me by a professional stylest at a Great Clips.  </li>
            <li>Best of all,this product works great both on wet/damp hair AND on dry hair to put life back in my curls on days</li>
            <li>Perhaps it is not meant for fine hair.</li>
            <li>Wish it was cheaper since I go through it quickly, but i love it.</li>
            <li>When will manufacturers stop covering up with cheap scents?  </li>
            <li>guess the good is that the I could constantly pull my hair to the side and it would hold for maybe 10 minutes at most</li>
            <li>I tried to return it, but Amazon won&#x27;t take it back because it&#x27;s considered a hazardous material!  </li>
            <li>Was very happy that it was delivered very timely and without any damage because it was wrapped tight in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li>I do like this...smells great, average curl hold, definition, and</li>
            <li>The same product purchased at my salon, but at a better price!  </li>
            <li>This made my hair definitely feel like it had some kind of product on it</li>
            <li>I bought this product with the fresh curls</li>
            <li>The fact that it&#x27;s not tested on Animals is pretty cool as a person of that belief.</li>
            <li>I have very fine hair and need something for extra volume and control.  </li>
            <li>This sculpting foam performs exactly as it should.  </li>
            <li>Definitely gives you more body, and makes it easier to style hair.</li>
            <li>This was my first mousse product and felt like I got ripped off.</li>
            <li>Anyway, I&#x27;m most likely not getting this product again.</li>
            <li>I will most definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li>have to wiggle back on but doesn&#x27;t fit right..</li>
            <li>I really like it, maybe not as much as some reviewers</li>
            <li>I have very wavy hair with loose curls that easily gets frizzy and out of control.  </li>
            <li>the first time i used it the top flipped off and now i have to hold it on and still have trouble getting the foam out.</li>
            <li>I love it so much, I would almost turn down chocolate for it.</li>
            <li>The product is good, only when you press the button to get the foam out, the foam just oozes out.</li>
            <li>My hair is curly (very) but not course at all - many products for curly hair tend to be too heavy and make my hair sticky.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for curly hair.</li>
            <li>I originally purchased a trial size of this product prior to a trip, but after the first use I knew this would become a product I&#x27;d use almost daily.  </li>
            <li>Just don&#x27;t know if its worth the extra money.  </li>
            <li>I like the Paul Mitchell Round Trip better for curly hair.</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s not hard and crunchy.</li>
            <li>AND IT DRY QUICK IN YOUR HAIR</li>
            <li>Light not heavy, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down.</li>
            <li>What a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you are wanting to keep a style, but still want your hair soft, this just isn&#x27;t the product.</li>
            <li>This product is an absolute must when getting my perm and later, when my perm needs a bit of a lift.  </li>
            <li>It controls some of my frizz while keeping my hair soft and natural looking.</li>
            <li>My hair has a natural tendency to puff out like a dandelion on humid days and this mousse tames the curls without &#x27;crunchiness&#x27;.  </li>
            <li>I did like how my hair looked styled and natural.</li>
            <li>I personally don&#x27;t like to use too many products on my hair or I at least get ones that still make my hair feel soft.  </li>
            <li>Different version of an older product with different name, sticky tag removed like it came from a wearhouse sale at a dollar store.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m not a mousse fan generally but this one makes my cut.  </li>
            <li>It clearly states on the back of the bottle that its &amp;#34;extremely flammable.&amp;#34;  </li>
            <li>To me the foam felt too watered down and the first time I saw that I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t work for me.</li>

            <li> Otherwise my hair would go flat and the product won&#x27;t help only leaving residue.</li>
            <li> This is a little bit pricey, but a little goes a long way, and it works so well that it&#x27;s worth the price.  </li>
            <li> For husband with wispy grey hair, it provides body.</li>
            <li> at the time my hair was about 5-6 inches long.</li>
            <li> If you want this product, please get it from anywhere else, a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> Naturally my hair is thin and sleek, and very soft</li>
            <li> I noticed some are using it with wavy hair and letting their hair air dry.  </li>
            <li> I scrunch it on to damp hair in the morning and then scrunch with a towel to get excess water and then just let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> For me with curly hair which turns massively frizzy in humid weather, it calms things down.  </li>
            <li> I use it with a hair dryer and also when I let my hair air dry!</li>
            <li> This is not a real Paul Mitchell product.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling stiff</li>
            <li> The scent is a little too strong for me, but that&#x27;s the only bad thing I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.  </li>
            <li> &gt; Read a few reviews from other people</li>
            <li> I have gotten other things from Paul Mitchel and was excited about trying out their mousse, but was beyond disappointed.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in place for long and eventually loses the formation.</li>
            <li> After shampooing, apply a little of it.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;d always get a stiff, crunchy look and feel that didn&#x27;t help me with styling it in the morning.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or stiff.  </li>
            <li> Then keep &#x27;picking&#x27; it while your hair dries so your hair doesn&#x27;t get stiff.  </li>
            <li> Not to thick or heavy lasts a while.</li>
            <li> The red cap broke so it&#x27;s difficult to use...</li>
            <li> Let me mention that my hair style isn&#x27;t complex.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and with a lot of frizz.  </li>
            <li> You don&#x27;t need a lot - a very small squirt</li>
            <li> This time the item arrived broken...</li>
            <li> It is a fake.</li>
            <li> People are buying the product, not some febreeze stinker.  </li>
            <li> Overpowering scent stinks.  </li>
            <li> Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s one of the worst hair products I have ever used.  </li>
    </ol>

    <ol>
            <li> This is not a real Paul Mitchell product. It is a fake. Do not buy it!</li>
            <li> This product was okay, I guess.  I personally don&#x27;t like to use too many products on my hair or I at least get ones that still make my hair feel soft.  This made my hair definitely feel like it had some kind of product on it and you couldn&#x27;t just run your fingers through your hair without having the gel/hairspray/mousse type feeling on your hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this if you are wanting to keep a style, but still want your hair soft, this just isn&#x27;t the product.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried many, many brands of Sculpting foam and this is by far the best.  You don&#x27;t need a lot - a very small squirt and it works wonders for my thinning hair.  Try it you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
            <li> Shipment arrived earlier than promised. Product is one I have used for years, and product was as advertised.</li>
            <li> Its a good product and works well.  Price is good.  Was very happy that it was delivered very timely and without any damage because it was wrapped tight in bubble wrap.</li>
            <li> Love the coconut scent of this product. Excellent for curly hair.</li>
            <li> Works great for curls. Definitely see a difference!  Foam has great hold on the hair. Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> This sculpting foam performs exactly as it should.  Hair styles easily, holds hair, and adds NO weight to the hair!!</li>
            <li> Definitely gives you more body, and makes it easier to style hair. Better than anything you find among less-expensive hair products.</li>
            <li> This product is an absolute must when getting my perm and later, when my perm needs a bit of a lift.  Paul Mitchell products are quality products.  Beware of imitations.</li>
            <li> I have thick curly hair and with a lot of frizz.  I bought this product with the fresh curls curl refiner from redken and its amazing how beautiful my curls look, even in humid weather! It was a tip from a curly salon worker in Sarasota, FL.</li>
            <li> I do like this...smells great, average curl hold, definition, and frizz control.  Just don&#x27;t know if its worth the extra money.  I like the Paul Mitchell Round Trip better for curly hair.</li>
            <li> I have very fine hair and need something for extra volume and control.  This was recommended to me by a professional stylest at a Great Clips.  The word &amp;#34;Flexible&amp;#34; is on the label.  It also says on the label that the product conrols &amp;#34;flyaways.&amp;#34;  What in the world????  This product GAVE my hair the flyaways!!  When I tried to use a curling iron with it, the hair would not slide off the curling iron; definitely not a flexible hold.  I&#x27;m going to return it and ask for my money back.  It&#x27;s one of the worst hair products I have ever used.  I noticed some are using it with wavy hair and letting their hair air dry.  Perhaps it is not meant for fine hair.</li>
            <li> Not what is pictured.  Different version of an older product with different name, sticky tag removed like it came from a wearhouse sale at a dollar store.  Smaller amount.  They should be held accountable.</li>
            <li> With repeated use, the ummpff isn&#x27;t as great as the first couple of uses</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple mouses for my wavy hair, especially one I could use at night and style in the morning. I&#x27;d always get a stiff, crunchy look and feel that didn&#x27;t help me with styling it in the morning. This not only promotes wave/curl but includes moisturizer that helps soften my hair so it&#x27;s not hard and crunchy. Wish it was cheaper since I go through it quickly, but i love it.</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for curly hair. It makes my hair look great and smell amazing.</li>
            <li> Love it and it works great for my hair!</li>
            <li> I LOVE PAUL MICHELL SCULPTING FOAM FOR THE HAIR IT NOT OILY AND IT DRY QUICK IN YOUR HAIR I REALLY LOVE THIS FOAM THE ONLY ONE I USE IN MY HAIR.</li>
            <li> Fast delivery, great product!!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a mousse fan generally but this one makes my cut.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair sticky or stiff.  It&#x27;s flexible with a terrific hold.</li>
            <li> For me with curly hair which turns massively frizzy in humid weather, it calms things down.  For husband with wispy grey hair, it provides body.</li>
            <li> Smells awesome and works great on my curly hair.</li>
            <li> Great hair product. Not to thick or heavy lasts a while.</li>
            <li> A little of this goes a long way.  After shampooing, apply a little of it.  Then keep &#x27;picking&#x27; it while your hair dries so your hair doesn&#x27;t get stiff.  It enhances the body and control added by the perm wave kit.</li>
            <li> Left my hair feeling stiff</li>
            <li> I love this stuff and if they ever topped making it, I&#x27;d cry my eyes. It controls some of my frizz while keeping my hair soft and natural looking. I scrunch it on to damp hair in the morning and then scrunch with a towel to get excess water and then just let my hair air dry.</li>
            <li> I really like it, maybe not as much as some reviewers but it&#x27;s definitely a nice product with a great smell. Makes your hair shiny and reduces/eliminates frizz.</li>
            <li> Love this stuff. Wonderful coconut scent, perfect hold and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair dry the next day. My hair has a natural tendency to puff out like a dandelion on humid days and this mousse tames the curls without &#x27;crunchiness&#x27;.  I love it so much, I would almost turn down chocolate for it. Almost.</li>
            <li> The product is good, only when you press the button to get the foam out, the foam just oozes out.</li>
            <li> Light not heavy, doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. Has an excellent hold. I use it with a hair dryer and also when I let my hair air dry!</li>
            <li> I use this product a lot and love the smell of coconut. This time the item arrived broken...The red cap broke so it&#x27;s difficult to use...have to wiggle back on but doesn&#x27;t fit right..The product itself is great, light, but manages hair even here in South Florida summers</li>
            <li> I originally purchased a trial size of this product prior to a trip, but after the first use I knew this would become a product I&#x27;d use almost daily.  I have very wavy hair with loose curls that easily gets frizzy and out of control.  This sculpting foam keeps my curls well-defined and frizz-free without making them crunchy and wet-looking.  Best of all,this product works great both on wet/damp hair AND on dry hair to put life back in my curls on days I&#x27;m not washing my hair.  This is a little bit pricey, but a little goes a long way, and it works so well that it&#x27;s worth the price.  The scent is a little too strong for me, but that&#x27;s the only bad thing I can say about this product.</li>
            <li> In my case it&#x27;s an okay product. Doesn&#x27;t hold my hair in place for long and eventually loses the formation. Let me mention that my hair style isn&#x27;t complex. Just a simple bangs comb-over to the side- at the time my hair was about 5-6 inches long. I also have a lot of hair. Like a lion. Haha.&lt;br /&gt; Read a few reviews from other people I could see how it would work for them and not me. Naturally my hair is thin and sleek, and very soft so I need a product that&#x27;s extra strength or gives me the extra volume to style my hair properly. Otherwise my hair would go flat and the product won&#x27;t help only leaving residue. To me the foam felt too watered down and the first time I saw that I knew that it wouldn&#x27;t work for me. I follow the directions of course. This was my first mousse product and felt like I got ripped off. I paid about $15 at my local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess the good is that the I could constantly pull my hair to the side and it would hold for maybe 10 minutes at most but I would have to do that throughout the day and having product in my hands until I wash them is not my thing. Smells pretty good. The fact that it&#x27;s not tested on Animals is pretty cool as a person of that belief. Anyway, I&#x27;m most likely not getting this product again. Too pricey for I would have to go through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall it&#x27;s an okay product. I did like how my hair looked styled and natural.</li>
            <li> The same product purchased at my salon, but at a better price!  I will most definitely purchase this product again!</li>
            <li> My hair is curly (very) but not course at all - many products for curly hair tend to be too heavy and make my hair sticky. This is perfect - light, airy, great distribution, and all day hold.</li>
            <li> Contains Propane.  Not kidding.  Listed as the fourth ingredient.  I tried to return it, but Amazon won&#x27;t take it back because it&#x27;s considered a hazardous material!  It clearly states on the back of the bottle that its &amp;#34;extremely flammable.&amp;#34;  What a huge waste of money.</li>
            <li> This product was recommended to me by my hairdresser.</li>
            <li> I was entirely satisfied with the purchaseand will deal with this seller again.  Paul Mitchell Sculpting Foam in the travel size is easy to pack, works well anfd is a good product.</li>
            <li> Overpowering scent stinks.  When will manufacturers stop covering up with cheap scents?  People are buying the product, not some febreeze stinker.  If people want perfume, let them buy perfume.</li>
            <li> I have gotten other things from Paul Mitchel and was excited about trying out their mousse, but was beyond disappointed. It looks like a bottle with a label glued on, and the top is nothing like in the picture, its this weird flimsy thing, and the mousse continues to come out even after you stop squeezing it. Also the mousse itself also doesn&#x27;t work, most likely fake like the bottle. If you want this product, please get it from anywhere else, a complete waste of my money.</li>
            <li> the first time i used it the top flipped off and now i have to hold it on and still have trouble getting the foam out. it is a very good product but i won&#x27;t buy it again unless the top is modified.</li>
            <li> One of the best products I have found to style my curls, offer them moisture and still keep my hair soft!</li>
