            <li>The atomized spray is very fine.  </li>
            <li>I am pleased with this bottle.</li>
            <li>Shipping included an appropriate size funnel.</li>
            <li>I would purchase more.</li>
            <li>My dad was so bummed thinking he wouldn&#x27;t be able</li>
            <li>The top of the canister of spray we use in the bathroom kept breaking (we think it&#x27;s a design flaw)</li>
            <li>Definitely glad we ordered this item.</li>
            <li>The product arrived on time and worked just fine a satisfied customer here.</li>
            <li>The atomizer was easy to fill with the included funnel.  </li>
            <li>This product came in on time and is easy to use.</li>
            <li>You have squeeze it a couple of times to get the perfume out, but it works fine.  </li>
            <li>We filled it up</li>
            <li>I ordered this because I had a perfume bottle that refused to spray although it was nearly full.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s nice because the drops are fine and the velocity is low.</li>
            <li>Be sure and clean it after every use, as it will clog if the ink dries and you will never get the sprayer clear again.</li>
            <li>I made my own scents with essential oils I bought on Amazon \\&quot;Edens</li>
            <li>A different color would have been a nice option.</li>
            <li>it was just the right size to fill from my perfume bottle...</li>
            <li>So far it works fine but doesn&#x27;t spray a lot with each pump of the bulb.  </li>
            <li>My daughter had this type bottle on the TOP of her ten year birthday list&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Would have done better to look at some local stores for this buy.  </li>
            <li>I use it for a cologne,and am pleased that the spray from it is diffuse compared with a different form of delivery.</li>
            <li>These are simple and elegant as wel as well made.</li>
            <li>Thank you so much!</li>
            <li>for/// would certainly reccommend for anyone</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m sure I could have found better quality for the same or, less.</li>
            <li>but it works very well.</li>
            <li>It is as the picture shows,just a glass bottle,nothing fancy,but very efficient.</li>
            <li>I tried again with another refill of water and mild rubbing alchohol, but it did not open up.&lt;br</li>
            <li>The bottle arrived quickly and is exactly what we expected!</li>
            <li>Just a note in case anybody else has this question:  Apparently this item may have come with a funnel at some point</li>

            <li> My daughter had this type bottle on the TOP of her ten year birthday list&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great size.  Durable.  We filled it up and she was happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice unit</li>
            <li> Saved a mega expensive bottle of perfume I broke the top on</li>
            <li> Very good purchase. Solved my need.</li>
            <li> Stops pumping all the time. Nice when it works</li>
            <li> Awesome product and service.  I ordered this with the hope of salvaging a perfume that I purchased and the sprayer did not work.  The atomizer was easy to fill with the included funnel.  Thank you!!</li>
            <li> Very nice. I made my own scents with essential oils I bought on Amazon \\&quot;Edens Garden\\&quot;. One is Lavender -- I spray on my pillow before I sleep. I call it my \\&quot;Sleeping Potion\\&quot;. I might make extras for gifts.</li>
            <li> Arrived broken and I returned.  The return was no problem.</li>
            <li> Pros: good size, attractive, nice materials/construction&lt;br /&gt;Cons: with only water in it, it ceased to function after 2 days.  I tried again with another refill of water and mild rubbing alchohol, but it did not open up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully this is just a lemon and not indicative of the entire line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
            <li> The product arrived on time and worked just fine a satisfied customer here.</li>
            <li> This product came in on time and is easy to use. The fabric surrounding the squeeze portion started to unwind after 10 uses.</li>
            <li> This was the perfect replacement for the &#x27;antique&#x27; unit I had. not fancy but it works very well. I use it to create a textural spray of ink on drawings. Be sure and clean it after every use, as it will clog if the ink dries and you will never get the sprayer clear again.</li>
            <li> I ordered this because I had a perfume bottle that refused to spray although it was nearly full. I like this because you can get the fragrance where you want it to go.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone who likes to smell &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34;.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s just what I was looking for as a theatrical prop.</li>
            <li> The glass is very thin. I&#x27;m afraid I&#x27;m going to break it.  Would have done better to look at some local stores for this buy.  I&#x27;m sure I could have found better quality for the same or, less.</li>
            <li> purchased as a gift...the receiver  loves it.. she used it as soon as she got it,,that was a perfect size</li>
            <li> it doesn&#x27;t work I have to keep taking it out to use the perfume. I will have to order something different</li>
            <li> Great for switching out your perfume from bottles that are aerosol propelled.  No more perfume stuck in your nose!</li>
            <li> what I expected...good atomizer....it was just the right size to fill from my perfume bottle...atomizer works well and sprays well.</li>
            <li> I thought the bottle was like crystal instead of glass.... at least, thats what picture looked like...&lt;br /&gt;Yolanda Dutari</li>
            <li> I am pleased with this bottle.I use it for a cologne,and am pleased that the spray from it is diffuse compared with a different form of delivery.It is as the picture shows,just a glass bottle,nothing fancy,but very efficient.</li>
            <li> Very good, sprays well.  My husband extremely happy with it.  He had a Cologne that would not spray, so we got this.</li>
            <li> These are simple and elegant as wel as well made. Shipping included an appropriate size funnel. I would purchase more.</li>
            <li> product was gift for friend. it arrived earlier than promised and just what friend was lookin for/// would certainly reccommend for anyone</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m using it to spritz photography props with water and glycerin. It&#x27;s nice because the drops are fine and the velocity is low.</li>
            <li> I found that the spray doesn&#x27;t come out well.</li>
            <li> The item was as described.  Heavy glass.  So far it works fine but doesn&#x27;t spray a lot with each pump of the bulb.  Just a note in case anybody else has this question:  Apparently this item may have come with a funnel at some point but no longer does.  In the reviews, one person mentioned something about having received a funnel along with the atomizer, but a set of funnels is listed in the &amp;#34;Frequently bought together&amp;#34; items.  So I listed the question.  Some said they did receive a funnel, some said they did not.  I did not receive one, so don&#x27;t expect one and order a set.</li>
            <li> I purchased this after I dropped my perfume bottle, which caused the spray to stop working.  I transferred my perfume to this bottle.  You have squeeze it a couple of times to get the perfume out, but it works fine.  My only complaint is that I have to continuously tighten the metal lid to the glass bottom or else a little perfume leaks out when I shake it.</li>
            <li> The opening for the sprayer is so tiny, hardly any comes out. You have to pump and pump to get any at all. I should have sent it back.</li>
            <li> It was perfect!! Thank you so much! My dad was so bummed thinking he wouldn&#x27;t be able use the last of his cologne due to the nozzle broken.</li>
            <li> The top of the canister of spray we use in the bathroom kept breaking (we think it&#x27;s a design flaw) so ordered this to dispense the product. Works perfectly, and looks so much nicer than the can.</li>
            <li> The bottle arrived quickly and is exactly what we expected! Definitely glad we ordered this item. A different color would have been a nice option.</li>
            <li> The atomized spray is very fine.  It us working well.</li>
            <li> Strangely, this is not used for what you may think.  My club is building a model railroad and we build everything using superglue.  After applying the glue and small mist of water and the glue sets up.  Cuts down on construction time.</li>
            <li> i love it! a must buy if you love perfume!!</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t spray at all</li>
    </ol>
