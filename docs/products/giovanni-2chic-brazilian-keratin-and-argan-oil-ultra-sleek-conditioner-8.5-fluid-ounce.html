            <li>It is the best conditioner I have ever used for the humid climate in which I live.</li>
            <li>this is by far the best conditioner that I have tried, and i have tried many.</li>
            <li>and I have to say this is my favorite conditioner by the Giovanni hair care line.  </li>
            <li>For those who color their hair I think this this line retains the color longer than most shampoos and conditioners.</li>

            <li>I love the scent-</li>
            <li>This one is the one I&#x27;ve used the most.</li>
            <li>Very good product, especially for the price.</li>
            <li>This 2Chic Ultra-Sleek line does not have very many online reviews at this time, but the reviews I did find were predominately positive.</li>
            <li>It has great slip and leaves my hair soft and tangle free</li>
            <li>The price is certainly more than the popularly marketed brands (Pantene Pro-V, Herbal Essences, etc) but is still very modest when compared to many high-end/salon products.</li>
            <li>I style with Aveda Confixor Liquid Gel which does the trick just fine.</li>
            <li>Saw it available on Amazon.</li>
            <li>it has a light, fruity scent.</li>
            <li>I use the shampoo from this line with this conditioner and find that my hair is smooth and moisturized.</li>
            <li>My wife mentioned that after her showers she now doesn&#x27;t have to comb out her hair because this product leaves it compltely snag and tangle free.</li>
            <li>Everyone is different, but it&#x27;s been a great find for me.</li>
            <li>I have very dry hair, and this product leaves my hair smooth and it smells great.</li>
            <li>The conditioner rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a residue or film on my hair or build up.</li>
            <li>It feels clean and conditioned.  </li>
            <li>I have always had a hard time with finding hair care products for my hair but this is PERFECT!!!!</li>
            <li>I cannot express enough how delighted I am with this product.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair felt this good.  </li>
            <li>My hair is very fine though so at times I feel like I need something extra to give it more definition.</li>
            <li>Even without blow drying my hair is pretty much smooth.</li>
            <li>I have fine, straight hair.</li>
            <li>This is the kind of conditioner that softens instantly.  </li>
            <li>I purchased this product to try and add to our lineup of more natural homecare products we use.</li>
            <li>It was recommended by someone in the know, and she was right.</li>
            <li>In the past I have used Giovanni hair products and was happy with the results.</li>
            <li>and I don&#x27;t have to use much heat to straighten my hair because my hair cuticle and texture is already smooth and straight.  </li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t moisturize half as good as even cheaper brands.</li>
            <li>Now  I have found this 2Chic Conditioner w/Keratin &amp; Argan OIl, and my hair really loves it!</li>
            <li>After the sampoo, it smoothes my hair so luxuriously and makes it ready for anything!</li>
            <li>You can check them out on the ewg site if you are interested in toxicity of products you use.</li>
            <li>I also have to say that I have a very healthy hair regimen and also get my hair trimmed regularly, so the 2chic line along with regular maintenance works for my hair.  </li>
            <li>Yet this conditioner has certainly improved the look and feel of my hair, even after just one use.</li>
            <li>Really like this conditioner</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;m really picky.  </li>
            <li>The shampoo seemed to be very drying but once applying the conditioner it felt like butter.</li>
            <li>I try to steer toward Paraben free &amp; sulfate free products, but only if it actually does well with my hair.  </li>
            <li>My hair feels much much silkier and looks healthier after just one week of use.</li>
            <li>Although there is still damage from wearing a hat, it looks and feels much smoother since using this product.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a couple other natural hair products in the past (Burt&#x27;s Bees, BWC) and have not been impressed.  </li>
            <li>After the first week I&#x27;ve noticed a complete softness to my hair that I haven&#x27;t had in awhile.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different conditioners over the years, the most recent being the Moroccan Oil brand.  </li>
            <li>Also give the 2chic Ultra-Sleek Hair &amp; Body Super Potion on the ends of your hair has well or before you blow dry as a protectant.</li>
            <li>I have very wild hair.  </li>
            <li>It is better than the average conditioner (although easier to detangle) but hasn&#x27;t solved my issue or hydrated my hair enough to prevent knots of that size.</li>
            <li>This conditioner is very thick, and leaves their hair nice and soft.  </li>
            <li>But after using this conditioner she said my split ends weren&#x27;t that bad and my hair looked really healthy. :)</li>
            <li>I browsed the organic section of a local store to see what is available locally, and then cross referenced with some internet research.</li>
            <li>I prefer to find natural options-</li>
            <li>Works ok, smells ok, unfortunately it has Phenoxyethanol in it... which made me sad as I really love this brand in general.</li>
            <li>I have relatively straight hair, but when I don&#x27;t blow it dry</li>
            <li>Because they are young and don&#x27;t have as much oil in their hair as an older child or adult would have, I only use actual shampoo on their hair once a week, and instead just wash it with this conditioner every other day.  </li>
            <li>By the way I&#x27;m an adult Caucasian male of western European descent, so don&#x27;t pay too much attention to people who say this product is for \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair only.  </li>
            <li>I personally like the fact that they use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li>Because this conditioner is so thick and creamy, it is fantastic for detangling their hair-</li>
            <li>i&#x27;ve had such a hard time finding a cruelty free conditioner that works as well as salon and name brands that do test on animals.</li>
            <li>My wife and I are both early 30&#x27;s, white people (she is 100% Italian though).</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive shampoos and conditioners in an effort to calm down my oddly textured hair.</li>
            <li>If you have thin, fine hair this shampoo will pull all your hairs out.</li>
            <li>The price is very reasonable, and just a little of this product goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>My hair is fine, meaning each strand of hair is thin and fragile, but it has varying degrees of curl/</li>

            <li> My hair is fine, meaning each strand of hair is thin and fragile, but it has varying degrees of curl/</li>
            <li> I color my hair and it tends to get dry unless I condition heavily, which can weigh it down because it&#x27;s fine.</li>
            <li> I have unusually dry hair, and this product has made a big difference.  </li>
            <li> it is very subtle yet sweet.  </li>
            <li> I found out this is used by a lot of ethnic women and also women with grey hair.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner on my two little girls&#x27; hair, which is super curly but also thin and silky.  </li>
            <li> Gets very dry and brittle</li>
            <li> The fact that it&#x27;s also free of Phthalates, artificial fragrance, dyes, sulfates, parabens and PEGs is definitely a big plus, in my humble opinion.</li>
            <li> AT OUR RETIREMENT CENTER.  </li>
            <li> I rub it into the ends of their hair after their bath while it&#x27;s still wet and work it into their roots.  </li>
            <li> I have thick, naturally wavy, course textured hair.  </li>
            <li> Personal Background: I have been struggling lately with dry and damaged hair.  </li>
            <li> This product worked extremely well for both our hair types.</li>
            <li> I find that my hair sheds less in the shower</li>
            <li> it just looks little frizzy and drab.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a tough consumer to crack, but I&#x27;m a big fan of this conditioner.</li>
            <li> Now, I understand that my hair had been through a lot lately, and no product (despite how hard they try to claim such) can literally undo damage.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this keratin shampoo and conditioner for a few years with my Brazilian blowouts.  </li>
            <li> It does smooth it as promised, but i was so disappointed  that I lost so much hair :(</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews for products, but this conditioner blows me away.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been frowning my hair out and my stylist tells me all the time how I have the healthiest hair, when in the past I&#x27;ve been told my hair is just mousey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have really thick hair and this product gets the job done!</li>
            <li> I know that has been contributing to the damage, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s a non-negotiable for sun protection.)  </li>
            <li> I am very disappointed.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> After chemo my hair grew out like wavy straw.  This product actually makes it feel silky.  All the hair products in the drug store are ripoffs.  This one actually does what it claims.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product (shampoo and conditioner) for about three months now and I have to say this is my favorite conditioner by the Giovanni hair care line.  I am an African American woman with medium length relaxed hair.  I work out often so I will conditioner wash my hair with this product and always get great results.  I also have to say that I have a very healthy hair regimen and also get my hair trimmed regularly, so the 2chic line along with regular maintenance works for my hair.  For those who color their hair I think this this line retains the color longer than most shampoos and conditioners. I find that my hair sheds less in the shower and I don&#x27;t have to use much heat to straighten my hair because my hair cuticle and texture is already smooth and straight.  Also give the 2chic Ultra-Sleek Hair &amp; Body Super Potion on the ends of your hair has well or before you blow dry as a protectant.</li>
            <li> Really like this conditioner and I&#x27;m really picky.  I have bleach highlights and colored hair.  Gets very dry and brittle especially cause I use&lt;br /&gt;hair spray every day.  This is the kind of conditioner that softens instantly.  I add some to the driest parts and leave in.  I bought 3 tubes.</li>
            <li> This conditioner smells great and was really moisturizing. The shampoo seemed to be very drying but once applying the conditioner it felt like butter. I didn&#x27;t feel the shampoo or conditioner did a very great job at straightening the hair though. The smell of the shampoo and conditioner smelled really amazing</li>
            <li> In the past I have used Giovanni hair products and was happy with the results. There was a roll on product for the hair that I absolutely loved, but then it was discontinued. Now  I have found this 2Chic Conditioner w/Keratin &amp; Argan OIl, and my hair really loves it! After the sampoo, it smoothes my hair so luxuriously and makes it ready for anything! I cannot express enough how delighted I am with this product. The price is very reasonable, and just a little of this product goes a long way!&lt;br /&gt;I just love it!  Buy Giovanni Organic Cosmetic 2Chic Conditioner w/Keratin &amp; Argan! You will be happy with this purchase!</li>
            <li> This is my favorite conditioner for my hair type. I have always had a hard time with finding hair care products for my hair but this is PERFECT!!!!</li>
            <li> I found this by accident. It is the best conditioner I have ever used for the humid climate in which I live. Even without blow drying my hair is pretty much smooth. I found out this is used by a lot of ethnic women and also women with grey hair. I am neither. So I guess this works for everyone.</li>
            <li> If you have thin, fine hair this shampoo will pull all your hairs out. It does smooth it as promised, but i was so disappointed  that I lost so much hair :(</li>
            <li> Works ok, smells ok, unfortunately it has Phenoxyethanol in it... which made me sad as I really love this brand in general.</li>
            <li> best conditioner i&#x27;ve found that doesnt test on animals. i&#x27;ve had such a hard time finding a cruelty free conditioner that works as well as salon and name brands that do test on animals. this is by far the best conditioner that I have tried, and i have tried many. I have dry/normal curly/wavy hair with a scalp that only gets oily after like 3-4 days and this works for me!</li>
            <li> I have very wild hair.  I cannot say this product tames it, but I see some improvement with this conditioner.</li>
            <li> It has great slip and leaves my hair soft and tangle free I love it ! I have really thick hair and this product gets the job done!</li>
            <li> i GOT A SAMPLE THIS PRODUCT OFF THE FREEBIE TABLE AT OUR RETIREMENT CENTER.  i USED IT AND WAS SO THRILLED WITH THE RESULTS ON MY SILVER PLATINUM HAIR I IMMEDIATELY CHECKED WHERE I COULD PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT.  IT IS A 5 STAR FOR ME.</li>
            <li> I am very disappointed. It didn&#x27;t moisturize half as good as even cheaper brands. I ended up using it to shave my legs.</li>
            <li> Great product, tried it on vacation and loved it. Saw it available on Amazon. And it&#x27;s easier to get it here than scouring stores and wasting time trying to find it when you can have it delivered to your door.</li>
            <li> I use this conditioner on my two little girls&#x27; hair, which is super curly but also thin and silky.  This conditioner is very thick, and leaves their hair nice and soft.  Because they are young and don&#x27;t have as much oil in their hair as an older child or adult would have, I only use actual shampoo on their hair once a week, and instead just wash it with this conditioner every other day.  Because this conditioner is so thick and creamy, it is fantastic for detangling their hair- I rub it in, comb it through, and leave it on for about five minutes before rinsing it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use a tiny amount as a leave-in conditioner- I rub it into the ends of their hair after their bath while it&#x27;s still wet and work it into their roots.  The Giovanni company does make a leave-in serum, but after trying it I prefer to use this conditioner as a leave-in treatment instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and it smells great- it has a light, fruity scent.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used this keratin shampoo and conditioner for a few years with my Brazilian blowouts.  I have very dry hair, and this product leaves my hair smooth and it smells great.</li>
            <li> I have unusually dry hair, and this product has made a big difference.  It was recommended by someone in the know, and she was right.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried far more expensive shampoos and conditioners in an effort to calm down my oddly textured hair. My hair is fine, meaning each strand of hair is thin and fragile, but it has varying degrees of curl/frizz throughout and some coarse areas. I color my hair and it tends to get dry unless I condition heavily, which can weigh it down because it&#x27;s fine. I use the shampoo from this line with this conditioner and find that my hair is smooth and moisturized. The conditioner rinses clean and doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a residue or film on my hair or build up. I can&#x27;t believe it is so inexpensive. I&#x27;m hooked.</li>
            <li> I usually don&#x27;t write reviews for products, but this conditioner blows me away. I picked it up at my local organic grocery store although next time I&#x27;ll purchase it on amazon because it&#x27;s cheaper.  I can&#x27;t remember the last time my hair felt this good.  It feels clean and conditioned.  I&#x27;ve tried dozens of different conditioners over the years, the most recent being the Moroccan Oil brand.  I like the Giovanni way better.  By the way I&#x27;m an adult Caucasian male of western European descent, so don&#x27;t pay too much attention to people who say this product is for \\&quot;ethnic\\&quot; hair only.  I also suffer all kinds of allergies and this product passes the test.</li>
            <li> I purchased this product to try and add to our lineup of more natural homecare products we use. Obviously products like this work differently for everyone since we all have different types of hair. My wife and I are both early 30&#x27;s, white people (she is 100% Italian though). This product worked extremely well for both our hair types. My wife mentioned that after her showers she now doesn&#x27;t have to comb out her hair because this product leaves it compltely snag and tangle free. This is a great product and I would recommend to anyone to give it a shot. Enjoy!</li>
            <li> Personal Background: I have been struggling lately with dry and damaged hair.  I have thick, naturally wavy, course textured hair.  I am also on a mission to simplify my health/beauty regimens, but my hair was not responding well to DIY baking soda shampooing, or DIY coconut oil / egg protein treatments.  I exercise often, and sweat a lot when doing so, thus the \\&quot;no shampoo\\&quot; route simply won&#x27;t cut it for me.  (Also, I wear a hat when I workout- I know that has been contributing to the damage, but unfortunately, that&#x27;s a non-negotiable for sun protection.)  I browsed the organic section of a local store to see what is available locally, and then cross referenced with some internet research. I prefer to find natural options- I try to steer toward Paraben free &amp; sulfate free products, but only if it actually does well with my hair.  I&#x27;ve used a couple other natural hair products in the past (Burt&#x27;s Bees, BWC) and have not been impressed.  This 2Chic Ultra-Sleek line does not have very many online reviews at this time, but the reviews I did find were predominately positive. The price is certainly more than the popularly marketed brands (Pantene Pro-V, Herbal Essences, etc) but is still very modest when compared to many high-end/salon products. I found the price at my local store is actually cheaper than online (plus the bottle had a $2 off coupon attached) so I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works: Now, I understand that my hair had been through a lot lately, and no product (despite how hard they try to claim such) can literally undo damage.  Yet this conditioner has certainly improved the look and feel of my hair, even after just one use. I&#x27;m a tough consumer to crack, but I&#x27;m a big fan of this conditioner. My hair feels much much silkier and looks healthier after just one week of use. Although there is still damage from wearing a hat, it looks and feels much smoother since using this product. I love the scent- it is very subtle yet sweet.  The fact that it&#x27;s also free of Phthalates, artificial fragrance, dyes, sulfates, parabens and PEGs is definitely a big plus, in my humble opinion. Everyone is different, but it&#x27;s been a great find for me.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m still in search for the perfect conditioner.  I just recently started highlighting my hair and since then, I&#x27;ve had these golf ball sized knots!  I was told to get this product to see if it would work.  It is better than the average conditioner (although easier to detangle) but hasn&#x27;t solved my issue or hydrated my hair enough to prevent knots of that size.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner. I have relatively straight hair, but when I don&#x27;t blow it dry it just looks little frizzy and drab. This conditioner keeps my hair just as moisturizes as a keratin treatment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been frowning my hair out and my stylist tells me all the time how I have the healthiest hair, when in the past I&#x27;ve been told my hair is just mousey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of Giovanni products and they are all great. This one is the one I&#x27;ve used the most. You can check them out on the ewg site if you are interested in toxicity of products you use. I personally like the fact that they use natural ingredients.</li>
            <li> Very good product, especially for the price. My hair is very fine though so at times I feel like I need something extra to give it more definition. I style with Aveda Confixor Liquid Gel which does the trick just fine.</li>
            <li> My boyfriend bought me this product in response to my \\&quot;please pick me up some conditioner, any kind will do\\&quot; text. He talked to one of the girls at the counter and I&#x27;m sure happy he did! After the first week I&#x27;ve noticed a complete softness to my hair that I haven&#x27;t had in awhile. My hair practically soaks this conditioner up in the shower! I just wash my hair, add conditioner then finish my shower and rinse my hair at the end. I have fine, straight hair. I don&#x27;t get my hair trimmed enough and it was riddled with split ends the last time I saw my hair stylist. But after using this conditioner she said my split ends weren&#x27;t that bad and my hair looked really healthy. :)</li>
