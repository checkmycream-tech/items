            <li>Works great for about an hour</li>
            <li>Coat hair good with it.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
            <li>I bought this junk because the good stuff started to lose its effectiveness</li>
            <li>I used this shampoo for 4 weeks to give it a fair shot but couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore.  </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement - and it smells good!</li>
            <li>Absolutely love this shampo and now can go for two days without shampooing!</li>
            <li>This shampoo is amazing.  </li>
            <li>This is incredibly effective in treating folliculitis.</li>
            <li>This shampoo smells good, feels good on my scalp and keeps my hair oil free for about 4 days before it starts to show signs of oiliness.</li>
            <li>others that I&#x27;ve liked were always discontinued.  </li>
            <li>some of the good shampoos are so concentrated that I&#x27;ve had to add water to them in my hands just to be able to spread all over my hair/scalp.  </li>
            <li>it did make scalp feel nice and tingly and that was all</li>
            <li>But, I found this, looked/sounded good, used it and the first time you use it, your hair feels soooooooooooooooooo CLEAN and wonderful afterwards.  </li>
            <li>This is ok, but I have found a holistic one on this site that does a much better job.</li>
            <li>and it does not matter how many times he washed it per day</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve had problems with oily hair/scalp since I was a teenager and this shampoo definitely ranks in the best top 3 I&#x27;ve used over the years.  </li>
            <li>if anything, i think it causes a rebound effect and makes my hair more oily,and sooner, since it is so stripping.</li>
            <li>Have found another product(tea tree shampoo) to be more appropriate my scalp condition.</li>
            <li>; feeling sits in, a couple more minutes</li>
            <li>This shampoo, along with astringent, has made a huge difference, and she&#x27;s feeling more self-confident.  </li>
            <li>Would have been an easy 5 stars with a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Other wise it is a good product and it came quickly.</li>
            <li>Very fresh mint scent</li>
            <li>Anyone that is familiar with this condition is well aware that an itchy area is forbidden from touching in any way.  </li>
            <li>When I used it last night, my hair felt so good and fresh!</li>
            <li>Absolutely the best shampoo we have tried for my little one&#x27;s hair.</li>
            <li>Helped cleanse my hair tremendously</li>
            <li>for the products - they have been tremendous.</li>
            <li>normally if i wash it in the morning, at night it will look okay.</li>
            <li>this shampoo is very concentrated but surprisingly easy to use.  </li>
            <li>have been using this Thera-Rx skin wash for several months and find it verify effective for quickly easing &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34;.  </li>
            <li>wow, the difference is striking.</li>
            <li>results so far is that this skin wash product is most effective for &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34;, especially in the event a pustule hemorrhages.</li>
            <li>The top was not tight on the shampoo and it leaked out.</li>
            <li>Its a great product, did the job, but eventually my hair balanced out and went back to normal, thus I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.  </li>
            <li>Cleared right up.</li>
            <li>and it really clears out oil from scalp and hair!</li>
            <li>- I am a male w/ very short hair, so this regime is very quick and easy.</li>
            <li>He has very greasy hair</li>
            <li>My hairs is very oily and with dandruff.</li>
            <li>I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li>Makes hair feel thicker,  Cleans really well.</li>
            <li>this absolutely does not work, it does not do anything for regulating an oily scalp.</li>
            <li>Product works very well.  </li>
            <li>It hasn&#x27;t cured it, but it has decreased it by about 90% which is a great improvement.  </li>
            <li>This shampoo keeps the oil away for the whole day.</li>
            <li>Since the Drs say there is nothing else available, I&#x27;ve decided to try combinations of topical products in additional to my Rx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>for reference, my hair is super oily and i have to wash it daily.</li>
            <li>Highly recommend.</li>
            <li>When our pre-teen suddenly developed truly oily hair, it was absolutely necessary to find something to keep her hair clean.  </li>
            <li>you have red bumps on your scalp, these 2 products are worth a shot.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve have scalp folliculitis for over 10 years and been through various treatments which all lead to same issue of becoming resistant.  </li>
            <li>The irritation is normally tolerable if not gone within minutes.</li>
            <li>but with this, it starts to look pretty oily after only like 12 hours.</li>
            <li>My head is completely clear after using this shampoo for about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li>I tried all sorts of natural remedies: baking soda, vinegar, &amp;#34;no &#x27;poo,&amp;#34; etc.</li>
            <li>(as all products do when used frequently).  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll also note that when either directly applied or applied with dampened swab onto a pustule, for 10+ minutes, it seems speed up them drying out/</li>
            <li>They say shampooing oily hair every day actually creates MORE oil, so I TRIED to only do it every other day.  </li>
            <li>I&#x27;m only saying it doesn&#x27;t work for me with my particular condition.</li>
            <li>It just strips your hair like any ordinary, cheap clarifying shampoo does.  </li>
            <li>Next morning, shower and wash hair again, apply normal hair stuff for day.&lt;br /&gt;Note</li>
            <li>My hair is not extremely oily</li>
            <li>Years ago I learned the itch from mosquito bites is caused by the bacteria injected into the skin, which also gets worse when scratched as more bacteria is added.</li>
            <li>I normally put several drops directly onto the effected area and let it sit and dry.  </li>
            <li>the smell is a little strong, but does not linger in her hair like the other dandruff shampoos we have tried.</li>
            <li>The skin wash and solv-x shampoo BY FAR have reduced my red bumps that can get big and nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>a little goes a long way, and i saw a major improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li>/&gt;These 2 products have not gotten rid of the bumps completely, but the bumps are less frequent and usually smaller.</li>

            <li> /&gt;These 2 products have not gotten rid of the bumps completely, but the bumps are less frequent and usually smaller.</li>
            <li> I tried using two washes, using a small amount, using a large amount, nothing seemed to work.</li>
            <li> Dry hair out of shower, apply skin wash ONLY at night.</li>
            <li> Add to that the fact that all day I wear headphones with a pleather headband that rests and moves about on my scalp, and I looked (and as a result, felt) like a complete mess by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and my sticky scalp problem has completely cleared</li>
            <li> I found it did not work as well as other similar products for my hair type.</li>
            <li> I now only use it once every 10 days or so (alternating between other shampoos of course)</li>
            <li> With other shampoos, only washing every other day was a struggle...even using a TON of dry shampoo on the off days.  </li>
            <li> I can now go TWO days in between washes (using dry shampoo to refresh on those days) and my hair isn&#x27;t oily!  </li>
            <li> I was skeptical at first, especially given the price tag, but this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Once my hair dried it would be flat and lifeless.</li>
            <li> Tried Neutrogena TGel, Ketoconazole shampoo (otc and Rx) and some other stuff I tried from Walmart.</li>
            <li> Not sure how it would work for a female w/ longer</li>
            <li> I have oily long hair, but it is time consuming to wash everyday.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair.  </li>
            <li> I didn&#x27;t have any conditions like other reviewers here, so that wasn&#x27;t applicable to me.</li>
            <li> I used to have to wash my hair every day or every other day.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s hard enough going through puberty without everyone looking at your hair before your face.</li>
            <li> It was a mess.</li>
            <li> The bottle was a mess.</li>
            <li> but I wash it everyday</li>
            <li> but it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> I have naturally thin hair which only appeared thinner with the added oil.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll spot treat the irritated area with the skin wash, let it sit for few minutes, then will follow it with their Solv-X product.  </li>
            <li> only complaint is that the shampoo itself is rather thick and a little difficult to work into a lather, but it&#x27;s a minor squabble.</li>
            <li> Before looking for it, I noticed my hair got way oilier, way sooner than usual.  </li>
            <li> Just a small amount leaked out so</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this product, but I was getting really sick of getting up in the morning, washing my hair in the shower, and going to work only to have my head turn into a greasy mess by noon.</li>
            <li> I suffer from folliculitis and my red bumps would get bad.</li>
            <li> My case of red bumps was really bad at times and it seemed that they appeared over night.</li>
            <li> (Previously the only thing that worked for me was Accutane, which has truly nasty side effects).</li>
            <li> The smell of the shampoo is also terrible - very chemical smelling.</li>
            <li> Only negative (as others have posted) - Amazon&#x27;s shipping/packaging on this is terrible.</li>
            <li> Made my scalp itch even worse!</li>
            <li> Unfortunately this stuff just doesn&#x27;t work on my hair.</li>
            <li> Expensive tub cleaner...</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to use this because I didn&#x27;t think I had an oily scalp, but the residue I had was oil/extra</li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive, but not as bad as RX products.  </li>
            <li> So expensive for nothing!</li>
    </ol>

            <li> This is ok, but I have found a holistic one on this site that does a much better job.</li>
            <li> I need to put a lot in my hand to wash my hair and I didnt see any difference, I still need to wash my hair every day.So expensive for nothing!</li>
            <li> Great for oily hair. Cleans hair and scalp real good.</li>
            <li> My friend recommended this shampoo for my husband hair. He has very greasy hair and it does not matter how many times he washed it per day, the oil was there all the time. This shampoo is amazing.  I can only tell you if you have oily hair....PLEASE GIVE IT A TRY!</li>
            <li> I found it did not work as well as other similar products for my hair type. My hairs is very oily and with dandruff. If use two douses a day it still leaves dandruff and gets oily by the end of the day.</li>
            <li> Helped cleanse my hair tremendously</li>
            <li> Only negative (as others have posted) - Amazon&#x27;s shipping/packaging on this is terrible. I ordered the skin wash and solv-x shampoo, both bottles were leaking. It was a mess. I called Amazon and got some $ back as a result. If enough people complain, maybe they will alter the shipping and packaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the products - they have been tremendous. I suffer from folliculitis and my red bumps would get bad. Tried Neutrogena TGel, Ketoconazole shampoo (otc and Rx) and some other stuff I tried from Walmart. The skin wash and solv-x shampoo BY FAR have reduced my red bumps that can get big and nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what I do:&lt;br /&gt;1) Wash hair with solv-x shampoo in shower morning and night. I put it on just after getting in the shower and leave it on till the end of my shower.&lt;br /&gt;2) Dry hair out of shower, apply skin wash ONLY at night. Coat hair good with it.&lt;br /&gt;3) Leave skin wash on all night.&lt;br /&gt;4) Next morning, shower and wash hair again, apply normal hair stuff for day.&lt;br /&gt;Note - I am a male w/ very short hair, so this regime is very quick and easy. Not sure how it would work for a female w/ longer hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know the instructions say to put it on before the shower and then rinse it off. My case of red bumps was really bad at times and it seemed that they appeared over night. So I just leave the skin wash all night to hopefully combat those bumps. I also sweat a lot while sleeping, so that could be the issue there. I can&#x27;t stop the sweating, so the skin wash for now appears to fight whatever is actually causing these bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These 2 products have not gotten rid of the bumps completely, but the bumps are less frequent and usually smaller. And this treatment has been the only treatment that actually helped. Everything else I tried up to this point did nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have red bumps on your scalp, these 2 products are worth a shot.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t do anything but stink</li>
            <li> Made my scalp itch even worse! I&#x27;ll stick with tea tree.</li>
            <li> This is incredibly effective in treating folliculitis. (Previously the only thing that worked for me was Accutane, which has truly nasty side effects). My head is completely clear after using this shampoo for about 6 weeks.</li>
            <li> I have oily long hair, but it is time consuming to wash everyday. This shampoo smells good, feels good on my scalp and keeps my hair oil free for about 4 days before it starts to show signs of oiliness. Great product. I would highly recommend it!</li>
            <li> Would have been an easy 5 stars with a lower price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had a bunch of bumps on the back of my head, didn&#x27;t bother to find out what they were, just got this and used it for a couple weeks. Cleared right up.</li>
            <li> I have extremely oily hair.  They say shampooing oily hair every day actually creates MORE oil, so I TRIED to only do it every other day.  With other shampoos, only washing every other day was a struggle...even using a TON of dry shampoo on the off days.  After a lady at Ulta told me shampoo for oily hair didn&#x27;t exsist, I turned to Amazon and found this.  This shampoo has literally changed my life!  I can now go TWO days in between washes (using dry shampoo to refresh on those days) and my hair isn&#x27;t oily!  It&#x27;s AMAZING!!  I know you&#x27;ve probably never heard of this brand, and neither had I, but don&#x27;t let that fool you!!  I will never use anything else!!!</li>
            <li> Absolutely the best shampoo we have tried for my little one&#x27;s hair. the smell is a little strong, but does not linger in her hair like the other dandruff shampoos we have tried. a little goes a long way, and i saw a major improvement after the first use.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve had problems with oily hair/scalp since I was a teenager and this shampoo definitely ranks in the best top 3 I&#x27;ve used over the years.  others that I&#x27;ve liked were always discontinued.  this shampoo is very concentrated but surprisingly easy to use.  some of the good shampoos are so concentrated that I&#x27;ve had to add water to them in my hands just to be able to spread all over my hair/scalp.  I believe 99% of those that try this for oily hair will purchase it again.  I do.</li>
            <li> This is the best shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used for oily hair and scalp!! Absolutely love this shampo and now can go for two days without shampooing!</li>
            <li> i havair loss and scalp problems, this did not help at all. it did make scalp feel nice and tingly and that was all</li>
            <li> I use it regularly because I get scalp acne but haven&#x27;t noticed any change in my condition.  I&#x27;m only saying it doesn&#x27;t work for me with my particular condition.</li>
            <li> This is the only product my husband has found that controls issues he has with his scalp.  Highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I bought this because it says it&#x27;s great for oily hair. Unfortunately this stuff just doesn&#x27;t work on my hair. I tried using two washes, using a small amount, using a large amount, nothing seemed to work. Once my hair dried it would be flat and lifeless. The smell of the shampoo is also terrible - very chemical smelling. I recommend trying &amp;#34;Paul Mitchell Tea Tree Shampoo.&amp;#34; I have been using this for 6 months now three times a week and a generic shampoo on the rest of the days and I&#x27;ve seen a huge improvement - and it smells good!</li>
            <li> The shampoo does not work, I used it all. My hair is not extremely oily but I wash it everyday, I thought this shampoo was going to work but it was a waste of money.</li>
            <li> This seems to have solved a rather embarrassing problem. About six months ago I started having issues with my hair being waxy and sticky. I tried all sorts of natural remedies: baking soda, vinegar, &amp;#34;no &#x27;poo,&amp;#34; etc. Nothing was working. I would wash my hair and even before it was done drying I could feel a sticky, waxy film around my crown. After doing some research, I found that this may be the result of a fungal infection and this shampoo was recommended. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and my sticky scalp problem has completely cleared up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how well it will treat oily scalp, since that wasn&#x27;t my problem, but it definitely worked for what I needed.</li>
            <li> Very fresh mint scent and it really clears out oil from scalp and hair! When I used it last night, my hair felt so good and fresh!</li>
            <li> Makes hair feel thicker,  Cleans really well.</li>
            <li> I had my doubts about this product, but I was getting really sick of getting up in the morning, washing my hair in the shower, and going to work only to have my head turn into a greasy mess by noon. I have naturally thin hair which only appeared thinner with the added oil. Add to that the fact that all day I wear headphones with a pleather headband that rests and moves about on my scalp, and I looked (and as a result, felt) like a complete mess by the end of the day. It&#x27;s only been two days since I started using this product and wow, the difference is striking. My hair looks and feels softer and fuller, all day and into the evening. I was skeptical at first, especially given the price tag, but this stuff works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the shampoo itself is rather thick and a little difficult to work into a lather, but it&#x27;s a minor squabble.</li>
            <li> This shampoo works as well as a suave product.  It just strips your hair like any ordinary, cheap clarifying shampoo does.  Works great for about an hour but then you&#x27;re back to square one.  The best degreaser I&#x27;ve found is maple holistics here on amazon.  I bought this junk because the good stuff started to lose its effectiveness (as all products do when used frequently).  I used this shampoo for 4 weeks to give it a fair shot but couldn&#x27;t stand it anymore.  Maybe it works for others but now I just use it to wash off conditioner I use to shave with from the bottom of the tub.  Expensive tub cleaner...</li>
            <li> this absolutely does not work, it does not do anything for regulating an oily scalp. if anything, i think it causes a rebound effect and makes my hair more oily,and sooner, since it is so stripping. i would not recommend or repurchase. onto the next. for reference, my hair is super oily and i have to wash it daily. normally if i wash it in the morning, at night it will look okay. but with this, it starts to look pretty oily after only like 12 hours.</li>
            <li> Before looking for it, I noticed my hair got way oilier, way sooner than usual.  I didn&#x27;t have any conditions like other reviewers here, so that wasn&#x27;t applicable to me. But, I found this, looked/sounded good, used it and the first time you use it, your hair feels soooooooooooooooooo CLEAN and wonderful afterwards.  Its a great product, did the job, but eventually my hair balanced out and went back to normal, thus I don&#x27;t really use it anymore.  I now only use it once every 10 days or so (alternating between other shampoos of course) so I can use it up.</li>
            <li> Product works very well.  Have found another product(tea tree shampoo) to be more appropriate my scalp condition.</li>
            <li> This was helpful for my teen while struggling with acne</li>
            <li> I used to have to wash my hair every day or every other day.  Now I can go 3-4 days without washing.  Will buy this again and again.</li>
            <li> This product has helped my folliculitis.  It hasn&#x27;t cured it, but it has decreased it by about 90% which is a great improvement.  Maybe with continued use, it will cure it.  It&#x27;s a good product.  Somewhat expensive, but not as bad as RX products.  In my last shipment; however, it leaked all over the box.  This time, I ordered the shampoo as well and it leaked all over the box.  Please address the security of the bottles before packaging and maybe even tape them shut or something to insure I get all of my product.</li>
            <li> I was skeptical to use this because I didn&#x27;t think I had an oily scalp, but the residue I had was oil/extra skin.&lt;br /&gt;this shampoo calmed the scalp and loosened the build up.</li>
            <li> I have oily hair.  I tried the name brand shampoos for oily hair but my hair would still get oily by the end of the day.  This shampoo keeps the oil away for the whole day.</li>
            <li> When our pre-teen suddenly developed truly oily hair, it was absolutely necessary to find something to keep her hair clean.  This shampoo, along with astringent, has made a huge difference, and she&#x27;s feeling more self-confident.  It&#x27;s hard enough going through puberty without everyone looking at your hair before your face.</li>
            <li> The top was not tight on the shampoo and it leaked out. The bottle was a mess. Just a small amount leaked out so I am keeping it. Other wise it is a good product and it came quickly.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve have scalp folliculitis for over 10 years and been through various treatments which all lead to same issue of becoming resistant.  I&#x27;m to the point where I&#x27;m on the maximum Rx of Bactrim and Nicomide to prevent &amp;#34;flairs&amp;#34;.  Since the Drs say there is nothing else available, I&#x27;ve decided to try combinations of topical products in additional to my Rx.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this Thera-Rx skin wash for several months and find it verify effective for quickly easing &amp;#34;itch&amp;#34;.  Anyone that is familiar with this condition is well aware that an itchy area is forbidden from touching in any way.  Years ago I learned the itch from mosquito bites is caused by the bacteria injected into the skin, which also gets worse when scratched as more bacteria is added. I experimented with anti-bacterial dish soap (no water) and found that if applied before any scratching to a bite would not only stop the itch in moments but also heals it quicker.  This concept lead me to this product as folliculitis is caused by bacteria so considered relative principle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results so far is that this skin wash product is most effective for &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34;, especially in the event a pustule hemorrhages. I normally put several drops directly onto the effected area and let it sit and dry.  The irritation is normally tolerable if not gone within minutes. I&#x27;ll also note that when either directly applied or applied with dampened swab onto a pustule, for 10+ minutes, it seems speed up them drying out/healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In shower I&#x27;ll spot treat the irritated area with the skin wash, let it sit for few minutes, then will follow it with their Solv-X product.  After Solv-X sits for a couple minutes the &amp;#34;cool mint&amp;#34; feeling sits in, a couple more minutes and I rinse.</li>
