            <li>Beautiful smell,  works well,  not greasy, better than my expensive stuff.</li>
            <li>While I&#x27;m a bit sceptical about the anti-ageing thing, regular use certainly leaves my skin feeling nicely pampered and my wife says it feels softer so it may well be working.</li>
            <li>You won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re using a miracle drug for your face--no one will think you&#x27;ve had plastic surgery--but it is a great daily moisturizer stocked with essential oils.</li>
            <li>I have used this and the regular version and prefer the scent of the Anti-aging much more.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen huge improvement in my overall skin condition, but I&#x27;d buy it again at this price.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t say anything about the Anti-aging part, I have not noticed much there</li>
            <li>I really like it would recommend for winter months .</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s also a fast skin penetration cream.</li>
            <li>&amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; but uses phenoxyethanol, a neuro- and reproductive toxin that is very sketchy.</li>
            <li>Feels and smells great, only need a small amount.  </li>
            <li>This product is an easy to use thick and smooth moisturizer which I use whenever I think of it.</li>
            <li>I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the two other than the Original being much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m 29 and for the first time ever I feel like I am starting to look and feel older.</li>
            <li>I noticed some gray hairs and new creases on my forehead and near my eyes and freaked.</li>
            <li>to know I&#x27;m using natural products.</li>
            <li>What&#x27;s worse, it is quite high on the ingredients list, in larger quantity than many of the beneficial ingredients.</li>
            <li>Not  greasy, easily absorbed with just a faint clean smell.</li>
            <li>Having got to the point where I thought my face had acquired a little too much of a &#x27;rugged, lived-in&#x27;</li>
            <li>They have a marvelously complex minty smell that is masculine and modern.</li>

            <li> It&#x27;s not too greasy feeling and seems to keep my face moisturizerd during the dry winter weather.  I can&#x27;t say that I&#x27;ve seen huge improvement in my overall skin condition, but I&#x27;d buy it again at this price.</li>
            <li> This is a great moisturizer for us guys. It smells great and does not leave my face feeling greasy at all. I have used this and the regular version and prefer the scent of the Anti-aging much more. It has a nice light scent that just smells like natural stuff and nothing perfumy or too strong. Not sure how well it works to keep my skin looking younger but I can say after a month of using it I notice my skin feels smoother and not oily. Great product line!</li>
            <li> Excellent product. Ranks right  up there with some of the most expensive men&#x27;s skincare lines available... and at a great price also.</li>
            <li> Feels good on the skin, NOT greasy though it goes on &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; it seems to absorb quickly. Works all day. I can&#x27;t say anything about the Anti-aging part, I have not noticed much there, maybe it needs more time. I will keep using it because I like the moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;I shave my whole head and face, Feels good on a freshly shaved dome :)</li>
            <li> Great product. Great price!</li>
            <li> Having got to the point where I thought my face had acquired a little too much of a &#x27;rugged, lived-in&#x27; look I decided it might be time to treat it to a little skin care . Quite by chance I came across Bulldog Anti-Ageing Moisturiser . It had good reviews , so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. While I&#x27;m a bit sceptical about the anti-ageing thing, regular use certainly leaves my skin feeling nicely pampered and my wife says it feels softer so it may well be working. Easy to work into the skin and with a pleasant smell , I rather like it. Recommended, a nice product to use .</li>
            <li> Makes my face look younger . I really like it would recommend for winter months .</li>
            <li> Awesome product. No overpowering scent. Haven&#x27;t aged a day since I bought it!</li>
            <li> I like the plants smell of this cream. I feel like I am putting smashed plants on my face everyday. Not greasy so perfect texture. It&#x27;s also a fast skin penetration cream.</li>
            <li> Bull Dog products are my new favorite. They have a marvelously complex minty smell that is masculine and modern. This product is an easy to use thick and smooth moisturizer which I use whenever I think of it. I can&#x27;t comment on its scientific value but it sure feels good on my dry face. Bull Dog also has a lighter weight Original Moisturizer wich I use as a after shave. I recommend this and the other Bull Dog products enthusiastically. I only wish they offered a shampoo.</li>
            <li> Feels really nice on the skin, absorbs well and smells nice. Skin feels smooth but still manly.</li>
            <li> Great Great Great product!!!!!!!!</li>
            <li> Great natural scent and works well, no oily/greasy feeling.  Guys this stuff works</li>
            <li> I have used many other day/night moisturizers and this is one my favorite. It really smells good and leaves your skin smooth as a baby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product contains oak apple tannins which help your skin to recover and also leaves a great refreshing aroma on your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended for your nightly skin treatment.</li>
            <li> Solid stuff, good smell &amp; texture</li>
            <li> Used this product in the UK and had to order it when I moved state side. Lasting moisturised feeling and smells great too!</li>
            <li> Best smelling most refreshing stuff I&#x27;ve used</li>
            <li> Best product I have used so far, bonus that it comes at a great price. Goes on smooth and non-greasy and my face feels the effect almost all day until I shower in the evening and reapply. No reason for me to ever look elsewhere. Looking forward to a product from them that has SPF in it. Can be pretty brutal here south with the sun</li>
            <li> Great stuff for my aging face!</li>
            <li> Feels and smells great, only need a small amount.  Great to know I&#x27;m using natural products.</li>
            <li> Shocked at how well this works. You won&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;re using a miracle drug for your face--no one will think you&#x27;ve had plastic surgery--but it is a great daily moisturizer stocked with essential oils.</li>
            <li> Not  greasy, easily absorbed with just a faint clean smell.</li>
            <li> I love this, it works well on my face, and I love the fact that I can use it anywhere and it doesn&#x27;t appear greasy.</li>
            <li> &amp;#34;Natural&amp;#34; but uses phenoxyethanol, a neuro- and reproductive toxin that is very sketchy. What&#x27;s worse, it is quite high on the ingredients list, in larger quantity than many of the beneficial ingredients. I&#x27;d rather use parabens than this.</li>
            <li> Love bull dog moisturizers. They don&#x27;t leave my skin oily when apply or even after a long time. Smells amazing too.</li>
            <li> Big fan of all the Bulldog product&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used, this one is no exception. They are one of the few vegan-friendly &amp;#34;men&#x27;s beauty product&amp;#34; companies and explicitly say so on their website which is awesome. I was using the Original Moisturizer until this one came out and if I were to be completely honest I can&#x27;t really tell the difference between the two other than the Original being much cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This version, like the Original, is not greasy at all and has a great scent. For me, it fully absorbs in about a minute after application. Solid solid winter companion if you live in a place that gets cold enough to snow.</li>
            <li> Beautiful smell,  works well,  not greasy, better than my expensive stuff.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m 29 and for the first time ever I feel like I am starting to look and feel older. I noticed some gray hairs and new creases on my forehead and near my eyes and freaked. I haven&#x27;t used many skincare products, but I like the way this makes my face feel and I do think that this combined with the face wash make my skin smoother and softer.</li>
            <li> Love this product!!! What a difference it makes after one week of use!!!</li>
