            <li>Doesn&#x27;t have a very high scent that affects my sinus, which works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;Last</li>
            <li>i will be ordering more</li>
            <li>this is safe ..</li>
            <li>so I&#x27;m sure it go away</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s noticeable in most lighting situations.</li>
            <li>but I was mostly concerned of my mustache</li>
            <li>It bleached most hair.</li>
            <li>but it&#x27;s okay ,</li>
            <li>I love this stuff.</li>
            <li>was glad to get this in the mail and promptly used it.</li>
            <li>&lt;br /&gt;and making sure to keep it from my eyes.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got it.</li>
            <li>I love it.</li>
            <li>This is much better.</li>
            <li>You may wish to use more cream than accelerator.</li>
            <li>Gentle and effective, love it!</li>
            <li>The product worked quickly and was effective when used as directed.  </li>
            <li>The price is so good came very very fast easy to use you may feel some burn is ur skin while using</li>
            <li>I can live through it though and it does get a good result.</li>
            <li>and i thought i had found in this, since it had such great reviews.</li>
            <li>so later i bravely reapplied.</li>
            <li>Easy to clean off skin; no sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t burn sensitive, fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;- No foul, eye-watering scent.  </li>
            <li>but when i ran out i decided maybe there was something even MORE gentle</li>
            <li>(we used a cool, damp washcloth).  </li>
            <li>Per the instructions we covered them with cream for another 5 minutes before rinsing with cool water.  </li>
            <li>Works quickly; 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t even on for a minute when I quickly took it off with a damp cloth.</li>
            <li>I quickly made a scrub of lemon n honey to lighten it up</li>
            <li>so the delivery was quick.  </li>
            <li>I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li>Great for dark hair, lightens well too.</li>
            <li>It works great and really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>It works just fine and doesn&#x27;t really bother my skin.  </li>
            <li>My skin was light, hairs not so much.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s definitely worth buying.</li>
            <li>It turned the hairs golden.</li>
            <li>I guess my skin is more sensitive than others.  </li>
            <li>I added right amounts,</li>
            <li>right?</li>
            <li>I am fair-skinned and have acne-prone/oily/sensitive facial skin as reference; what I planned to bleach originally was my &#x27;happy trail&#x27; and mustache which are similar hair thicknesses + darkness - relatively bolder for a fine hair</li>
            <li>one night and the next morning this bleaching cream right on top.</li>
            <li>Very gentle bleaching cream.</li>
            <li>but i was so scared i had to wipe it off after like 30 seconds the first time i used it</li>
            <li>Burned like hell first time I used it.</li>
            <li>This product really is gentle and does the trick!</li>
            <li>Ok, lets start off by saying this works only for ONE day.</li>
            <li>When I first saw the reviews I figured</li>
            <li>I use it mostly for my face and once in a blue moon I use it on my stomach.  </li>
            <li>This bleaching kit is more for smaller areas.</li>
            <li>Perhaps the hairs are more dense and I need higher strength or maybe multiple sessions for this area - who knows, I&#x27;ll keep trying</li>
            <li>, would definitely buy it again :)</li>
            <li>There is consistent tingling sensation and so far haven&#x27;t experienced anything more than that or any real negative result of it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll keep using this product as long as it&#x27;s on the market, but I&#x27;ll just be more aware of when I apply it.</li>
            <li>After the first day hair literly grew so much.</li>
            <li>The thing I have noticed the most about it that I actually don&#x27;t like is it kind of foams up unevenly on my face like it wants to bubble off</li>
            <li>Used on my upper lip, easy to mix and use, also no itching or burning, and worked like a charm.</li>
            <li>I have super sensitive skin .</li>
            <li>Gentle?</li>
            <li>Sally Hansen Fast and Gentle Creme Hair Bleach For Face 1 ea]</li>
            <li>Very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>It is indeed &#x27;gentle&#x27; and it works.  </li>
            <li>I bought this at a Sally&#x27;s Beauty store for it&#x27;s gentle cream feature</li>
            <li>Just tried this product this very morning</li>
            <li>I may of used too much</li>
            <li>Not what i wanted fast shipping though</li>
            <li>This is gentle as it says.</li>
            <li>Says that it&#x27;s gentle</li>
            <li>It bleaches skin very well.</li>
            <li>Didn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
            <li>NOT for sensitive skin!!!</li>
            <li>The first time I used it I had no issues, it&#x27;s the second and third time it peeled the top layer of my skin, so not so gentle after all.</li>
            <li>As much as I do not like Jolen powder, I will be going back to that because it is far better for sensitive skin</li>
            <li>It burned my upper lip and I returning the product for a full refund</li>
            <li>Tried it again for a second time days later making sure</li>
            <li>and I&#x27;ve still got loads left over for the next time I need to do my eyebrows. :)</li>
            <li>normally i use jolen mild facial bleaching cream</li>
            <li>I will use again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li>Most of the hair was completely bleached a fair blonde color, but a few pesky dark ones were still visible.  </li>
            <li>as for performance it did not bleach very quickly at all, and even left many dark hairs after the ten minutes.</li>
            <li>but it may be the best of a bad</li>
            <li>Works really well and did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>It works really well as far as bleaching goes though.</li>
            <li>It was my own fault because the prescription medicine says right on the label that it can make your skin sensitive, so my timing with the bleaching cream was an act of poor judgement.</li>
            <li>It wasn&#x27;t any more gentle than any other facial hair bleach-</li>
            <li>Instead of waiting the recommended 24 hours, we forged ahead and went for an upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine, dark hair was covered thouroughly and then the cream was left to do its magic for 10 minutes before being rinsed off with cool water</li>
            <li>I have fine arm hair and not so hairy but still noticeable since the hairs are dark.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s only the first day</li>
            <li>I have tried better products in the past.</li>
            <li>You would have to mix multiple containers to cover a large area.  </li>
            <li>so those fine hairs can be quite noticeable when they&#x27;re almost black!  </li>
            <li>I know that &amp;#34;no complaints&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t a glowing endorsement, but it&#x27;s hard to get jazzed about having to bleach my lady moustache :)  </li>
            <li>I have found that it works quickly compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li>I wait the whole 10 minutes and it completely bleaches all the hairs and even the skin for a short period.</li>
            <li>I wouldn&#x27;t even say I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li>later they were 2 shades lighter much to my relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My daughter says it works much better than Sally Hansen and not as messy, for the price and quality will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t  have sensitive skin and this burned it luckily after rubbing it with coconut oil the dark color and burning feeling went away.</li>
            <li>Over all for the price it works and will last for a decent amount of time even with having to repeat the process.</li>
            <li>It burned the first time I used it, but I thought it was because my skin was very dry that day.</li>
            <li>This cream hair bleach seems to do the trick on finer hairs and not thick and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li>Left it just a few seconds, took it off, and my skin was light</li>
            <li>that I barely felt it.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m giving this product a four star instead of a five because it can in fact create blisters on skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li>I gave 4 stars because it burns as other bleach creams, and the product calms its gentle.</li>
            <li>Works really well and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin like the other brands.</li>
            <li>If mixed as directed, you will have too much cream for just an upper lip - wasting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the other products out there</li>

            <li> Instead of waiting the recommended 24 hours, we forged ahead and went for an upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine, dark hair was covered thouroughly and then the cream was left to do its magic for 10 minutes before being rinsed off with cool water</li>
            <li> I have fine arm hair and not so hairy but still noticeable since the hairs are dark.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s only the first day</li>
            <li> I have tried better products in the past.</li>
            <li> You would have to mix multiple containers to cover a large area.  </li>
            <li> so those fine hairs can be quite noticeable when they&#x27;re almost black!  </li>
            <li> I know that &amp;#34;no complaints&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t a glowing endorsement, but it&#x27;s hard to get jazzed about having to bleach my lady moustache :)  </li>
            <li> I have found that it works quickly compared to other brands.  </li>
            <li> I wait the whole 10 minutes and it completely bleaches all the hairs and even the skin for a short period.</li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even say I have sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> later they were 2 shades lighter much to my relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My daughter says it works much better than Sally Hansen and not as messy, for the price and quality will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  have sensitive skin and this burned it luckily after rubbing it with coconut oil the dark color and burning feeling went away.</li>
            <li> Over all for the price it works and will last for a decent amount of time even with having to repeat the process.</li>
            <li> It burned the first time I used it, but I thought it was because my skin was very dry that day.</li>
            <li> This cream hair bleach seems to do the trick on finer hairs and not thick and coarse hair.  </li>
            <li> Left it just a few seconds, took it off, and my skin was light</li>
            <li> that I barely felt it.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m giving this product a four star instead of a five because it can in fact create blisters on skin if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
            <li> I gave 4 stars because it burns as other bleach creams, and the product calms its gentle.</li>
            <li> Works really well and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin like the other brands.</li>
            <li> If mixed as directed, you will have too much cream for just an upper lip - wasting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the other products out there</li>
            <li> I have never bleached before and decided to do it despite trepidation due to my extremely sensitive skin.  </li>
            <li> Will completely bleach stubborn dark hair in a short time.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy to use this at first, but I wanted to test it out for the summer for the dark hair on my stomach.</li>
            <li> I use about a third to half what the instructions day to use, since I only need to bleach my upper lip.</li>
            <li> my skin is not normally sensitive, but as soon as i applied this (immediately) it burned like hell.</li>
            <li> I think next time I will only leave it on for half the time.</li>
            <li> Never having heard of the brand before I was reluctant to try it, but sort of desperate to help out a family member who can&#x27;t stand the thought of waxing her upper lip, I purchased it at a local beauty supply store to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions recommend a test patch on the inside of your arm - leaving the cream on for 10 minutes and then rinsing off with a cool water.  </li>
            <li> I used it over a week ago, and my skin is still really dry and flaky.</li>
            <li> If you are purchasing it for facial hair, this package should last you a long time as it takes very little to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> For larger applications you may want to investigate waxing.d last you a long time as it takes very little to get the job done.  </li>
            <li> it work but still left it dark.</li>
            <li> For the really dark hairs, you need to do it twice, but it&#x27;s not a big deal.</li>
            <li> This cream left a black ring around my mouth where I was bleaching.</li>
            <li> The extra 5 did the trick and in less than 20 minutes from start to finish, a bleaching cream success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I tried this because the usual brand I like was more expensive on amazon than at the store this time around.</li>
            <li> It will suffice to say that I won&#x27;t use any other brand as long as I have access to this one.</li>
            <li> It burned a little, but didn&#x27;t leave my skin red or irritated.</li>
            <li> I put this on my upper lip and a few seconds it starts to BURN.</li>
            <li> Be careful</li>
            <li> As I am just trying to lighten my eyebrows a bit rather than bleach them completely, I am careful to keep the product on for no longer than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> but it&#x27;s only on for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> I wanted to try something that was faster to mix and less messy than using a generic brand of Jolen.</li>
            <li> I got this cream for my face due to not finding Sally brand.</li>
            <li> I usually buy another German brand of bleaching cream and I was unsure whether to trust another brand.</li>
            <li> Other than that</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as other bleaching creams.</li>
            <li> it didn&#x27;t do the job of other brands.</li>
            <li> I have dark hair on my abdomen</li>
            <li> turn my face dark color.  </li>
            <li> I have really dark hair</li>
            <li> It did leave a few blisters that weren&#x27;t really noticeable but definitely not ideal.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the other brands I&#x27;ve bought but doesn&#x27;t sting!</li>
            <li> Slight tingling which went away as soon as the process was over</li>
            <li> Burned the skin on my face immediately, leaving a black ring around the offended area.</li>
            <li> I got this to dye my hair, worst mistake because its for facial hair, It burned still and just dyed my roots, dont get for your hair :)</li>
            <li> my skin black warning</li>
            <li> I bought this after I saw a video review for it on youtube, as I had just bleached my hair and found that my eyebrows (black) stood out like a sore thumb.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> Those always clump and make a mess.  </li>
            <li> This product is easier to use then the drugstore brand, and less messy.  </li>
            <li> The product did burn but it was so little</li>
            <li> I had to let it sit a little longer than the directions said.</li>
            <li> even on dark hair!</li>
            <li> A little string smelling</li>
            <li> so I have to resmooth it every few minutes until time</li>
            <li> It was a bit harsh, but I would probably buy this again.</li>
            <li> for a few weeks as well, in my case.</li>
            <li> /&gt;Enough on that subject!</li>
            <li> There is no strong smell, and it does as intended.</li>
            <li> I have extremely sensitive skin and have to be really careful about what I put on my face because my skin will go haywire, so I was worried that I would have a bad reaction to it.</li>
            <li> Somewhat expensive, especially if you are going to use it for legs and arms.  </li>
            <li> and I had two small blisters.</li>
            <li> not pleased with the ingredients- sulfates &amp; parabens &amp; junk-</li>
            <li> I washed it off even less than 5 minutes and it still burned my skin and now it&#x27;s hurt and look even worse..</li>
            <li> I had the dark ring around my mouth after using it!!!  </li>
            <li> I use it to lighten my eyebrows, but do need to leave it on for at least 10 mins.</li>
            <li> , I mean it feels like you swabbed acid on your skin.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for years, after I decided that getting my mustach hairs waxed every few weeks was way too expensive.</li>
            <li> I thought maybe I did the ratio of bleach creme to activator wrong.</li>
            <li> Boy was I wrong it burned on application all I thought was that it needed to burn to work</li>
            <li> It does sting a little, but it&#x27;s not any horrible pain.</li>
            <li> and I can&#x27;t wait till the summer to not be afraid to show my body in a bikini.</li>
            <li> I used it again and it burned so bad</li>
            <li> im highly disappointed in this cream</li>
            <li> Horrifying.</li>
            <li> soon Horrible product do NOT RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Awful!!!</li>
            <li> Please don&#x27;t torture yourself with the kits which have those awful burning, non-dissolving, red-mark-leaving crystals.</li>

    <h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <ol>
            <li> I like this product a lot.</li>
            <li> I have never bleached before and decided to do it despite trepidation due to my extremely sensitive skin.  The product worked quickly and was effective when used as directed.  Slight tingling which went away as soon as the process was over and I washed it off.  I will use again and highly recommend.</li>
            <li> I have been using this product for years to lighten my eyebrows. It works great and really lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> Great for dark hair, lightens well too.</li>
            <li> normally i use jolen mild facial bleaching cream but when i ran out i decided maybe there was something even MORE gentle and i thought i had found in this, since it had such great reviews. my skin is not normally sensitive, but as soon as i applied this (immediately) it burned like hell. the burning sensation does go away after a minute or two but i was so scared i had to wipe it off after like 30 seconds the first time i used it and then eventually i re-read the reviews (some people said they had burning as well) so later i bravely reapplied. as for performance it did not bleach very quickly at all, and even left many dark hairs after the ten minutes. normally i only go 4 minutes or 5 mins with the jolen. the next day i woke up with TWO pimples on my upper lip, im guessing from irritation and i know this is no coincidence. im highly disappointed in this cream, i would never recommend it and i would give zero stars if i could. they should call it burning-pimple-inducing-slightly-bleaching cream! :P i guess i will try to use it for something else..stomach hair or arm hair or something. blah</li>
            <li> Gentle and effective, love it!</li>
            <li> Great product! I had to leave it on for 15 minutes though. I have dark hair on my abdomen&lt;br /&gt;and I didn&#x27;t want to wax or shave so I tried this. It&#x27;s definitely worth buying. 👍</li>
            <li> NOT for sensitive skin!!! It burned the first time I used it, but I thought it was because my skin was very dry that day. I used it again and it burned so bad I took it off after 5 minutes and I had blisters. As much as I do not like Jolen powder, I will be going back to that because it is far better for sensitive skin</li>
            <li> This cream left a black ring around my mouth where I was bleaching. I&#x27;ve never seen a bleaching cream do this... I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to anyone.  Hope this ring disappears soon!</li>
            <li> Box was smashed but product was intact and worked well. Will buy again. Thank you &amp; have a nice day</li>
            <li> Gentle? Burned like hell first time I used it. Had to discard it and get refund</li>
            <li> Burned the skin on my face immediately, leaving a black ring around the offended area. Had to rub vitamin e oil into it for ages for it to go away. Horrifying.</li>
            <li> Searching for an alternative to [[ASIN:B000GCW4VA Jolen Creme Bleach 1 kit]] and [[ASIN:B000141EGE Sally Hansen Fast and Gentle Creme Hair Bleach For Face 1 ea]], I found GiGi.  Never having heard of the brand before I was reluctant to try it, but sort of desperate to help out a family member who can&#x27;t stand the thought of waxing her upper lip, I purchased it at a local beauty supply store to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions recommend a test patch on the inside of your arm - leaving the cream on for 10 minutes and then rinsing off with a cool water.  We did that and there was visible bleaching of the inner arm skin (a patch where the cream had been), but no redness or irritation.  Instead of waiting the recommended 24 hours, we forged ahead and went for an upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fine, dark hair was covered thouroughly and then the cream was left to do its magic for 10 minutes before being rinsed off with cool water (we used a cool, damp washcloth).  Most of the hair was completely bleached a fair blonde color, but a few pesky dark ones were still visible.  Per the instructions we covered them with cream for another 5 minutes before rinsing with cool water.  The extra 5 did the trick and in less than 20 minutes from start to finish, a bleaching cream success!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- Works quickly; 10 to 15 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean off skin; no sticky residue.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t burn sensitive, fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;- No foul, eye-watering scent.  Very mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s:&lt;br /&gt;- You have to mix the cream with the activator, and measurements are somewhat imprecise.&lt;br /&gt;- Somewhat expensive, especially if you are going to use it for legs and arms.  This would require several boxes of product.&lt;br /&gt;- If mixed as directed, you will have too much cream for just an upper lip - wasting product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the other products out there this is one is the best.  It is indeed &#x27;gentle&#x27; and it works.  If you are purchasing it for facial hair, this package should last you a long time as it takes very little to get the job done.  For larger applications you may want to investigate waxing.d last you a long time as it takes very little to get the job done.  For larger applications you may want to investigate waxing.</li>
            <li> listen this bleaching cream worked great. i will be ordering more</li>
            <li> I bought this at a Sally&#x27;s Beauty store for it&#x27;s gentle cream feature cause I wanted to try something that was faster to mix and less messy than using a generic brand of Jolen. Oh my! I put this on my upper lip and a few seconds it starts to BURN. Not like a tingle that tells you it&#x27;s working, I mean it feels like you swabbed acid on your skin. It wasn&#x27;t even on for a minute when I quickly took it off with a damp cloth. My skin was light, hairs not so much. I thought maybe I did the ratio of bleach creme to activator wrong. NOPE. Tried it again for a second time days later making sure I added right amounts, mixed well, and put a spot on my face. BURNED. Left it just a few seconds, took it off, and my skin was light and I had two small blisters. I wouldn&#x27;t even say I have sensitive skin. I&#x27;ve never had a reaction to any product I&#x27;ve tried like this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product unless you&#x27;re looking for a skin lightening creme that feels like acid to skin slough the color off.</li>
            <li> It burned my upper lip and I returning the product for a full refund</li>
            <li> This product really is gentle and does the trick!</li>
            <li> I know that &amp;#34;no complaints&amp;#34; isn&#x27;t a glowing endorsement, but it&#x27;s hard to get jazzed about having to bleach my lady moustache :)  I like this product over those that utilize a powdery/grainy substance as part of the mixing process.  Those always clump and make a mess.  This was easy to mix and did the trick!</li>
            <li> Just tried this product this very morning and I am very happy! Used on my upper lip, easy to mix and use, also no itching or burning, and worked like a charm. Will buy again!</li>
            <li> I got this to dye my hair, worst mistake because its for facial hair, It burned still and just dyed my roots, dont get for your hair :)</li>
            <li> The cream does the job and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I use it to lighten my eyebrows, but do need to leave it on for at least 10 mins.</li>
            <li> My daughter says it works much better than Sally Hansen and not as messy, for the price and quality will definitely buy it again.</li>
            <li> I got this cream for my face due to not finding Sally brand. It work but it&lt;br /&gt;also turn my face dark color.  I quickly made a scrub of lemon n honey to lighten it up n it work but still left it dark. My skin doesn&#x27;t glow anymore.  Idk why it did that and lost hope if it going away.  It&#x27;s been months.  Be careful</li>
            <li> Ok, lets start off by saying this works only for ONE day. Literally ONE. After the first day hair literly grew so much. Im so pissed.  Thought it would just bleach the hair , but it bleached it &amp; DOUBLED it. I dont recommend it, not at all .</li>
            <li> I usually buy another German brand of bleaching cream and I was unsure whether to trust another brand. I am happy to have bought GiGi because it&#x27;s a really gentle and effective cream. Great result!</li>
            <li> Lightens the hair without leaving any bleached look on my upper lip. I use about a third to half what the instructions day to use, since I only need to bleach my upper lip.</li>
            <li> When I first saw the reviews I figured this is safe ..right? Boy was I wrong it burned on application all I thought was that it needed to burn to work so I waited the time indicated and it darkened my skin I may of used too much but that&#x27;s only because it doesn&#x27;t seem to work it&#x27;s only the first day so I&#x27;m sure it go away soon Horrible product do NOT RECOMMEND</li>
            <li> Gigi product didn&#x27;t work for me as l anticipated. It burns me alot especially if l don&#x27;t mix it correctly.</li>
            <li> Works well and good price</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t  have sensitive skin and this burned it luckily after rubbing it with coconut oil the dark color and burning feeling went away.</li>
            <li> Works really well and did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> Not what i wanted fast shipping though</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t work properly</li>
            <li> I ordered it on Tuesday, got it Friday so the delivery was quick.  I have fine arm hair and not so hairy but still noticeable since the hairs are dark. I tried it and I love the results! It turned the hairs golden. It wasn&#x27;t harmful on my skin and for the price, it&#x27;s a bargain. I highly recommend :)</li>
            <li> I have used this bleach for years.  I use it mostly for my face and once in a blue moon I use it on my stomach.  I have really dark hair so those fine hairs can be quite noticeable when they&#x27;re almost black!  This cream hair bleach seems to do the trick on finer hairs and not thick and coarse hair.  It works just fine and doesn&#x27;t really bother my skin.  The thing I have noticed the most about it that I actually don&#x27;t like is it kind of foams up unevenly on my face like it wants to bubble off so I have to resmooth it every few minutes until time is up.  Other than that, I&#x27;m pretty happy with it!  Oh, and like others said, it would be a pain to use this for larger parts of the body.  You would have to mix multiple containers to cover a large area.  This bleaching kit is more for smaller areas.</li>
            <li> I am fair-skinned and have acne-prone/oily/sensitive facial skin as reference; what I planned to bleach originally was my &#x27;happy trail&#x27; and mustache which are similar hair thicknesses + darkness - relatively bolder for a fine hair so it&#x27;s noticeable in most lighting situations. I&#x27;ve been using this for maybe almost a year now and its perfect for my mustache ! I wait the whole 10 minutes and it completely bleaches all the hairs and even the skin for a short period. There is consistent tingling sensation and so far haven&#x27;t experienced anything more than that or any real negative result of it. However, for some reason, every time I try my happy trail it bleaches the skin and hairs blotchily. Perhaps the hairs are more dense and I need higher strength or maybe multiple sessions for this area - who knows, I&#x27;ll keep trying but I was mostly concerned of my mustache and it does the job!</li>
            <li> works well. I will continue to purchase.</li>
            <li> Awful!!! I had the dark ring around my mouth after using it!!!  Never use it again!</li>
            <li> Some of the reviews worried me with the &amp;#34;turned my skin black warning but I did not have this problem. The product did burn but it was so little that I barely felt it. I would by again. The only thing is, (and this is just a personal thing) that I had to do 2-3 rounds of bleaching to achieve the actual blonde I desired.</li>
            <li> It bleached most hair. I had to let it sit a little longer than the directions said. It burned a little, but didn&#x27;t leave my skin red or irritated. I plan on using this in the future.</li>
            <li> I was a little iffy to use this at first, but I wanted to test it out for the summer for the dark hair on my stomach. You are suppose to wait 10 minutes with the bleach on in order for it to work properly. It does burn but does not burn your skin. I had to use it twice to get the results I wanted but it worked really nice!!! I was really happy and I can&#x27;t wait till the summer to not be afraid to show my body in a bikini.</li>
            <li> The price is so good came very very fast easy to use you may feel some burn is ur skin while using but it&#x27;s okay , no smell no eye burn , would definitely buy it again :)</li>
            <li> I used it over a week ago, and my skin is still really dry and flaky. It feels like I have a chemical burn. It works really well as far as bleaching goes though. I think next time I will only leave it on for half the time. It was a bit harsh, but I would probably buy this again. I&#x27;ll just over-moisturize for a bit.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff. There is no strong smell, and it does as intended. For the really dark hairs, you need to do it twice, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. It does sting a little, but it&#x27;s not any horrible pain. It&#x27;s bleach, what do you expect? This is gentle as it says.</li>
            <li> Does not work as well as other bleaching creams.</li>
            <li> IT worked, but I did not like the smell!</li>
            <li> Don&#x27;t buy this s***y product... I bought it for my GF and it literally burned her skin up</li>
            <li> I bought this after I saw a video review for it on youtube, as I had just bleached my hair and found that my eyebrows (black) stood out like a sore thumb.&lt;br /&gt;I was glad to get this in the mail and promptly used it. Plastered it (as it comes with a spatula like applying tool) onto my eyebrows after following the directions&lt;br /&gt;and making sure to keep it from my eyes. 10 minutes and a bit of tingling (no burning) later they were 2 shades lighter much to my relief.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad I got it. It worked great and I&#x27;ve still got loads left over for the next time I need to do my eyebrows. :)</li>
            <li> Says that it&#x27;s gentle but it does sting.  I guess my skin is more sensitive than others.  I can live through it though and it does get a good result.</li>
            <li> it burned my skin when I tried to use it on the hair on my upper lip. I washed it off even less than 5 minutes and it still burned my skin and now it&#x27;s hurt and look even worse..</li>
            <li> works great for teenagers legs!</li>
            <li> The first time I used it I had no issues, it&#x27;s the second and third time it peeled the top layer of my skin, so not so gentle after all. I have two areas on my face now with skin scrapped off.</li>
            <li> Works as well as the other brands I&#x27;ve bought but doesn&#x27;t sting! Will completely bleach stubborn dark hair in a short time.</li>
            <li> I love it. I have super sensitive skin . This works for me.thanks for the product i was actually trying to cancell it but i got it anyway. Turned to be goof</li>
            <li> The cream somewhat works, the hair was lighter but not bleached until I did addition applications. It doesn&#x27;t irritate or smell and is simple to use. I have tried better products in the past. Over all for the price it works and will last for a decent amount of time even with having to repeat the process.</li>
            <li> This product is easier to use then the drugstore brand, and less messy.  I have found that it works quickly compared to other brands.  As I am just trying to lighten my eyebrows a bit rather than bleach them completely, I am careful to keep the product on for no longer than 5 minutes.</li>
            <li> Works perfectly. Doesn&#x27;t have a very high scent that affects my sinus, which works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;Last for a few weeks as well, in my case.</li>
            <li> Was very pleased with the results of this cream and was a great deal with two boxes.</li>
            <li> Not as good as the Sally Hansen cream</li>
            <li> I tried this because the usual brand I like was more expensive on amazon than at the store this time around. It wasn&#x27;t any more gentle than any other facial hair bleach- with one difference- it didn&#x27;t do the job of other brands. So.... eh.</li>
            <li> This item does not match the product description on the site. And it&#x27;s working at all.</li>
            <li> works great.. very gentle! even on dark hair!</li>
            <li> It bleaches skin very well.I gave 4 stars because it burns as other bleach creams, and the product calms its gentle.</li>
            <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;-Plenty of cream to use multiple times&lt;br /&gt;-Fast acting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Had a burning sensation when used on my lip, but not my arm for test area&lt;br /&gt;-Turned my skin a shade lighter for about an hour</li>
            <li> Very gentle bleaching cream. Works really well and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin like the other brands.</li>
            <li> This works just as it&#x27;s supposed to. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, after I decided that getting my mustach hairs waxed every few weeks was way too expensive. The box is good for about 5 or 6 applications. I have extremely sensitive skin and have to be really careful about what I put on my face because my skin will go haywire, so I was worried that I would have a bad reaction to it. I surprisingly did not.  However, one time I made the mistake of using a prescriprion facial creme (for acne) one night and the next morning this bleaching cream right on top. It did leave a few blisters that weren&#x27;t really noticeable but definitely not ideal. It was my own fault because the prescription medicine says right on the label that it can make your skin sensitive, so my timing with the bleaching cream was an act of poor judgement. I&#x27;m giving this product a four star instead of a five because it can in fact create blisters on skin if you&#x27;re not careful. I&#x27;ll keep using this product as long as it&#x27;s on the market, but I&#x27;ll just be more aware of when I apply it.</li>
            <li> It will suffice to say that I won&#x27;t use any other brand as long as I have access to this one. Please don&#x27;t torture yourself with the kits which have those awful burning, non-dissolving, red-mark-leaving crystals. This is much better. Pay attention to recommended amounts/directions. You may wish to use more cream than accelerator. Can apply longer but Not stronger.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not pleased with the ingredients- sulfates &amp; parabens &amp; junk- oh my!- but it may be the best of a bad bunch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough on that subject!</li>
            <li> Works great! A little string smelling but it&#x27;s only on for a few minutes.</li>
            <li> Didn&#x27;t work very well. Need to leave on longer</li>
