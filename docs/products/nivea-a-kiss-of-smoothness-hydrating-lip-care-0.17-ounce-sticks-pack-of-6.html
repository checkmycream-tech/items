            <li>Its very effective.</li>
            <li>This has been very effective on me.</li>
            <li>it is a great product and has a good value as well for what it does.  </li>
            <li>At this time, however, it just doesn&#x27;t compare to a product that I feel is superior in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li>It also lasts for a good while, a couple of hours without needing to reapply.</li>
            <li>But I went by Good Housekeeping recommendations and I do not like the feel on my lips and think even Chap Stick works better.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li>She said nivea thats a good brand.</li>
            <li>Good price&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>Delightful light</li>
            <li>Feels good, no discernible taste.</li>
            <li>It makes my lips look and feel so good.</li>
            <li>The composition as an emolient feels superior.</li>
            <li>Really really smooth lips, goes on well, even tastes delicious!!</li>
            <li>best chap stick on the market right now!</li>
            <li>These lip balms are great and not like the waxy ones that make me feel like I should put a wick in my mouth and light it as if it was a candle!  </li>
            <li>Very sexy feeling</li>
            <li>PLEASE keep them available online!!</li>
            <li>I simply love it!</li>
            <li>Always love Nivea!</li>
            <li>I love this stuff!</li>
            <li>I am so glad that I found this in bulk!</li>
            <li>LOVE Nivea !</li>
            <li>but this one is still my favorite!</li>
            <li>Now that I&#x27;ve gone through a winter, I would say this is a great light, colorless lip moisturizer.  </li>
            <li>The Nivea brand is simply amazing</li>
            <li>applicator itself is quite nice, also.  </li>
            <li>and I have tried every kind out there (and returned the bads</li>
            <li>, if you like something with a tasty flavor/smell and nice mouth feel I&#x27;d recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li>I would have to use it whether I liked it or not since it&#x27;s in a pack of 6.&lt;br</li>
            <li>Nice to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It is really nice.</li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t like that warm</li>
            <li>Nice product for a guy.</li>
            <li>But there are times in the summer where it comes in handy.  </li>
            <li>Hydrating SPF 4 Lip Care Stick will be comparative to Burt&#x27;s Bees, since it would have to best that product to become my new</li>
            <li>Nivea Lip Care Stick glides on easily, and moisturizes fairly well.  </li>
            <li>I also like the pleasant light scent it</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s so great and super affordable too.</li>
            <li>It goes on real smooth, and rather than sit on top of your lips like wax based lip balms, it is said to be \\&quot;absorbed\\&quot; into the lips.  </li>
            <li>and I think more effective than what I&#x27;ve been used to.      </li>
            <li>It is definitely superior to the more commonly available chapstick.</li>
            <li>Very smooth, and moisture retaining for the lips.  </li>
            <li>a very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s very smooth and not tacky at all.</li>
            <li>I use this Nivea on top of them and it works much better than the products included with the long-wear colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>Anyone want a bunch of partly-used Chapstick and Burts Bees? :)</li>
            <li>(I catch my self spending more time than I should to apply just because it feels</li>
            <li>Not bad!..could be better, maybe they should think things with flavor maybe..other than that, its an ok product.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s more like a lotion that absorbs into the lips.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li>On top of that, it is unflavoured and unscented, so I&#x27;m not forever wanting to lick my lips, so it stays in place a lot longer.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m glad we can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li>It didn&#x27;t keep my lips moisturized for more than a minute.</li>
            <li>This moisturizing stick makes my lips feel softer, smoother and definitely more kissable.  </li>
            <li>would rate this at the top of my list.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s an ok balm depending what your going for</li>
            <li>I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li>Looked on Amazon and read reviews of many lip balms and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li>I really love being able to buy these in bulk packages of 6 on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I have bought many of these, and will keep doing so.</li>
            <li>For me, I see that my lips are looking better for it.</li>
            <li>hydrating lip care has become a favorite of mine</li>
            <li>I am allergic to all lipsticks and most chapsticks, but these have not caused a reaction!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li>I really love this product and use it all the time.</li>
            <li>As you&#x27;d expect, lip balm is lip balm, for the most part.</li>
            <li>Nivea is her favorite.</li>
            <li>It goes on smooth, not chunky and no overpowering tutti-fruity smell!</li>
            <li>even look a lot better as soon as you have the lip balm on.</li>
            <li>I love this stuff, I buy it by the 6 pack.  </li>
            <li>I love this chapstick because it works to hydrate your lips while looking like a gloss.  </li>
            <li>Safe for all day/night application.</li>
            <li>and this is really cheap for this brand!</li>
            <li>My fiancee hates my chapstick/lip balms (Mostly Burts Bees).  </li>
            <li>I have tried so many, and clogged up my bags, bathroom, desk, and car with oodles of them...</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve used a variety of products over the years, and I&#x27;ve found some to be better than others.    </li>
            <li>Moisture Lip balm is one of the better products on the market, in my opinion.</li>
            <li>Seven things to love about Nivea a Kiss of Moisture</li>
            <li>have used it for 3 or 4 yrs-- glad to buy it 6 @</li>
            <li>i love this lip care because it is not frozen during winter</li>
            <li>I like this one better-</li>
            <li>Be sure to purchase on Amazon - much better prices than stores.</li>
            <li>Amazon always has the best prices and shipping is fast and allows me to have it shipped right to her in her dorm.</li>
            <li>Isn&#x27;t caky like Chapstick can be but is very smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t put shine or color on my lips, goes on smoothly, feels good, absorbs fast and keeps my lips nicely conditioned.</li>
            <li>Thats amazing to me and worth getting more of these.</li>
            <li>Nivea&#x27;s Kiss of Moisture lip care is light and wonderful to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>very smooth and light application</li>
            <li>well she was right if it works that quickly its good for sure.</li>
            <li>My lips stay smooth and I can put lipstick on top of it.  </li>
            <li>I love how smooth this feels going on.</li>
            <li>Nivea Lip Care is a great way to weatherproof your sensitive lips, and keep them continually moist.</li>
            <li>Buy and enjoy:)</li>
            <li>No funny taste -- perfect for kissing.&lt;br</li>
            <li>but it works best when applied without any other products.  </li>
            <li>However, the original packaging lists  ingredients that are favorable- castor seed oil, shea butter, jojoba seed oil, grape seed oil-all excellent ingredients that explain why this moisturizing stick is so helpful for dry lips.  </li>
            <li>Surprisingly, the feel is very moist and smooth</li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell strongly</li>
            <li>For a women&#x27;s pocketbook, it would be just fine.    </li>
            <li>After putting it on it makes your lips look super shiny and really healthy.  </li>
            <li>Doesn&#x27;t quickly disappear like so many others.</li>
            <li>After just a week of use my lips are much smoother (and more kissable!</li>
            <li>I noticed with the weather warming my lips were chapping far more easily, so I gave this a try, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li>It smooths on great, and it leaves my lips feeling smooth if I use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li>These balms are no longer available in my area so order them online...</li>
            <li>chapped and smooth</li>
            <li>The Nivea balm goes on velvety smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave your lips feeling greasy or looking shiny.</li>
            <li>/&gt;If Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm were no longer available, I might try Nivea&#x27;s Lip Care Stick again.  </li>
            <li>Lightweight and smooth moisturizer for lips</li>
            <li>The balm is soothing to my lips, which tend to chap, and glides smoothly.</li>
            <li>It glides on smoothly, stays on, and keeps my lips moist without being sticky or caking up.  </li>
            <li>The balm applies smoothly with a satiny finish-none of the chalky, waxiness that we can experience elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li>It glides on your lips smoothly and starts moisturizing immediately.</li>
            <li>It has an unassuming butter-balm odor, and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m a guy, but I like to have smooth lips, you know why</li>
            <li>I was surprised by all of the good reviews on this lip balm.</li>
            <li>Too many products have a scent/smell that I don&#x27;t like, but this product has little to no smell - and what there is is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li>Great for the lips and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li>but that&#x27;s 4 more than nothing and the higher spf&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t feel or look as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this lip balm when I first received it.</li>
            <li>So I was really really excited to receive this in the mail...</li>
            <li>I opened it up and found that I wasn&#x27;t as excited</li>
            <li>so it&#x27;s definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li>31 years of avid devotion and my love for this product is not waning.  </li>
            <li>It has spf which is super important.</li>
            <li>in all though, it&#x27;s a good deal, as 6 tubes should last for years!</li>
            <li>I have been using this lip balm for almost a week now, and cannot come up with enough good things to say about it.</li>
            <li>I normally use Rosebud Slave everyday and love it, it stays on, looks good and has a nice non-gooey texture.</li>
            <li>True</li>
            <li>Thanks Amazon, you made this mom&#x27;s effort easier :)</li>
            <li>In a pinch, I bought a two-pack of Nivea Kiss of Smoothness because it was handy and inexpensive, but I have been pleasantly surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li>Hope I can find this good of a deal next time!</li>
            <li>Mildly scented, which is nice if you are sensitive to, or tend to get overwhelmed by, fragrances.  </li>
            <li>and it soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li>I enjoyed giving it out to others who also like it immensely and plan on getting more of it.</li>
            <li>I enjoyed giving it out to others who also like it immensely and plan on getting more of it.</li>
            <li>I guess Smoothness is OKAY, but it won&#x27;t heal my chapped lips, only help them stay \\&quot;okay\\&quot; when they are already good and soft.</li>
            <li>This particular flavor is superb for protecting your lips from dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Within few minutes of application, it comforts your lips.</li>
            <li>- Goes on really smooth and gets absorbed pretty quick.     </li>
            <li>It&#x27;s super soft and I love the feel on my lips.</li>
            <li>This is a great little lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li>texture/shine: It&#x27;s pretty high shine for a balm, which I love.</li>
            <li>only problem is that I have to rinse it off every day with warm water and (for me) a microfiber cloth.</li>
            <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li>For the price, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve always used some kind of lip balm, especially in the wintertime.  </li>
            <li>Because it gets absorbed into your lips, it doesn&#x27;t tend to get all over your shirt collar, coffee cups, etc.   </li>
            <li>I rarely have to reapply.&lt;br</li>
            <li>I love the way it smooths out your lips, filling in cracks and making them soft.</li>
            <li>and it absorbed right in, can snap fingers right away...</li>
            <li>/&gt;Living in Alabama (with the highest rate of skin cancer in the world with the exception of Australia--both with hot sun and many blue-eyed people), I&#x27;m especially interested in something that keeps my mouth healthy: the lips are a common site for basal cell carcinoma.  </li>
            <li>feeling like it&#x27;s slid right off my lips around my mouth.</li>
            <li>I must always have something on my lips, and normally that is some sort of light lipgloss</li>
            <li>keeps my lips nice and moist all day long</li>
            <li>The deal on here was great, and I bought enough to last me all year!</li>
            <li>The product seem to moisten our lips relatively quickly but did not absorb as fast as I would like.</li>
            <li>but she thought was very modern.    </li>
            <li>OK, the spf is only 4</li>
            <li>;) ).</li>
            <li>I reach for this first.  </li>
            <li>I don&#x27;t have chapped lips, they are smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li>My first pro on the product that I could find is no flavor.</li>
            <li>I know that sounds funny alotta people seem to dig the flavored lipbalms.</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s lightly scented and completely flavorless.</li>
            <li>The title may sound minimal, but really what more can you ask from a product.</li>
            <li>I suspect that this stick will melt in your purse if you leave it in the car on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall... it does what it claims and my husband LOVES it and the scent.  </li>
            <li>The emollient gently coats your lips-AND STAYS THERE!</li>
            <li>Nivea Hydro care is a bit different than most.  </li>
            <li>I really don&#x27;t know if it suits everyone, but I think it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li>the lovely blue, all-encompassing cap.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li>Works pretty well</li>
            <li>I first purchased Labello (Nivea&#x27;s predecessor) in Genoa, Italy in 1982.  </li>
            <li>;)</li>
            <li>Since Hydro Care is designed to be \\&quot;absorbed\\&quot;, it feels like it disappears, but after a few uses, it seems to leave my lips good for quite a while.  </li>
            <li>An absolute must if you do any kind of outdoor activity or tend to have dry skin.</li>
            <li>So many balms end up a huge mess</li>
            <li>instead of this, if you&#x27;d rather have something more subtle in shine (suitable for a man who doesn&#x27;t want to appear to have something on his lips) then I&#x27;d go with burts bees</li>
            <li>I had always tried other popular products like EOS and Baby Lips, never getting the results I wanted.</li>
            <li>After needing to find a good lip balm last spring I have used this one religiously.</li>
            <li>Consequently, it wears off quickly and needs frequent reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>This keeps my lips super moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li>It is pretty smooth and actually seems to do it&#x27;s job, so you don&#x27;t have to re-apply it as often as wax lip balm   -</li>
            <li>It glides on very smoothly, and feels a little more slick than most lip balms.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;m usually purely a Burt&#x27;s Bees kinda girl.</li>
            <li>I am a lip balm/gloss junkie, and I definitely have found a new favorite product.</li>
            <li>I swear some lip balms have ingredients in them that make your lips more dry than before you tried them!</li>
            <li>Unlike competing brands, which feel like coating your lips with a melted candle, this Nivea lip balm goes on light and clean -- with a nice fresh scent -- but does the job at least as well as those other</li>
            <li>but it won&#x27;t come with me in my purse, on vacation and doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li>I got a sample of this lip balm and was really amazed at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li>But this was very moisturizing without being greasy and actually very soothing on your lips, like shea butter.</li>
            <li>B0002Z8Q3Q Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm Beeswax Tube]], however if you want totally color/scent free with a bit of shine and don&#x27;t mind a slippery feel</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not colored, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about how I will look if I accidently put too much on.</li>
            <li>With an SPF of 4 I didn&#x27;t really think of this product as a sunscreen for my lips because 4 is almost like 0.</li>
            <li>so I don&#x27;t really think much hydration was happening.</li>
            <li>Very soothing for chapped lips.  </li>
            <li>It really helps to prevent my lips from chapping.</li>
            <li>There isn&#x27;t much you can say about this product.</li>
            <li>I have been using this lip balm for a while, but it is very pricey.</li>
            <li>that very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>that very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li>It&#x27;s not designed to work that way, and this is what I really like about it.  </li>
            <li>However chapped your lips are multiple application of this lip balm will make them smooth within hours.</li>
            <li>you&#x27;ve not tried this, absolutely pick one up -</li>
            <li>It applies smoothly but it only hydrates my lips for a minute.</li>
            <li>It really dries your lips out.</li>
            <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve been through a hundred different kinds of lip balms and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li>(another striking difference when compared with other lip care products in my experience)</li>
            <li>I also love that this product has some SPF, but it doesn&#x27;t taste like it has sunscreen like a lot of other lip products with SPF do.</li>
            <li>Lips are more susceptible to UV damage than other skin.  </li>
            <li>so you do have to re-apply more often than other chapsticks</li>
            <li>Living in Southern California where the sun is pretty strong, I&#x27;m always putting on sunscreen and definitely something for my lips.</li>
            <li>and it sinks in easily.</li>
            <li>Has helped to smooth out and reduce raggedy dry lips skin on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li>It feels like I licked my lips with my tongue, and it dries up quickly just the same.</li>
            <li>I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for several years, and after living in two very harsh wintering areas, as well as arid high deserts, I can surely say that this is one of my top 5 items over the years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got next to no taste for those accidents.&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li>My daughter tried it and said it was too greasy, but again, that&#x27;s pretty much what lip balm is, a stick of grease, and this really isn&#x27;t any different.</li>
            <li>It stands true to it&#x27;s name,as it is very hydrating and the moisture stays for longer times,even in the dry and sunny weather.</li>
            <li>I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li>I highly recommend this product for sports enthusiasts/athletes or anyone who spends time outdoors - and for the upcoming winter weather, this lip balm will be a must have.</li>
            <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li>It is highly regarded and well rated.  </li>
            <li>The thing that bothers me about most lip balm is that it is mostly made from wax, so it goes on thick and leaves a layer on your lips that comes off on everything from coffee cups to your shirt collar when you turn your head around far enough (like backing a car out of your driveway).    </li>
            <li>It is smooth, glides on easily, fragrance free, tasteless.  </li>
            <li>No harsh chemicals on those very absorptive lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>The green one has a better smell though.</li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re looking for good lip protection, you can do a lot worse.</li>
            <li>when left in a pocket or bag, this is very well sealed keeping it clean and keeping it from popping open etc.     </li>
            <li>Great feel-it certainly does help hydrate the lips without any scent or artificial color.  </li>
            <li>I love how it leaves my lips soft and supple but it doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li>I would just prefer this be my new brand now.</li>
            <li>I know she hands me a new tube and</li>
            <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s even cured my husbands super dry and flakey lips, if I can keep him applying it</li>
            <li>For women (or men) looking for a balm to repair your sore cracked lips, a major moisture boost, and added sun protection, this is absolutely the balm to buy.</li>
            <li>Well when I first go the box from the vine told my mom we all live at the same house here my mom and bro etc.</li>
            <li>WOW!</li>
            <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s a pretty generic lip balm.  </li>
            <li>I have tried many other lip products as such from Avon etc.</li>
            <li>Sufficient protection for daily wear, but I agree with other users about wanting more if you are playing softball or skiing or out in the sun for extended periods.</li>
            <li>First off, the plastic casing is a bit bigger and designed to be the size and style of a lipstick container.  </li>
            <li>I never got mine in the mail but emailed them about it and they fixed it!</li>
            <li>of all it makes my lips so soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li>container is like a small lipstick and handy for your purse, beach bag or back pack.</li>
            <li>I put this product on around bed time and was still noticing the positive effects the next day.    </li>
            <li>Also the mechanism works well which allows you to use the full product unlike other that you might end up throwing out before using it all.</li>
            <li>, it&#x27;s perfectly clear and</li>
            <li>The problem for me is that it feels like it sits on the surface of the lip, rather than really absorbing in and moisturizing properly.  </li>
            <li>so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>So busy wanting to taste  the flavor you end up licking the product intended to moisturize or heal the cracked lips off your lips before it can do its job.</li>
            <li>And they feel kissably soft too.</li>
            <li>Unlike a chapstick, the lid is the whole blue cover that you see in the picture.  </li>
            <li>Your lips feel so soft and supple, even hours after it has worn off</li>
            <li>The blue cover seals the product well and is very hygienic.  </li>
            <li>Con&#x27;s  this product is not all natural or even close.    </li>
            <li>I keep one in my car so I can use it frequently when I am about town.  </li>
            <li>Needless to say, I use it fairly</li>
            <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave behind the kind of greasy, thick feeling layer that most lip balms do.  </li>
            <li>put the long-wear on first thing in the morning, let it dry completely and hit the door.</li>
            <li>While I prefer a moist feeling compared to some balm (burts bees) which are pretty dry feeling, I feel like this one is a bit to slippery.     </li>
            <li>I have every type of burts bee&#x27;s that they make, a big selection of avon balms, and some of the marketed to children flavored balms as well as classic chapstick.     </li>
            <li>I like the slight oversize of the lip-balm: this covers your whole mouth area very well.</li>
            <li>- The case is a bit bigger than normal lip balm.  </li>
            <li>The real test of this lip balm would be  to try it during the extremely dry winter months when lips are chapped &amp; cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>My lips are sensitive and become dry fairly easy within a few hours of not having applied any lip balm . . .</li>
            <li>I have two other brands, but I always reach for this one first.</li>
            <li>Goes on smoothly in all temperatures -- important if you keep an extra tube in your car or purse for cold weather use.  </li>
            <li>My husband will only use this product to keeps his lips soft.  </li>
            <li>&quot; This is what I got, but apparently, I needed to get Nivea Kiss of Moisture, not Smoothness.  </li>
            <li>If you&#x27;re a senior citizen and starting to get those fine lines, get this product and you&#x27;ll put a stop to (or at least curb)</li>
            <li>Almost scent free and completely tasteless, Lip Care goes on with silky smooth creaminess and stays on a long time.  </li>
            <li>It comes out of the package with rounded edges, much nicer than some other</li>
            <li>This lip balm is highly moisturizing and long lasting.</li>
            <li>so much you wear it in the dark).</li>
            <li>In fact, this is exactly how it works and after a few moments you don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s there anymore.  </li>
            <li>live in a very dry climate (Alaska)</li>
            <li>I live in a desert, so dry skin and lips is a constant problem for me.</li>
            <li>My only complaint is the lack of taste, as I prefer tingy peppermint in my lip balm due to its refreshing qualities.</li>
            <li>I really like this product and already ordered another half dozen of the nivea lip care ....</li>
            <li>The amount of raggedy dry skin has decreased, making my lips look better naked or with lip color.</li>
            <li>It is a whole stick, opposed to something pouring out of little holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li>I am new to this brand and can&#x27;t wait to try other things they have to offer us ladies .</li>
            <li>She even loved the casing it comes in which I thought was a little dowdy</li>
    </ol>

            <li> Its very effective.</li>
            <li> This has been very effective on me.</li>
            <li> it is a great product and has a good value as well for what it does.  </li>
            <li> At this time, however, it just doesn&#x27;t compare to a product that I feel is superior in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
            <li> It also lasts for a good while, a couple of hours without needing to reapply.</li>
            <li> But I went by Good Housekeeping recommendations and I do not like the feel on my lips and think even Chap Stick works better.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
            <li> She said nivea thats a good brand.</li>
            <li> Good price&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> Delightful light</li>
            <li> Feels good, no discernible taste.</li>
            <li> It makes my lips look and feel so good.</li>
            <li> The composition as an emolient feels superior.</li>
            <li> Really really smooth lips, goes on well, even tastes delicious!!</li>
            <li> best chap stick on the market right now!</li>
            <li> These lip balms are great and not like the waxy ones that make me feel like I should put a wick in my mouth and light it as if it was a candle!  </li>
            <li> Very sexy feeling</li>
            <li> PLEASE keep them available online!!</li>
            <li> I simply love it!</li>
            <li> Always love Nivea!</li>
            <li> I love this stuff!</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this in bulk!</li>
            <li> LOVE Nivea !</li>
            <li> but this one is still my favorite!</li>
            <li> Now that I&#x27;ve gone through a winter, I would say this is a great light, colorless lip moisturizer.  </li>
            <li> The Nivea brand is simply amazing</li>
            <li> applicator itself is quite nice, also.  </li>
            <li> and I have tried every kind out there (and returned the bads</li>
            <li> , if you like something with a tasty flavor/smell and nice mouth feel I&#x27;d recommend [[ASIN:</li>
            <li> I would have to use it whether I liked it or not since it&#x27;s in a pack of 6.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Nice to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It is really nice.</li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t like that warm</li>
            <li> Nice product for a guy.</li>
            <li> But there are times in the summer where it comes in handy.  </li>
            <li> Hydrating SPF 4 Lip Care Stick will be comparative to Burt&#x27;s Bees, since it would have to best that product to become my new</li>
            <li> Nivea Lip Care Stick glides on easily, and moisturizes fairly well.  </li>
            <li> I also like the pleasant light scent it</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s so great and super affordable too.</li>
            <li> It goes on real smooth, and rather than sit on top of your lips like wax based lip balms, it is said to be \\&quot;absorbed\\&quot; into the lips.  </li>
            <li> and I think more effective than what I&#x27;ve been used to.      </li>
            <li> It is definitely superior to the more commonly available chapstick.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, and moisture retaining for the lips.  </li>
            <li> a very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s very smooth and not tacky at all.</li>
            <li> I use this Nivea on top of them and it works much better than the products included with the long-wear colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> Anyone want a bunch of partly-used Chapstick and Burts Bees? :)</li>
            <li> (I catch my self spending more time than I should to apply just because it feels</li>
            <li> Not bad!..could be better, maybe they should think things with flavor maybe..other than that, its an ok product.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s more like a lotion that absorbs into the lips.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
            <li> On top of that, it is unflavoured and unscented, so I&#x27;m not forever wanting to lick my lips, so it stays in place a lot longer.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m glad we can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> It didn&#x27;t keep my lips moisturized for more than a minute.</li>
            <li> This moisturizing stick makes my lips feel softer, smoother and definitely more kissable.  </li>
            <li> would rate this at the top of my list.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s an ok balm depending what your going for</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm.</li>
            <li> Looked on Amazon and read reviews of many lip balms and decided on this one.  </li>
            <li> I really love being able to buy these in bulk packages of 6 on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I have bought many of these, and will keep doing so.</li>
            <li> For me, I see that my lips are looking better for it.</li>
            <li> hydrating lip care has become a favorite of mine</li>
            <li> I am allergic to all lipsticks and most chapsticks, but these have not caused a reaction!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I really love this product and use it all the time.</li>
            <li> As you&#x27;d expect, lip balm is lip balm, for the most part.</li>
            <li> Nivea is her favorite.</li>
            <li> It goes on smooth, not chunky and no overpowering tutti-fruity smell!</li>
            <li> even look a lot better as soon as you have the lip balm on.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I buy it by the 6 pack.  </li>
            <li> I love this chapstick because it works to hydrate your lips while looking like a gloss.  </li>
            <li> Safe for all day/night application.</li>
            <li> and this is really cheap for this brand!</li>
            <li> My fiancee hates my chapstick/lip balms (Mostly Burts Bees).  </li>
            <li> I have tried so many, and clogged up my bags, bathroom, desk, and car with oodles of them...</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve used a variety of products over the years, and I&#x27;ve found some to be better than others.    </li>
            <li> Moisture Lip balm is one of the better products on the market, in my opinion.</li>
            <li> Seven things to love about Nivea a Kiss of Moisture</li>
            <li> have used it for 3 or 4 yrs-- glad to buy it 6 @</li>
            <li> i love this lip care because it is not frozen during winter</li>
            <li> I like this one better-</li>
            <li> Be sure to purchase on Amazon - much better prices than stores.</li>
            <li> Amazon always has the best prices and shipping is fast and allows me to have it shipped right to her in her dorm.</li>
            <li> Isn&#x27;t caky like Chapstick can be but is very smooth and easy to apply.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t put shine or color on my lips, goes on smoothly, feels good, absorbs fast and keeps my lips nicely conditioned.</li>
            <li> Thats amazing to me and worth getting more of these.</li>
            <li> Nivea&#x27;s Kiss of Moisture lip care is light and wonderful to use on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> very smooth and light application</li>
            <li> well she was right if it works that quickly its good for sure.</li>
            <li> My lips stay smooth and I can put lipstick on top of it.  </li>
            <li> I love how smooth this feels going on.</li>
            <li> Nivea Lip Care is a great way to weatherproof your sensitive lips, and keep them continually moist.</li>
            <li> Buy and enjoy:)</li>
            <li> No funny taste -- perfect for kissing.&lt;br</li>
            <li> but it works best when applied without any other products.  </li>
            <li> However, the original packaging lists  ingredients that are favorable- castor seed oil, shea butter, jojoba seed oil, grape seed oil-all excellent ingredients that explain why this moisturizing stick is so helpful for dry lips.  </li>
            <li> Surprisingly, the feel is very moist and smooth</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell strongly</li>
            <li> For a women&#x27;s pocketbook, it would be just fine.    </li>
            <li> After putting it on it makes your lips look super shiny and really healthy.  </li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t quickly disappear like so many others.</li>
            <li> After just a week of use my lips are much smoother (and more kissable!</li>
            <li> I noticed with the weather warming my lips were chapping far more easily, so I gave this a try, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
            <li> It smooths on great, and it leaves my lips feeling smooth if I use it on a regular basis.</li>
            <li> These balms are no longer available in my area so order them online...</li>
            <li> chapped and smooth</li>
            <li> The Nivea balm goes on velvety smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave your lips feeling greasy or looking shiny.</li>
            <li> /&gt;If Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm were no longer available, I might try Nivea&#x27;s Lip Care Stick again.  </li>
            <li> Lightweight and smooth moisturizer for lips</li>
            <li> The balm is soothing to my lips, which tend to chap, and glides smoothly.</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly, stays on, and keeps my lips moist without being sticky or caking up.  </li>
            <li> The balm applies smoothly with a satiny finish-none of the chalky, waxiness that we can experience elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How</li>
            <li> It glides on your lips smoothly and starts moisturizing immediately.</li>
            <li> It has an unassuming butter-balm odor, and it goes on smooth.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m a guy, but I like to have smooth lips, you know why</li>
            <li> I was surprised by all of the good reviews on this lip balm.</li>
            <li> Too many products have a scent/smell that I don&#x27;t like, but this product has little to no smell - and what there is is very light and pleasant.</li>
            <li> Great for the lips and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> but that&#x27;s 4 more than nothing and the higher spf&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t feel or look as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this lip balm when I first received it.</li>
            <li> So I was really really excited to receive this in the mail...</li>
            <li> I opened it up and found that I wasn&#x27;t as excited</li>
            <li> so it&#x27;s definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> 31 years of avid devotion and my love for this product is not waning.  </li>
            <li> It has spf which is super important.</li>
            <li> in all though, it&#x27;s a good deal, as 6 tubes should last for years!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip balm for almost a week now, and cannot come up with enough good things to say about it.</li>
            <li> I normally use Rosebud Slave everyday and love it, it stays on, looks good and has a nice non-gooey texture.</li>
            <li> True</li>
            <li> Thanks Amazon, you made this mom&#x27;s effort easier :)</li>
            <li> In a pinch, I bought a two-pack of Nivea Kiss of Smoothness because it was handy and inexpensive, but I have been pleasantly surprised at the results.  </li>
            <li> Hope I can find this good of a deal next time!</li>
            <li> Mildly scented, which is nice if you are sensitive to, or tend to get overwhelmed by, fragrances.  </li>
            <li> and it soaks in quickly.  </li>
            <li> I enjoyed giving it out to others who also like it immensely and plan on getting more of it.</li>
            <li> I enjoyed giving it out to others who also like it immensely and plan on getting more of it.</li>
            <li> I guess Smoothness is OKAY, but it won&#x27;t heal my chapped lips, only help them stay \\&quot;okay\\&quot; when they are already good and soft.</li>
            <li> This particular flavor is superb for protecting your lips from dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Within few minutes of application, it comforts your lips.</li>
            <li> - Goes on really smooth and gets absorbed pretty quick.     </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s super soft and I love the feel on my lips.</li>
            <li> This is a great little lip moisturizer.</li>
            <li> texture/shine: It&#x27;s pretty high shine for a balm, which I love.</li>
            <li> only problem is that I have to rinse it off every day with warm water and (for me) a microfiber cloth.</li>
            <li> it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> For the price, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used some kind of lip balm, especially in the wintertime.  </li>
            <li> Because it gets absorbed into your lips, it doesn&#x27;t tend to get all over your shirt collar, coffee cups, etc.   </li>
            <li> I rarely have to reapply.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I love the way it smooths out your lips, filling in cracks and making them soft.</li>
            <li> and it absorbed right in, can snap fingers right away...</li>
            <li> /&gt;Living in Alabama (with the highest rate of skin cancer in the world with the exception of Australia--both with hot sun and many blue-eyed people), I&#x27;m especially interested in something that keeps my mouth healthy: the lips are a common site for basal cell carcinoma.  </li>
            <li> feeling like it&#x27;s slid right off my lips around my mouth.</li>
            <li> I must always have something on my lips, and normally that is some sort of light lipgloss</li>
            <li> keeps my lips nice and moist all day long</li>
            <li> The deal on here was great, and I bought enough to last me all year!</li>
            <li> The product seem to moisten our lips relatively quickly but did not absorb as fast as I would like.</li>
            <li> but she thought was very modern.    </li>
            <li> OK, the spf is only 4</li>
            <li> ;) ).</li>
            <li> I reach for this first.  </li>
            <li> I don&#x27;t have chapped lips, they are smooth and soft.  </li>
            <li> My first pro on the product that I could find is no flavor.</li>
            <li> I know that sounds funny alotta people seem to dig the flavored lipbalms.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s lightly scented and completely flavorless.</li>
            <li> The title may sound minimal, but really what more can you ask from a product.</li>
            <li> I suspect that this stick will melt in your purse if you leave it in the car on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall... it does what it claims and my husband LOVES it and the scent.  </li>
            <li> The emollient gently coats your lips-AND STAYS THERE!</li>
            <li> Nivea Hydro care is a bit different than most.  </li>
            <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it suits everyone, but I think it&#x27;s worth a try</li>
            <li> the lovely blue, all-encompassing cap.&lt;br /&gt;2.</li>
            <li> Works pretty well</li>
            <li> I first purchased Labello (Nivea&#x27;s predecessor) in Genoa, Italy in 1982.  </li>
            <li> ;)</li>
            <li> Since Hydro Care is designed to be \\&quot;absorbed\\&quot;, it feels like it disappears, but after a few uses, it seems to leave my lips good for quite a while.  </li>
            <li> An absolute must if you do any kind of outdoor activity or tend to have dry skin.</li>
            <li> So many balms end up a huge mess</li>
            <li> instead of this, if you&#x27;d rather have something more subtle in shine (suitable for a man who doesn&#x27;t want to appear to have something on his lips) then I&#x27;d go with burts bees</li>
            <li> I had always tried other popular products like EOS and Baby Lips, never getting the results I wanted.</li>
            <li> After needing to find a good lip balm last spring I have used this one religiously.</li>
            <li> Consequently, it wears off quickly and needs frequent reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> This keeps my lips super moisturized and soft.</li>
            <li> It is pretty smooth and actually seems to do it&#x27;s job, so you don&#x27;t have to re-apply it as often as wax lip balm   -</li>
            <li> It glides on very smoothly, and feels a little more slick than most lip balms.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m usually purely a Burt&#x27;s Bees kinda girl.</li>
            <li> I am a lip balm/gloss junkie, and I definitely have found a new favorite product.</li>
            <li> I swear some lip balms have ingredients in them that make your lips more dry than before you tried them!</li>
            <li> Unlike competing brands, which feel like coating your lips with a melted candle, this Nivea lip balm goes on light and clean -- with a nice fresh scent -- but does the job at least as well as those other</li>
            <li> but it won&#x27;t come with me in my purse, on vacation and doesn&#x27;t do much.  </li>
            <li> I got a sample of this lip balm and was really amazed at how well it worked.  </li>
            <li> But this was very moisturizing without being greasy and actually very soothing on your lips, like shea butter.</li>
            <li> B0002Z8Q3Q Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm Beeswax Tube]], however if you want totally color/scent free with a bit of shine and don&#x27;t mind a slippery feel</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not colored, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about how I will look if I accidently put too much on.</li>
            <li> With an SPF of 4 I didn&#x27;t really think of this product as a sunscreen for my lips because 4 is almost like 0.</li>
            <li> so I don&#x27;t really think much hydration was happening.</li>
            <li> Very soothing for chapped lips.  </li>
            <li> It really helps to prevent my lips from chapping.</li>
            <li> There isn&#x27;t much you can say about this product.</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip balm for a while, but it is very pricey.</li>
            <li> that very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> that very well.&lt;br</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not designed to work that way, and this is what I really like about it.  </li>
            <li> However chapped your lips are multiple application of this lip balm will make them smooth within hours.</li>
            <li> you&#x27;ve not tried this, absolutely pick one up -</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly but it only hydrates my lips for a minute.</li>
            <li> It really dries your lips out.</li>
            <li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve been through a hundred different kinds of lip balms and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
            <li> (another striking difference when compared with other lip care products in my experience)</li>
            <li> I also love that this product has some SPF, but it doesn&#x27;t taste like it has sunscreen like a lot of other lip products with SPF do.</li>
            <li> Lips are more susceptible to UV damage than other skin.  </li>
            <li> so you do have to re-apply more often than other chapsticks</li>
            <li> Living in Southern California where the sun is pretty strong, I&#x27;m always putting on sunscreen and definitely something for my lips.</li>
            <li> and it sinks in easily.</li>
            <li> Has helped to smooth out and reduce raggedy dry lips skin on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
            <li> It feels like I licked my lips with my tongue, and it dries up quickly just the same.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for several years, and after living in two very harsh wintering areas, as well as arid high deserts, I can surely say that this is one of my top 5 items over the years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got next to no taste for those accidents.&lt;br /&gt;Never</li>
            <li> My daughter tried it and said it was too greasy, but again, that&#x27;s pretty much what lip balm is, a stick of grease, and this really isn&#x27;t any different.</li>
            <li> It stands true to it&#x27;s name,as it is very hydrating and the moisture stays for longer times,even in the dry and sunny weather.</li>
            <li> I had high hopes for this</li>
            <li> I highly recommend this product for sports enthusiasts/athletes or anyone who spends time outdoors - and for the upcoming winter weather, this lip balm will be a must have.</li>
            <li> I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> It is highly regarded and well rated.  </li>
            <li> The thing that bothers me about most lip balm is that it is mostly made from wax, so it goes on thick and leaves a layer on your lips that comes off on everything from coffee cups to your shirt collar when you turn your head around far enough (like backing a car out of your driveway).    </li>
            <li> It is smooth, glides on easily, fragrance free, tasteless.  </li>
            <li> No harsh chemicals on those very absorptive lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The green one has a better smell though.</li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re looking for good lip protection, you can do a lot worse.</li>
            <li> when left in a pocket or bag, this is very well sealed keeping it clean and keeping it from popping open etc.     </li>
            <li> Great feel-it certainly does help hydrate the lips without any scent or artificial color.  </li>
            <li> I love how it leaves my lips soft and supple but it doesn&#x27;t last long...</li>
            <li> I would just prefer this be my new brand now.</li>
            <li> I know she hands me a new tube and</li>
            <li> /&gt;It&#x27;s even cured my husbands super dry and flakey lips, if I can keep him applying it</li>
            <li> For women (or men) looking for a balm to repair your sore cracked lips, a major moisture boost, and added sun protection, this is absolutely the balm to buy.</li>
            <li> Well when I first go the box from the vine told my mom we all live at the same house here my mom and bro etc.</li>
            <li> WOW!</li>
            <li> Otherwise, it&#x27;s a pretty generic lip balm.  </li>
            <li> I have tried many other lip products as such from Avon etc.</li>
            <li> Sufficient protection for daily wear, but I agree with other users about wanting more if you are playing softball or skiing or out in the sun for extended periods.</li>
            <li> First off, the plastic casing is a bit bigger and designed to be the size and style of a lipstick container.  </li>
            <li> I never got mine in the mail but emailed them about it and they fixed it!</li>
            <li> of all it makes my lips so soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li> container is like a small lipstick and handy for your purse, beach bag or back pack.</li>
            <li> I put this product on around bed time and was still noticing the positive effects the next day.    </li>
            <li> Also the mechanism works well which allows you to use the full product unlike other that you might end up throwing out before using it all.</li>
            <li> , it&#x27;s perfectly clear and</li>
            <li> The problem for me is that it feels like it sits on the surface of the lip, rather than really absorbing in and moisturizing properly.  </li>
            <li> so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> So busy wanting to taste  the flavor you end up licking the product intended to moisturize or heal the cracked lips off your lips before it can do its job.</li>
            <li> And they feel kissably soft too.</li>
            <li> Unlike a chapstick, the lid is the whole blue cover that you see in the picture.  </li>
            <li> Your lips feel so soft and supple, even hours after it has worn off</li>
            <li> The blue cover seals the product well and is very hygienic.  </li>
            <li> Con&#x27;s  this product is not all natural or even close.    </li>
            <li> I keep one in my car so I can use it frequently when I am about town.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I use it fairly</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t leave behind the kind of greasy, thick feeling layer that most lip balms do.  </li>
            <li> put the long-wear on first thing in the morning, let it dry completely and hit the door.</li>
            <li> While I prefer a moist feeling compared to some balm (burts bees) which are pretty dry feeling, I feel like this one is a bit to slippery.     </li>
            <li> I have every type of burts bee&#x27;s that they make, a big selection of avon balms, and some of the marketed to children flavored balms as well as classic chapstick.     </li>
            <li> I like the slight oversize of the lip-balm: this covers your whole mouth area very well.</li>
            <li> - The case is a bit bigger than normal lip balm.  </li>
            <li> The real test of this lip balm would be  to try it during the extremely dry winter months when lips are chapped &amp; cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> My lips are sensitive and become dry fairly easy within a few hours of not having applied any lip balm . . .</li>
            <li> I have two other brands, but I always reach for this one first.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly in all temperatures -- important if you keep an extra tube in your car or purse for cold weather use.  </li>
            <li> My husband will only use this product to keeps his lips soft.  </li>
            <li> &quot; This is what I got, but apparently, I needed to get Nivea Kiss of Moisture, not Smoothness.  </li>
            <li> If you&#x27;re a senior citizen and starting to get those fine lines, get this product and you&#x27;ll put a stop to (or at least curb)</li>
            <li> Almost scent free and completely tasteless, Lip Care goes on with silky smooth creaminess and stays on a long time.  </li>
            <li> It comes out of the package with rounded edges, much nicer than some other</li>
            <li> This lip balm is highly moisturizing and long lasting.</li>
            <li> so much you wear it in the dark).</li>
            <li> In fact, this is exactly how it works and after a few moments you don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s there anymore.  </li>
            <li> live in a very dry climate (Alaska)</li>
            <li> I live in a desert, so dry skin and lips is a constant problem for me.</li>
            <li> My only complaint is the lack of taste, as I prefer tingy peppermint in my lip balm due to its refreshing qualities.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and already ordered another half dozen of the nivea lip care ....</li>
            <li> The amount of raggedy dry skin has decreased, making my lips look better naked or with lip color.</li>
            <li> It is a whole stick, opposed to something pouring out of little holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> I am new to this brand and can&#x27;t wait to try other things they have to offer us ladies .</li>
            <li> She even loved the casing it comes in which I thought was a little dowdy</li>
            <li> They tend to dry out your lips, though, and the so-called moisturizer that some include is barely usable.</li>
            <li> We&#x27;ll have to wait for colder weather to be sure, but it is far beyond unpleasant.</li>
            <li> it is pretty much like expensive</li>
            <li> You have to give it a chance to really work over a few applications, especially if you have really dry lips.</li>
            <li> : Like I said, the real test would be the harsh dry winter of Alaska.</li>
            <li> I blew her off saying that I didn&#x27;t really have trouble with dry lips and was not a &#x27;chapstick or lipstick&#x27; carrier.</li>
            <li> it moisturizes well, no built up gook on the lips, last long time.</li>
            <li> It does not last very long</li>
            <li> If I skip using the balm for a day or two, my lips get really dry but don&#x27;t peel the same way.</li>
            <li> If you have dry, chapped or flaky lips, I can&#x27;t recommend this product to you enough.  </li>
            <li> My lips instantly feel moisturized and not as dry or chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> The smell also reminded me of an airplane toilet.</li>
            <li> In this dry climate (as well as the notorious dry air of a long flight) this lip balm is terrific.</li>
            <li> Lipstick is hard to apply after using Nivea Softness as it does not stick very well</li>
            <li> it comes in only because things can get smashed in the dark and mysterious depths of my purse.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s not as long wearing as I&#x27;m used to</li>
            <li> no odor at all, some balms leave a strange color or taste on your lips and this does neither.    </li>
            <li> It lasts a long time on your lips, and has almost no taste at all.</li>
            <li> It wears long and seems to make lips look and feel</li>
            <li> so I am extra careful not to confuse the two.  </li>
            <li> I prefer long wearing lip stain.  </li>
            <li> and I refuse to use any other brand and stock up on only this one !</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips and also live in NM where we have very little humidity.</li>
            <li> Dip your finger in Olive oil and rub on your lips, then dip your finger into granulated sugar and rub your lips with this mixture whenever they are dry and peeling.  </li>
            <li> I do this as needed and have never had dry, cracked lips.  </li>
            <li> I have problem dry skin, lips included.</li>
            <li> As well as being on a C-pap at night they dry the lips out to point  of painfulness and this product works well for me on that end as well.  </li>
            <li> My lips remain dry.  </li>
            <li> - Doesn&#x27;t need to be constantly re-applied and after a few applications the effects seem to last all day.     </li>
            <li> But it&#x27;s taken two weeks of battering without cracking so the plastic mst be pretty tough.</li>
            <li> bought 8 and carry them around in every single coat.</li>
            <li> As a bonus, while I used to have trouble getting the tiny caps of the Neutrogena lip balm containers, my aging fingers have little trouble opening and holding on to the large tube-type caps on the Nivea containers.  </li>
            <li> This goes on easy even when it&#x27;s cold</li>
            <li> What I was interested in it for was the \\&quot;hydrating effects\\&quot; but unfortunately those were short lived.</li>
            <li> Out of several different products I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one has capture my attention.</li>
            <li> strange odor.&lt;br /&gt;No colours - you can wear it over or under other lip products...</li>
            <li> It glides on smoothly, like a thin oil would, leaves a shine and makes my lips slick but not heavy or thickly coated.  </li>
            <li> woman friend asked the other day,\\&quot;My lips feel dry, do you have anything around your house?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
            <li> I usually get them in singles because they last so long..</li>
            <li> I expected to feel the waxiness of a chap stick--</li>
            <li> The thin texture means there isn&#x27;t too much gunk on your lips</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s way too slidy and wet.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s definitely not too heavy or sticky</li>
            <li> I do have quite some trouble with different medications i am on and having diabetes you tend to have dryer skin</li>
            <li> if you don&#x27;t like the old thick waxy stuff.    </li>
            <li> I love shea butter, but I think the jojoba oil makes me sick to my stomach.  </li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the little things that make this a slightly above average product compared to others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
            <li> and I&#x27;ve usually got some color left when I get home in the evening.&lt;br</li>
            <li> I switched over to this lip balm after trying Chap-stick, Aquaphor and other products for years.</li>
            <li> For me, a person who eschews lipsticks and other lip items, it makes its presence known for about 15 minutes, then I forget about it.</li>
            <li> I would prefer Blistex, Chapstick, or any other.</li>
            <li> The taste isn&#x27;t really inspiring but at least it isn&#x27;t some crazy fruity combination.</li>
            <li> It seems less waxy than other lip balms.</li>
            <li> So no more fumbling with a tiny little lid that drops and can never be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
            <li> - there&#x27;s nothing I hate more than sticky lip balm.</li>
            <li> a gentle push will send the moisturizer down the tube -- it&#x27;s almost impossible for your four-year-old daughter to smoosh your lip balm when she puts the cap back on.  </li>
            <li> Nivea Recovery 15 on the other hand!</li>
            <li> /&gt;And when I found this, I never bought any other again!</li>
            <li> I keep a tube of it everywhere, my purse, my make-up table, the downstairs half bath, and my desk drawer at work.  </li>
            <li> Not effective at all even after continuous application throughout the day I would wake up with dry lips.  </li>
            <li> I was a little hesitant about the case/tube</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t have a weird taste and your lips won&#x27;t feel dry again an hour later.</li>
            <li> For a few years now, I&#x27;ve been a dedicated Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm user.  </li>
            <li> Lip gloss was too gooey and sticky, lipstick was too heavy.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve tried a few over the years and they seemed like glorified lip gloss, fingers in tubs didn&#x27;t spell &#x27;sanitary&#x27; in my book.  </li>
            <li> /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got it and applied a few times.  </li>
            <li> Nor is it that waxy whitish uneven coating of the lipsavers of yesteryear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read the ingredients, chemical make-up, etc.  </li>
            <li> - It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;seal\\&quot; your lips like regular lip balm making your lips feel worse over time.  </li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge proponent of lip balms.</li>
            <li> It solves your lip issues the natural way, without artificial flavors or colors.</li>
            <li> I found I needed to apply it about twice as often as ordinary lip balms, but it feels and works so well that IMO</li>
            <li> pepperminty feel that my usual brand boasts</li>
            <li> The balm is unscented and tasteless and doesn&#x27;t cause any itching or inflammation on my sensitive skin.</li>
            <li> No more cracking at the corners of my lips.</li>
            <li> No more cracking at the corners of my lips.</li>
            <li> Your lip balm should always have at least an SPF of 15.</li>
            <li> I mean we&#x27;re talking about lip balm here.&lt;br /&gt;In</li>
            <li> Just skipping my mosturizing routine for one day can cause major dryness and painful chapped lips.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t give bad reviews.</li>
            <li> It is untinted, and adds a subtle shine without glitter or colour-</li>
            <li> I used to use Neutrogena lip balm, which is quite hard to find in the stores and also quite expensive.  </li>
            <li> I wouldn&#x27;t be afraid to keep this in my back pocket and sit on it, nor would I be afraid of this container accidentally opening.</li>
            <li> Now that it&#x27;s cold, I&#x27;m constantly reapplying, as the cold gusts dries out my lips before walking from my car to the grocery store.</li>
            <li> It doesn&#x27;t irritate already painful lips and it glides on gently, not cracking them.</li>
            <li> I get easily nauseated by smells</li>
            <li> I used this lip care stick during a 3 hour golf game in 100+ degree heat, it never melted in my pocket and protected my lips from sunburn.</li>
            <li> Our lips are so sensitive, and get some of the worst exposure to sun, wind and cold, not to mention the workout our poor lips get eating, etc.&lt;br</li>
            <li> So now I have six useless chapsticks.  </li>
            <li> Needless to say, I use a lot</li>
            <li> and I was at one time guilty for that</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this lip balm, I won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
            <li> Now during the dry months I can relax knowing that my lips are protected from cracking and blistering without the awful feeling of greasy, filmy lip coating.&lt;br</li>
            <li> Men should not be afraid to use the colorless women&#x27;s lip balm because it will do wonders to your lips.</li>
            <li> Doesn&#x27;t look like chicken grease on my lips&lt;</li>
            <li> This stick is tasteless bordering on waxy however it does do its job.</li>
            <li> Not sure if I had an allergic reaction but it made my lips burn and peel so terribly</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this chapstick!</li>
            <li> It is hard to find something with spf that doesn&#x27;t taste horrible.</li>
            <li> Bad and noticeable flavor.</li>
            <li> I hate reapplying lipstick over and over throughout the day, so I like to use long-wear products like Outlast and Colorstay.</li>
            <li> But I bought this piece of crap in bulk.</li>
            <li> but it was horrible!  </li>

            <li> I had high hopes for this but it was horrible!  Not sure if I had an allergic reaction but it made my lips burn and peel so terribly I just had to throw it away.  The smell also reminded me of an airplane toilet.</li>
            <li> bought this at the store just to have extra lip balm in my vehicle..it moisturizes well, no built up gook on the lips, last long time.</li>
            <li> These lip balms are great and not like the waxy ones that make me feel like I should put a wick in my mouth and light it as if it was a candle!  These balms are no longer available in my area so order them online...PLEASE keep them available online!!</li>
            <li> Great for the lips and lasts a long time.</li>
            <li> I hate reapplying lipstick over and over throughout the day, so I like to use long-wear products like Outlast and Colorstay. They tend to dry out your lips, though, and the so-called moisturizer that some include is barely usable. I use this Nivea on top of them and it works much better than the products included with the long-wear colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the long-wear on first thing in the morning, let it dry completely and hit the door. I don&#x27;t have to carry the color around with me all day, I just keep re-applying the Nivea all day and I&#x27;ve usually got some color left when I get home in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For months I&#x27;ve been trekking across the house or office to my purse for the ONE tube of Nivea I owned, despite the fact that there&#x27;s Chapstick and Burts Bees by just about every chair. With this six-pack, that&#x27;s going to change. Anyone want a bunch of partly-used Chapstick and Burts Bees? :)</li>
            <li> Great product.  Keeps my lips un- chapped and smooth</li>
            <li> My husband will only use this product to keeps his lips soft.  Softness without shiny is what he says!</li>
            <li> I expected to feel the waxiness of a chap stick-- something like putting a candle stick to my lips.  Surprisingly, the feel is very moist and smooth (I catch my self spending more time than I should to apply just because it feels good).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like how this leaves my mouth looking healthier without looking like I put on lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in Alabama (with the highest rate of skin cancer in the world with the exception of Australia--both with hot sun and many blue-eyed people), I&#x27;m especially interested in something that keeps my mouth healthy: the lips are a common site for basal cell carcinoma.  OK, the spf is only 4 but that&#x27;s 4 more than nothing and the higher spf&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve used don&#x27;t feel or look as good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A woman friend asked the other day,\\&quot;My lips feel dry, do you have anything around your house?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I pulled this out of my pocket and she used it and I didn&#x27;t get it back.  So, I&#x27;m ordering another pack today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend before a trip into the sun (but you may like the feel of it so much you wear it in the dark).</li>
            <li> Not bad!..could be better, maybe they should think things with flavor maybe..other than that, its an ok product.</li>
            <li> I switched over to this lip balm after trying Chap-stick, Aquaphor and other products for years. The Nivea balm goes on velvety smooth and doesn&#x27;t leave your lips feeling greasy or looking shiny. It&#x27;s more like a lotion that absorbs into the lips.&lt;br /&gt;The only problem is that I have to rinse it off every day with warm water and (for me) a microfiber cloth. Otherwise, I end up with a layer of film that eventually cracks and peels off after a couple days. If I skip using the balm for a day or two, my lips get really dry but don&#x27;t peel the same way. Maybe it&#x27;s a medical thing, but I would think that using the balm every day would heal them.&lt;br /&gt;All in all though, it&#x27;s a good deal, as 6 tubes should last for years!</li>
            <li> I have been using this lip balm for almost a week now, and cannot come up with enough good things to say about it. It glides on very smoothly, and feels a little more slick than most lip balms. The thin texture means there isn&#x27;t too much gunk on your lips and it sinks in easily. It is untinted, and adds a subtle shine without glitter or colour- my boyfriend is always stealing mine, because he loves it too! On top of that, it is unflavoured and unscented, so I&#x27;m not forever wanting to lick my lips, so it stays in place a lot longer. I noticed with the weather warming my lips were chapping far more easily, so I gave this a try, and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. After just a week of use my lips are much smoother (and more kissable! ;) ). This has become a staple for me in a very short time; I keep one in my purse, one in my pocket, and one in my makeup box at home. For women (or men) looking for a balm to repair your sore cracked lips, a major moisture boost, and added sun protection, this is absolutely the balm to buy.</li>
            <li> I have been using Kiss of Smoothness now for 6 months and my lips look and feel great. My wife loves the softness of my lips now. Men should not be afraid to use the colorless women&#x27;s lip balm because it will do wonders to your lips.</li>
            <li> My husband loves this stuff.  I&#x27;m glad we can get it on Amazon.</li>
            <li> I generally don&#x27;t give bad reviews. I suck it up if an item disappoints me. But I bought this piece of crap in bulk. So now I have six useless chapsticks.  It didn&#x27;t keep my lips moisturized for more than a minute. It&#x27;s way too slidy and wet. It feels like I licked my lips with my tongue, and it dries up quickly just the same. Maybe I should&#x27;ve gotten the Kiss of Moisture, I don&#x27;t know. But I&#x27;ll never buy this again.</li>
            <li> So I was told by a friend to get the \\&quot;blue Nivea lip balm.\\&quot; This is what I got, but apparently, I needed to get Nivea Kiss of Moisture, not Smoothness.  I guess Smoothness is OKAY, but it won&#x27;t heal my chapped lips, only help them stay \\&quot;okay\\&quot; when they are already good and soft. Sooo, it stays by my bed in case I need some but it won&#x27;t come with me in my purse, on vacation and doesn&#x27;t do much.  Nivea Recovery 15 on the other hand! WOW!</li>
            <li> This moisturizing stick makes my lips feel softer, smoother and definitely more kissable.  If you have dry, chapped or flaky lips, I can&#x27;t recommend this product to you enough.  It solves your lip issues the natural way, without artificial flavors or colors.</li>
            <li> Finally!  A lip balm that doesn&#x27;t leave my lips feeling sticky and greasy.  For the longest time, I have always loathed the feel of lip balm on both my lips and on the lips of my, ahem, kissing partners.  It was definitely a deterrent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Nivea Kiss of Moisture.  Now during the dry months I can relax knowing that my lips are protected from cracking and blistering without the awful feeling of greasy, filmy lip coating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The applicator itself is quite nice, also.  It&#x27;s actually like a stick instead of a rotating disc along the bottom.  I find this easier to use than traditional chapstick.</li>
            <li> Very smooth, and moisture retaining for the lips.  Conditions lips to be softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> My husband teases me because I constantly use lip balm or chap stick. I tell him that if he loves me he&#x27;ll always have some in his pocket for me if I forget mine. Needless to say, I use a lot and I have tried every kind out there (and returned the bads ones).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would rate this at the top of my list. It&#x27;s got a buttery softness without leaving you sticky or gooey lips. It doesn&#x27;t have a weird taste and your lips won&#x27;t feel dry again an hour later. I swear some lip balms have ingredients in them that make your lips more dry than before you tried them! Winter is approaching, stock up on this!</li>
            <li> For a few years now, I&#x27;ve been a dedicated Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm user.  I keep a tube of it everywhere, my purse, my make-up table, the downstairs half bath, and my desk drawer at work.  Needless to say, I use it fairly often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My review of Nivea&#x27;s A Kiss of Moisture Hydrating SPF 4 Lip Care Stick will be comparative to Burt&#x27;s Bees, since it would have to best that product to become my new staple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Nivea Lip Care Stick glides on easily, and moisturizes fairly well.  The problem for me is that it feels like it sits on the surface of the lip, rather than really absorbing in and moisturizing properly.  Consequently, it wears off quickly and needs frequent reapplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm were no longer available, I might try Nivea&#x27;s Lip Care Stick again.  At this time, however, it just doesn&#x27;t compare to a product that I feel is superior in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B001AQCTWA Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm Beeswax Tube]]</li>
            <li> I got a sample of this lip balm and was really amazed at how well it worked.  It doesn&#x27;t leave behind the kind of greasy, thick feeling layer that most lip balms do.  This goes on easy even when it&#x27;s cold (another striking difference when compared with other lip care products in my experience) and it soaks in quickly.  I found I needed to apply it about twice as often as ordinary lip balms, but it feels and works so well that IMO it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
            <li> I reach for this first.  It is smooth, glides on easily, fragrance free, tasteless.  My lips stay smooth and I can put lipstick on top of it.  I have two other brands, but I always reach for this one first. I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
            <li> I wasn&#x27;t too sure about this lip balm when I first received it. I&#x27;m usually purely a Burt&#x27;s Bees kinda girl. But this was very moisturizing without being greasy and actually very soothing on your lips, like shea butter. It&#x27;s not as long wearing as I&#x27;m used to and it doesn&#x27;t have that cooling pepperminty feel that my usual brand boasts but you can&#x27;t ask for everything.    My younger sister recently stole/forcibly borrowed the Nivea lip balm out of my purse and she adored it. She even loved the casing it comes in which I thought was a little dowdy but she thought was very modern.    I was a little hesitant about the case/tube it comes in only because things can get smashed in the dark and mysterious depths of my purse. But it&#x27;s taken two weeks of battering without cracking so the plastic mst be pretty tough. All in all I&#x27;d get this product again.</li>
            <li> It&#x27;s the little things that make this a slightly above average product compared to others I&#x27;ve used. I must always have something on my lips, and normally that is some sort of light lipgloss (I don&#x27;t like lipsticks heaviness) with some sheer color/shine. I do however keep a supply of different balms around. I have every type of burts bee&#x27;s that they make, a big selection of avon balms, and some of the marketed to children flavored balms as well as classic chapstick.     Color/odor: big plus here, it&#x27;s perfectly clear and no odor at all, some balms leave a strange color or taste on your lips and this does neither.    texture/shine: It&#x27;s pretty high shine for a balm, which I love. However I&#x27;m torn on the texture of it, it&#x27;s very emollient and remains that way, leaving me feeling like I have something slippery on my lips, which makes me lick them and basically I end up feeling like I have nothing on after a few mins, or feeling like it&#x27;s slid right off my lips around my mouth. While I prefer a moist feeling compared to some balm (burts bees) which are pretty dry feeling, I feel like this one is a bit to slippery.     packaging: WONDERFUL! So many balms end up a huge mess when left in a pocket or bag, this is very well sealed keeping it clean and keeping it from popping open etc.     All in all I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s an ok balm depending what your going for, if you like something with a tasty flavor/smell and nice mouth feel I&#x27;d recommend [[ASIN:B000PI92JW Avon NATURALS Lip Balm Vanilla]] instead of this, if you&#x27;d rather have something more subtle in shine (suitable for a man who doesn&#x27;t want to appear to have something on his lips) then I&#x27;d go with burts bees [[ASIN:B0002Z8Q3Q Burt&#x27;s Bees Lip Balm Beeswax Tube]], however if you want totally color/scent free with a bit of shine and don&#x27;t mind a slippery feel this is a great deal!</li>
            <li> I love this lip balm. It&#x27;s not colored, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about how I will look if I accidently put too much on. It smooths on great, and it leaves my lips feeling smooth if I use it on a regular basis. I can&#x27;t see myself switching to anything else.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used my facial moisturizer on my lips after washing my face but wanted something different.  I don&#x27;t have chapped lips, they are smooth and soft.  Lip gloss was too gooey and sticky, lipstick was too heavy.  In comes lip balm.  I&#x27;ve tried a few over the years and they seemed like glorified lip gloss, fingers in tubs didn&#x27;t spell &#x27;sanitary&#x27; in my book.  Looked on Amazon and read reviews of many lip balms and decided on this one.  I would have to use it whether I liked it or not since it&#x27;s in a pack of 6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just got it and applied a few times.  No sticky, no waxy, no taste or smell...excellent!  It glides on smoothly, like a thin oil would, leaves a shine and makes my lips slick but not heavy or thickly coated.  Just touched my lips with my finger and rubbed them - no oily feel and it absorbed right in, can snap fingers right away...excellent! I think I will like this lip care, it was what I was looking for...so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Lip Trick to exfoliate: Dip your finger in Olive oil and rub on your lips, then dip your finger into granulated sugar and rub your lips with this mixture whenever they are dry and peeling.  I do this as needed and have never had dry, cracked lips.  You can also mix a larger amount in a screw-top jar and use on your face or body before your shower for an inexpensive body-scrub.~</li>
            <li> I am a picky person when it comes to what I put on my mouth, but this is an excellent product! Too many products have a scent/smell that I don&#x27;t like, but this product has little to no smell - and what there is is very light and pleasant. This lip balm is highly moisturizing and long lasting. The case/look of the product is simple enough to not scare away men and pleasing enough for women. I highly recommend this product for sports enthusiasts/athletes or anyone who spends time outdoors - and for the upcoming winter weather, this lip balm will be a must have.</li>
            <li> I used to only use Carmex however Nivea&#x27;s lip balm is now my only lip balm I will use. Without feeling like it is coating my lips, it protects, hydrates and moisturizes. I simply love it!</li>
            <li> Unlike Carmex and burt &#x27;s bees, it does not result in my lips ending up drier than they began.  Also, no flavor or odor, a big plus for me.  It also lasts for a good while, a couple of hours without needing to reapply.</li>
            <li> Its lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t cake on or waxy.  It has spf which is super important. Its hydrating and lasts for a while. The green one has a better smell though. And I wish it softened the lips too.</li>
            <li> Nivea Kiss of Smoothness / B0018MIT5M&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been through a hundred different kinds of lip balms and this one is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s super soft and I love the feel on my lips. The balm is unscented and tasteless and doesn&#x27;t cause any itching or inflammation on my sensitive skin. I really love being able to buy these in bulk packages of 6 on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~ Ana Mardoll</li>
            <li> This is a great little lip moisturizer. It is hard to find something with spf that doesn&#x27;t taste horrible. This one is very good. It lasts a long time on your lips, and has almost no taste at all. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on cups when I&#x27;m drinking. I have bought many of these, and will keep doing so. Even my boyfriend loves it, and continuously borrows it from me. I definitely recommend it.</li>
            <li> I have problem dry skin, lips included. I am a lip balm/gloss junkie, and I definitely have found a new favorite product. I also love that this product has some SPF, but it doesn&#x27;t taste like it has sunscreen like a lot of other lip products with SPF do. I love how smooth this feels going on. It&#x27;s definitely not too heavy or sticky - there&#x27;s nothing I hate more than sticky lip balm.</li>
            <li> Goes on smoothly in all temperatures -- important if you keep an extra tube in your car or purse for cold weather use.  Mildly scented, which is nice if you are sensitive to, or tend to get overwhelmed by, fragrances.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a pretty generic lip balm.  No added colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took one star off the rating for the inadequate SPF protection.  Lips are more susceptible to UV damage than other skin.  SPF 4 is simply inadequate, and doesn&#x27;t meet dermatologist guidelines for skin protection.  Your lip balm should always have at least an SPF of 15.</li>
            <li> But I went by Good Housekeeping recommendations and I do not like the feel on my lips and think even Chap Stick works better.&lt;br /&gt;Good value but would not order again.</li>
            <li> Living in Southern California where the sun is pretty strong, I&#x27;m always putting on sunscreen and definitely something for my lips. With an SPF of 4 I didn&#x27;t really think of this product as a sunscreen for my lips because 4 is almost like 0. What I was interested in it for was the \\&quot;hydrating effects\\&quot; but unfortunately those were short lived. This product comes off of your lips within about 2 minutes so I don&#x27;t really think much hydration was happening. I normally use Rosebud Slave everyday and love it, it stays on, looks good and has a nice non-gooey texture. The nivea stick is also not gooey at all but maybe not waxy enough either as I said it does not stay on at all. My recommendation would be to pass on this one unless you don&#x27;t mind reapplying often.</li>
            <li> My first pro on the product that I could find is no flavor. I know that sounds funny alotta people seem to dig the flavored lipbalms. True and I was at one time guilty for that I noticed one thing bout that though. So busy wanting to taste  the flavor you end up licking the product intended to moisturize or heal the cracked lips off your lips before it can do its job. This already cleared up some dryness I have been having for quite sometime in just two days. Thats amazing to me and worth getting more of these. I have tried many other lip products as such from Avon etc. I would just prefer this be my new brand now. I do have quite some trouble with different medications i am on and having diabetes you tend to have dryer skin then then people without it and lips as well.As well as being on a C-pap at night they dry the lips out to point  of painfulness and this product works well for me on that end as well.  This product works well for me and I will be a continuing customer of this product be it here on amazon or as I See it in the stores .I was very impressed and to me it is a great product and has a good value as well for what it does.  I am new to this brand and can&#x27;t wait to try other things they have to offer us ladies . Well when I first go the box from the vine told my mom we all live at the same house here my mom and bro etc. She said nivea thats a good brand. well she was right if it works that quickly its good for sure.</li>
            <li> Nivea&#x27;s Kiss of Moisture lip care is light and wonderful to use on a regular basis. It&#x27;s lightly scented and completely flavorless. It wears long and seems to make lips look and feel better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Nivea&#x27;s Kiss of Moisture regularly for several weeks now and I&#x27;ve grow to like this product a lot. Out of several different products I&#x27;ve used in the past, this one has capture my attention. I actually USE it regularly and remember to use it because I like how it feels on my lips. For me, I see that my lips are looking better for it. The amount of raggedy dry skin has decreased, making my lips look better naked or with lip color. And they feel kissably soft too. I also like the pleasant light scent it has.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Good price&lt;br /&gt;- Lightweight and smooth moisturizer for lips&lt;br /&gt;- Has helped to smooth out and reduce raggedy dry lips skin on my lips.&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t look like chicken grease on my lips&lt;br /&gt;- I like the chunkier design. Nice to hold and use.&lt;br /&gt;- Delightful light scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- None to report so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other comments:&lt;br /&gt;- I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere on the package or container that this lip care product had SPF 4 in it. I only seen this info on Amazon&#x27;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nivea&#x27;s A Kiss of Moisture hydrating lip care has become a favorite of mine and I plan to buy it again in the future. They will also be on my Christmas gift list too for stocking stuffers for my female friends and family members. I recommend it. For the price, it&#x27;s worth trying.</li>
            <li> The title may sound minimal, but really what more can you ask from a product. I mean we&#x27;re talking about lip balm here.&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness I do some activities that cause me to have a lot of wind in my face and Nivea worked well at keeping my lips from chapping. The taste isn&#x27;t really inspiring but at least it isn&#x27;t some crazy fruity combination. As a guy I just want something that works and doesn&#x27;t make me feel like I just waxed my lips and this product does that.&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.</li>
            <li> Wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Feels good, no discernible taste. Does the job.</li>
            <li> It is really nice. Always love Nivea!</li>
            <li> Very soothing for chapped lips.  Also, thicker than Chapstick, so longer lasting.</li>
            <li> It stands true to it&#x27;s name,as it is very hydrating and the moisture stays for longer times,even in the dry and sunny weather. The sticker price might shock some, but you have to realize that it is for the pack of six. It is definitely superior to the more commonly available chapstick.</li>
            <li> Nivea Lip Care is a great way to weatherproof your sensitive lips, and keep them continually moist. Almost scent free and completely tasteless, Lip Care goes on with silky smooth creaminess and stays on a long time.  Our lips are so sensitive, and get some of the worst exposure to sun, wind and cold, not to mention the workout our poor lips get eating, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The container is like a small lipstick and handy for your purse, beach bag or back pack. An absolute must if you do any kind of outdoor activity or tend to have dry skin. If you&#x27;re a senior citizen and starting to get those fine lines, get this product and you&#x27;ll put a stop to (or at least curb) the \\&quot;wizened mouth\\&quot; look. Nivea Lip Care is the moisture your lips have been waiting for!</li>
            <li> So I was really really excited to receive this in the mail... I opened it up and found that I wasn&#x27;t as excited anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Unlike a chapstick, the lid is the whole blue cover that you see in the picture.  So no more fumbling with a tiny little lid that drops and can never be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  It does hydrate as it claims!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  Your lips feel so soft and supple, even hours after it has worn off you will still feel it&#x27;s presence.  Very sexy feeling lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  It is a whole stick, opposed to something pouring out of little holes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  This one is a big one for me... it says that it has shea butter and jojoba oil.  I love shea butter, but I think the jojoba oil makes me sick to my stomach.  I get easily nauseated by smells and this is one of them... so for those who aren&#x27;t into scents, then I don&#x27;t suggest this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.  I love how it leaves my lips soft and supple but it doesn&#x27;t last long... it is pretty much like expensive chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.  When you apply it, it glides on and it feels sort of greasy.  I don&#x27;t like that warm feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.  I suspect that this stick will melt in your purse if you leave it in the car on a hot day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall... it does what it claims and my husband LOVES it and the scent.  It isn&#x27;t my cup of tea, but if I have nothing else, I will use it.  Again... the smell is a big killer for me personally.</li>
            <li> I used this lip care stick during a 3 hour golf game in 100+ degree heat, it never melted in my pocket and protected my lips from sunburn. This product lasts and moistens lips without a lot of applications. My only complaint is the lack of taste, as I prefer tingy peppermint in my lip balm due to its refreshing qualities. This stick is tasteless bordering on waxy however it does do its job.</li>
            <li> I am allergic to all lipsticks and most chapsticks, but these have not caused a reaction!&lt;br /&gt;I bought 8 and carry them around in every single coat.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff! It makes my lips look and feel so good. It&#x27;s great for school and before bed. It doesn&#x27;t clump and has SPF 4. I also like the Nivea body wash and lotion. Buy and enjoy:)</li>
            <li> I really love this product and use it all the time. It really helps to prevent my lips from chapping. I would recommend Nivea&#x27;s lip balm to anyone.</li>
            <li> best chap stick on the market right now!</li>
            <li> As you&#x27;d expect, lip balm is lip balm, for the most part. There isn&#x27;t much you can say about this product. My daughter tried it and said it was too greasy, but again, that&#x27;s pretty much what lip balm is, a stick of grease, and this really isn&#x27;t any different.</li>
            <li> Unlike competing brands, which feel like coating your lips with a melted candle, this Nivea lip balm goes on light and clean -- with a nice fresh scent -- but does the job at least as well as those other guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent stuff.</li>
            <li> I keep this moisture stick in my purse or tote or briefcase - whichever I&#x27;m carrying at the time. The balm is soothing to my lips, which tend to chap, and glides smoothly. Isn&#x27;t caky like Chapstick can be but is very smooth and easy to apply. My lips instantly feel moisturized and not as dry or chapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
            <li> Nice product for a guy. No need to touch the thing with your finger and since it retracts then you don&#x27;t end up damaging the lip balm when you put the cap back on. Also the mechanism works well which allows you to use the full product unlike other that you might end up throwing out before using it all.</li>
            <li> I ordered these for my daughter who cannot be without a chopstick in her purse or pocket.  Nivea is her favorite. Amazon always has the best prices and shipping is fast and allows me to have it shipped right to her in her dorm. Thanks Amazon, you made this mom&#x27;s effort easier :)</li>
            <li> I used to use Neutrogena lip balm, which is quite hard to find in the stores and also quite expensive.  In a pinch, I bought a two-pack of Nivea Kiss of Smoothness because it was handy and inexpensive, but I have been pleasantly surprised at the results.  It glides on smoothly, stays on, and keeps my lips moist without being sticky or caking up.  As a bonus, while I used to have trouble getting the tiny caps of the Neutrogena lip balm containers, my aging fingers have little trouble opening and holding on to the large tube-type caps on the Nivea containers.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
            <li> I am so glad that I found this in bulk! I have been using this lip balm for a while, but it is very pricey. The deal on here was great, and I bought enough to last me all year! Hope I can find this good of a deal next time!</li>
            <li> This keeps my lips super moisturized and soft. LOVE Nivea !</li>
            <li> My lips remain dry.  Product doesn&#x27;t help.  Not effective at all even after continuous application throughout the day I would wake up with dry lips.  I would not recommend this product.</li>
            <li> I always have Nivea Kiss of Moisture within reaching distance. It goes on smooth, not chunky and no overpowering tutti-fruity smell! Sufficient protection for daily wear, but I agree with other users about wanting more if you are playing softball or skiing or out in the sun for extended periods.</li>
            <li> Its very effective. I am one of those users who only use moisturizer/chapstick when an emergency need. This has been very effective on me.</li>
            <li> My lips are sensitive and become dry fairly easy within a few hours of not having applied any lip balm . . . Ever since I discovered Nivea A Kiss of Smoothness I never went back to Chapstick or Blistex. You can feel the moisture on your lips when you initially apply the lip balm and your lips even look a lot better as soon as you have the lip balm on. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this product.</li>
            <li> I love this stuff, I buy it by the 6 pack.  Doesn&#x27;t put shine or color on my lips, goes on smoothly, feels good, absorbs fast and keeps my lips nicely conditioned.</li>
            <li> I love this chapstick because it works to hydrate your lips while looking like a gloss.  After putting it on it makes your lips look super shiny and really healthy.  It does not last very long so you do have to re-apply more often than other chapsticks but this one is still my favorite! The six-pack will last forever even with the re-applying so it&#x27;s definitely worth buying!</li>
            <li> Great feel-it certainly does help hydrate the lips without any scent or artificial color.  Feels great going on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No SPF. If you are looking for that, this is not it.  Safe for all day/night application. No harsh chemicals on those very absorptive lips!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is very attractive and has a nice feel on application.  The blue cover seals the product well and is very hygienic.  I keep it in my desk-a word of caution:  The size and  shape are not unlike a glue stick (also at my desk) so I am extra careful not to confuse the two.  The emollient gently coats your lips-AND STAYS THERE! Doesn&#x27;t quickly disappear like so many others. Nor is it that waxy whitish uneven coating of the lipsavers of yesteryear!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also read the ingredients, chemical make-up, etc.  There are no ingredients listed either at Amazon or on the lip balm itself. However, the original packaging lists  ingredients that are favorable- castor seed oil, shea butter, jojoba seed oil, grape seed oil-all excellent ingredients that explain why this moisturizing stick is so helpful for dry lips.  I do not see anything harmful or worrisome  in the list of ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in a very dry climate (Alaska) albeit it is now summertime. The real test of this lip balm would be  to try it during the extremely dry winter months when lips are chapped &amp; cracked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice product- I would get it again and give to others!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Like I said, the real test would be the harsh dry winter of Alaska. Now that I&#x27;ve gone through a winter, I would say this is a great light, colorless lip moisturizer.  The balm applies smoothly with a satiny finish-none of the chalky, waxiness that we can experience elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How does this differ from others? The composition as an emolient feels superior. I like the slight oversize of the lip-balm: this covers your whole mouth area very well. In this dry climate (as well as the notorious dry air of a long flight) this lip balm is terrific. No more cracking at the corners of my lips. This lip balm remedied that very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a repeat buyer of this lip balm. It&#x27;s great that it comes in a pack of six. I enjoyed giving it out to others who also like it immensely and plan on getting more of it. Well done, Nivea!lip balm is terrific. No more cracking at the corners of my lips. This lip balm remedied that very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a repeat buyer of this lip balm. It&#x27;s great that it comes in a pack of six. I enjoyed giving it out to others who also like it immensely and plan on getting more of it. Well done, Nivea!</li>
            <li> I&#x27;ve always used some kind of lip balm, especially in the wintertime.  But there are times in the summer where it comes in handy.  The thing that bothers me about most lip balm is that it is mostly made from wax, so it goes on thick and leaves a layer on your lips that comes off on everything from coffee cups to your shirt collar when you turn your head around far enough (like backing a car out of your driveway).    Nivea Hydro care is a bit different than most.  First off, the plastic casing is a bit bigger and designed to be the size and style of a lipstick container.  This is not to say that it is made for women, in fact there is no indication that it is, but if you are used to carrying lip balm in your front pocket, you might think it is a bit larger than you&#x27;d like.  For a women&#x27;s pocketbook, it would be just fine.    It goes on real smooth, and rather than sit on top of your lips like wax based lip balms, it is said to be \\&quot;absorbed\\&quot; into the lips.  In fact, this is exactly how it works and after a few moments you don&#x27;t feel it&#x27;s there anymore.  This could lead you to think it&#x27;s immediately going away, expecting it to \\&quot;seal\\&quot; your lips like regular lip balm.  It&#x27;s not designed to work that way, and this is what I really like about it.  I don&#x27;t necessarily like the feel of waxy lip balm. This is really different and I think more effective than what I&#x27;ve been used to.      Since Hydro Care is designed to be \\&quot;absorbed\\&quot;, it feels like it disappears, but after a few uses, it seems to leave my lips good for quite a while.  I don&#x27;t find myself needing to re-apply it constantly throughout the day like regular lip balm.    I really don&#x27;t know if it suits everyone, but I think it&#x27;s worth a try if you don&#x27;t like the old thick waxy stuff.    Pros:    - Goes on really smooth and gets absorbed pretty quick.     - Doesn&#x27;t need to be constantly re-applied and after a few applications the effects seem to last all day.     - It doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;seal\\&quot; your lips like regular lip balm making your lips feel worse over time.  It is pretty smooth and actually seems to do it&#x27;s job, so you don&#x27;t have to re-apply it as often as wax lip balm   - Because it gets absorbed into your lips, it doesn&#x27;t tend to get all over your shirt collar, coffee cups, etc.   - The effects seem to last well    Cons:   - The case is a bit bigger than normal lip balm.  Not something i tend to carry in my front pocket, but I think women would find it fits well in a purse.   - Takes a bit of getting used to if you&#x27;ve always used waxy lip balm.  You have to give it a chance to really work over a few applications, especially if you have really dry lips.</li>
            <li> I have been using Nivea lip care for years. This particular flavor is superb for protecting your lips from dryness.&lt;br /&gt;Within few minutes of application, it comforts your lips. However chapped your lips are multiple application of this lip balm will make them smooth within hours. I always recommend all my friend this Nivea kiss of smoothness.</li>
            <li> Great product it&#x27;s my fav chap stick! I&#x27;ve used it for years and this is really cheap for this brand! I never got mine in the mail but emailed them about it and they fixed it! Very very happy with the product as well as the costumer service!! I will order again when I run out and I would tell everyone to buy it!</li>
            <li> keeps my lips nice and moist all day long</li>
            <li> My fiancee hates my chapstick/lip balms (Mostly Burts Bees).  These don&#x27;t have that &#x27;shiny&#x27; look that girls like and guys don&#x27;t.</li>
            <li> You cant go wrong with this chapstick! The Nivea brand is simply amazing and I refuse to use any other brand and stock up on only this one !</li>
            <li> I have tried... dozens of lip balms, chapsticks, lip gloss... Whatever. I have tried so many, and clogged up my bags, bathroom, desk, and car with oodles of them...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And when I found this, I never bought any other again! I&#x27;ve been using this consistently for several years, and after living in two very harsh wintering areas, as well as arid high deserts, I can surely say that this is one of my top 5 items over the years.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s got next to no taste for those accidents.&lt;br /&gt;Never sticky or greasy.&lt;br /&gt;No strange odor.&lt;br /&gt;No colours - you can wear it over or under other lip products...&lt;br /&gt;And it stays on and lasts practically all day! I rarely have to reapply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s even cured my husbands super dry and flakey lips, if I can keep him applying it consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve not tried this, absolutely pick one up - I usually get them in singles because they last so long.. but I do keep several around at a time for all those locations like by the bed, in the bathroom, in the car, wallet/purse, and also at my desk since I work at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your lips a favor and try this, it&#x27;s so great and super affordable too.</li>
            <li> I live in a desert, so dry skin and lips is a constant problem for me. Just skipping my mosturizing routine for one day can cause major dryness and painful chapped lips. I&#x27;ve used a variety of products over the years, and I&#x27;ve found some to be better than others.    Nivea a Kiss of Moisture Lip balm is one of the better products on the market, in my opinion. It glides on your lips smoothly and starts moisturizing immediately. It seems less waxy than other lip balms. I like it a lot. Will it buy it again? Yes, I will.</li>
            <li> I&#x27;m not a huge proponent of lip balms. They tend to be sticky and smelly. This Nivea product is neither. It has an unassuming butter-balm odor, and it goes on smooth. It comes out of the package with rounded edges, much nicer than some other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it \\&quot;sink in?\\&quot; No. Lips are not waterproof, you will know it is there. For me, a person who eschews lipsticks and other lip items, it makes its presence known for about 15 minutes, then I forget about it. Does it work? I think so. We&#x27;ll have to wait for colder weather to be sure, but it is far beyond unpleasant. If you&#x27;re looking for good lip protection, you can do a lot worse.</li>
            <li> Overall my wife and I both like this product.    Pro&#x27;s   heavy-duty outer packaging. I wouldn&#x27;t be afraid to keep this in my back pocket and sit on it, nor would I be afraid of this container accidentally opening. Compared to the competition this packaging gets a A+    Both of our lips were moister after using this product. I put this product on around bed time and was still noticing the positive effects the next day.    The product seem to moisten our lips relatively quickly but did not absorb as fast as I would like. It felt like a combination oil, moisturizer, and wax.    Con&#x27;s  this product is not all natural or even close.    Don&#x27;t use if you plan to kiss someone shortly after using. Bad and noticeable flavor. This is noticeable when kissing someone that has recently used this product.</li>
            <li> Seven things to love about Nivea a Kiss of Moisture Hydrating SPF 4 Lip Care:&lt;br /&gt;1. the lovely blue, all-encompassing cap.&lt;br /&gt;2. a gentle push will send the moisturizer down the tube -- it&#x27;s almost impossible for your four-year-old daughter to smoosh your lip balm when she puts the cap back on.  (Believe me, this is not good!)&lt;br /&gt;3. a very light scent.&lt;br /&gt;4. No funny taste -- perfect for kissing.&lt;br /&gt;5. It&#x27;s not sticky -- no stalactite or mites hanging off your lips.&lt;br /&gt;6. very smooth and light application -- I forget that it&#x27;s on.&lt;br /&gt;7. After using it for a solid week, my lips are noticeably softer and smoother.</li>
            <li> It applies smoothly but it only hydrates my lips for a minute. Now that it&#x27;s cold, I&#x27;m constantly reapplying, as the cold gusts dries out my lips before walking from my car to the grocery store.</li>
            <li> have used it for 3 or 4 yrs-- glad to buy it 6 @ a time-- it works for me</li>
            <li> i love this lip care because it is not frozen during winter and i has no difficulty to spread over my lip</li>
            <li> After needing to find a good lip balm last spring I have used this one religiously. I had always tried other popular products like EOS and Baby Lips, never getting the results I wanted. I finally bought this lip balm as well as the Nivea kiss of moisture. I like this one better- only use once a day and stops any peeling lips!</li>
            <li> This is the best chapstick I have ever used. It doesn&#x27;t irritate already painful lips and it glides on gently, not cracking them. Kinda shiny, so I can get away with not wearing lip gloss, which I think is gross. Doesn&#x27;t smell strongly so it&#x27;s not distracting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all it makes my lips so soft and moisturized!</li>
            <li> My BFF said YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS.  I blew her off saying that I didn&#x27;t really have trouble with dry lips and was not a &#x27;chapstick or lipstick&#x27; carrier. I prefer long wearing lip stain.  Next thing I know she hands me a new tube and says &#x27;try it.  It is like lotion for your lips&#x27;.  She was not kidding. Nivea Smoothness was the best product for lips I have ever seen.  It is like lotion for your lips. I love the way it smooths out your lips, filling in cracks and making them soft. I keep one in my car so I can use it frequently when I am about town.  At home, I keep it next to my toothbrush so I can apply it after brushing my teeth.  The softness lasts a while but I do apply it often because I like the way it treats my lips.  Lipstick is hard to apply after using Nivea Softness as it does not stick very well so that is one caveat I have found. However, I apply lip stain and use this as topcoat. Works pretty well but it works best when applied without any other products.  Recently I was treated to Sephora&#x27;s Sugar lips product.  It is highly regarded and well rated.  It doesn&#x27;t hold a candle to my Nivea Softness.  Be sure to purchase on Amazon - much better prices than stores.</li>
            <li> I really like this product and already ordered another half dozen of the nivea lip care ....A++++ would recommend to anyone</li>
            <li> I was surprised by all of the good reviews on this lip balm. It really dries your lips out. I would prefer Blistex, Chapstick, or any other. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
            <li> I first purchased Labello (Nivea&#x27;s predecessor) in Genoa, Italy in 1982.  I now buy it by the box.  31 years of avid devotion and my love for this product is not waning.  Carmex, Lipsyl, Chap-stix?  You have been forever banished from my pocket, desk, car, night table, gym bag, dopp kit.....</li>
            <li> I am absolutely obsessed with this lip balm, I won&#x27;t use anything else. It&#x27;s very smooth and not tacky at all.</li>
            <li> Best lip balm/chap stick I&#x27;ve ever used... I&#x27;m a guy, but I like to have smooth lips, you know why ;) but yeah, this is the best I&#x27;ve found. Really really smooth lips, goes on well, even tastes delicious!! Great stuff. Will definitely buy again when it runs out.</li>
            <li> I have very dry lips and also live in NM where we have very little humidity. This product is a must for me and do not want to be without it which is why I bought the multi-pack. Having a lip product with sunscreen is also a plus.</li>
